Executive Summary
1.       An integrated fiduciary assessment of program fiduciary systems for the proposed Program was
carried out on the MUDHCo and a sample of participating regional and urban local governments that will
implement the ULGDP II consistent with Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP) 9.00, Program-for-
Results Financing. A special survey was designed for assessing the financial management performance of
cities. During September and October 2013, teams visited all 26 new cities joining the program to collect
this information. For the 18 ULGs1 in the current ULGDP program, data was obtained and analyzed from
the last three Annual Performance Assessments. As part of the fiduciary assessment, the Bank carried out
a procurement system assessment for the proposed ULGDP II PforR operation between May and
September 2013. The review included applicable procurement systems, rules and procedures, including
oversight mechanisms at the program implementing entities. The program implementing entities include
the federal MUDHCo, regional BoFEDs, and participating cities (ULGs). All the regions and 18 of the 44
participating cities have been visited and assessed. Fraud and corruption and compliant handling
mechanisms were also assessed.

2.       The fiduciary assessment entailed a review of the capacity of the sample participating entities on
their ability (a) to record, control, and manage all Program resources and produce timely, understandable,
relevant, and reliable information for the borrower and the World Bank; (b) to follow procurement rules
and procedures, capacity, and performance focusing on procurement performance indicators and the
extent to which the capacity and performance support the program development objectives and risks
associated with the Program and the implementing agency; and (c) to ensure that implementation
arrangements are adequate and risks are reasonably mitigated by the existing framework.

3. Financial Management: At the national level, the assessment notes that the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accounting PEFA ratings of 2010 had placed Ethiopia in the top tier of countries in the Africa
Region in public financial management. Some of the areas where further improvements were needed are
in the areas of multi-year planning, unreported government operations, Revenue generation including tax
collections, budget execution, external and internal audit and external oversight. Government of Ethiopia
has a well-designed public financial reform program that is addressing these weaknesses in a systematic
manner.

4.       This financial management assessment builds on the lessons learnt during the implementation
period of ULGDP I (2008-2013). The challenges during ULGDP I were that the program was
implemented as a special purpose grant outside of government systems at the region and city levels, and
that cities used a mixture of manual accounting, IBEX accounting system and discrete systems such as
Peachtree to account for ULGDP.2 In the initial years of the program, this led of large variation in
reporting on ULGDP between the city level, regional level and federal level. Since the Annual
Performance Assessment (APA) did not take place in a timely manner as scheduled, there were delays in
release of funds, resulting in cities being forced to manage two capital investment budgets – their own and
those funded by ULGDP. Flow of funds was therefore a challenge. Public Financial Management
assessments have shown that internal audit is an area of weakness across the country. In the cities covered
by ULGDP this has remained a major area of weakness. There has been limited progress on an improving

     Although the geographic scope of ULGDP phase 1 is 19, including Addis Ababa, due to the fact that Addis has
been treated differently (as explained in detail in the Program Appraisal Document), this document will refer to the
scope of the performance based fiscal transfer element of the ULGDP as 18 ULGs.
2
     As each regional government in Ethiopia is authorized to issue city proclamations as they see fit, there is no
formal common definition of what constitutes a city. Therefore, the words “city? and “ULGs? are used
interchangeably throughout this document.
                                                                                                                   5
internal audit in the cities covered by ULGDP I. While the backlog of external audit has improved and the
ratings of all cities have now been classified as “qualified? there is significant variation in risk between all
the cities classified as “qualified?. There is need to improve the quality of external audit, its coverage and
follow up to audit reports. There are five cities where follow up to audit report findings varies from 0-40
percent and this is a major area of concern. On the revenue side, while cities seem to have made
remarkable progress in increasing own source revenue, there is a possibility of “gaming? with 11 of the
18 cities exceeding their own revenue targets in EFY 2004. Going forward there is need for “stretch?
targets to improve revenue collection.

5.       Many of these issues will be addressed during ULGDP II. It has been agreed that ULGs will
follow an agreed template for proclaiming the budget at the Federal, Regional and City level. This budget
will not only specify the flow of resources to the city level but will also enable the tracking of funding
used at the sub program level within the city. Fund flows will greatly improve since funds will be
disbursed twice a year through government systems and cities will have predictable flow of resources.
The Government chart of accounts will be modified to accommodate this during ULGDP II. All 44 cities
covered by ULGDP II are now using IBEX for accounting for government funds. The use of IBEX will
be standardized for ULGDP and resources for equipment and training will be provided to the cities. This
should greatly improve accounting and reporting. On internal audit, MoFEDs Inspection Department will
take the lead in improving the quality and timeliness of internal audit reports. They will engage with
internal audit units in the 44 cities and provide ongoing support in this area. In the area of external audit,
OFAG will take responsibility for ensuring that quality audits are produced in a timely manner. OFAG
will engage with ORAGs to ensure that this happens in a cost efficient and timely manner. To ensure
effective follow up of external audit findings, an incentive system is being built into the DLI system under
ULGDP II. Through these initiatives it is expected that most of the financial management issues of
concern during ULGDP I would have been adequately addressed. It is the conclusion of the assessment
that the financial management risk is rated as Substantial.

6.      Program Procurement: The detail procurement assessment reveals that, in all regional states and
ULGs (city administration), there is adequate public procurement and contracts management legislative
framework and systems in place. The major issues with all the implementing agencies are, except at the
MUDHCo, the weakness of implementation of the applicable public procurement rules and procedures
including oversight mechanism. The regions as well as the ULGs have limited capacity to follow the rules
and procedures and therefore there is risk of the agencies’ performance in implementing the applicable
procedures under the program. The overall performance of procuring entities (city administrations) in
complying with established system and therefore ensure transparency, efficiency and economy is found to
be deficient. The conclusion of this assessment is that the risk of program procurement system to help
achieve the program results is HIGH, before risk mitigation measures have been put in place.

7.      As the procurement and contracts management implementation capacity of the ULGs is weak,
there are three layers of risk mitigation measures proposed. The first risk mitigation measure is achieving
“Assuring Minimum Access Condition (MC).? This is an action and a requirement to be achieved
before the program is effective. All the participating ULGs (City administrations) will be checked for
having the minimum institutional and staff capacity to implement the program. It is checked annually
through the APA. It is only those cities that meet the minimum access conditions that will participate in
the program. For the details of the MCs, please refer to annex 10 of the Program Appraisal Document.
The second risk mitigation measure is implementation and monitoring of the agreed Program Action
Plan (PAP). There are a number of procurement and contracts management capacity enhancement related
action plans agreed with the Borrower in order to build the capacity of the implementing Cities and other
agencies (summarized in the below table). The third risk mitigation measure is the Annual Performance
Assessment (APA). During the first two years of the program implementation, the APA will cover the
detail procurement compliance and performance audit and starting the third year of the program
implementation Independent Procurement Audit (IPA) will be conducted on each ULG. At the moment,

                                                                                                              6
as the Regional Public Procurement Agencies (RPPAs), which are mandated to carry out procurement
audits in their jurisdictions, do not have the capacity to carry out Independent Procurement Audits, the
first two years APA will include detail procurement audits scope. After the second year, the RPPA’s
capacity to undertake their statutory responsibilities will be built and they will conduct annual
Independent Procurement Audits. From procurement and contracts management aspect, both the APA and
the IPA are required to deliver an acceptable Annual Independent procurement audit report along with a
satisfactory Management response as to how the audit issues have been resolved. And the result of the
audits will be part of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI 1).

8.      Fraud and Corruption Risk is rated as Moderate. To address the fraud and corruption associated
with fiduciary risk, ULGDP II PforR operation will be aligned to the Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACG).
The memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT)
with the FEACC on October 3, 2011 provides a framework for cooperation and sharing of information on
fraud and corruption allegations, investigations and actions taken on the Program, including on
procurement. The MOU will provide the Bank and INT with a foundation for expanding the existing
working relationship to cover future cooperative investigations under the PforR Program when needed,
and for helping to ensure that the Government of Ethiopia and the FEACC can implement their
commitments under the Anti-Corruption Guidelines. The Government also committed to use the Bank’s
debarment list to ensure that persons or entities debarred or suspended by the Bank are not awarded a
contract under the Program during the period of such debarment or suspension.

9.      For these reasons mentioned from Paragraph 3 to 8, the fiduciary risk assessment concludes
that this project should be classified as having “substantial? risk.3 The main risk areas and the
mitigation measures that are being put in place are summarized below:

and procurement systems are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the financing proceeds will be
used for intended purposes, with due attention to principles of economy, efficiency, effectiveness,
transparency and accountability, and for safeguarding Program assets once the proposed mitigation
measures have been implemented. Appropriate systems to handle the risks of fraud and corruption,
including effective complaint-handling mechanisms, have been agreed on and established. The overall
risk for this project is rated as “Substantial?.

I.    Background and Program Institutional Arrangements

11.     Ethiopia is a country of many nations, nationalities and peoples, with a total population of
91.7 million (2012)4. Only 17 percent of the population lives in urban centers, the great majority of them
in Addis Ababa. At a current annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, Ethiopia’s population is estimated to
reach 130 million by 2025, and is projected by the UN to be among the world’s top ten, by 2050.

12.     Ethiopia has experienced strong economic growth over the past decade. Economic growth
averaged 10.7 percent per year in 2003/04 to 2011/12 compared to the regional average of 5.4 percent.
Growth reflected a mix of factors, including agricultural modernization, the development of new export
sectors, strong global commodity demand, and government-led development investments. Private
consumption and public investment have driven demand side growth, with the latter assuming an
increasingly important role in recent years. On the supply side, growth was driven by an expansion of the
services and agricultural sectors, while the role of the industrial sector was relatively modest. More
recently annual growth rates have declined slightly, but still remain at high single-digit levels. Growth in
the export of goods has also moderated in recent years and a decline was observed in 2012/13 for the first
time since 2008/09. There have been bouts of high inflation in recent years and, while inflation is
currently much lower, keeping it down remains a major objective for monetary policy. Ethiopia is
vulnerable to terms of trade shocks from international food and fuel prices, and to large domestic
weather-related shocks as the 2011/12 East Africa drought demonstrated.

13.     Ethiopia is rapidly urbanizing. With population growth rate at about 4 percent per year,
Ethiopia’s urban areas have consistently been growing faster than the global and middle-income average,
and are among the fastest growing in Africa. If the current trend continues, it is projected that current 17
percent urban population (about 13.9 million people) living in cities will reach 23 percent by 2030.

14.     Most cities are characterized by high level of poverty and poor access to basic services.
Urban poverty is significant and more prevalent than rural poverty (46 percent of urban residents are poor
compared with 30 percent of rural dwellers).5 Levels of infrastructure and service delivery in Ethiopia’s
urban centers are low. Even in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s most well-endowed city, 45 percent of
households have no access to piped water supply, 40 percent have no access to improved sanitation, 35
percent of houses are not connected to a road network, and 67 percent of houses have no connection to
any drainage facility6. The situation is worse in most other cities.

15.     Urbanization is key to Ethiopia’s growth prospects. The urban economy in Ethiopia is a
major driver of growth. Urban areas are estimated to now account for over 58 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) and about 80 percent of the growth in GDP in recent years is linked to the urban economy.
Urban areas are expected to continue to drive Ethiopia’s economic growth for the foreseeable future.

16.     Urbanization offers new opportunities in Ethiopia to improve education, health, and other
public services, as more concentrated populations are easier to reach. However, the challenges of
providing infrastructure, housing, services, energy, and jobs to the expanding urban population are

significant, and must be addressed. If not, the rapid pace of urbanization will be associated with the
creation of slums and deteriorating urban environmental assets.

17.      In this context, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) acknowledges the important role of the
urban sector in overall economic growth and wishes to invest in it. The Government’s Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP) for 2010/11-2014/15 is the articulation of the overarching national
development strategy for Ethiopia. The GTP envisages a shift in focus from rural-based agricultural
productivity to urban-based industrialization, complemented by a growing service sector. GoE has
recognized the need for supportive policies and investments to achieve this vision. As such, it has adopted
a city-oriented policy framework known as the Ethiopian Cities Prosperity Initiative: Building Green,
Resilient and Well Governed Cities, 2013/14 – 2025. This policy package outlines the role of the urban
sector in helping meet the overarching policy objectives of GTP.

18.      In this context, the government introduced the Urban Local Government Development
program (ULGDP) in 2008 as a performance grant to ULGs. The ULGDP was preceded by a series
of Bank supported interventions, which aimed to build capacity at ULGs.7 Based on local government
capacity enhanced through these projects, the government introduced the ULGDP as a performance-based
programmatic fiscal transfer to ULGs. The overall goal of the government program is to support
improved performance in the planning, delivery, and sustained provision of urban services and
infrastructure by local governments. It aims to fulfill this goal by providing grants to ULGs based on their
performance across a range of clearly defined areas. The funds are allocated for institutional performance
and are earmarked for expenditure on urban infrastructure.

19.     The proposed second ULGDP (ULGDP II, the Program) is a follow-up to the successful first
phase. The current ULGDP is jointly funded by the government and the World Bank (participating
regions and cities contribute each 20 percent, totaling 40 percent of the IDA amount, to the investments).
Addis Ababa and Dire-Dawa contribute 40 percent of the IDA amount. At the onset of the program in
2008, a total program budget of US$208 million comprised US$58 million of government own sources
and US$150 IDA financing. In 2011, an additional US$208 million (US$58 million from the government
and US$150 from IDA) was made available to the project, as a result of higher than expected
performance of local governments and faster than expected project disbursements. In preparation to
scale-up of the program to an additional set of ULGs, the ULGDP also included capacity building funds
to enable 18 new ULGs to participate in the performance-based grant mechanism.

20.      The proposed Program, which will scale up the support to cover 44 cities, will provide the
highly needed investment funds to promote the cities as growth engines in the GoE’s urban
development strategy, support the institutional capacity of all tiers of governance (federal, regional and
local) in urban development, and enhance the incentives of everyone involved. This is done through a
result/performance-based budget allocation system under the PforR modality, clearly linked to well-
defined disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). The assessment of the Program is based on significant
recent analytical work, and references are made to these documents, where relevant.

21.    ULGDP is an example of a typical performance based grant that provides incentives based
upon performance. The standard features of such arrangements are the following:

 The government and the Bank have been working in partnership since the early 2000s to help Ethiopia’s urban local
governments effectively meet their new responsibilities. The Bank has supported the government’s strategy through a series of
projects, starting with the Capacity Building for Decentralized Service Delivery project (2003) and the Public Sector Capacity
Building program (PSCAP, 2004).
                                                                                                                                 13
22.     In the Ethiopian context ULGDP was the pioneer in introducing performance based grants
for capital investment to cities based upon performance. It was therefore a very different kind of
Special Purpose Grant flowing from the Federal level directly to cities. With a view to understand the
context it is important to have an overview of the system of Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers (IGFT).
23.     There has been a major increase in the size of the Federal Budget over the last five years. In
nominal terms it has increased almost fourfold in the last six years. During the current year around 20
percent of the allocation is for recurrent expenditures, 42 percent for capital expenditures and around 30
percent for transfers to Regions. Transfers to regions have also increased almost fourfold during the same
period – from around Birr 16.6 billion in EFY 2001(2008/09) to almost Birr 60 bn. in EFY 2006
(2013/14). Fund flows to regions fall into two main categories. Federal Block Grants flow to regions and
can be used by the region as per its own priorities. A second major fund flow mechanism is the MDG

                                                                                                       14
25.       In real terms the picture looks quite different:




26.       Federal grant has shifted from using simple indicators of population, level of development
and revenue raising effort to the one that considers the expenditure need and the fiscal capacity of
each SNG. The current Federal formula considers the expenditure needs of each SNG for selected
sectors and the potential revenue capacity of each region for selected revenue basis. The Federal
Government provides regional subsidy in the form of a block grant based on the relative fiscal gap of
regional governments in order to equalize fiscal capacity among regions consistent with the Constitution
of the country. The only exception is Addis which does not receive Federal subsidies due to its ability to
raise its own financing. The regional allocations made during the last three years are the following:

      Regional Transfers (in million birr – nominal figures)




                                                                                                       15
27.     Regions have limited own source revenues. On average regional revenues account for around
20 percent of their budgetary outlays. They are therefore highly dependent upon fund flows from the
Federal level.

28.     At the regional level, different regions transfer different amounts to sub regional entities.
On average, the large regions transfer around 50 percent of their budgets to the woreda level (both urban
and rural). The two urban centers of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa are outliers in this regard. Addis, on
average, transfers only around 17 percent of its budget to the ten sub cities, and Dire Dawa only transfers
around 15 percent of this budget to kebeles.

29.     The transfer formulas followed for fund flows to sub regional entities are complex and
varied. The eleven regions apply different formulas for transfers within their regions. The approaches
followed are based upon expenditure needs, fiscal capacity, fiscal effort, or per capita allocation. The
elements of the formula are also varied with different cost elements being considered.




                                                                                                              16
30.     Different regions also consider different sector for calculating unit costs which would form the
basis of the amount calculated to be transferred. There is only one region (SNNPR) that takes the urban
development sector into account which calculating resource flows to sub regional entities.

31.       The complexity of the IGFT system of Ethiopia needs to be kept in mind while designing
any incentive system at the sub regional level. For example, at the subregional level, cities, and
urban woredas collect “state revenues? and “municipal revenues.? State revenues are to be used for
financing basic delivery of state services such as education and health while municipal revenues are to be
used for services such as waste disposal etc. The bulk of the own source revenue collected at the city level
is state revenue8 and the current ULGDP provides an incentive mechanism for increasing revenue
collection. However this is not as great an incentive as expected since regions deduct state revenue
collections when they transfer block grants to sub regional entities.

32.      It is within this environment that the next phase of ULGDP is being designed. The proposed
Program, which will now scale up the support to cover 44 cities, will provide the highly needed
investment funds to promote the cities as growth engines in the GoE’s urban development strategy,
support the institutional capacity of all tiers of governance (federal, regional and local) in urban
development, and enhance the incentives of everyone involved. This is done through a
result/performance-based budget allocation system under the PforR modality, clearly linked to well-
defined disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). The assessment of the Program is based on significant
recent analytical work, and references are made to these documents, where relevant.

     With the exception of Jijiga, where the collection of municipal revenue (primarily from chat) greatly outweighs
the collection of state revenue.

II. Institutional Framework and Implementation Arrangements

33.      Ethiopia has a highly decentralized governance structure comprising the federal
government, nine regional governments, and two city administrations. Each level of government has
clearly demarcated responsibilities.

34.      The institutional arrangements for program implementation will be based on the
experiences from the current ULGDP, with clear division of tasks and responsibilities between
involved parties, as per the GoE structure and consistent with existing legal provisions, regulations and
guidelines of which some will be up-dated to include the new features of the Program. At the central
level, the Ministry of Urban Development Housing and Construction (MUDHCo) will be responsible for
the overall program management and operations. MoFED will be responsible for transfers of funds,
financial management, including audit and reporting, and compilation of federal fiscal reports.

35.     MUDHCo, MoFED and the Office of the Auditor General (OFAG) will ensure that
Program resources are budgeted for and disbursed within the Expenditure Framework , and that
Program accounts are audited as per statutory requirements. The offices of auditor general at the regional
level will be supported through the regional capacity building support, and a linked DLI for timely audit.

36.      As per the current ULGDP, MUDHCo will be the coordinating ministry and will have the
overall responsibility for implementation oversight and accounting for ULGDP II funds to the
Parliament and the days to day coordination will be handled by the Urban Governance and Capacity
Building Bureau (UGCBB) with in the MUDHCo. The division of tasks is clearly outlined in the ULGDP
Program Operational Manual, which will be updated prior to the start of the second ULGDP. MUDHCo
will also be responsible for the capacity building support to the regions and management of the annual
performance assessments and oversight and M&E issues on Program specific matters. MUDHCo has
proved in the first phase to have the capacity to manage activities expected in the coming operations, but
will need support in the scaling up, and strengthening of the capacity building support to regions and
M&E activities.

37.     MUDHCo will coordinate the implementation of the Program Action Plans. All ICB
contracts procurement and implementation will be performed as per the GoE Procurement Laws.
The Regional BoFEDs and the Regional Public Procurement and Asset Management agencies will play
the regulatory roles while the ULGs (city administrations) carry out the actual procurement and contracts
administration. Procurement and contract complaints that are not resolved at the implementing agencies
level (City Administrations) will be appealed to the Regional PPAMAs and the complaint Board at the
regional level will be responsible for addressing the procurement and contract complaints, following
respective regions legislative frameworks.

38.     As per the current ULGDP, MoFED will be responsible for overall financial management
including handling flow of funds to the regions and the cities included in the Program , and for
preparing semi-annual and annual financial reports. The flow of funds will be simplified compared to the
existing system, with bi-annual tranches based on results of annual performance assessments of the
ULGs.

39.     At the regional level, the Bureaus of Trade, Industry and Urban Development (BTIUDs)
will be the core coordinating office for the ULGDP II, and will have tasks related to capacity building
support of cities, consolidation of progress reports, oversight functions and backstopping support on
various tasks related with the Program. The Bureaus of Finance and Economic Development (BoFEDs)
will manage flow of funds at this level, and consolidate the fiscal reporting from the cities for onward
submission to the federal level.

                                                                                                       18
40.      At the ULG level – the Mayor’s office will be responsible for the overall performance of the
ULG, and based on a signed participation and performance agreement, the tasks will be clearly defined in
areas of counterpart funding, compliance with MCs, performance criteria, accountability requirements
and operations. The project selection and approval will be done at the city council level after involvement
of citizens in the process of identification and prioritization and the established appraisal committees with
Heads of Department, chaired by the city manager/or mayor. The city will also ensure that it is complying
with all financial management, procurement and environmental and social safeguards and regulations.
The incentives in the annual performance assessments will promote this.

41.     A steering/coordinating committee (SC) will be established with representatives from
MUDHCo and MoFED to ensure strong coordination of issues on planning, allocations, flow of funds,
and compilation of data and approval of the results from the annual performance assessments (APAs). A
program technical sub-committee under this committee will review the results from the APA and provide
quality assurance of the results, as well as handling of complaints in a streamlined manner. The Program
Technical Committee (PTC) will comprise of key technical staff of MUDHCo and MoFED and will also
carry out periodic evaluation of program implementation against objectives and provide technical
guidance with support from the World Bank. It will bring policy issues to the SC and ensure that the
Program is implemented in line with the Program Operational Manual. It will meet on a quarterly basis.


III. Program’s Expenditure Framework
42.      Program grants (performance based capital grants and capacity building funds) are to be
seen as specific purpose grants in the GoE Fiscal Decentralisation Strategy, 2004. They will target
specific outcomes in terms institutional improvements and infrastructure and service delivery, although
these are not sector specific, but multi-sectoral reflecting the needs for urban development across sectors.
It will promote the future roll out of support to ULGs as a genuine part of the intergovernmental fiscal
framework.

43.      ULGDP-II will supplement the OSR of the ULGs, and the support received from the
regions for recurrent costs, and will focus on larger infrastructure investments in the ULGs
consistent with their mandates. Of the total Program funds of US$ 380 million, US$ 323 Million will be
used in the PG grants for investments in infrastructure and services (of which the ULGs can spent up to a
maximum 5 percent for capacity building). The remaining US$57 million will be applied for
federal/regional capacity building support, oversight, support to audit and safeguard management, and
Program management, including the APAs, value for money audits and M&E.

44.     The average annual ULGDP-II grant amount for investments per capita p.a. will amount to
about 14.9 USD over the next five years, which is approximately on par with the current support under
ULGDP I (for the currently enrolled 18 ULGs). The amounts will enable the existing and new ULGDP
ULGs to boost their investments in infrastructure and services, also compared to the existing modest
resources from only ULG own source revenues.9 The size of the grant has been determined based on: (i)
experiences from grants and utilization in the first ULGDP, where the grants were in the same range; (ii)
review of existing infrastructure gaps (which would argue for a higher grant, but resources are not
unlimited); (iii) review of typical unit cost of projects; (iv) considerations on the trends in urbanization;
(v) considerations on the absorption capacity and review of the level of urban OSR and options for
maintaining and sustain the investments (note the Program will support incentives to mobilize further
OSR and to contribute towards maintenance and operations of existing and new infrastructure).10

45.     Although there is an average size of US$14.9 per year per capita, the actual size of
disbursement to a given local government will depend on that local government’s performance as
determined by the annual performance assessments. The graph below shows the typical range of per
capita disbursement depending on the performance of a ULG against the average performance (in this
example set as 60 points on a scale from 0-100), and the allocation is the first FY 2014/15 with an
average of US$ 14.9 per capita, and with examples of what average performance scores on the three ULG
performance-related DLIs will result in and allocations against various results in the APA. New ULGs
will only get access to the DLI I, the MC linked allocations in the first Fiscal Year, to ensure that they
gradually build up the capacity to handle and absorb funds.

IV. Proposed Program’s Fiduciary Arrangements
    A. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

48.      The 2011 Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) notes improvements in
Ethiopia’s public financial management (PFM) systems. The emphasis has been on “getting the basics
right? in the fields of planning and budgeting; revenue administration; and budget execution, including
procurement, accounting, and reporting systems. The Government of Ethiopia has also focused quite
extensively on improving regional PFM systems. Since these reforms are ongoing, there is variability in
PFM systems between the federal level, the nine regions, and the two city administrations as well as in
over 800 local governments. The detailed ratings for the federal government and selected regions are in
Annex “A?. There is great variability between the Federal Government and the Regions.




49.     Improvements have been noted in the preparation of sectoral strategic plans. Rigorous
budget formulation has been in place since 2000 at all levels of government. MoFED is now focusing at
introducing medium-term perspective to budgeting at federal level through strengthening the macro–fiscal
framework and introducing a medium-term fiscal framework (MEFF) structured in a program budgeting
format. By so doing, the linkages between spending and policy objectives will be further strengthened. In
the area of revenue administration, introducing Standard Integrated Tax Administration Systems
(SIGTAS) and rolling out tax identification numbers has increased tax collections.

50.      The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has been implementing a comprehensive Public
Financial Management (PFM) reform program, with support from development partners,
including the Bank for the last twelve years through the Expenditure Management and Control
Program of the government’s civil service reform program (CSRP). This was being supported by the
IDA financed Public Sector Capacity Building Support Program (PSCAP), Protection of Basic Services
(PBS) and other donors financing as well as Government own financing. These programs have focused on
strengthening the basics of PFM systems: budget preparation, revenue administration, budget execution,
internal controls, cash management, accounting, reporting and auditing. With the basics increasingly in
place, the Government is beginning to increase its focus on strengthening the linkages between public

                                                                                                      21
policy objectives and expenditure. In this context, GOE has embarked on a programming/performance
budgeting framework within MoFED.

51.       Ethiopia’s performance as per the main dimensions of PFM is the following:

         Credibility of the budget - The predictability in the composition of expenditure improved sharply,
          the variance in excess of the aggregate deviation falling to 5.7 percent. The budget is reasonably
          realistic and is reasonably implemented as intended, and performance in this regard has improved
          marginally since the period covered by the first PEFA assessment. Actual amounts spent were not
          very different from budgeted amounts. In addition, there were no significant changes in the
          original composition of primary expenditures and aggregate federal revenue out -turn compares
          well with federal budgeted revenues. Moreover expenditure arrears are far from being a systemic
          problem indicating that commitment controls are good (with no cash rationing). As far as the
          credibility of the budget is concerned, the situation in 2010 appears to have improved when
          compared with the same in 2007. In fact the country has managed to perform consistently in all
          areas relevant to budget credibility with the focus remaining on ensuring fiscal discipline.

         Comprehensiveness and transparency - improved during the period covered by the 2010 PEFA
          assessment. Other notable areas of improvement are: Increase in the amount of budgetary
          documentation submitted to House of Peoples’ Representatives (HPR), strengthened reporting on
          donor projects and programs, improved transparency in inter-governmental fiscal relations,
          through greater timeliness in the provision of information to regional governments on the size of
          the budget subsidies that they will receive, and improved access by the public to key fiscal
          information through audit reports. An issue remaining to be addressed is for the Government to
          make available to the public information on the incomes and expenditures of extra-budgetary
          operations which includes the road fund, pension and social security fund, sugar fund, and the
          like.

         Policy based budgeting - In 2010 the annual budget process continues to be well ordered with the
          existence of a budget calendar generally adhered to, and a budget circular issued to budgetary
          institutions. A rolling three-year Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework (MEFF) with main
          economic and fiscal aggregates is elaborated yearly. Budget institutions are gradually learning
          how to elaborate their budget on a multi-year basis (performance budgeting). With regard to
          2007, the 2010 PEFA evaluation indicates that performance in both budget preparation and multi-
          year budgeting (with the introduction of program budgeting) has slightly improved.

         Internal audit – an internal system based audit manual has been prepared and provided to all
          internal audit units in the federal and regional governments supplemented with a training manual.
          International Standards for the Professional Practice in Internal Audit (ISPPIA), issued by the
          Institute of Internal Auditors are reflected throughout. Weaknesses were noted in an internal
          audit, which recommended increased focus on systems audits, and increasing management
          response to audit findings. Further strengthening of the internal audit function is a key challenge.

         Accounting and reporting - The full roll-out of IBEX has helped to strengthen the quality of in-
          year budget execution reports, Annual financial statements prepared for 2006/07-2008/09 (EFYs
          1999-2001) included information on revenue and expenditures, financial assets and liabilities, but
          excluded information on donor-financed projects and programs. A limiting factor continued to be
          the use of non-IPSAS compliant accounting standards; compliance with IPSAS would require
          disclosure of information on donor-financed projects and programs.

         External audit - Overall performance of external audit has improved due to increased coverage
          and a lessening of the time needed to audit annual financial statements. Audits conducted by
                                                                                                           22
        OFAG generally adhere to INTOSAI auditing standards and focus on significant issues. The PFM
        study also notes that regional performance of PFM reform varies from region to region.

    B. PROCUREMENT

52.     In Ethiopia, for Federal budgetary bodies, public procurement is regulated by the Public
Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation No. 649/2009. The Proclamation establishes
the Federal Public Procurement and Property Administration Agency (FPPPAA) as a body responsible for
regulation and monitoring of Federal bodies’ public procurement activities. The Nine regional states and
two City administrations do have their own procurement proclamations and directives which are basically
drafted using the federal one as a prototype. Only the two city administrations under the Federal
Government, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, have their own “Local Procurement Laws while all other city
administrations under regional governments have no local procurement law of their own, as they are
required to be abided by their respective regional procurement laws. At the federal level, Directives,
Manuals and SBDs/SRFP have been issued following the proclamations. The same development is
observed in most of the regional states. But the intensities that these legal requirements being known by
the procuring entities and their proper implementation is very weak. In general, the Procurement Legal
Framework of the nine regional states and two City administrations could be considered adequate, despite
a number of setbacks when it comes to the implementation by almost all city administrations.

53.      A CPAR was carried out in 2002 and updated in 2010 mainly to respond to Ethiopia’s
progress in decentralization since 2002 and also address the gaps identified during the 2002 CPAR .
Though some improvements were achieved since the 2002 CPAR, the 2010 CPAR highlighted a number
of risk areas and inadequacies in the legal , institutional setups and procurement practices that includes;
(a) FPPA does not have regulatory and monitoring responsibility over government owned enterprises; (b)
FPPA reports to MoFED and the RPPAs report to their respective BoFEDs and cannot be considered
independent of the executive bodies though it seems they have some level of management autonomy; (c)
capacity of FPPA and RPPAs to monitor procurement activities and carry out comprehensive
procurement audits are weak; (d) there are no formal oversight or complaint mechanism at some regional
states levels; (e) there is lack of adequate recognition for the procurement profession, and a shortage of
capacity to effectively enforce and implement the procurement law; (f) procurement staffs skills in
understanding procurement process management requirements of the government’s own system is low
and the private sector is not organized and mature.

54.     The 2010 CPAR has also highlighted concerns with: (a) the minimum time given to Bidders to
prepare meaningful bids; (b) the local preferences given to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and (c)
the legal framework allows a merit point system to be used for both goods and works procurement and
this may lead to reduced transparency in award of contracts. These weaknesses or situations may affect
the implementation of the planned program (PforR).

55.     Program Procurement and contracts administration risks identified during the assessment
include: (a) noncompliance with national and regional directives; (b) weak procurement capacity at the
ULGs; (c) transparency and fairness issues related to procurement process as the result of not
implementing the legal procedures available; (d) competitiveness issues as the result of government
owned enterprises involvement in tenders and application of different preferential treatment to MSEs; (e)
Weak accountability, integrity and oversight arrangements; (fi) weak contracts administration, complaints
handling set up and mechanism, and the inefficient resolution of contractual disputes . The detail of
mitigation measures action plans for these weaknesses is presented in table on fiduciary risks and
proposed mitigation measures.




                                                                                                        23
     C. FRAUD AND CORRUPTION

56.     There is a robust legal framework for addressing fraud and corruption in Ethiopia. The
1957 Penal Code criminalized some acts of corruption. Several provisions dealing with corruption
were incorporated in the 1974 Special Penal Code. Both remained in force until 2004 when a new
Criminal Code was enacted. In May 2001, the Government established the Federal Ethics and Anti-
Corruption Commission (FEACC) with a mandate to expand and promote ethics and anti-corruption
education, prevent corruption (through review of working procedures and systems), and to investigate and
prosecute alleged corruption offences.

57.     Proclamation No. 433/2005 and Regulation No. 144/2008 provides for the role, powers,
duties, and responsibilities of the FEACC. These provisions enable FEACC to effectively achieve its
objectives. The FEACC has received political support at the highest level in the country. The Government
has also declared that it follows a zero-tolerance policy toward corruption.


58.     Since 2007, all the nine Regional Governments have established their own Regional Ethics
and Anti-corruption Commission (REACC) as per the regional laws. However, FEACC is
responsible for coordinating efforts of Anti-corruption across regions including ULGs and preparing a
national report on anti-corruption efforts across the country. It also solely represents the nation on
external communications. The REACC work and collaborate with the FEACC.

59.     FEACC and REACC have adopted both preventive and curative approaches in combating
corruption in the country. They undertakes preventive functions and activities through different
mechanisms, which include establishing anti-corruption offices and forums, studying work procedures
and systems within public institutions and making recommendation for addressing identified weaknesses,
and providing ethics education. Likewise, investigation and prosecution of suspected cases of corruption
are important curative activities of their mandates.


V.       Program Fiduciary Performance and Significant Fiduciary Risks
A.   FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

60.      There is no doubt that ULGDP was one of the most successful programs of its kind. It is now
helping to incentivize better performance in most of the cities that have been covered and it is emerging
as a model that is to be emulated across the country. It is to the credit of ULGDP that the two biggest
regions in the country – Oromia and SNNPR have introduced performance based incentives for cities in
their regions.

61.      This fiduciary assessment has assessed the risks across the entire financial management
cycle – from planning and budgeting and revenue generation up to audit and accountability. The risks are
identified and discussed separately in each section below:
         Planning and Budgeting: As indicated in the PEFA assessments and as was the experience
          during ULGDP I, Ethiopia has a well-functioning planning and budgeting system. The APA for
          EFY 2004 showed that fifteen of the eighteen cities in the program had fully complied with
          government planning processes.




                                                                                                      24
    The program will follow government planning and budgeting arrangements as outlined budget
    Manuals. The budget will be proclaimed at the Federal level at the Federal MUDHCo as a
    special purpose Grant classified by Regions, MUDHCo and ULGs/Cities. At Regional and ULG
    level the budget will also be proclaimed without offset and double counting, particularly for their
    matching fund/contributions. The MUDHCo/MoFED, will allocate the ULGDP-II Budget to
    regions and ULGs based on the performance result in collaboration with World Bank. The
    program Budgeting is structured an upstream process starting at the ULGs and moving upwards
    to the regions and the federal level. Each Regional bureau will collect all the budget requests
    from each ULG, consolidate them based on the performance assessment and approved capital
    investment plan (CIP), and submit to MUDHCo. Each ULGs is required to prepare a CIP, along
    with a related budget for each budget year, and send it to the next higher-level for review,
    approval and consolidation. MUDHCo will prepare a consolidated budget and submit this to the
    concerned body for approval. Fund transfers by MoFED will be based on approved budgets
    submit by MUDHCo. A chart of accounts of the Program mapped to the budget and that
    facilitates budgeting and accounting will be part of the Program Operating Manual. The risk to
    ULGDP II for planning and budgeting is therefore classified as “Moderate?.

   Revenue: At the city level revenue officials collect two kinds of revenue. The first kind is known
    as “State? revenues (for social services which are collected on behalf of the region) and
    “Municipal? revenues (for city services such as waste management) which are collected on behalf
    of the municipality. There is large potential for increasing revenue collection across Ethiopia
    since the draft Adam Smith study (November 2013) has assessed the tax gap as a percent of
    revenue as being 37.4 percent at the Federal level and much higher in some of the big regions
    where the primary focus of ULGDP II is going to be implemented.

As part of the preparation process for the IFA, a detailed survey was undertaken of the twenty six
new cities joining the program. The finding of this assessment is that there is great potential for
increasing State Revenue and municipal revenue during the ULGDP II period. In nominal terms,
for 17 cities newly joining the Program, between EFY 2002 and EFY 2005, state revenue
increased by 360 percent and municipal revenue increased by 233 percent.

This survey has also shown that revenue projections are accurate with State Revenue being on
average at 101 percent of the target and Municipal revenue being at 81 percent of the target. State
revenue is also (on average) three times larger than municipal revenue. The details are at Annex
“B?.

This is also the experience with the 18 cities currently in ULGDP I where the last annual
assessment showed that 11 cities exceeded their revenue targets for EFY 2003.




The basic message from this analysis is that there is large potential for revenue increases in the
44 ULGDP II cities and “stretch? targets need to be assigned to these cities. This is key for
improving the sustainability of the program. The risk from the revenue side to the program is
also “Low?.


                                                                                                                  27
   Budget Execution: Budget execution (of the adjusted budget) is good at the national, regional
    and woreda levels. During the last FY the average budget execution rate for the recurrent budget
    (at the regional level) was 94 percent and for the capital budget it was 85 percent.




    The situation at the city level is quite similar. In EFY 2004, the recurrent budget execution rate
    for the 18 cities in the ULGDP I was close to 100 percent and for the capital investment program
    it was 78 percent. For the 26 new cities joining the program the special survey conducted for the
    IFA has shown that (as an average for three years – EFY 2002 to EFY 2005), the recurrent budget
    execution rate was almost 100 percent and the capital budget execution rate was 72 percent. The
    details are at Annex “C?.




    The risk to the program from the perspective of budget execution is also classified as ‘Low?.

   Treasury Management and Flow of Funds: Treasury management and flow of funds has
    been somewhat of an area of concern during ULGDP I. Over the last five years cities have
    repeatedly raised their concerns regarding the flow of funds. Due to timing delays they have
                                                                                                    28
had to maintain two capital investment budgets – one being their own CIP and the other being
the ULGDP CIP. While allocations have been communicated to them in time, reporting delays
and commitments have resulted in them receiving funds in a stop go manner. This will need to
be addressed as the program moves into its second phase. As can be seen in the table below,
the flow of funds to a sample of cities varied between 41 percent to 71 percent of the funds
due.




Some of the shortfalls above are amounts due from the region and the city for ULGDP –
funding sources over which the Bank has little control. While the aide memoire of July 2013
had pointed to serious shortfalls on the part of several regions and cities in making their
contributions to ULGDP (20 percent each), it turns out that regions and cities have made their
contributions in full against the amounts that were transferred to them, not what was allocated
to them. The details are at Annex “D? and provide a good lesson for the design of the next
program.

Part of the reason for the erratic cash flows is the fact that in ULGDP I there have been
significant timing delays in the completion of the Annual Performance Assessment (APA). Over
the six years of the program only four annual performance assessments have been conducted:

    o   August 15-September 18, 2010 of performance in EFY 2001/FY2008-09 with impact on
        EFY 2003/FY 2010-11;
    o   July 7-August 8, 2011 of performance in EFY 2002/FY2009-10 with impact on EFY
        2004/FY2011-12;
    o   April 5-May 5, 2012 of performance in EFY 2003/FY2010-11 with impact on EFY
        2005/FY 2012-13;


                                                                                                  29
    o   May 5-July 7, 2013 of performance in EFY 2004/2011-2012 with impact on EFY
        2006/FY 2013-14.

As per the Program Operational Manual for ULGDP (November 2011) these APAs should have
been completed by December prior to the actual disbursement year, reviewing the performance of
the previous year. Even for the APAs that were completed, they were minimum around six
months behind schedule, making it hard for the ULGs to use the results in the normal annual
planning and budgeting process.

Due to this several cities have had to maintain two capital investment budgets – one being their
own CIP and the other being the ULGDP CIP. This will need to be addressed as the program
moves into its second phase. Semiannual financial reports also will report on the budget
utilization including variances analysis.

From the perspective of the Bank the situation is a bit different. An initial allocation of $99
million was made at the start of the program. Three years later, 35 percent of the initial
allocation was not utilized. The details are at Annex “E?. Cities in the ULGDP have voiced
their concerns regarding the flow of funds. Things have improved in recent years and the
program is expected to fully disburse US$300 million by the end of the program in December
2014. The details of the allocations made, funds released and balances are at Annex “F?.

Going forward, it has been agreed that disbursement of program funds from IDA to MoFED
will be made once a year upon achievement of the disbursement linked indicators (DLI).
Funds will be deposited to the Treasury or a separate foreign currency account. The MoFED
has expressed their preference of opening of a separate foreign currency account where the
IDA funds will be deposited. Local currency accounts may also be opened. Upon achievement
of the indicators, the MUDHCo will work with MoFED to inform the World Bank and
provide evidence as per the verification protocols, as justification that results for the DLI have
been met.

In case of a scalable DLI, the task team will determine the amount to be disbursed on the basis
of the programs progress report and DLI verification protocol. A notification will be made to
the borrower to advise the amount to be disbursed against progress achieved towards the
results of the scalable DLI. Disbursement requests will be submitted to the Bank using the
Bank’s standard disbursement forms signed by an authorized signatory.

Although PforR operations do not link disbursements to individual expenditure transactions,
the aggregate disbursements under such operations should not exceed the total expenditures by
the borrower under the Program over its implementation period. If, by Program completion,
Bank financing disbursed exceeds the total amount of program expenditures, the borrower is
required to refund the difference to the Bank.

Once IDA resources reach the separate foreign currency account, then the Program can use it
to finance program expenditures or transfer resources to local currency account for
transferring funds to federal level implementing entities and regions. At regional level BoFED
will also, as per consultation with the BUD, disburse resources to ULGs, and regional entities.
Duties and responsibilities of the various implementing entities and their roles in fund flows
and management of resources will be documented in the Program Operating Manual. The
below depicts the fund flow chart.




                                                                                                     30
    Given the experience of the Bank during ULGDP I, the risk assessment regarding Treasury
    operations and flow of funds is classified as “Moderate?.

   Accounting and Reporting: ULGDP I has been a Special Purpose Grant (SPG) that has been
    provided through MoFED to MUDHCo, and through BoFED to BUDs and the cities. During
    implementation of ULGDP I, cities used a mix of system to account for ULGDP funds. These
    were a mix of manual, IBEX, and discrete systems such as Peachtree. Accounting was a major
    challenge since there were major variations in figures at the city / regional and federal levels,
    as can be seen in the table below:




                                                                                                        31

        During implementation of the Program, the quality of accounting and reporting improved
        significantly, but remains a challenge in some of the 18 cities who joined the Program in 2008.
        For the 26 new cities joining the program, this is going to be a major challenge. In 58 percent
        of these cities cash flow statements are not prepared on time, some 46–76 percent of cities
        submit quarterly reports to BoFEDs on time, and only 38 percent of cities generate income
        and expenditure statements in a timely manner. IBEX has been introduced in all cities for core
        government operations. Only a few of these cities are using IBEX for accounting and
        reporting on donor funded projects.

        Government rules/regulations and directives as well as manuals will be in use for the Program
        in respect to accounting policies and procedures. The chart of accounts will take on board of
        program accounting and reporting needs and this will be documented in the Program
        Operating Manual. IBEX will be used by all participating cities to record transactions and to
        produce reports at all levels. Adequate capacity building will be provided to cities to enable
        them to utilize this software effectively for ULGDP II. The Program will allocate adequate
                                                                                                          32

               Semi-annual accounting reports, the Format of which has been agreed will be used, to report
               on the use of program resources. These reports will be submitted to the World Bank by
               MoFED within 45 days of end of the Semi-annual end date. Program financial reports will be
               produced from the existing system and their production will be the responsibility of the each
               implementing entity which will be consolidated at the higher level and at the end by MoFED.
               (Reports of the regional implementing entities (like ULG’s) will be consolidated by BoFED
               which will be submitted to MoFED. The BoFED and MUDHCo’s reports will be consolidated
               by MoFED). The format of the semiannual financial report was agreed at Negotiations.
               MoFED will also prepare annual Program financial statements in accordance with acceptable
               standards within three months of the end of fiscal year and provided them to the auditors to
               enable them to carry out and complete the financial audit on time.

               From the perspective of accounting and reporting, the risk is classified as “Substantial?.

              Internal controls and internal audit: Internal audit is an area of weakness across the
               country. In the cities covered by ULGDP I this has remained a major area of weakness and
               there has been little progress in improving systems and capacity over the last five years. The
               survey for the IFA of the 26 new cities joining the program has shown that internal audit
               departments are weak, there is patchy coverage and in 77 percent of cities internal auditors do
               not assess the accuracy of quarterly financial statements submitted by the city to BoFEDs. The
               typical findings of irregularities at the city / woreda level are the following:

               In ULGDP II, Government rules/regulations and directives as well as manuals in regards to
               Internal Control procedures will apply. While the internal control framework is generally
               recognized as being robust, a particular area of weakness noted is in internal audit. To deal
               with this risk, it has been agreed that MoFED’s Inspection Directorate in collaboration with
               BoFED’s Inspection Directorate will work closely with the relevant Internal Audit
               Departments of the Cities and provide on-going support. The Inspection Directorate will

                                                                                                                                                                       33
    review internal audit reports on an annual basis - following risk based post audit arrangements
    for the program activities. To achieve this task, the Directorate will strengthen its capacity and
    will coordinate with MUDHCo and MoFED/COPCU to review federal and regions and ULGs
    to review sample regions and ULGs. Internal Audit Reports will be submitted to the MoFED
    and MUDHCo within 30 days of completion of the audit report together with a proposed
    action plan to deal with identified risks. The reports will be shared with the World Bank
    during annual assessments.

    It is due to this that the fiduciary risk to the program is classified as “Substantial?.

   External Audit: In the 2010 PEFA assessment external audit was rated as one of the weaker
    components of the public financial management cycle in Ethiopia. While there have been
    major improvements at the Federal level, there are significant weakness at the regional level.
    Many of the big regions, where the bulk of the cities covered by ULGDP II are covered – have
    very low audit coverage. In SNNPR, Amhara and Oromia, audit coverage is less than 30
    percent of the institutions due to be audited every year.




    At the start of ULGDP I there was a large backlog in audit coverage in the 18 cities in the
    program and their financial management practices were weak. ULGDP through its scoring
    system brought a particular focus to this area and over the course of the last five years, all
    audit backlogs have been eliminated in the cities in the program and there has been an
    improvement in management of public funds. In EFY 2004 all 18 cities received a “qualified?
    audit opinion, a major improvement for the six cities that had received an ‘adverse? opinion
    the previous year. However not a single city as received a “clean? opinion as yet and that is
    the trajectory for future reforms.




                                                                                                         34
For the 26 new cities joining the program, their situation is quite similar to the 18 cities when
they joined the program in 2008. For the 26 new cities, they have a major audit backlog from
the last five years which varies from 50 percent of cities to 15 percent of cities per year. Their
financial management practises are also weak and between 8-15 percent of these cities
received an “adverse? audit opinion per year for the last four years. The main irregularities
relate to issues such as weak asset management, poor cash reconciliations, long outstanding
advances and payables, weaknesses in procurement and mis-coding of expenditures.

A major challenge has been the poor follow up of audit findings. For the 18 cities in ULGDP
I, the APA for EFY 2004 found that five cities implemented between 0-40 percent of the
findings for the previous year. Due to this audit findings are repeated year after year, with
limited follow up and impact.




Value for money auditing during ULGDP I has been mixed. The only value for money audit
that has been conducted relates to cobblestone investments that have been made that account
for over US$56 million of ULGDP funds. This value for money audit showed that “good?
quality work on cobblestone investments ranged from 60 percent to 90 percent in the regions
and there was large variability on a unit cost basis between regions – especially the
investments made in Bahir Dar.

Due to the reasons outlined above, it has been agreed with Government that the program is

                                                                                                     35
         subject to both financial and performance (value for money) audit. It has also been agreed that
         the Office of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG) or an assigned auditor, in collaboration
         with ORAG will conduct the annual financial audit of the financial statement of the Program.
         The audit will be conducted in accordance with agreed upon terms of reference following
         international auditing standards. The terms of reference were agreed during Negotiations. The
         resultant audit report and management letter will be submitted to the World Bank within six
         months after the end of the GOE fiscal year. In accordance with the Bank’s policies, the Bank
         requires that the Recipient disclose the audited financial statements in a manner acceptable to
         the Bank; following the Bank’s formal receipt of these statements from the borrower, the Bank
         makes them available to the public in accordance with The World Bank Policy on Access to
         Information. In addition to the financial audit, OFAG will also conduct value for money for
         the Project. The first value for money audit of the Program will commence from the second
         year onwards. Terms of reference for this value for money audit will be prepared by
         MUDHCo in consultation with the OFAG and World Bank.

         The risk rating for external audit if therefore classified as “Substantial?.

        Transparency and accountability: There is need for focusing on this area during ULGDP II.
         The finding of the October 2013 assessment was that in 88 percent cases Cities did not make
         public audit findings either to the staff or the public. This issue needs to be addressed since
         Parliamentary Oversight over the budget process and for ensuring accountability has been
         identified as probably the weakest area of the PFM cycle in Ethiopia. This risk is also
         classified as “Substantial?.

         Staffing and Infrastructure: The core functions for financial management are going to be
         conducted by the Office of Finance and Development (OFED) in the participating cities. The
         October 2013 assessment has shown that 22 percent of positions in OFEDs are vacant. The
         greatest shortfall is on the planning side where 33 percent of staff positions are vacant. In
         addition, there is high staff turnover. 36 percent of the existing staffs have been in office for
         less than two years. There is therefore need to ensure that existing positions are filled up and
         that adequate training is provided to the existing staff to enable them to discharge their
         functions. The facility survey showed that in almost 75 percent of cities there were major
         basic facilities and infrastructure deficits that constrained staff from discharging their
         functions. This is an issue that will need to be addressed during ULGDP II. The details are at
         Annex “G?. Given the key role that OFED staffs play in discharging their fiduciary duties, this
         risk is also classified as “Substantial?.


B.   PROCUREMENT

62.      Eighteen (18) out of forty four (44) cities participating in the Project were assessed. These
included nine Regional capitals, one city administration and nine other cities. Of these, six were old
cities that had participated in the ongoing ULGDPI project and twelve are new cities. Overall the
performance of cities that benefitted from the previous ULGDP I was better than new ones buoyed by
institutional capacity provided by the Project and adherence to agreed Project procurement procedures.
However when it comes to government own financing, both old and new cities show poor performance in
the implementation of Regional Government Procurement Proclamations;

63.     Based on the current records, all regional states and city administrations spend more than
50 percent of their annual budget through procurement. At the federal level, this percentage goes up
to 65 percent on average. The scope of procurement of contracts in terms of number and value of items
undertaken by the towns/cities, each year, varies from town to town. The total number of contracts
procured each year (works, goods and consultancy services) ranges from as low as seven in smaller towns
                                                                                                             36
to as big as one hundred ninety five in some bigger cities. Procurement of works and goods contracts take
the major share in terms of numbers while procurement of works contract is the largest in terms of
contract values. The average value of works contract handled by the cities also varies from a city to a city,
but can be considered as about US$1.5 million. Some cities (Hawassa, Dire Dawa, Bahir Dar) have
experience of procuring contracts of value as big as over US$10 million for works contracts. Under the
planned PforR operations, the cities are not expected to have works and goods above current the Bank’s
Operations Procurement Review Committee thresholds.

64.    Annual procurement expenditure and maximum value of contracts are presented in charts
below:-

         All maximum contract values are “Works Contract? and there is also more number of “Works
          Contract? than “Goods? and “Services?; meaning good amount of procurement expenditure
          goes to works contract, followed by Goods procurement while procurement of Services is
          almost non-existent.
         Cities procurement expenditure in terms of number of contracts as well as values of contracts
          tremendously varies from city to city. Accordingly their procurement capacities vary from city
          to city depending up on their past experiences.

65.       Procurement Planning:

         Preparation of annual procurement Plan is a requirement by Procurement Directives and
          Regulation of the regions (prototype of the FPPA directives). The Procurement Directive has
          detailed parameters to be included in the Procurement Planning Template and accordingly
          consists: - Procurement type/category, Description of contract, Lots, Quantity., Method,
          Procurement Lead time for different milestones, and estimate contract amount and the Source
          of financing as well as Contract Type. But in practice most of the cities are not preparing the
          Procurement plan with contents as required. Almost all cities prepare list of contracts and
          estimated budgets and consider that as a procurement plan. Key information like procurement
          methods, dates for key milestones, including procurement lead times and record of actual
          dates are missing. Of all, though it is the requirement in all directives, the procurement plans
          are not updated and are not tracked as progress monitoring tools. The assessment team’s
          observation is that the entities prepare list of procurement items with budgets only for budget
          processing purpose but not for planning, managing and monitoring the procurement cycle of
          contracts. Again, the biggest gap is due to lack of skills and enforcement of the requirement of
          the regional public procurement requirements.

         Procurement of goods, works and services required by all sector offices in the City
          Administrations is undertaken in pool system, by finance and economic development offices.
          This requirement applies to regional sector bureaus (by Public Procurement and Property
          Disposal Agency) and Woreda Administrations as well. A study carried out by MoFED on
          the pool system found dissatisfaction by some sector because of delays in the system and lack
          of control by the respective sector bureaus.

66.       Procurement Markets, Process and Procedures:

         As per the regional procurement proclamations and directives, the default procurement
          method is open tendering, which includes, International Competitive Bidding, National
          Competitive Bidding and regional/local open bidding. A clear and applicable guideline for
          procurement method selection is elaborated in the procurement manual of the regions for staff
          to follow. The most used procurement method for medium to large value procurement in most
          of the visited cities is NCB, followed by local Competitive Method (for Works/Goods and
          services for which MSEs are major players). Almost all Procurement Directives have
          discouraged Direct Contracting and shopping. However the actual practice by some procuring
          entities is contrary to the legal procedures. For example, award of contracts through Direct
          Contracting to private or government owned enterprise is a common practice in Amhara NRS.
                                                                                                             38
          The assessment mission has noted contracts with large value were procured using direct
          contracting method, though the default procurement method is open bidding.

         The participation of Government owned enterprises, in Bids for supply of goods, works and
          services is allowed in some cases through direct awarding and in some cases on competitive
          basis. Similar to the Federal Procurement law, the regional procurement laws have a provision
          that allows domestic margin of preference to be applied in the following three cases when
          domestic bidders compete with foreign bidders; (i) Pharmaceutical materials which are
          produced locally will be given 25 percent of margin of preference, (ii) Others goods which are
          produced in the country will be given 15 percent of margin of preference, (iii) For woks and
          consultancy services a margin of preference of 7.5 percent will be given. Procurement
          directive of most of the visited regions have a provision that works and services contract of up
          to certain limit (example: ETB 500,000.00) are reserved only for MSEs; while for contracts
          above this threshold the MSEs enjoy 3 percent margin of preference over the private bidders.
          Some Regional Governments have also issued directives to determine “Supports to be given
          to MSEs development?, where works and production and supply contracts up to certain
          threshold of ETB 5,000,000.00 (US$250,000) and Services up to ETB 2,500,000.00
          (US$125,000), are reserved for MSEs only, on competitive basis among themselves.
          According to the directive, an enterprise (MSE) is entitled to get the privilege only for three
          times. Contracts with an estimated value of over the above thresholds may be awarded to the
          private contractors/suppliers (either to domestic or foreign bidders), but they are obliged to
          sub-contract 30 percent of the work/supply/service to MSEs. According to the MSE Directive,
          BoFEDs have an obligation to enforce provisions of the MSE directive, hence overriding the
          regional BoFED Procurement Directive.

         The assessment reveals that there are adequate suppliers of goods, works and services in most
          regions, except for few emerging regions. For most National Competitive Bids (NCB), the
          number of Bidders is overwhelming, making the evaluation process cumbersome. Similarly
          for LCB, where major players are MSEs, there is no shortage, as the city administrations can
          organize, train and deploy as much number of MSEs as they require, provided there are
          sufficient contracts to engage them. The assessment of the regional procurement markets
          situation has not identified any exceptional circumstances involving natural monopolies that
          could be involved in the supply of goods, works and services under the Program.

         Standard Bidding Documents are not used consistently and in its complete form, by most city
          administrations, and if at all used are very much modified. In ULGDP cities, SBDs are
          properly used for GIZ or Bank financed project, while for government financed contracts in
          same cities the Bidding Documents are incomplete and miss important section. As a result of
          use of incomplete Bidding Documents important sections like ITB, Bid Data Sheet,
          Evaluation and Qualification Criteria and Conditions of Contracts are missing, jeopardizing
          the overall Bid Process quality. Due to incomplete and inconsistent bid information in the
          issued bidding Documents, the quality of Bid evaluations and contracts provision in the
          resulting contract agreements are also inadequate.

         In most of the visited cities, bids for larger contracts are advertised in widely circulated
          newspapers and also advertised on local notice boards. In general, Bidding Document
          preparation and the evaluation and award of contracts are undertaken within reasonable time.
          Bid evaluation results of all bidders are posted on notice boards in addition to notifying the
          bidders the result of the evaluation.

67.       Procurement and Contracts Administration Capacity:


                                                                                                             39
   The unit responsible for handling procurement in each City Administration is the
    Procurement, Finance and Property Administration Process. The Procurement, Finance and
    Property Administration Process fall under the Finance and Social Economic Development
    Officer of each City. In each city the finance and social development office has three
    processes; namely, Development Plan Process, Internal Audit Process and Procurement,
    Finance and Property Administration Process. “The process that is responsible for day to day
    procurement operation is the Procurement, Finance and Property Administration Process?. A
    review of the staffing levels in the cities has shown that there are shortages of staff at the
    senior positions, those currently assigned have been there for less than 2 years on average and
    there is high staff turnover. In most cases, the qualification for those in position was found to
    be a Diploma level in Accounting or Purchasing. It was observed that job level for
    procurement staff is much lower in general when compared to similar professions like
    financial management. In most cases there are no established career structures for procurement
    cadres. Cities that are participating in the ongoing ULGDP I have project units which process
    all procurement.

   Contract administration of Goods procurement is handled by the Procurement Units and
    property administration officers while works and engineering consultancy services are
    delegated to BUD at the regional level and to infrastructure and design and construction units
    under city managers, at the city administrations level. Payment verification and request are
    made by the sector units and payment is being effected by OFED of each city administration.
    The regional Public Procurement Directives have contained reasonably adequate guidance on
    basic contracts administration procedures similar with the Federal one. But the awareness and
    implementation of the contract administration procedures, by the city administrations, is very
    low. The actual practice is much haphazard and this makes the contract administration
    unreliable and risky. It is noted that staffs are not aware of what is provided in the directives
    and most have no experience of contract administration. The contracts administrations
    weaknesses stems from the poor contract documents signed between cities and
    suppliers/contractors. The signed agreements of most contracts are incomplete and this again
    origins from incompleteness of the issued Bidding Documents that do not contain the correct
    and complete model contracts to be entered. In most cases, the Bidding Documents contain
    only Invitation for Bid (IFB) and Bill of Quantity (BOQ). And the contract agreements
    contain only form of contracts and priced BOQs. As the result, there is no agreement based
    formal contract administration practice and all subsequent actions (monitoring and control of
    contracts timeliness, quality delivery and cost controls) are based on traditions and perceptions
    or unwritten understandings between the parties. This is a critical area to be addressed through
    the Program Action Plan (PAP).

   Procurement processing delays is not a major challenge in most of the cases. This may be
    attributed to the simple and non-complex nature of contracts being handled by cities so far.
    Bidding document preparation takes one week to one month and similarly the bid evaluation
    process takes two weeks to two months depending on the size and complexity of the contract.
    For goods contract, the main problem, while preparing bidding documents, is obtaining the
    right specification from sector offices. Most sector offices have limited capacity for
    preparation of technical specifications (purchaser’s requirements) in their procurement
    requests. Again, in terms of time taken to prepare Bidding Documents and to complete the Bid
    Evaluation there is big variation between cities depending on their experience in the bid
    processes management.

   Cost and time overrun (variations) is not a major problem for goods. But cost and time
    overrun is common challenge for Works and Consultancy Services contracts implementation.
    Up to 30 percent cost overrun has been recorded at some City Administrations. Though there
                                                                                                        40
         is no legal provision for procedures of approving variations orders or issuing contracts
         modifications, the practices is that, “Award Approving Committee? or “project committees? in
         some regions (serving as “Award Approving Committee?), reviews and approves variations.

        During the assessment, it was noted that contractual disputes are dealt not consistent to the
         provision of the contract or acceptable standards. The practice to resolve contractual disputes
         varies considerably from a city to a city. In some cases, where there is a contractual provision
         in the contract agreement for disputes resolutions, contractual disputes are resolved following
         the mechanisms as stipulated in the contract agreement. But in most cases, the contract
         agreements do lack detail contractual clauses and provisions not only dispute resolution
         mechanism, but also basic obligations and rights of the parties. Therefore most cases are
         resolved following traditions and perceptions or unwritten understandings between the parties.

C.    FRAUD AND CORRUPTION

68.     It is difficult to determine the extent to which fraud and corruption will actually occur in
the ULGDP program as there is no apparent systematic recording, collection, or analysis of fraud
and corruption data under ULGDP1. Previous reviews and implementation support missions under
ULGDP 1 did not encounter any reports of fraud and corruption in the Program except issues relating to
procurement compliance which were resolved. The various Regional and Local authorities under the
Program will undertake regular monitoring and are subject to fiduciary controls, and consequently, will
adopt a common approach to preventing, deterring, and detecting fraud and corruption throughout the
Program.

69.      The Government of Ethiopia has agreed to implement the PforR Program in accordance
with the Anti-Corruption Guidelines applicable to PforR operations of the World Bank. The Federal
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) and the Regional Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission (REACC) were established with powers to prevent, expose, investigate and prosecute
corruption offences and impropriety in Ethiopia. Over the past decade, the FEACC has investigated some
2,302 suspected cases of corruption and prosecuted a number of suspected offenders; 612 offenders
received sentences varying between 3 and 21 years imprisonment and fines. Among the cases investigated
and prosecuted were those involving high-ranking government officials, ruling party members, chief
executive officers, and staff of government owned public enterprises.13 In the last ten years (2001–2012),
there has been a steady rise in the total number of cases prosecuted as well as an improvement in
conviction rates from 77.8 percent to 85 percent. All regional ethics and anti-corruption commissions
received 7,037 complaints and tipoffs within their mandate amounting to two third of the total complaints
under the federal and regional mandate in 2011 and 2012. Out of the total complaints and tips off, 16
percent were convicted with variation among regions.14 As indicated in the subsequent flow charts,
federal, regional, and local governments have well-defined complaints handling mechanisms starting
from the federal level to the city administrations.

70.     Alignment with the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines: The Program will be aligned with
Anti-Corruption Guideline in respect to sharing of debarred firms list and information on fraud and
corruption allegations. It will also take into account investigation of fraud and corruption allegations as
per the MOU signed between FEACC and INT.

71.     Sharing of Debarment list of firms and individuals: The Government of Ethiopia commits to
use the Bank’s debarment list to ensure that persons or entities debarred or suspended by the Bank are not
awarded a contract under the Program during the period of such debarment or suspension. The
information on the list of debarred and suspended firms is public information in “Clients Connections?,
13
     FEACC annual reports, 2011 and 2012.
14
     Ibid.
                                                                                                            41
and on the Bank’s website. Companies and individuals debarred by the Bank and the PPRA will be
posted and updated regularly on MUDHCo’s website (www.mudc.gov.et), and advertised publicly by
ULGs. MUDHCo will take responsibility in ensuring that the website is updated regularly with
information on the list of debarred firms and individuals and share this information with all ULGs in the
Program, instructing them to comply by appending the debarment list to the annual transfer of Grant
notification which will be made public - and go to all Program ULGs. This list will also be used by
procurement officers and council members to monitor ULGs compliance. ULG compliance with the
debarment list will also be monitored through the Program annual assessment.

72.      In addition the Government also agreed that they would include some disclosure measures in
bidding documents for works, goods and services to be financed under the program, including insisting
that the firms and/or individuals declare they have not been debarred or suspended and/or have any links
with a debarred entity or individual.

73.      Sharing Information on Fraud and Corruption Allegations: In line with the ACGs, the
government (through FEACC) will share with the Bank all information on fraud and corruption
allegations, investigations and actions taken on the Program, including on procurement. Since the
proposed program is providing support to 44 ULGs, the structure of collecting and sharing information on
fraud and corruption and on the program goes beyond the Federal Government and would involve
Regional and local institutions as well. Consequently, information on fraud and corruption and
complaints regarding the Program will be collected at the Regional level and shared with the Federal
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission who will in turn share with the Bank. The FEACC gets monthly
reports from the REACC on fraud and corruption and other relevant activities, but in the case of this
program, the FEACC would compile and share information on fraud and corruption with the Bank every
6 months. The details of this reporting would include the types of allegations and the status of actions
taken. A template for recording and sharing the information with the Bank has been provided to the
FEACC.

74.    Investigation of fraud and corruption allegations: As indicated earlier, the Federal Ethics and
Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) and the Regional Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission
(REACC) were established with powers to prevent, expose, investigate and prosecute corruption offences
and impropriety in Ethiopia.

75.      The Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) has a good working relationship with the FEACC as
part of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between them on October 3, 2011. The MOU
provides a framework for cooperation and sharing of information, where appropriate, taking into
consideration the legal and policy framework and mandate of each organization. Thus far, the working
relationship between INT and FEACC based on the MOU has been cooperative and productive. The
MOU will provide the Bank and INT with a foundation for expanding the existing working relationship to
cover future cooperative investigations under the PforR Program when needed, and for helping to ensure
that the Government of Ethiopia and the FEACC can implement their commitments under the Anti-
Corruption Guidelines. More specifically, the terms of the cooperation includes the following: (a) to
provide one another (spontaneously or upon request) with information of relevance for detection,
substantiation and prevention of fraud and corruption in connection with conduct which may constitute a
serious crime under national legislation or a sanctionable offence under World Bank Group and Policies;
(b) to undertake joint activities and collaborate when appropriate in each Party’s efforts to detect,
substantiate and prevent fraud and corruption; (c) to engage one another on relevant activities which they
organize and undertake, and which may be of common interest in the execution of their mandates; (d) to
provide a mechanism for the reciprocal referral of inquiries and recommendations pertaining to
investigations and actions residing within the mandate and jurisdiction of the respective parties; (e) to
designate contact points to facilitate and expedite the effective and confidential transmission of
information exchanged, and (f) to meet periodically to identify possible priority areas for cooperation that

                                                                                                         42
present common strategic or operational objectives. The MOU will therefore make it possible for INT to
collaborate with the FEACC on any case of suspected fraud and corruption in the Program.

76.     FEACC, as indicated earlier has the responsibility for investigating and prosecuting corruption in
the country, including for funds specifically from Development Partners to support the Government of
Ethiopia. This responsibility is sometimes delegated by the FEACC to the REACC as part of an MOU
between them, which provides among other things powers to investigate and prosecute corruption for
funds and more specifically funds that seek to benefit the Regions and Cities. In addition, the FEACC and
REACC Commissioners meet bi-annually to share information on lessons learned, conduct joint learning
programs as well as discuss various issues regarding capacity building and priorities for addressing
corruption in the country more broadly.

    D. COMPLAINT-HANDLING MECHANISMS

77.      Complaint handling mechanisms are in place at all level of governments as per the
requirement of the National Proclamations (Proclamation 433/2005 and 434/2005) and institutional
level operational guidelines. These proclamations clearly define the procedures to follow under
corruption offences as well as for administrative complaints related to the Program. There are a number
ways for participation and engagement of citizens in complaint handling, transparency and social
accountability. At the grassroots, citizens have shown experience in forming community groups,
committee or representative to liaison with constituency and seek solutions. ULGs have started to create
forum for receiving in requests and information and responsiveness by local authorities. Such
mechanisms include facilitating face-to-face/interface meetings and joint discussion between citizens and
providers of services; joint monitoring and assessment performances. Although the system of complaints
handling is very well established in Ethiopia, the MUDHCo and the Regional and Local Authorities will
take full responsibility in ensuring that program beneficiaries are regularly informed about the complaint
system which is an important requirement that will help in ensuring the program meets its development
objectives.

                                                                             compliant                                              case                    case

                                                                            Investigation and prosecution report to REACC deputy commissioner

                                                                                 Deputy commissioner forwards to commissioner with recommendation



                                                                                 Commissioner makes decision whether to prosecute or not



78.      ULGs have defined and interlinked accountabilities in handling complaints on the Program
as well as reporting fraud and corruption to ensure they discharge their responsibilities effectively.
Complaints can be received from internal or external clients through various channels such as suggestion
boxes, verbal, written and in person. At the ULGs level, complaints are lodged to the City Complaint-
Handling Body or unit consisting of Ethics Liaison Unit officers (responsible for managing complaints
related to finance, procurement, administrative. personnel, revenue etc.), to the police , to other delegated
bodies or directly to REACC. The Ethics Liaison Officers are the legal representatives of REACC at the
local levels, and this program will seek to support their capacity strengthening on a demand-driven basis
as part of the broader capacity support to MUDHCo and the Regional Authorities.

79.     The City Complaint- Handling body identifies whether the complaint is fraud and
corruption related complaints or other complaint (such as administrative /system, service provision
related complaints). If it is fraud and corruption, it classifies whether it is petty corruption or grand


                                                                                                                                                     44
corruption15 in the case of a large Region such as Oromiya where this distinction is made primarily
because cases of petty corruption are prosecuted by the Oromiya Justice Bureau, while grand corruption
cases are prosecuted by the REACC. It also identifies whether the jurisdictions in which a complaint
could be treated is with either FEACC or REACC or delegated to the Police for investigations. If the
complaint is classified as an administrative issue related to the Program, the Complaint- Handling body
collects the required information and refers to the concerned institution /department and provides advice
to take preventive and corrective actions while at the same time reporting to the Ethics infrastructure
coordination Department at REACC who keeps track of the complaints that come in on the Program.
Response or feedback is provided to the complainer. If the decision is not satisfying to the complainer,
he/she can take the case to REACC for further action.

80.      On the other hand, if the complaint is found to be related to allegation of corruption and
fraud or related to wrong doing as per the screening, the Complaint- Handling body /liaison unit
officer forwards the issue with the necessary data to the Registrar of REACC. The Registrar sorts out
the complaint in terms of its jurisdictional responsibility, whether it is petty or grand corruption, and
submits to the Deputy Commissioner of REACC. The Deputy Commissioner verifies the complaint and
then refers it to the investigation and prosecution team. The investigation team investigates the case and
submits its findings back to the Deputy Commissioner. Then the Deputy Commissioner checks the
information collected from the investigations, endorses and then forwards to the REACC Commissioner.
The Commissioner refers the case to the court /prosecutor for the next action. Sometimes complainers can
directly approach the Police. The Police, in its mandate as a delegated body in this instance, investigate
the cases and forward the results to FEACC or REACC depending on the mandate given and the process
moves forward as described above after the information gets to the Registrar. In terms of sharing
information with the Bank on Complaints regarding the Program, the Planning and Evaluation section of
REACC will compile reports related to complaints from the Ethics Infrastructure Coordination Case
Team,(consolidated reports coming from all ULGs), Investigation and prosecution department in
REACC, Registrar, and from the Ethics Officers of the Regional Urban Development Bureau and submit
on quarterly basis to FEACC who will then submit a consolidated report to the World Bank bi-annually.

81.     The expectation is that most of the prosecution for corruption-related offences in the
Program will be done by the REACCs, with support from the FEACC, as and when necessary . The
MOU between FEACC and REACCs provides a context for collaboration on various issues, including
prosecution support. FEACC has responsibility of strengthening the capacity of REACCs and organize
various training and capacity building programs in response to identified priority areas where such
capacity is needed. As part of this Program, there will be some support to help strengthen the capacity of
both FEACC and REACCs on a demand-driven basis, including supporting their request for a Program
Coordinator at FEACC and at all REACCs to ensure there is full support to the program demands for
receiving and compiling complaints on the program and sharing with the Bank, ensuring that information
is shared on the debarment lists is shared regularly, and other related issues that comes up as part of the
program to ensure full compliance and applicability of the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines.
      COMPLAINT HANDLING IN PUBLIC PROCURING ENTITY RELATED TO PROCUREMENT


82.    The procurement systems assessment found that there are systems and procedures for
handling bidder’s enquiries and complaints at federal, regional and local levels for procurement in
ULGDP I and remedial action are taken on complaint review board decisions and observations
made following appeals. The federal procurement proclamation enacted the establishment of “Board for
Review and Resolution of Complaints in public procurement? and instituted the board with five members.
A complaints review unit in PPA (the board member) receives and compiles complaints and presents to

15
  In Oromiya Region, cases which are below Birr 100,000 (About 5,000 USD) and not committed by higher official is considered to be petty
corruption and will be referred to the Bureau of Justice for investigation. On the other hand a case which is above Birr 100, 000 or even below
Birr 100,000 but committed with the involvement of higher official is considered to be Grand corruption and will be referred to the investigation
department in REACC.
                                                                                                                                              45
the board; receive offence reports from Procuring Entities against suppliers. The Board refers any
procurement complaints perceived to involve fraud and corruption to the FEACC and/or REACC for
investigations.

83.     As indicated in the procurement systems assessment, the revised procurement legislation/
directives of each regional state provides a mechanism for submitting complaints that ULGS are
required to comply with. Complaints from suppliers or bidders can be lodged to the procuring entity
within 5 days of the circumstances justifying a complaint becomes known. The head of the procuring
entity responds to complainer within 15 days. If the complainant is not satisfied with the response
provided by the head of the procuring entity or if the head of the procuring entity doesn’t reply to the
complainer, then the complainer appeals the case to the procurement complaint review board (majority of
the board members are public officials and from procuring agencies). The head of BoFED or the process
head of economic and social development gives final approval of the recommendation of the Board or
committee. Response is made to the complainer within 15 days. If the complainer is still dissatisfied with
the response of procurement complaint board, the complainer can take the matter to the courts. If the
complaint process/procedure related and the complainer is satisfied, necessary actions are taken and
responses are made to the complainer .On the other side, the procurement process can be withheld or
upheld depending on the confirmation of the complaint for wrong doing or not.

84.      Complaints could be on serious/petty breaches of fraud and corruption related allegation or
on the processes or procedures of procurement conducted (for example, due to inadequate
knowledge of the complainer which requires explanation). If the complaint review board/committee
suspects the case is related to fraud and corruption, then the case is directed to the REACC or FEACC.
Any bidder, procuring entity, citizen including Ethics unit officers, Federal and regional auditor generals
can lodge procurement related complaints to REACC or FEACC. Besides, as mentioned above, the ethics
liaison unit officer of each entity report fraud and corruption related cases. Although the Anti-Corruption
law in Ethiopia makes provision for people to complain directly to the FEACC and REACC if they
believe a case of fraud and corruption has been committed, the Program Coordinators will also emphasize
this point to all the procuring entities as part of the program’s information dissemination. The regional
and city administration/ULG level procurement complaints handling flow mechanism is shown follows.

Figure 2: Fraud and Corruption Suspicious Cases Investigation Flow Chart




                                                                                                        46
Figure 3: Compliant Handling Flow Chart at the City Administration on Procurements




85.      There is also an appeal mechanism that if the complainant is not satisfied with the
explanation provided by the head of the procuring entity, then the complainant appeals the case to
the regional procurement complaint board. The majority of the board members are from public
officials and procuring agencies and the final approval of the recommendation of the Board is made by
the BoFED head, who is again part of the executing or contracts award approver. The system in place is
workable, but the independency of the complaints review committee/board is questionable. The system
also allows the complainant takes the case to court seeking for further justice if the complainant is not
satisfied with the resolution given by the complaint board. The existing complaints handling mechanism
is satisfactory except that the board is not independent from the procurement executing bodies and the
general business community has less awareness of the existence of such mechanism to complain. The
risk mitigation measure that can be recommended is: (i) The RPPAs need to conduct business outreaches
and sensitize the business community regarding the available procurement complaints redressing
mechanism; (ii) The independence of the complaint review board may be improved by involving private
sector and independent professionals as a board member

86.     As to complaints suspicious of fraud and corruption and how these are directed to REACC
or FEACC, the existing practice is workable. The existing practice is as follows: (i) any bidder, citizen
or individual can report/direct (whistle blow) the case to REACC or FEACC; (ii) the case can also be
reported to the ethics officer of each entity who further forwards the case to REACC or FEACC; (iii) the
complaint review board/committee screens cases and if the board suspects the case is related to fraud and
                                                                                                      47
corruption, then they direct the case to REACC or FEACC. The only gap identified with this arrangement
is that both the FEACC and REACC staffs have less capacity and competence to review complex
procurement and contract cases. In many places, implementing agency staffs are scared of the name
REACC and FEACC as they consider any thing taken to these offices causes impressment of staffs as the
cases may not be investigated by qualified experts in the field of public procurement and contracts
management. This risk may be minimized by: (i) providing the FEACC and REACC staffs training and
capacity building on public procurement and contracts management and (ii) the FEACC and REACC use
specialized experts to review and investigate fraud and corruption suspicious procurement and contract
issues before they take actions on cases reported.

87.      The assessment revealed that there are serious shortcomings in contract management,
especially at the cities level. In order to mitigate this risk, the following three actions may be considered
as program action plan : (i) The MUDHCo, regions, or the Bank may support the cities with provision of
contract management and administration training and (ii) A consultant may be recruited by the project to
prepare a contract administration manual to the participating cities and provide the necessary training on
it (the Contract administration manual will be based on the Governments own systems) ; (iii) the ToR of
the annual procurement audits should include review of the contract performance to further bring the
cases to the management.

88.      There is inadequate system by which city administrations keep data on volume of
complaints and the nature of complaints and report on them. Incoming procurement complaints have
no separate file; they are kept in the respective contract files. There is also no system or practice by which
complaints and responses are disclosed to the public. However the finding of this assessment is that there
is a practice of responding to procurement complaints. No evidence of retaliation has been noticed. The
shortcoming observed is that complaints are reviewed by the implementing/procuring entity and this
could result in conflict of interest issues. There is need to ensure the independence of the entity reviewing
complaints.


VI. Fiduciary Risk Summary
      A. Addressing Fiduciary Risk

89.      Based on the above reasons, the fiduciary risk assessed for this operation is classified as
“substantial?. Overall, the fiduciary assessment concludes that the examined program financial
management and procurement systems are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the financing
proceeds will be used for intended purposes, with due attention to principles of economy, efficiency,
effectiveness, transparency and accountability, and for safeguarding Program assets once the proposed
mitigation measures have been implemented. Appropriate systems to handle fiduciary risks including the
fraud and corruption, including effective complaint-handling mechanisms, have been agreed on and
established. Risk mitigation measures for the identified risks have been discussed and agreed with
Government. The risk mitigation measures have two pronged approach: First a Disbursement Linked
Indicator will be provided in the Financing Agreement to support transparency aspects of the Program.
Secondly specific actions have been proposed that will support the DLI and help improve efficiency and
performance monitoring are indicated in the Program Action Plan.

No       Action                                                 Pre-Start      FY-1   FY-2   FY-3    FY-4
                                                                FY
1        Budgeting:
         Budget execution and analysis of variances is a
         challenge noted and this will be addressed through
         semi-annual reports. Review of reports to identify
         poor implementation and budget utilization will be
         performed.

2        Accounting:
         IBEX shall be used for all cities. Fragmented use of
         systems will be avoided.
         CoA will be clarified by MoFED and shall be
         included in the Operating manual and Training
         will be conducted
3        Staffing:

         OFEDs’ staff database will be submitted in the
         first six months of effectiveness, and 75 percent
         of professional staff positions will be filled
         within two years.
         Continuous training shall be provided for the
         staff to cater for staff turnover.


4        Internal Controls:
         Inspection Directorate at MoFED, in collaboration
         with regional Inspection Directorates at BoFEDs,
         will oversee the conduct of internal audits at least
         once per year by ULGs internal auditors.

5        External Audit:
         In addition to a financial audit (which is a legal
         covenant), a value for money audit will be
         conducted by OFAG. The first value for money
         audit will commence from the second year onwards
         and will be submitted to the World Bank with in 6
         month of the end of the EFY.


6        Regional PPAs to enforce their legal requirements
                                                                                                    53
        and provide reminders to Cities and organize
        training on the use and implementation of the
        procurement laws, directives, manuals, standard
        bidding documents and monitor the consistency of
        practices.

7       Cities will:
         Seek guidance from the regional authorities.
         Follow guidance on policies on support to
            MSEs and the level of preferences that would be
            acceptable across the board to ensure uniformity
            and minimize abuse (this guidance will be part
            of participatory and performance agreement,
            PPA and Program Operations Manual).


8       BoFED will undertake audit capacity building of the
        regional PPAs.
9       Each participating city’s mayors issue instructions
        and make all procurement legal documents
        including SBDs available to the staff and enforce
        and oversight its applications
10      The weakness in the existing Procurement
        complaints handling mechanism may be improved
        through: (i) The RPPAs will conduct business
        outreaches and sensitize the business community
        regarding the available procurement complaints
        redressing mechanism; (ii) BoFEDs will review the
        independence and options for improving the
        complaint handling mechanism
11      The gap identified with the capacity of FEACC and
        REACC may be improved through: (i) providing the
        FEACC and REACC staffs training and capacity
        building on public procurement and contracts
        management and (ii) the FEACC and REACC use
        specialized experts to review and investigate fraud
        and corruption suspicious procurement and contract
        issues before they take actions on cases reported,
        and (iii) provide training on complaint handling
        mechanisms and reporting for staff of REACCs and
        Ethics units in the ULGs
12      A consultant may be recruited by the Program to
        prepare a contract administration manual to the
        participating cities and provide the necessary
        training on it (the Contract administration manual
        will be based on the Governments own systems)

     C. Undertaking Audit

92.     Financial audits of ULGDP have been produced on an annual basis and meet the quality
expectations. These have been undertaken by the Audit Services Corporation on behalf of the Office of
the Federal Auditor General. The OFAG undertakes the audit of all spending units on an annual basis.
These audits are of a financial nature and primarily focus on forming an opinion on the program financial
                                                                                                      54
statements and of course comprise transaction-level testing, but internal controls are examined and
reported on as well.

93.     Since this PforR operation uses country systems, OFAG’s regular audits of MUDHCo and the
Cities will be sufficient for meeting the audit requirements of this Program. The auditor will be required
to express an opinion on the audited financial statements of compliance with International Standards on
Auditing (issued by IFAC) or INTOSAI pronouncements and submit the audit report within six months of
the end of the financial year. In addition, the auditors will provide a detailed management letters
containing the auditor’s assessment of the internal controls, accounting system, and compliance with
financial covenants.

94.     The OFAG also undertakes value-for-money audits on a regular basis. As a key risk mitigation
measure going forward, discussions will be held with OFAG to adjust the terms of reference for the
annual financial audits to take into account the value-for-money aspects.


VII. Implementation Support Plan
    A. Reviewing Implementation Progress


Annual assessment of minimum conditions
95.      Fraud and corruption may be an issue though not very significant during the implementation of
the program as it can be managed by strengthening the existing mitigation arrangement. The key factors
that lead to fraud and corruption arise from the large nationwide decentralized nature of the program,
insufficiently strengthened complaint redress mechanisms, weak system of disclosure of information
between provider and user in infrastructure development and weak fiduciary environment. Improving this
environment in the target ULGs is a specific goal of the ULGDP II, and will be addressed directly
through the following main modalities outlined.

96.     The Government of Ethiopia has agreed to implement the Program in accordance with the Anti-
Corruption Guidelines applicable to PforR operations (ACG).The government will continue to enhance
the prevention, investigation and prosecution actions on anti-corruption (fraud and corruption) in all
program financed ULGs primarily through the existing FEACC and ULGs decentralized arrangements.
The FEACC will consolidate reports submitted by REACC and share information with the World Bank
and MUDHCo. The consolidated report on anti-corruption (fraud and corruption) by FEAC will feed into
the Independent annual Program assessment (APA) to be carried out by an independent firm- the
assessment measures adherence to Program's minimum conditions and performance indicators and
determines the annual disbursement. The annual assessment will include, as minimum access conditions
and performance indicators, steps such as:

    a) Having strengthened systems of grievance and complaint handling and redress in place at all
       ULGs, especially by strengthening the link of ULGs, REACC ,FEACC with BoFEDs and ULGs’
       OFEDs.

    b) enhancing the competiveness in procurement and publicly advertising the bidding procedures/
       disclosing information to the public

    c) biannual reporting of ULGs on fraud and corruption, accountability and governance

    d)   having a consultative process for ULGs (carrying out municipal forum twice annually)


                                                                                                       55
    e) The Federal ULGDP office recording such allegations, or allegations from any other source
       regarding Program funding, and actions taken on them in performance report

    f) develop a Local Government Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan on governance and
       anticorruption issues by MUDHCo to be implemented and mentored at the URLG level

    g) Fulfilling the minimum capacity building requirements including;

               Capacity building program/training to enhance the assessment and reporting capacity of
                FEACC in M and E, enhanced assessment capacity, information sharing, accountability
                and participation
               Assigning qualified 2-3 core staff members in FEACC with the requisite computers and
                software
               Development of software and availability of vehicle for field work in FEACC
               It will also require to ensuring the placement of core fiduciary staff at the ULGA level for
                each year of the Program;
               REACC, liaison units capacity building/training to enhance the assessment and reporting
                capacity in M&E, enhanced assessment capacity, information sharing, accountability and
                participation
               Capacity building program to be managed at ULCGs and MUDHCo specifically focusing
                on training and improving system and strengthening transparency, accountability
                stringent oversight and monitoring arrangement at the ULGA and MUDHCo levels to
                minimize fraud and corruption risk,

97.     The institutional responsibilities for the above mentioned activities related to handling fraud and
corruption will be discussed and agreed at appraisal.

98.     Conducting performance /Financial audit reports (with no adverse or disclaimer opinion) annually
for program funds in all 18 ULGAs at first and in other ULGs.

99.     Mitigation measures and action plans have been proposed for each of the identified fiduciary risk
elements. Specific weaknesses pertaining to the Program will be dealt with through the Program Action
plan and some selected Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI) to be monitored using agreed verification
protocol and implementation

    B. Monitoring Fiduciary Risks
100.    The frequency and breadth of fiduciary systems implementation support may be varied in
accordance with changes in the risks to the Program. It is expected that as implementation progressed,
substantial improvements in procurement and financial management capacities will reduce the risk profile
and may afford a reduced supervision schedule. This will be determined by the Bank’s fiduciary systems
team in consultation with other pooling partners to monitor compliance with the Joint Financing
Arrangement and fiduciary provisions of legal covenants.

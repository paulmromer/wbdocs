     Safeguarding Against a Reversal in Social
      Gains During the Economic Crisis in Brazil
Executive Summary
 Brazil has accomplished impressive reductions in poverty and inequality between 2004 and 2014 as
  a result of rapidly growing formal employment, higher real wages and redistributive social assistance
  programs such as Bolsa Família. With labor income as the major source of income of the poor and
  vulnerable households, the current economic crisis poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the
  gains in poverty and inequality reduction. As in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Brazil’s social
  assistance and safety net system has a critical role in safeguarding the social gains achieved so far
  by preventing more Brazilians from falling into poverty. Yet the expansion of the budget for the social
  safety net system is hampered by the challenging fiscal consolidation environment in Brazil.
 This note summarizes the findings of the analysis carried out regarding the poverty and inequality
  impacts of the ongoing economic crisis in Brazil in 2016 and 2017. The first objective is to get an
  estimate of the extent to which the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and shrinking labor
  markets in Brazil will impact on poverty and inequality. The second objective is to generate a detailed
  profile of the “new poor? associated with the crisis. The third and final objective is to get estimates of
  the additional budget needed for the Bolsa Família Program to effectively mitigate the poverty
  impacts of the crisis and protect the past achievements of Brazil in poverty and inequality reduction
  until the necessary structural reforms take place in Brazil and the engines of growth are reignited.
 The analysis is repeated for two scenarios regarding the changes in real GDP in 2016 and 2017 for
  the purpose of providing a sufficiently narrow zone for policy decisions anticipating the adverse
  impacts of the crisis on poverty. The distributional impact of each scenario is evaluated first under the
  assumption of no changes in the real budget of Bolsa Família and second after allowing for an
  increase in the real Bolsa Família budget, which allows for an increase in the coverage of the
  program to the new poor based on the program’s current level of “real? benefits and eligibility rules.
 The results of the microsimulation analysis suggest that indicators about inequality and poverty will
  increase in 2016 and remain high in 2017. In scenario 1, the Gini index measuring inequality is
  predicted to increase from 0.515 to 0.522 in 2017 as is the poverty headcount ratio (at the R$140
  poverty line) which will increase from 8.7% to 9.8% representing an increase in the number of poor
  by 2.5 million people. In the more pessimistic scenario 2, the Gini increases to 0.524 in 2017 and the
  higher poverty headcount ratio of 10.3% in 2017 represents an increase in the number of poor by 3.6
  million people. However, poverty rates will increase mainly in the urban areas and less in the rural
  areas (where poverty rates are higher to begin with). The analysis also reveals that the people falling
  below the poverty line as a consequence of the crisis are likely to be slightly younger in age, skilled,
  located in urban areas, located in the southeast, previously working in the service sector, and white.
 The depth and duration of the current economic crisis in Brazil gives rise to the opportunity to expand
  the role of Bolsa Família from an effective redistribution program to a true safety net program that is
  sufficiently flexible to expand its coverage to the “new poor? households generated by the crisis. The
  analysis in this note suggests that an increased budget (in real terms) of about 4.73% (R$1.25 billion)
  and 6.9% (R$1.82 billion) from the 2015 budget of R$26.4 billion, would be a very effective way of
  targeting scarce financial resources to the most needy among the “new poor? households generated
  by the crisis. In nominal terms, or in 2017 Reais, the estimate of the budget required in 2017 can be
  calculated by multiplying the 2015 budget (R$26.4 billion) with the estimated increase in the “real?
  Bolsa Família budget (e.g., 1.0473 under scenario 1) and the expected inflation rate between 2015
  and 2017 (e.g., 10% or 1.10). Using these specific values, the estimate of the nominal budget
  required in 2017 is R$30.41 billion.
 The distribution of the additional Bolsa Família budget to the newly eligible households among the
  “new poor? can prevent the extreme poverty rate in Brazil from increasing beyond the level of 2015,
  though its impact on preventing the overall poverty rate from increasing is not as dramatic. It is
  important to bear in mind that the preceding estimates of the additional budget needed for Bolsa
  Família are derived based on the program’s current level of real benefits and eligibility rules and
  assuming annual adjustments in the nominal budget in par with the annual inflation rate so at to
  maintain the purchasing power of the benefits constant over time. Delays in adjusting the nominal
  value of the transfers of Bolsa Família in par with the prevailing inflation rate are likely to lead to
  higher poverty rates than those estimated in this note (all else equal). As the Brazil Systematic
  Country Diagnostic (2016) highlights, in spite of the limited fiscal space in the medium run, there is
  ample scope to expand funding for the most progressive elements of social policy, through
  reallocations from poorly targeted social transfers and through improvements in the efficiency of
  spending.

extent, it was due to a policy of social inclusion in
the context of a booming economy, fueled by
favorable external conditions. Brazil’s achievements
were also of historical significance, in that it was the
first time in the history of Brazil that a sustained
reduction in poverty and inequality had been
achieved. Nevertheless, even after the reduction in
poverty and inequality, Brazil remains one of the
most unequal countries in the world, with a Gini
coefficient higher than in most countries except
Colombia and Honduras in Latin America and
Caribbean and a few countries in sub-Saharan
Africa.

Gukovas. Martin Raiser, Ricardo Paes de Barros, Pedro Olinto, Oscar Calvo-Gonzalez, and Antonio Nucifora,
provided very constructive suggestions and feedback. This note is a revised and updated version of an earlier note
using data from the 2014 PNAD as a baseline year.
2 See Olivieri et al. (2014) for a detailed description of the ADePT simulation module developed for microsimulations

of the poverty and welfare impacts of economic crises (http://go.worldbank.org/UDTL02A390) .The ADepT crisis
simulation module is based on a simplified version of the approaches developed by Bourguignon, Bussolo, and
Pereira da Silva (2008) and Ferreira et al. (2008).
3 The categories are inactivity (or being out of the labor force), unemployment, and employment in the following

three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and mining); manufacturing (including electricity, gas, and
water); and services (including the construction sector).

7 Recent work by Bank staff also suggests that during this crisis, discouraged worker effects are likely to dominate

instead of the added worker effects that in past crises in Brazil typically contributed to women and other temporary
workers increasing their labor force participation during the crisis period (Skoufias, et al. 2016).
8 See Olivieri et al (2014) for a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the ADePT Simulation module.
9 See Figure 1.12 in the Brazil Systematic Country Diagnostic (2016) where the evolution of the wage skill premium

and inequality is presented.
10 Given that the analysis is being carried out with only one year of data from the 2015 PNAD, adjusted 2015

nominal income for general inflation between 2015 and 2016 or 2017 compared against a poverty threshold that is
also adjusted by the same general inflation rate is equivalent to price changes having no real effects. Another issue
related to prices is spatial disparities in the cost of living. Although Brazil does not have an official poverty line, the
administrative poverty lines used by the Bolsa Família program make no adjustments for cost of living differences
across regions or between urban and rural areas. Alternative simulations carried out (not reported) taking into
account spatial cost of living differences in the baseline year using a spatial cost of living index derived from the
2008/9 POF survey yielded qualitatively similar estimates on the distributional impacts of the crisis in Brazil.
11 The Gini index, for example, is most sensitive to income differences at about the middle of the distribution.
12 The very large declines for the very bottom percentiles of income are primarily due to extreme values and outliers

(i.e., very low but non-zero values of reported income). Reproducing the GIC excluding the bottom 1% of the income
distributions yields the same general picture with the maximum decline i n income at the “new? bottom percentile of
income being around -40%.
13 Southeast region includes the following States: Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.
14 In practice, targeting errors are always an issue of concern in the implementation of cash transfer programs such as

Bolsa Família, and it is important to develop targeting mechanisms that minimize inclusion and exclusion errors.
15 Administrative records from the Bolsa Família program report a budget of R$26.4 billion in 2015. The budget

calculations in this note, net out the number of families that would graduate or become ineligible from Bolsa Família
because of increases in their income. It is also assumed that every family whose per capita income less than R$154
and meeting the official criteria receives the benefit.
16 The cumulative distribution functions in Figure 14 zoom-in the per capita income range between R$0 and R$250.
17The estimate of the nominal budget required in 2017 can be calculated by multiplying the 2015 budget (R$26.4

billion) with the estimated increase in the “real? Bolsa Família budget (e.g., 1.0473 under scenario 1) and the
expected inflation rate between 2015 and 2017 (e.g. 10% or 1.10). Using these specific values, the estimate of the
nominal budget required in 2017 is R$30.41 billion.

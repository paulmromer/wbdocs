Executive Summary

Background

The 2015 annual report is the third in a series of annual reports produced by the Service Level
Benchmarking Coordination Committee (SLBCC). The purpose of the report is to disseminate and share
lessons learned from the peer review process with our wider stakeholder groups, namely government,
donors, development partners, urban communities. The services being benchmarked are water supply,
wastewater and solid waste.

After its inception in 2012, the Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) and Peer Review Process (PRP) has
registered considerable achievements in the management of water, wastewater and solid waste
services in urban local authorities in Zimbabwe. The advent of the refugee crisis in Europe and the
devastating Elnino induced droughts, epitomised by climate change realities continue to draw the
attention of most governments and development partners away from Africa. This has resulted in low
FDIs into the region, leading to de-industrialisation and constrained investments in infrastructure in
general, and water and sanitation in particular. Despite the myriad of challenges facing the country and
indeed the local government sector, tremendous progress had been and still is being made in delivering
these much needed services to the citizenry. One such noble intervention is the attempt at
benchmarking these three services and the review of progress against agreed benchmarks through a
Peer Review mechanism.

Guided by the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-ASSET), the
Service Level Benchmarking and Peer Review Process is an integral part of the national drive towards
accountability, transparency and prosperity to the citizens of Zimbabwe. The Service Level
Benchmarking process seeks to continuously monitor and improve service delivery in the WASH sector
through accurate data reporting. The SLB Peer Review process is being funded and implemented by the
World Bank, in partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe, Local Authorities and Zimbabwe Local
Government Association (ZILGA).

Critical to the success of this process is the need to get stakeholders commitment and buy-in. This is
achieved through structured engagement aimed at ensuring stakeholder participation throughout the
process, from activity planning to monitoring, review and reporting. Pursuant to our objective of
ensuring stakeholder involvement, a workshop for Town Clerks was held in Bulawayo from 26-27
January 2015. This was followed by a capacity building workshop for Mayors/Chairpersons on the 28
January 2015 in Bulawayo. These workshops provided a firm foundation for the success of the SLB
programme. Obtaining buy-in and commitment at these two levels of local authority leadership was
essential in order to avoid the previous year’s pitfalls. An additional benefit to this high level uptake of
the programme was the assurance for its sustainability beyond the external financial and technical
support from the World Bank where local authorities are expected to take over funding, coordination
and management of the entire programme.

Similarly, a workshop for external stakeholders, including donors and development partners was held
on 6th February 2015 to share the SLB 2014 annual report. As with the other two workshops, the annual
report got a resounding reception. The donors and development partners were appreciative of the
initiative despite the seemingly low progress in achieving the desired benchmarks. Despite the slow
start, the results were general noticeable improvements in all the services. Most importantly was the
catalytic nature of the project and its ability to foster vertically and horizontal learning among Local
Authority peers. In addition, the SLB process was accepted as a more objective and scientific way of
monitoring and evaluating service delivery performance by local authorities through self-assessments
and peer assessments.

In order to mainstream the project into the overall WASH sector initiatives and to ensure that there is
no duplication of efforts as well as funding with other partners, the annual report was also shared with
the WASH Urban Rehabilitation Technical Committee, it being a sub-committee of the National
Coordination Unit (NCU) of the National Action Committee (NAC). This was critical in order to harmonise
interventions across the sector and to ensure that the impact of the interventions is felt by a larger
population. Likewise, the report and the lessons thereto were cascaded to UCAZ officers’ forums such as
the Town Treasurers Forum and the Town Engineers Forum.

This report reviews the progress of the SLB process to date and gives a summary of the results of the
Peer Review process of 2015. Unlike in the previous reports, the results for the 2015 peer review
process show that there is an improvement in service delivery across all Local Authorities. Factors that
contributed to this improvement are the notable investments in water and sanitation assets, mainly by
development partners during the period. Development partners such as GIZ, World Bank, UNICEF and
AfDB carried out interventions aimed at improving the asset base for water and sanitation services
delivery. We also noted the contribution made by the Government of Zimbabwe through its PSIP to
finance outstanding water and sanitation infrastructure in some local authorities. These interventions,
though far inadequate given the magnitude of the problems in the sector, did make some noticeable
impact on service delivery.

Despite the limited financial base, most councils did take steps to address some areas of concern,
especially those that did not require huge capital funding. A change of systems and attitudes was also
reflected by the movement of indicators. As this was a third round of data collection, some of the
movements in indicators could also be due to a tightening of the data gathering systems as officials
became more conscious of the need to keep proper and accurate records. Some councils carried out
property surveys and this, in a way, helped them to improve revenue collection by identifying
properties that were missing from their databases. Data availability and completeness was generally
good. However, reliability of some of the data remained questionable due to statistics that could not be
scientifically verified.

Most Local Authorities have now embraced the separation of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) in their
budgets. However there is need to ensure adherence to this practice during resource allocation and
during expenditure. Generally, Local Authorities were better prepared for the review process than
before and good team work was exhibited throughout the reviews.



Summary Results on Indicators Based on 2014 Data

Water Supply Indicators

Data on water supply in the table below shows some slight improvement. However, there is need for
some local authorities to separate industrial, commercial and institutional consumption which tends to
push consumption figures upward. Reliability of data has significantly improved as compared to the
2013 data. Like in the previous year, there was very minimal investment in infrastructure mainly due to
the depressed economic environment. However, to a greater extent, local authorities have managed to
maintain the existing infrastructure in a sound condition to maintain the current service levels.

Non-revenue water is still high in most councils. There is need for investment in metering installations
and replacement, and also in leak detection. In addition, zonal metering may also improve tracking and
accounting for water losses, as these will be confined to smaller geographical zones. GIS uptake among
local authorities is very low, despite its costs being moderate. Individual local authorities need to come
up with strategies for the reduction of NRW, which is above 50% for the majority of the councils. Data
on water production shows that there is adequate water being produced, however, at the consumer



                                               Page 6 of 52
end water accounted for is very low. In some instances there is conflicting data on water produced and
continuity of water supply.

When it comes to the quality of water supplied, councils appear to be tempering with data, especially
when quality is bad. The main weakness is that councils are reporting good results and not testing all
relevant key parameters. The testing of the quality of drinking water right from the treatment plant,
intermediate points (reservoirs and pumping stations), and consumer end need to be tightened and
guided by clear protocols. Health Officers should come up with a monitoring protocol for quality of
water. Periodic independent water quality testing is highly recommended for all councils. Equally
significant is the need to standardise testing parameters across councils.

When it comes to tariff structure and tariff setting, there is no uniformity among councils. Some
councils are charging very high tariffs while others are charging uneconomic tariffs. There is a tendency
to over-charge consumers when there is no cost build up to justify the tariff because tariffs are largely
estimates. There is need for a standard method of calculating the cost built up to a tariff structure. Such
justification is essential for Local Authorities to gain the confidence of rate payers. This might result in
more revenue as resistance to pay is overcome by being transparent in the way tariffs are determined.

Redressing customer complaints and paying attention to customer needs is an area requiring attention
in most Local Authorities. While there is evidence of use of multiple mechanisms by which consumers
can make their complaints, there is lack of empirical evidence of how, when and by who the complaints
were resolved. In addition, registers do not have provision for the complainant to endorse to vouch that
the complaint had been satisfactorily attended to. There is need for local authorities to daft a model
complaints register which councils can adopt to suit their context.

The table below summarises the councils’ performance on the water supply indicators.

Wastewater Management Indicators

A summary of results on wastewater management is shown in the table below. These results show that
the collection of sewage for treatment is still very low. It is evident that sewage is being collected from
sources but most of it is not reaching wastewater treatment plants. This is revealed by a high treatment
capacity in relation to the incoming sewage. It is also important to ensure that flows at sewage
treatment plants are recorded and that the plants themselves are well-maintained. The testing of
sewage seems to have improved and this needs to be encouraged for current and future decision
making.

Poor wastewater management had resulted in councils paying heavy fines to EMA due to their continued pollution
of the environment. While most councils are able to give accurate figures pertaining to water produced and
pumped into the distribution system, the same cannot be said with certainity for wastewater. Most sewage
treatment plants do not have working meters to measure amount of flow. It follows therefore that most of the
figures are based on estimates. This casts doubt on both reliabilty of the figures and accuracy of the data supplied.
Furthermore, there is very little recycling of wastewater being done. This is an area where councils are lossing
huge opportunities for maximising usage of wastewater resources (water, energy and nutrients) including revenue
generation.



Solid Waste Management Indicators

A summary of results on solid waste management is given in the table below. These results show an
appreciable effort by councils although the general impression in the country is that solid waste is not
being properly managed. Littering is now the main challenge which is being worsened by the continual
sprouting of vending sites in most towns. Most councils have invested in the acquisition of refuse

collection equipment, although a lot still needs to be done. However, there is very minimal
recycling/reuse of solid waste materials and lack of scientific refuse disposal systems. Most councils are
still a long way from developing compliant landfills, as prescribed by the Environmental Management
Agency (EMA), as these require appropriate land and huge capital investments. To date, only Norton
and Bulawayo have managed to construct landfills as prescribed by EMA standards. However, it is
encouraging to note that most councils are actually seized with this issue to the extent that more
councils may be having compliant landfills in the not so distant future.

Weight of solid waste has also been largely estimates as most local authorities do not have access to
weighbridges. The challenge might soon be over as councils are beginning to procure self-weighing
refuse trucks, a development that will improve accuracy of data for future peer reviews.

2016 Outlook and Beyond

While we celebrate the achievements made in 2014, there is still a lot to be done with respect to the
following issues identified by Local Authorities:

Development of Master/Strategic Plans

Councils need to seriously consider developing master plans to enable long-term planning for growth
and expansion, taking into consideration population and capacity of council to service that population
effectively. The current mushrooming of peri-urban settlements is, in part, attributed to the absence of
operational master plans. Master plans allow cities to plan for future growth and expansion, thereby
averting the shortage of land for urban expansion.

Increased stakeholder participation and coordination

The underlying argument is that when citizens participate in the governance of their local affairs, the
resulting interventions are sustainable. It is therefore a widely held view that citizen participation in the
decisions that affect them directly, is no-longer an option, but a requirement for every council. To date,
there is no structured way by which citizen participation is encouraged. Despite the absence of a
framework, councils are set to gain much more by involving locals in deciding what is good for them. In
fact, research has shown that citizens who take part in the governance of their councils are more willing
to pay their taxes than those who do not.

Expansion and rehabilitation of infrastructure

This is an area that requires huge capital investments, which at the moment is beyond the reach of
many councils. While foreign direct investments and grants are ideal vehicles for achieving these, local
initiatives have to be sought in order to ensure that councils do not slip back to 2008/2009 cholera
outbreak period.

Improved revenue collection strategies

Councils need to continuously look at sustainable ways of improving revenue generation as well as
tightening financial leakages. The traditional debt collection methods might be out of sync with reality.
More robust and home-grown solutions need to be explored to complement the traditional sources of
revenue for councils.

Reviewing of tariff structures to economic levels

The peer review process has revealed that there is no standard way by which councils arrive at tariffs
for the various services that they provide. Comparative analysis of the tariff schedules for the 32 local
authorities for water indicates that some tariff levels are too high while others are uneconomically too
low. The concept of cost build up to tariff structure is a new phenomenon that councils are beginning to
take on board as a result of the SLB process. There is need for councils to work out a standard tariff
structure which can be shared and applied with consideration of the contextual factors of the particular
local authority.

Establishment of compliant landfills

As indicated under the section on summary of indicators, local authorities might need to come together
and develop a model landfill which they can share with EMA for approval. This approach is prudent
given that there appears to be no standard landfill at EMA. Councils need to take the initiative.

1. Introduction

1.1 Strategic Context
The good performance of local authorities in delivering key services such as water and solid waste
management is key to the success of the government’s economic blueprint – the Zimbabwe Agenda for
Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-ASSET): October 2013 - December 2018. Zim-ASSET
aims to achieve sustainable development and social equity anchored on indigenization, empowerment
and employment creation which will be largely propelled by the judicious exploitation of the country’s
abundant human and natural resources. This Results Based Agenda is built around four strategic clusters
that will enable Zimbabwe to achieve economic growth and reposition the country as one of the
strongest economies in the region and Africa. The four strategic clusters identified are: Food Security
and Nutrition; Social Services and Poverty Eradication; Infrastructure and Utilities and Value Addition
and Beneficiation. The cluster approach enables Government to prioritise its programmes and projects
for implementation with a view to realizing broad results that seek to address the country’s socio-
economic challenges.
To buttress the aforementioned clusters, two sub-clusters were also developed namely Fiscal Reform
Measures and Public Administration, Governance and Performance Management. Zim-ASSET is
designed to address the past policy failures by focussing on strategic areas of development, with
emphasis on internal resources as opposed to external donor support. Preliminary evaluations have
revealed some level of progress on MDG 6, which looks at measures to Combating HIV and AIDS,
Malaria and Other Diseases; and on MDG 2 which looks at achieving Universal Primary Education,
among others. However, achievements in the health sector continued to be adversely affected by
sporadic outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, high maternal mortality, shortage
of funds to procure essential drugs and equipment and to rehabilitate dilapidated infrastructure.
 As for water, sanitation and hygiene, high levels of pollution continued to affect urban drinking water.
The Elnino-induced drought has affected sources of clean water in rural areas such as boreholes,
forcing people to resort to unprotected sources of drinking water. These practices have further exposed
the population to communicable diseases that further strain the already strained health delivery
system.
The utilities and infrastructure sector has also not been spared, as roads, civil aviation and railway
networks across the country have not seen major improvements and modernisation due to shortage of
capital and long term investments. In the urban areas, capacity challenges also affected the efficient
operation of councils resulting in poor water and sewerage reticulation systems. The Zim-ASSET
Infrastructure and Utilities cluster is focused on the rehabilitation of infrastructural assets and recovery
of utility services in Zimbabwe, including water and sanitation infrastructure. The water supply and
sanitation sector outcomes include improved access to water supply and sanitation services to the
people of Zimbabwe, and improved water supplies and wastewater disposal in towns, cities and rural
areas.
Read in conjunction with the Social Services and Poverty Eradication Cluster, the Zim-ASSET document
thrives for improved service delivery by local authorities. In this regard, public infrastructure (sewerage
system, roads, health facilities, waste management, schools and social amenities) need to be
constructed and maintained in all local authorities.



                                                Page 12 of 52
Clearly, the SLB Project perfectly dovetails with the aims and spirit of Zim-ASSET as it tries to improve
service delivery in water supply, wastewater and solid waste management in all the 32 urban local
authorities through strategic planning, monitoring and reporting of service delivery. Similarly, there are
strong linkages with other government initiatives, namely output-based budgeting, performance
appraisals and E-governance. National imperatives now demand that the SLB Project takes a more
holistic and integrative approach that will add value to other initiatives, with the overall objective being
to deliver improved and sustainable water supply and sanitation services. This approach, anchored on
horizontal learning and peer review, will entail revision and strengthening of organizational functioning
and culture, and formulating evidence-based targets at the corporate, unit and individual level. This will
be operationalised by peer-reviewed information systems improvement plans (ISIP) and performance
improvement plans (PIP), both leading to an output-based budgeting system. The response on the
government and donor side will be to revise financial allocation systems to recognize efficiency and
need through an incentivized allocation system.

The WASH sector has undergone a torrid time since the cholera outbreak of 2008/9, and this has
attracted the attention of donors at a time when the capacity of government to financially support the
sector has greatly weakened and the councils’ ability to independent raise funds is declining. However,
there is realisation in the sector that some areas could be reasonably fixed without much capital outlay.
The introduction of the service level benchmarking project in 2012 has greatly opened up the sector and
brought some urgency into the recovery of WASH activities in the 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe. The
accompanying Peer Review process, introduced in 2014, has brought more transparency and openness
in sharing of ideas and experiences amongst the councils.




1.2 Objectives of Service Level Benchmarking
The Goal of SLB Project is to improve service delivery through enhanced performance, transparency and
accountability. With the Zim-ASSET thrust on the performance of local government, councils are
encouraged to examine ways of implementing changes in their practices. Benchmarking provides
councils the most useful options to achieve:
    •      a greater success in understanding and meeting customer needs;
    •      collective establishment of challenging, but realistic goals which relate to strategic council
           needs;
    •      a deeper understanding of performance measures and the development of true measures of
           productivity;
    •      a greater awareness of sector “best practices? and the desire to equal or surpass them;
    •      improved competitiveness.


The specific objectives of the Zimbabwean SLB Peer Review process in urban areas are:

         i.    To support and facilitate improvements in the delivery of water and sanitation services
               (water supply, wastewater management, and solid waste management) in Zimbabwe,
               against agreed national and international standards of performance.
        ii.    To carry out a thorough participatory review of water and sanitation services in urban areas
               and report on the findings.
        iii.   To enable and facilitate the delivery of recommended service improvements/changes in
               partnership with those using and delivering services.


                                                 Page 13 of 52
      iv.    To provide opportunities for sharing/learning good practice and benchmarking services on a
             national basis.
       v.    To provide an opportunity for teams to review progress, innovation, strengths, gaps and
             future needs to improve services.
      vi.    To provide an effective mechanism for council and residents involvement, thus ensuring
             two-way communication.



1.3 SLB Methodology Adopted in Zimbabwe
In order to refresh our minds, and indeed remind ourselves of the SLB roadmap, we decided to once
more give an outline of the SLB methodology that was adopted in Zimbabwe. This approach is also
useful to those who are reading our reports for the first time. The SLB process phases are as follows:

1.3.1 Inception
The SLB project started with an inception workshop which was held in September 2012. The purpose of
the workshop was to refine the methodology and present the draft data collection instruments.


1.3.2 Participatory development of indicators
The draft data collection instruments were presented to town engineers, town treasurers and other
officials from urban local authorities and from the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) at a
workshop held in Kadoma in October 2012. Three questionnaires, on water supply, wastewater
management, and solid waste management, and a reliability assessment framework were presented
and thoroughly analysed. The process of finalising the data collection instruments continued after the
workshop up to the end of November 2012.


1.3.3 Data collection
The data collection took place between January and March 2013. It was carried out by a team
comprising of members from WSP, Zimbabwe Local Government Association (ZILGA), MLGPW&NH,
MEWC, staff and MSc students from the University of Zimbabwe. A capacity building element was
incorporated into the project right from the start when data collection teams were formulated (Fig 1.1).
Data for 2012, on water supply, wastewater and solid waste management, were collected from all the
32 urban local authorities in Zimbabwe.

key partners right from the beginning



                                                   Page 14 of 52
1.3.4 Data analysis, validation and development of benchmarks
The data were compiled in a Microsoft Excel master sheet and results presented to ZILGA forum
meetings, the Infrastructure Technical Reference Group (ITRG),             Australian Embassy, Africa
Development Bank, GIZ and UNICEF. A technical review workshop was held in Kadoma to validate the
data, review data collection tools and set local benchmarks with a horizon of 2018. The most important
outcome of the Kadoma Workshop was the unanimous agreement that from 2014, the benchmarking
exercise would be led by ZILGA teams through a peer review mechanism with financial and technical
support from the World Bank for three years.



1.3.5 Introduction of a peer review mechanism
A number of meetings took place in 2014 before the introduction and roll out of a peer review
mechanism at the end of July 2014. These include a Town Engineers Forum meeting in Mutare in March,
a three-day workshop in Masvingo in May to finalise the data collection handbook and to introduce the
draft peer review mechanism, and Town Clerks Forum meeting in Bulawayo end of May to further
develop the modalities of the peer review mechanism. This was finalised through another Town Clerks
meeting in Kadoma in July, which set up the governance structures and timetable for peer reviews to be
led by Town Clerks. Subsequently, an inaugural peer review meeting was held in Masvingo on 29-30 July
2014. This was followed by the launch of the SLB Peer Review Process by the then Minister of Local
Government, Public Works and National Housing and the Minister of Environment, Water and Climate.

2. Peer Review Process – Setup and Activities for
2015
2.1 Definition
Peer review is the evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of
the work (peers). It constitutes a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the
relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve
performance, and provide credibility. Peer review in urban service level benchmarking can thus be
described as the systematic examination and assessment of the performance of a council/utility by
other councils/utilities. Peer reviews in Zimbabwean local authorities have therefore been designed to
support and facilitate the drive for quality improvement using a process that responds to changes in
national development and priorities.



2.2 Governance Structure
The Peer Review process is carried out through agreed programme implementation structures, as
shown in Fig 2.1. However, the structure is also supported by cooperating partners such as the World
Bank, UNICEF, GIZ, AusAid and AfDB.


                             Sector Policy

2.3.2 Peer Review Visits to Different Towns
The visits to each local authority were organised as shown in Tables 2.2 to 2.5. The visits were generally
organised as follows:

Day 1:                  Most guests would have arrived the previous day and are ready to start on time
         9.00am         Introductions and review of councils’ preparedness in terms of fully completed
                        questionnaires, all supporting documents in place, and a team SWOT Analysis
                        ready for presentation. (Meeting to agree on format of presentation and
                        acceptable forms of data submission – soft or hardcopies)
         9.30am -       Guided field visits to water supply, wastewater and solid waste management
                        installations.
         1.30pm         Lunch provided by Reviewed Council
         2.30pm         Council leadership team make overview presentation. Reviewers’ question time
         3.00pm         Reviewers commence drilling down and observations, review of evidence, and
                        reliability scoring. (Council to provide latest copies of questionnaires and ALL
                        supporting documents)
Day 2:                  The outline structure for the day will be:
         8.00 am        Reviewers continue drilling down and observations, review of evidence, and
                        reliability scoring.
         12.30 pm       Lunch provided by Reviewed Council – reviewers may use this time for
                        confidential discussions
         1.00 pm        Discussions by core team and report writing on findings; planning for feedback
                        session
         4.00 pm        Feedback to the expanded council management led by the Chair of the Peer
                        Review Team (Other members of council management, besides the heads of
                        department can be invited to this session).
         4.20 pm        Questions and answers with the expanded council management
         4.30 pm        Close



In cases where the council was poorly prepared for the peer review visit, the peer review process took
much longer than anticipated. It was important that review teams completed and submitted their
report before departure. The reviewed council was supposed to revise their data as per reviewers’
recommendations and re-submit all documents, including supporting information, overview
presentation, and Performance Improvement Plan, within a week. Failure to comply with this often
hindered the whole process of analysis of results and production of the annual report.

Table 2.2 shows the peer review matrix used for the reviews. Like in the previous year, councils were
paired according to their classification. However, it has been provisionally agreed that in the coming


                                                   Page 20 of 52
year, pairing will be different in that classification of the councils will no longer be a criteria for pairing
councils. Instead, councils will sit in November 2016 to agree on the new method to be used for pairing
local authorities.

The following specific points were noted from Table 3.1:

Property level coverage of direct water supply, %: Results for 2014 recorded an increase in
properties with direct water supply. Although few new connections were done, the increase is
probably a result of improved accuracy of data on properties arising from property surveys and the
introduction of GIS in some councils. As a result of use of these two measures, data reliability has
improved significantly. However, it has been observed that the survey instruments require
improvements to enable capturing of varied data such as condition of the meters at the households.
This becomes economic since there will be recording of multiple services which would ideally require
another survey to be conducted.

Per capita supply of water, L/cap.d: There was a noticeable decrease in per capita supply of water
across councils. Most bulk meters are not working whilst estimates based on pumping records

would be unreliable, considering the state of the infrastructure and the age of the pumps. The
figures on per capita water supply seem to betrayal other indicators on water supply such as
continuity of supply as the majority of councils are still facing serious water shortages. Although the
impact of inclusion of non-domestic consumption would not affect the figure in most councils, this
would present a challenge to some, especially those based on mining and large industries. However,
as most councils are now buying bulk water meters, we expect these figures to reduce to the true
value in the next year or so.

Extent of metering of water connections, %: Results recorded a noticeable decrease which again
could be a result of more reliable and accurate data obtained from the surveys as well as use of GIS
to locate metered properties. Despite the overall decrease registered, there were councils that
invested in new meters. This positive gain could not translate into realisable result because of the
over-estimated figures presented in the previous year. After carrying out property surveys, most
councils presented data on functional meters only, which tended to decrease the value of the
indicator.

Extent of non-revenue water (NRW), %: Results showed a marginal increase in NRW when a
decrease was desirable. The marginal gains could be a result of investments in new meters,
introduction of zonal/district metering and maintenance of water reticulation system. On the other
hand, there was a decrease in the number of functional meters as local authorities struggled to
replace them. The use of Promun software has greatly improved, enabling councils to accurately
determine the amount of water monthly consumption from exception reports.

Meter management is recommended through carrying out physical inspections on the functionality
of meters on a regular basis. Although data on water production shows that there is adequate water
being produced in most Local Authorities, the production figures do not tally with water billed. Such
discrepancies need to be further investigated. Results also show that some councils had suspiciously
very low NRW, which could be due to high estimates of water consumed especially due to lack of
functional meters. Towns with unrealistically low NRW are Chitungwiza, Mvurwi and Chirundu. On
the other hand, Harare, Mutare, Kadoma Redcliff, Rusape and Chiredzi have unrealistically high NRW
figures (Fig 3.1). Individual Local Authorities need to come up with strategies for reduction of NRW
as this is still way above the benchmark. The high non-revenue water partly explains why consumers
do not have continuous water supply despite the very high per capita figures. The high NRW also
constitute a major threat to the viability of local authorities. Further analyses of this indicator were
therefore done.

Figure 3.1. Non-Revenue Water results for 2012-2014 for all 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe

Figure 3.2 shows the NRW figures for 2014 expressed in m3 per hour per kilometre (m3/hr.km). It
reveals the state of decay of infrastructure in councils and shows that Mutare, KweKwe and Rusape
are loosing a lot of water per unit length of their water mains. This could be due to ageing pipes,
types of pipes, poor workmanship, etc. A programme of leak detection and repair would greatly
assist in solving this problem. However, this does not rule out the contribution of non-functional
meters and water thefts.

Figure 3.2. Non-Revenue Water results in m /hr.km for 2014 for all 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe

Another measure of the integrity of pipes is the average number of water pipe bursts per 100 km in
a month as shown in Fig 3.3. The 2012 figures for Mutare, Kadoma, Zvishavane, Gokwe and Chinhoyi
were way too high compared to other towns and cities in Zimbabwe. The figures for 2014 show an
improved situation. In 2014 higher figures were recorded for KweKwe, Masvingo, Beitbridge,
Rusape, Kariba, Chipinge and Shurugwi.

Continuity of water supply, hr/d: Results show that the water supply situation practically remained
constant with water availability averaging 12.3hrs. Very few councils, such as Kwekwe and Bulawayo
indicated 24 hr of water supply. This data is questionable and might need to be further corroborated
by the consumers themselves. In most cases, per capita supply, NRW and continuity of supply figures

are not tallying. The water supply situation is critical for Chitungwiza, Epworth and Norton (which
indicated supplies of just a few hours a day). These towns do not have a water treatment plant of
their own and rely on the City of Harare. The data supplied was largely based on estimates since no
Local Authority has an up to date record of continuous water supply for a particular suburb for a
period of seven days as required by the indicator. This calls for the need for good record-keeping on
the supply situation for different areas in a single council. There is need for councils to carry out
routine inspections of certain strategic points so as to come up with a more realistic figure. For
example, high level ground might not experience the same water flow as low lying areas, thereby
making the figures too general to the extent of giving false impressions about adequacy of water to
consumers.

Figure 3.4. Continuity of Water Supply results for 2014 for all 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe

Quality of water supplied, %: Most councils have shown a marked improvement in carrying out
water tests. Although most towns do not have the requisite equipment for carrying out these tests,
external tests are being done by the Ministry of Health, EMA and other accredited water testing
laboratories. Unlike in the previous reporting periods where water tests tended to be confined to
water treatment plants, results show that the majority of councils are now carrying out the
prescribed tests. However, there is still no standard testing regime to be followed by all local
authorities. Some councils are doing basic tests like jar test and residual chlorine once in every shift,
once per day, whilst in other councils these tests are very erratic. In most cases, bacteriological tests
are not being done or are done haphazardly. There is no pattern for monitoring intermediate and
consumer end points. In view of these observations, councils need to come up with an appropriate
sampling, testing and quality control protocol in order to improve the protection of their water
consumers.

Efficiency in satisfactory response/reaction to customer complaints, %: Most councils indicated
that they have multiple mechanisms by which residents can present their complaints. These
mechanisms include the use of complaints registers, telephone, SMS messaging and WhatsApp, e-
mail among others. Despite these claims, there is no empirical evidence of a complainant feedback
mechanism. It is not possible to establish whether the complaints were addressed within the time
indicated or not because there is no provision for endorsement by the complainant. In light of these
observations, councils need to design a comprehensive complaints register which captures all the

missing details in the current registers. This would ensure that councils have a standard way in which
customer complaints are registered and followed up. This is essential after observing that some
councils have suspiciously too low complaints for a period of a year. Despite these short-comings, in
general, there has been a marked improvement in the way in which councils interface with
residents.

Operating cost recovery in water supply services, %: Results show that there has been an increase
in cost recovery in water supply. This could be a result of councils’ improved financial management
systems and more realistic budgeting. In addition, the justification of tariff build up by councils
improved accountability and transparency in the formulation of budget figures, which might have
enhance the confidence that residents have over their council. However, Mutare and Masvingo
tariffs of over 400% are unrealistically too high and need to be further investigated. On the contrary,
Marondera, Norton, Beitbridge, Redcliff, Karoi, Mvurwi and Gwanda have unrealistically low figures.
High cost recovery figures show that councils are not investing enough in the sector. This is partly
caused by poor revenue collection and by the need to deal with unfunded mandates such as council
schools and clinics.

Figure 3.5. Operating Cost Recovery in Water Supply results for 2012 to 2014 for all 32 urban councils in
Zimbabwe

Efficiency in collection of water supply-related charges, %: The average revenue collection
efficiency decreased marginally from 51.5% in 2012 to 48.1% in 2014. The scope for increase is high
if councils put in place strategies for revenue collection such as pre-paid water meters, water
disconnections, hiring debt collectors, ward-based billing, etc. Worth noting is the supportive
attitude adopted by the parent Ministry to councils’ revenue collection strategies. There is still
concern with councils on very low collections below 20% such as Gweru, Chegutu, Zvishavane and
Shurugwi. However, the issue of separation of arrears from current bills is still a problem. Councils
need to come up with a formula which will address this challenge including consultations with some
organisations that are already practicing this system such as ZESA. Some examples of this practice
are beginning to emerge in Promun software for councils such as Kariba and Ruwa.

  Figure 3.6. Efficiency in Collection of Water Supply-related Charges results for 2012 to 2014 for all 32 urban
  councils in Zimbabwe

  Maintenance Coverage ratio, %: The results show that only 2.5% was used for maintenance-related
  expenses out of all the expenses incurred in water supply. This is still very low when compared to
  the target benchmark of 20%. It has been recommended that councils keep separate votes for
  maintenance and for repairs. In addition, a well costed maintenance plan is required for each
  council. Most Local Authorities do not have maintenance plans and they are failing to separate
  maintenance costs from repair costs. Councils need to embrace this practice as it is the hallmark of
  good asset management.

  The following points were noted:

  Coverage of toilets, %: Results show a marginal increase in coverage of toilets. There are areas
  where to some extent open defecation is still being practiced. Cases in point include one high
  density suburb in Victoria Falls which has no toilets for many years. In most councils, however,
  coverage of toilets has greatly improved. Again, reliability and accuracy of data in this area has been
  enhanced through surveys and GIS applications.

  Coverage of sewerage network services, %: There is noticeable improvement although data
  reliability is still questionable. As has been observed on data for coverage of toilets, there are
  properties that are still to be connected to the network. Results also indicate that some properties in
  high density suburbs are still dependent on septic tanks. Similarly, new properties have been
  occupied without sewer connections, although councils argue that council by-laws require that such
  properties are connected prior to occupation. This may point to poor enforcement of by-laws by
  councils resulting in neglecting their development control responsibility. Another problem is the
  proliferation of new housing schemes without due regard to the treatment of sewage produced in
  these new schemes.

  Efficiency in collection of sewage, %: There has been a marked improvement in this area as a result
  of investments by AFDB, GIZ, UNICEF, WB and PSIP. However, measuring the actual flow still remains
  a challenge in almost all councils. Also critical is the issue of adequate treatment of the sewage
  collected. An average figure above 100% obviously shows that councils are over estimating amount
  of flow. In the absence of flow meters, there can be reasonable estimation of the amount of flow but
  there is no standard way by which this is done across councils. It is therefore suggested that councils
  carry out 24-hour flow measurement campaigns lasting seven days each in the dray and the wet
  seasons. This should be very easy to implement since councils have engineers and the plans are
  manned for most of the time. Councils are also urged to assess their opwn figures and investigate
  when they do not make practical sense rather than wait for the reviewers to tell them so.

Figure 3.7. Efficiency in Collection of Sewage comparative analysis results for 2012 to 2014 for all 32 urban
councils in Zimbabwe

Adequacy of capacity for treatment of sewage, %: There is need to get accurate figures on inflows
so that we get more reliable data. The data on water produced and distributed into the system does
not tally with data on sewage collected at the treatment works. There is need for engineers to have
a standard way of estimating sewage flows that guide local authorities. Councils such as Marondera,
Epworth and Hwange need to give more attention to the treatment capacity of their plants. Some
councils reporting higher adequacy figures might be painting a wrong picture as they are not
collecting enough sewage or are underestimating the inflows. We also note that there is need to
account for wastewater collected in septic tanks, and therefore does not reach sewage treatment
plants. There is therefore a need for methodological uniformity so that the figures show similar
interpretation. Although rehabilitation projects could have improved the functional capacity of the
plants, not much change was expected as there were no new constructions.

Quality of sewage treatment, %: Most councils are not carrying out wastewater quality testing.
Sewage treatment is mostly by natural treatment methods such as waste stabilisation ponds. Larger
towns and cities have trickling filters and activated sludge plants In the absence of sewage testing,
the quality of sewage is compromised and cannot be supported by scientific evidence. This has result
in councils continuously polluting the environment and river bodies, attracting punitive fines from
EMA.

Extent of recycling or reuse of sewage, %: There has been little improvement on this indicator as
this requires capital works for rehabilitation or new constructions. There is a need to raise
awareness of new farmers on the benefits of using sewage treatment plant effluent for crop/pasture
irrigation so that councils can have somewhere to divert effluent to.

Efficiency in satisfactory response/reaction to customer complaints, %: There is now some
improvement as discussed for water supply. Councils need to improve the recording and tracking of
complaints.

Efficiency of cost recovery in sewage management, %: The reliability score is not reflective of the
actual performance of the indicator. Although not much sewage is reaching the treatment plants
and undergoing treatment, councils continued to bill residents but not financing rehabilitation and
maintenance of the ageing infrastructure. The Marondera, Chipinge and Gokwe data are suspiciously
low and require further investigation. On the other hand, Mutare, Kadoma, KweKwe and Plumtree
posted very high figures, possibly reflective of under-expenditure in the sector. However the
indicator is still above the agreed benchmark.

Figure 3.8. Efficiency in Cost Recovery in Sewage Management comparative analysis results for 2012 to 2014
for all 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe

Efficiency in collection of sewage charges, %: There is an improvement in performance but this
could be due to revenue allocation system being used by councils whereby they allocate money
received to some areas, leaving out water charges. This enables councils to disconnect water in case
of arrears. There does not appear to be a rational method for charging for sewage costs with
councils currently using fixed rates for billing sewage. There is need to relook at tariff setting for
sewer.

Maintenance Coverage ratio, %: There is considerable progress arising from interventions by
development partners in the rehabilitation of sewerage infrastructure. Sewage is no longer on the
streets. Most sewage ponds are operational although below capacity and they require rehabilitation
and maintenance. Most Local Authorities are not adhering to their maintenance schedules.

Coverage of SWM services through kerbside collection of waste, %: There is some significant
improvement on the indicator with most councils buying refuse collection equipment. Challenges
still remain in new housing developments, especially those with no roads.

Efficiency of collection of municipal solid waste, %: There is a sustained improvement (Fig 3.7)
which is very encouraging. The accounting for collected loads remains vague in the absence of
studies on refuse generation per person per day and absence of weighbridges. However, we have
noted that some councils have acquired refuse vehicles that have self-weighing capabilities. Most
councils reported more frequent collections of solid waste collection for industrial, commercial and
domestic. In most councils, commercial waste is collected daily while domestic waste is collected
once a week.

Figure 3.9. Efficiency in Collection of Municipal Solid Waste comparative results for 2012 to 2014 for all 32
urban councils in Zimbabwe

Extent of recovery of municipal solid waste collected, %: Very little recycling of sewage is taking
place in councils as reflected in the 2014. Some examples of recovery from Bulawayo and Karoi have
been noted for dissemination to other councils, although these are at a very small scale. This has the
effect of shortening the life span of the dumpsites as they quickly fill up. Little examples available
show a huge potential for waste recycling if councils take deliberate actions in support of current
waste scavengers.

Extent of scientific disposal of waste at landfill sites, %: No change was recorded. Councils are at
different stages of planning for compliant landfills in accordance with EMA regulations. However, a
demonstration is required and Norton Town Council has recently constructed one which will
hopefully be used as a model for other councils. It is recommended that councils seek donor funds
for the construction of pilot scientific landfills as funds for the construction of such landfills will
remain a constraint in the short-term.

Efficiency in satisfactory response/reaction to customer complaints, %: Change negligible. Councils
need to come up with a better method of registering complaints as well as ensuring endorsement of
their resolution. The current registers require review.

Efficiency of cost recovery in SWM services, %: The cost recovery aspect improved substantially
probably due to raised tariffs which in turn effected the collection efficiency if councils (Fig 3.10). On
the other hand, poor expenditure levels could have contributed to the increase in the indicator. The
change in this indicator therefore needs to be considered with utmost care. Councils with unusually
high cost recovery levels are Chinhoyi, Marondera, Norton, Rusape, Chiredzi, Gwanda, Karoi and
Plumtree. The ones that are underperforming on this indicator are Chipinge, Gokwe and Mvurwi.

Figure 3.10. Efficiency in Cost Recovery in Municipal Solid Waste Management comparative analysis results for
2012 to 2014 for all 32 urban councils in Zimbabwe

Efficiency in collection of SWM charges, %: Collection efficiency went down substantially (Fig 3.11).
This poses a serious threat to the sustainability of service delivery. The reasons for this have already
been discussed. One would naturally expect councils doing badly in cost recovery to have poor
collection efficiency but this was not necessarily the case. The general levels of collection efficiency
warranty intervention at national level toavoid the collapse of some councils.

Coverage of receptacles, %: The issue of a standard receptacle was referred to individual
local authorities in recognition of stipulations in their respective by-laws. The reported
fluctuations are attributed to the understanding of what constitutes an acceptable
receptacle. Littering remains a challenge that councils and EMA need to tackle from
behavioural perspective. There is need for change of attitudes of residents, perhaps through
vigorous community awareness campaigns.



3.1.4 Summary of 2014 Indicators
Table 3.4 gives a summary of all indicators for the 2014 data. These indicators were affected by
some councils which did not submit complete information. In some cases wrong data passed
through the peer review process unnoticed. There is need for especially Engineers, Treasurers and
Health Officers to pay very close attention to detail during the review process in order to improve
the quality of data. It is normally expected that a member of the SLB Team, chair of the review
panel, and the Town Clerk/Secretary of the visited council demonstrate responsibility for all
collected data.

3.2 Availability and Reliability of Data
Most councils, regardless of size, are still struggling to collect and maintain quality data. It is still
difficult to get basic data on infrastructure such as the length of water/sewer reticulation systems,
capacity of water and wastewater treatment plants, and so forth. This situation is exacerbated by
the lack of measuring instruments such as flow meters, resulting in estimates which, in most cases
are over-estimated.

Team work among council officials has notably improved. This has, to some extent, enhanced the
availability of data and its reliability. However, ordinary accounting data which should be readily
available from computers and audit reports were sometimes difficult to get. The general impression
is that there is a disconnect between those who generate the data and those who are supposed to
manage the data. It is strongly recommended that councils develop Information Systems
Improvement Plan (ISIP) and Performance Improvement Plans (PIP) with clear annual targets which
should be religiously adhered to.

At least, five councils provided complete data for the year under review. Overall, data supply
improved from 80.5% in 2012, 82.3% in 2013, and 90.9% in 2014. There is now a general
appreciation of the SLB process which is attributed to the continuous training and general
monitoring has improved.

Table 3.5 shows the level of availability of data for 2012, 2013 and 2014. Councils that are still
struggling to provide enough data are Gwanda, Karoi, KweKwe, Hwange and Mvurwi, in that order.
What is most worrying is that some of these councils have previously fared well in data submission.
On the contrary, councils like Lupane have greatly improved in their data generation.

The reliability of data remained a concern throughout the Peer Review exercise (Table 3.5). To
improve the quality of data collected, a template was developed to collect evidence against
benchmarks. This helped to some extent but there is still a need for proper systems to collect and
manage data efficiently in councils. The reviewers were generally insisting on data that was
presented with proper proof as required in the Supporting Information Template.

In some instances, reviews were delayed in order to get the required evidence. Supporting evidence
is the cornerstone of the peer review process as it represents the only way that reviewers can verify
the authenticity of submitted data . City of Bulawayo had the most reliable data, with an overall
average score of 1.7. The average reliability for all councils was 3.0. This shows no change from the
previous year. Reliability is high in cities; Harare (1.8), Bulawayo (1.7) and Kadoma (1.9). Councils
which greatly need to improve on data reliability include Kwekwe (4.0) and Shurugwi (4.0)

3.3 Performance Ranking of Councils
A performance ranking methodology is still being developed. This methodology will be used to
scientifically assess individual local authority performance against agreed performance scores. It is
anticipated that the tool will be ready in time for the Local Government Investment Conference
(LOGIC) in September 2016.

3.4 Key Challenges Faced by Councils
The Peer Review Teams were tasked to analyse and come up with a list of key challenges facing each
council. However, the ddefinition of key challenges was not well understood among reviewers, as
reflected in their reports. Despite the different definitions of this term, reviewers need to agree on
what they are reporting as key challenges. The main key challenges identified are (i) lack of scientific
disposal of solid waste, (ii) faulty water meters and (iii) inadequate infrastructure.

                                     Inadequate raw water
                                      Wild animals menace
                                    Absence of master plan
       Inability to separate arrears from current charges
 Poor maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure
                                             Power outages
                       Ownership of water infrastructure
                         Lack of land for urban expansion
                                                      Staffing
                              Inadequate computerisation
                               Vandalism of infrastructure
                                         Illegal settlements
                    Non-functional sewer treatment plant
                                      Ageing infrastructure
             Lack of feedback mechanisms on complaints
                             Lack of maintenance budgets
                                     High operational costs
                               Unsustainable water tariffs
                                    Low revenue collection
                                   High non-revenue water
                                   Environmental Pollution
                                    Non collection of waste
                                 Inadequate infrastructure
                                       Faulty water meters
                                    Non-compliant landfills
                                                                 0         5         10         15        20         25   30

3.5 Best Practices
The term best practice is not well understood by most local authorities. For instance, a local
authority mandate cannot be reported as a best practice. Simply put, a best practice is a method or
technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and
that is used as a benchmark.

This is another term that has caused much disagreement and interpretations among reviewers. In
the majority of cases, what are depicted as best practices are in fact things that the council is
expected to do by legislation. However, there is some agreement that a best practice has to be an
innovation, something that a council has invented and has proved helpful which others can replicate.
A best practice should have a measure of efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources. It
remains a subject of much contestation. There has been instances where councils tend to stage
manage best practices.

The following practices (Fig 3.13) where viewed as befitting to be acknowledged as best practices;

    1.    Build Operate and Transfer (BOT)
    2.    Customer Call Centres

3.6 Emerging Issues
An emerging issue is something we have not thought about or it's something we already know, but is
changing. In view of this definition, the following issues (Fig 3.14) were accepted as appropriate to
be pointed out as such.

3.7 Key Recommendations by Peer Reviewers
Fig 3.15 summarises the key recommendations given to various local authorities. These include the
need to ensure that LAs have compliant landfills; increased efficiency and cost effectiveness of O&M
costs; increased infrastructure capacity; and increased coverage of water and sewer metering.
Improvement of revenue collection still remains a central issue to be addressed by all councils.

3.8 Performance Improvement Plans
Most councils had varying difficulties in developing PIPs. From the assessment of the PIPs received,
there is need for training for all local authorities. The following are the comments given by reviewers

3.9 Capacity Issues
There is a general lack of understanding of what is meant by capacity issues. It should be noted that
these capacity issues should be related to the provision of the three services and not for the entire
council operations. Fig 3.17 summarises some of the capacity issues that came out from the 2014
reports. As can be observed, most councils are yet to install GIS systems. This is followed by financial
management and ICT capacity. Clearly, these are issues requiring urgent attention by councils.

3.10 Status of Assets
Fig 3.18 shows the frequency of mention of assets condition. Although most of the assets are in
reasonably good condition compared to previous years, there is need to qualify what is exactly
meant by each description. There might be need for using the Lickett scale to establish the actual
weighting for each response

4. Lessons Learnt and Way Forward


4.1 Lessons Learnt
4.1.1 Process and Organisation
The 2015 SLB process was better organised than in previous years. A number of the teething
problems that the process was facing had been resolved. Adequate time was given to the review
process and submission of data had significantly improved. The Chairing of the review process and
report writing after the review also improved greatly. We therefore adjusted the process a number
of times, even before the peer review visits started. One major issue was balancing the length of the
visits, considering the limited resources and the quality of the expected product. In future, two full
days would be required to ensure that reviewers do a thorough job and come out with a well written
report before they leave the town of review. More time, however, will be required for big cities like
Harare and Bulawayo.

The role of the panel chair was sometimes compromised as some chairs did not understand what
was expected of them. As most communication was by email, it was evident afterwards that not
everyone had access to internet. As a result, a lot of vital information and communications were lost.
In some cases, the review panels arrived without ever seeing the documents of the reviewed
council.

Councils are at different stages of development, especially in terms of ICT. This had a bearing on the
mode of presentation and the pace of the review discussions. Electronic copies were always
required for verifying the data against checking figures. The effect of any changes in figures can only
be captured if an electronic copy is being used.

Some councils tempered with checking figures and formulae, despite being warned not to do so.
This defeated the whole purpose of checking and verifying the data. Next time all cells with formulas
will be locked from editing.

A number of organisational challenges were faced. These include late withdrawal from panel visits
and complaints on levels of subsistence allowances. The World Bank system cannot cater for last
minute changes and councils will have to foot the whole bill for such changes. In case of changes by
the Town Clerk/Secretary, they have to find a suitable replacement (another Town Clerk/Secretary)
and notify the Chairperson of the PRCC. All councils are given the timetable for review visits and it is
essential that the HODs know in advance where they will be travelling to. Review panels should be
finalised two weeks before the visits to allow enough time for administrative procedures of the
World Bank. Regarding allowances, local authorities were free to top on the standard World Bank
rate, if their system allows it.

There was evidence of lack of communication of the SLB process among departments in some
councils and this was seen through disparities in the data provided by engineering, solid waste
management, and accounting departments.




                                              Page 45 of 52
4.1.2 Understanding of Questionnaires
It was wrongly assumed that members of the SLB Team who had visited several councils in 2013
were now familiar with the questionnaires. This was a costly assumption as sometimes the data that
were obtained were of poor quality. The Review Teams were not able to detect mistakes in the data
in the field. The checking figures and formulas had been tempered with and questionnaires were
returned with data elements still missing. In fact, there was hardly any follow up on the data after
the visits. This resulted in only about 82% of the data being gathered. The following issues need to
be considered, going forward:

       Training for the SLB core teams - Ministries, UCAZ and ZINWA should have specific people to
        work on the SLB Project who will go for a serious training on the questionnaires and how
        they are completed and verified.
       The Chairperson of the Review Team should remain responsible for collecting and
        submitting all revised documents after review. These documents are the questionnaires,
        SWOT Analysis, supporting information template, and overview presentation.



4.1.3 Documentation
Some councils were failing to provide relevant documentation whilst others were providing too
much documentation. The Supporting Information Template is the minimum of what is required. It
was always very difficult to get this template filled out in full. The template tries to standardise the
data so that it is easier to import into one database. The SWOT analysis was also on a template with
clear instructions on what to do. However, some councils were still developing their own
models/templates, which posed problems in compilation.

The completion of questionnaires remained a problem, even in some cities. The data in the
questionnaire is linked and it is easier to work as a team when completing these questionnaires. It
was expected that the Town Clerk/Secretary would check the questionnaires for correctness and
completeness before submission. This did not happen in many councils and at times departments
were submitting their data separately.

There was supposed to be a link between the questionnaires and the supporting evidence provided.
This was always a problem.

As summary of some of the key lessons worth noting were;

4.1.4 Citizen Engagement:


Since the start of the peer reviews some three years ago, there has been noticeable
improvement in the way that local authorities are engaging their respective committees.
There is evidence of greater community involvement through the sprouting of health clubs
in most of the local authorities to manage solid waste and recycling of solid waste.




                                              Page 46 of 52
4.1.5. Private/Public Partnerships:


The SLB project has increased opportunities to engage the private sector in the provision of
improved services. Cases in point include the bio-gas project in Harare City Council, Chinhoyi
Municipality/Delta Ltd recycling of bottles, pre-paid meter installations in Shurugwi, just but
to mention a few examples.


4.1.6. Participation by Chairpersons of Peer Review Teams


There has been       noticeable improvement in the attendance by TCs/Secretaries as
chairperson of peer reviews, although there is room for further improvement. Similarly,
there was evidence of familiarity with the peer review process, including the overall
coordination of the entire process. This has resulted in improved time management and
production of quality reports although there is need to continuously orient them on the
process.


4.1.7. Coordination and organization of the peer review process


Admittedly, the handover of the SLB process from World Bank to UCAZ has had its own
teething problem. Lack of clear delineation of roles sometimes resulted in duplication or in
other cases failure to invite appropriate reviewers prior to the review dates. This led to
delays in starting some reviews,      although these challenges were largely overcome. The
need to streamline the coordination and organization of the SLB process requires further
scrutiny with a view to improving the entire process so that peer review processes are not
unnecessarily delayed.


4.1.8. Participation at Peer Reviews for Local Boards


Peer reviewing Local Boards has not been as smooth as was expected. There were serious
attendance challenges in Epworth and Ruwa where distress calls were raised due to poor
attendance to the reviews. The situation had to be salvaged by having reviewers being
summoned from neighboring councils. In addition, there appears to be lack of interest
among some local authorities reviewing certain local authorities, a situation that requires to




                                          Page 47 of 52
be attended to immediately because such attitudes my lead to lack of interest and
commitment in the process by the affected local authorities.


4.1.9. Performance Improvement Plans


There has been some improvement in the current performance improvement plans in terms
of presentation. However, this remains something that the PRCC had long noted and has
planned to conduct a training workshop in order to address the identified gaps. The issues
that are still nagging most councils relate to clear articulation of the works to be done,
expected implementation time for each activity, the activity budgeted and source of
funding. In addition, current PIPs are not drawn from previous PIP thus delinking the two
processes, making the previous PIP irrelevant.


4.1.10. Participation by Town Mayors/Chairpersons:


The project has noted participation by Mayors/Chairpersons throughout the process. This


4.1.11. Best Practices – Engaging communities in Public Works:


Bindura Municipality with the help of the community managed to rehabilitate the sewer
system. The strategy created employment and ownership by the community, it also saved
quiet a substantial amount of the council’s revenue.

4.1.12. What really is the gap under the SLB Project?


While the project is assisting Local Authorities to get to know their actual data , gaps across
all departments and solutions identified. The project still needs to assist LAs to come up
with actual costs to address these solutions.


4.2 Way forward
4.2.1 Format of Visits in 2016
In 2016, the visits to councils will be in two parts to ensure that data quality is greatly improved. All
LAs will be required to submit their completed questionnaires well in advance to enable analysis of
data completeness. These will be availed to the reviewers before the reviewers so that they are
familiar with the data submitted before the visit. After the data is in place, the Peer Review teams
will visit and validate the data and complete reliability scoring. This arrangement is expected to add



                                              Page 48 of 52
value to the reviews and reduce the amount of time spent during the actual review. The proposed
schedules for the visits will be sent out to all local authorities in January 2015.



4.2.2 Planned Activities and Meetings
The 2016 work plan outlines what is required to be done for the entire year. The PRCC will ensure
that the timelines are strictly adhered to.

4.2.4 Look and Learn Visits
Look and Learn visits are part of the first day of the peer review visits. One external visit is planned
and detailed plans with be discussed with the World Bank in January 2016.



4.2.5 Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)
PIPs formed part of the reports for 2015 review reports. All Local Authorities management to submit
what they felt were pressing needs which required further attention in 2016. These were analysed
and the frequency of issues are presented in the table below.

There was general observation that most councils did not fully comprehend the concept of PIPs. This
resulted in submissions that are below standard. For example, most of the PIPs are not linked to
budgets. Some councils had not fully comprehended the concept of PIPs. There is need for more
effort to be put in the development of PIPs. There is need to review the structure of the PIP reports
in order to incorporate such plans into the council budget. The Ministry of Local Government, Public
Works and National Housing could play an important role by compelling Local Authorities to ensure
that issues raised in the PIPs are factored into their budget.



4.2.6 Handbooks and Documentation
The Peer Review Handbook and the Peer Review reports are currently being edited and packaged for
printing and distribution to stakeholders.

5.0 Conclusion

The 2014 peer review results provided valuable lessons to the councils. While progress towards
achievement of benchmarks is gradual, as was expected, however, there were many achievements.
First, reviewers were more aware of the learning objective of the review. As a result, availability of
data greatly improved as there was no longer hidden suspicions. Second, data quality was much
improved than before. Third, completeness of data and questionnaires also improved greatly. Forth,
the general coordination and management of the entire peer review process was commendable as
compared to the previous period. Last, council leadership at both technical and political levels have
embraced SLB to the extent that sustainability of the project is no longer in doubt. Clearly, councils
have demonstrated ownership and commitment to the process, one such commitment is reflected
in the willingness of councils to co-fund some of the costs from own resources and assigning senior
council staff to the peer reviews. The opportunity costs cannot be understated.

We continue to look forward to even greater performance in 2016 and an even more committed
teams to propel the project to greater heights.

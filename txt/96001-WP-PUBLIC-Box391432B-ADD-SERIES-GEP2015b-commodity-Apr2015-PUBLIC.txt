Notes: Comovement is defined as the proportion of prices that move in the same direction in a particular month, averaged over the 12-month period
before the end of the crash. It is bounded between zero and 100, zero implying that half of the price movements are up and half down and 100 imply-
ing that all prices move in the same direction, either up or down. Coefficient of variation is the standard deviation of prices (levels) divided by the
mean. Definitions of correlation between oil prices with equities and exchange rates and volatility of oil prices can be found in the box.

T  he decline in commodity prices that began with metals
and agriculture four years ago‚Äîjoined by crude oil in mid-
2014‚Äîcontinued in 2015Q1. Increasing supplies, bumper
harvests, weak demand and a stronger U.S. dollar contributed
to the declines. The weakness is expected to continue for the
rest of the year with all key price indices registering declines
in 2015 before recovering moderately in 2016. This issue‚Äôs
Special Focus section examines the four episodes of oil price
crashes since 1970 and Ô¨Ånds that the 2014-15 and 1985-86
crashes were driven mostly by supply related factors, while
the other two were associated with the First Gulf War and
2008 Ô¨Ånancial crises, respectively.

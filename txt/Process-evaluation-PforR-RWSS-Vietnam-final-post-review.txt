       Executive Summary
The Program for Results-based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under the National Target
Program (PforR) was designed to support Phase 3 of the National Target Program (NTP3) for Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation in Vietnam. The NTP3 is implemented between 2012 to 2015, and the
PforR approach supports NTP3 activities eight geographically-clustered provinces of the Red River
Delta: Phu Tho, Quang Ninh, Ha Noi, Hung Yen, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc, and Thanh Hoa.

The overall aim of the NTP3 is to significantly improve the sustainability of water systems and the
quality of the water produced, and to push the sanitation agenda, making institutional changes to
enhance delivery of software support for sanitation promotion and hygiene education. Under the
PforR a new approach for the NTP will be tested through the introduction of results-based planning
and financing and by strengthening the institutional mechanisms related to governance,
procurement, financial management and environmental and social management systems. The PforR
aims to progressively transform the NTP into a more focused and efficient system for delivering
sustainable investments. Namely, it seeks to address the weaknesses identified in the NTP by
shifting the incentive structure of the program from one based on inputs (financial resources) and
activities (design and construction of water schemes) to one based on outputs (water connections,
toilets constructed) and outcomes (coverage and sustainability of clean water / hygienic sanitation).

Under the PforR, program results are tracked and verified through an annual independent
verification exercise. To understand not just whether, but how, outputs were achieved and the
degree to which those results can be attributed to the PforR itself, a process evaluation was
designed to document and critically describe the process and mechanisms used to achieve the
results, and the extent to which the approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the NTP. The
evaluation measures program outcomes and effectiveness vis-à-vis the traditional NTP approach
using a mixed-methods approach, and through a combination of qualitative and quantitative
research tools.

The objective of the process evaluation is to provide timely insights and recommendations to the
World Bank and the GoV to inform implementation of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under
NTP3 and future implementation of rural water supply and sanitation under the Rural Development
NTP. It also seeks to assess how well the PforR instrument meets its stated objectives of
incentivizing results and strengthening country institutions. A secondary objective is to understand
what aspects of the program may be amenable to design variations and impact evaluation at a later
date.

In the first two years of operation program-wide results are considered acceptable. In 2013 96
percent of the target for household sanitation was met and 70 percent of the target for commune-
wide sanitation was met. The targets for sanitation, both individual household sanitation and
commune-wide sanitation, were met or exceeded in 2014, while targets for water supply
connections were partially achieved (65%). In both years the targets for program planning and
reporting were fully achieved. Additional resources under the PforR have provided a significant
boost to implementation of NTP3, especially for sanitation – its budget has doubled or tripled that
in non-PforR comparison provinces. Increased investment along with increased rigor of monitoring,
reporting, and independent verification have improved the accuracy of information systems, and led
to better results.

The program is contributing to high levels of service for rural households, with disbursement linked
indicators tied to quality, quantity and continuity of water and quality of sanitation. While it is too
soon to assess whether the program is improving the sustainability of rural water supply and
                                                                                                      8
sanitation investments, beneficiaries are quickly adapting to having piped water and report
consuming large quantities, despite having alternative safe water sources. However, where it is free
and available, households still prefer to use other sources of safe water for drinking and cooking
purposes and just one-fifth of households exclusively use piped water for domestic purposes. The
evidence suggests that implementing agencies have not placed much emphasis on changing these
behaviors to shift demand towards piped water, which could harm cost recovery efforts and longer
term sustainability.

Demand for hygienic sanitation in the Red River Delta is high, with a strong preference for
bathroom facilities, as opposed to separate latrine facilities. These preferences lead to high
expenditures on average for hygienic sanitation (predominately pour-flush septic). Only a small
proportion of households received a subsidy or purchased their toilet using a loan – the vast
majority used savings or other income. As the sanitation targets get more ambitious over the
program period, and the PforR penetrates more deeply into areas where a higher number of poor
and ethnic minorities live, affordability may become a challenge. The PforR will need to adapt the
approach to serve a less populous population with fewer resources.

The provinces have faced challenges meeting the targets for water supply, stemming from system
over-design, high unit costs, low levels of counterpart funding and a low procurement bid savings.
There are indications that the targets may not be met and that key objectives of cost-efficiency and
sustainability may be in jeopardy if the program fails to adapt. The program also highlights some of
the institutional and behavioural bottlenecks to keeping school toilets clean and operational. Greater
emphasis on measures of sustainability of school sanitation were introduced during restructuring
that allow for a new disbursement linked indicator tied to school sanitation that is still hygienic 2
years after the initial verification. This issue also demonstrates the behavioural complexities of
setting output based targets that may not appropriately align incentives.

There are institutional and behavioural challenges to adopting the PforR approach that are
informative for other countries considering PforR. Most notable is the perception among
stakeholders that the PforR is an output-based investment project, as opposed to a results-based
budget support program. This perception has contributed to low levels of counterpart funding and
artificial separation between NTP and PforR investments. Poor program planning and budgeting
are further exacerbated by the lack of familiarity with the PforR approach.

Additional findings, which have particular relevance for other countries considering PforR are
summarized in Table 1 below.

Road Map of Report

The report has three main objectives. First, it describes key findings based on desk review and field
visits to the eight provinces of the impact of the program on water supply and sanitation targets and
results, and the effectiveness of the program in strengthening country institutions. Second, the
report outlines findings at the household level for beneficiaries of the program. Based on these
findings the report outlines a set of factors that facilitated success or posed barriers to the overall
PforR objectives. In doing so, the report highlights recommendations for design variations of the
PforR more broadly and NTP in particular, that would be amenable to impact evaluation in the
future. In the final section the report concludes with a summary of key findings.

       I.       Introduction
The Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) estimates that around 75
percent of the rural population of Vietnam has access to improved water 1 , however access to
‘clean’ water, defined by national potable water quality standards, is estimated to be only 35
percent.2 Water quality in Vietnam is compromised by pesticide and fertilizer pollution as well as
fecal contamination, especially where shallow groundwater is used. There is also a significant risk
of contamination with iron and arsenic in deeper groundwater sources in the two major river deltas,
the Mekong and Red River.

Access to hygienic and properly maintained sanitation is estimated to be 51 percent in rural areas.
Many of those that remain unserved lack the financial resources to afford hygienic latrines. Over
the past decade access to improved household sanitation has been accelerated through lending for
domestic sanitation through the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP).

The Government of Vietnam (GoV) has been proactive in responding to the challenge of increasing
access to and ensuring the quality and sustainability of rural water supply and sanitation services.
The National Target Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NTP) i s the GoV’s primary
instrument to achieve the objectives of its National Strategy for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
(RWSS) and the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target 7 for water and sanitation.

However, several weaknesses have been identified with the NTP, including: (i) insufficient
attention to household and institutional sanitation; (ii) lack of financial sustainability of water
supply systems; (iii) weaknesses in the expenditure framework; (iv) spreading investment resources
thin; (v) system inefficiencies; and (vi) governance weaknesses (see Table 1 below for details).

These challenges were the main drivers of the GoV decision to pursue a targeted, results-based
approach to rural water supply and sanitation under the new phase of the National Target Program.
The Program for Results-based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (hereafter PforR) under the
National Target Program supports Phase 3 of the National Target Program (NTP3) to be
implemented from 2012 to 2015 in eight geographically-clustered provinces: Phu Tho, Quang
Ninh, Ha Noi, Hung Yen, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc, and Thanh Hoa. The NTP3 aims to
significantly improve the sustainability of water systems and the quality of the water produced, as
well as push the sanitation agenda and make institutional changes that will enhance delivery of
software support for sanitation promotion and hygiene education. In these provinces, and in
response to the challenges outlined above, and detailed in Table 1, a new approach for NTP3 will
be tested through the introduction of results-based planning and financing and by strengthening the
institutional mechanisms related to governance, procurement, financial management and
environmental and social management systems. The PforR aims to progressively transform the
NTP into a more focused and efficient system for delivering sustainable investments.

The PforR focuses on (i) expanding water supply services; (ii) expanding household and
institutional sanitation; and (iii) strengthening institutions, including improved planning,
monitoring and evaluation. Each of these is tied to a Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLI).

    The PforR focuses on (i) expanding water supply services; (ii) expanding household and
    institutional sanitation; and (iii) strengthening institutions, including improved planning,
    monitoring and evaluation. In particular, the Program aims to provide and will measure
    achievement of the following results:


       (i) 130,000 new toilets constructed over the project period
       (ii) 340,000 new working water supply connections
       (iii)1,275,000 people benefit from commune-wide sanitation, defined as 0% open defecation (at
            least 70% improved); 100% of institutions (schools, commune health centers) have access
            to sanitation and water supply
       (iv) 850,000 additional people have working water supply connections that are sustainable

    Disbursement of the loan under the PforR is tied to independent verification of these results,
    derived from the results framework and defined as Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs).

    Objective of the evaluation

    The objective of the process evaluation is to provide timely insights and recommendations to the
    World Bank and the GoV to inform implementation of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under
    NTP3 and future implementation under the Rural Development NTP. It will do this by
    documenting the process of implementation of the PforR and gathering evidence on the
    effectiveness of the approach in addressing the weaknesses identified in the NTP (Table 1).
    Effectiveness of the program in achieving the intended results and stated goals will also be
    measured and assessed. A secondary objective is to understand what aspects of the program may be
    amenable to design variations and impact evaluation at a later date.


    Research Questions and Study Approach

    The unique structure of the PforR in the Red River Delta posed several limitations to use of a
    rigorous impact evaluation design. As the project would be a learning process for both the World
    Bank and the Client, since it was both the first PforR in the East Asia and Pacific Region, and the
    first in the Water and Sanitation sector, stakeholders convened for an Impact Evaluation Workshop
    in Hanoi in December 2013 decided to pursue an in-depth process evaluation rather than an impact
    evaluation.
                                                                                                                              13
The process evaluation was designed around several key research and learning questions, motivated
by a need to understand the Program’s effectiveness in addressing weaknesses in the NTP. These
include:

(1) How does the PforR compare with standard NTP3 along the following dimensions:
      a. Cost-efficiency of design and construction of water supply systems
      b. Sustainability of water supply systems4
      c. Financial and operational focus on sanitation
      d. Provincial planning processes
      e. Governance, transparency and accountability mechanisms

To further explore and document key innovations of the PforR, the following questions were
addressed in PforR provinces only:

(2) What are the incentive structures and dynamics for different types and levels of stakeholders
    and how do these facilitate or hinder achievement of targets?

(3) How effective are the NTP monitoring system and verification procedures for enhancing
    capacity for and improving the quality (accuracy, completeness, frequency) of routine
    monitoring data

Finally, to understand the effect of the program on beneficiaries the evaluation looked at the
effectiveness of the PforR in increasing coverage of piped water and household hygienic sanitation,
using the most rigorous method possible. At the household level, the evaluation gathered
beneficiary feedback on water and sanitation services, and assessed the constraints (financial,
technical and administrative) that households face for constructing and maintaining hygienic toilets
and connecting to and using piped water for drinking and cooking.

The evaluation covers the expansion of water supply services, household and institutional sanitation,
and institutional strengthening, including improved planning, monitoring and evaluation. It focuses
on the period of implementation of the PforR between project initiation in January 2013 through
June 2015, capturing the first 2 full years of implementation and results verification. The evaluation
is undertaken in the eight provinces comprising the project area: Phu Tho, Quang Ninh, Ha Noi,
Hung Yen, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc, and Thanh Hoa and in five non-PforR comparison
provinces: Hai Duong, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh, Hoa Binh, and Nghe An.

  While the DLI for sustainable water supply systems will not be verified until Year 4 of the program, the evaluation will assess
interim indicators of sustainability

                                                                                                                                    14
Methodology

Program results (outputs) are tracked and verified through an annual independent verification
exercise. To understand not just whether, but how, outputs were achieved and the degree to which
those results can be attributed to the PforR itself, the evaluation gathered in-depth qualitative and
quantitative data on the process and mechanisms for achieving these results, and measured
outcomes and effectiveness vis-à-vis the NTP using the most rigorous methodology possible. That
is, the evaluation focuses on the full results chain as shown in Figure 1.5

                                                  Figure 1: Results Chain




A mixed-methods approach using quantitative and qualitative research tools was used to document
and critically describe the process and mechanisms used to achieve the results of the PforR. Where
appropriate these processes and outcomes are compared with non-PforR sites and closely
comparable water schemes, which serve as a counterfactual for the PforR. Data were collected by
Depocen, a local Vietnamese research institute, following a detailed concept note and Terms of
Reference (TOR), which outlined the proposed evaluation design and research questions. The final
evaluation design including research questions, methodology, and data collection instruments were
developed collaboratively between the Client, the World Bank project team and Depocen.

In-depth interviews and focus group discussions

In-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussion (FGDs) were conducted with various
stakeholders from the central to local levels (Table 3). A list of guiding questions was developed
for FGDs and IDIs (see Annex A for a list of questions key informants and participants of Focus
Group Discussion).
At the central level, besides consulting with the World Bank, the following stakeholders were
consulted: (i) National Center for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NCERWASS); (ii) National
Target     Program      Standing     Office    (NTP        SO);     (iii)   Health Environment
Management Agency (VIHEMA); (iv) Ministry of Education and Training; (v) Ministry of
Finance; (vi) Ministry of Planning and Investment; (vii) State Audit of Vietnam.
At the provincial level, focus group discussions were conducted with the participation of
Department of Agricultural and Rural Development (DARD), Provincial Center for Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation (PCERWASS), Department of Health (DoH), Department of Planning and
Investment (DPI), Department of Finance (DoF), and Department of Education and Training
(DOET). In addition, IDIs with key personnel of PCERWASS were conducted in each province.

    The evaluation does not measure distant development outcomes, such as child health, nutrition, poverty reduction


                                                                                                                       15
Two FGDs were held at the commune level in each province. One was with relevant stakeholders
including commune leaders, local project coordinators, health workers, and women’s union while
the other was local villagers. The criteria for selection of commune are mainly the performance of
the program at these communes (i.e. whether the water connection is completed, whether the
construction is still going on, and whether the commune-wide sanitation is being implemented).
Priority is given to communes where both water and sanitation are being implemented. The
selection of communes of 8 provinces ensures the diverse participants and implementation progress
of the program at these provinces.

Quantitative surveys
The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews. Two types of surveys were conducted,
including:
Household survey: (i) a survey with 400 households with newly constructed latrines; and (ii) a
survey with 400 households that connected to the piped water system. The surveys measure
affordability of water and sanitation infrastructure, expenditure and financing of water and
sanitation, perceptions of quality, satisfaction, among others. The households were selected
randomly from the list of households that are directly benefited from the program in the first two
years.

The sampling frame used for the household survey is the complete list of beneficiary households
reported by the Program in the Comprehensive Results Report (CRR). For households benefiting
from piped water connections two communes were randomly selected from each province from the
full list of communes reporting connections. In each selected commune two villages were randomly
selected and between 12 – 13 households selected per village. Total sample size per province was
50 households (n=400 for water connections). For households benefiting from new household
sanitary latrines, a total of 400 households were selected at random from the full list of reported
latrines since no clustering approach was used in implementation. In total, 800 households were
selected for the surveys. See Annex B for the household questionnaire.

Water scheme survey: A water scheme survey using a semi-structured questionnaire and covering
system design elements, finances, operations and maintenance was conducted with 23 water
schemes in PforR provinces and 19 water schemes in non-PforR provinces, selected to be similar
technical, financial, and geographic aspects. Specifically, 20 newly constructed water schemes, 2
legacy schemes and 1 extension scheme were surveyed in the PforR provinces. While all the
surveyed schemes reported to be operational at the time of the survey, only 15 had submitted water
                                                                                                16

2015 annual verification cycle. See Annex C for the water scheme survey questionnaire.

Theory of the result-based approach and issues with the NTP it seeks to address

Results-based approaches6 are becoming increasingly mainstream for achieving desirable outcomes
in development. Contrary to traditional approaches to development, results-based approaches offer
financial or non-monetary reward upon demonstration of measurable outputs or outcomes. While
the details of each approach differ, they share a common aim to shift from financing of
infrastructure to delivery of public services, thereby achieving greater balance of incentive
structures.

These approaches aim to address what is a common situation that arises in interactions where
incentives and information are misaligned, which is often the case with development projects. This
is known as the principal agent problem (Ross 1973; Sappington 1991). The theory suggests that a
breakdown in service may occur when one actor (the principal) must rely on another actor (the
agent) to produce an output or deliver a service even when the interests of these two parties are not
aligned and access to information is not the same. Output based approaches aim to align these
incentives by linking development outcomes sought by principal to the particular motivations of the
agent.

Under the standard NTP model central government 7 (principal) 8 disburses funds to provincial
implementing agencies (agent) to finance certain activities or inputs, such as construction of water
supply schemes, funding of demonstration toilets and conduct of information, education and
communication activities (IEC). Funding under this arrangement is disbursed based on presentation
of an annual provincial plan of activities. Under this approach cost-efficiency is not rewarded since
any realized cost-savings do not accrue to the implementing agency. Moreover sustainability of
systems suffers since funding is tied to design and construction and not to operations and
maintenance. NTP has faced cost overruns, delayed construction times, and limited or non-existent
funding for sanitation, demonstrating that objectives between principal and agent have not always
been aligned. Some of the characteristics of the NTP that increase the likelihood of principal agent
problems are the following:

    (i)       high cost of information – monitoring data on household access to hygienic sanitation is
              costly to collect, requires specialized training and human resources, and
              quality/accuracy of data has been shown to be low9

    (ii)      lack of technological innovation – lack of skills for generating demand for piped water
              and sanitation and changing behavior may lead to sub-optimal outcomes; capacity of
              provincial government to design and manage water supply schemes

The PforR seeks to align the incentive structure by making monetary disbursement of funds
conditional on demonstration of pre-defined outputs. Furthermore, it improves the quality of

  In the case of the PforR the World Bank also acts as a principal, with the Government of Vietnam the agent. The PforR-IE will
solely focus on the relationship between central government and provincial implementing agencies, while recognizing that the
presence of multiple principals introduces further complexities into the prevailing incentive structures.

information available to both principal (central government agencies) and agent (provincial
implementing agencies), through independent verification of targets. If agents feel incentivized to
produce more accurate reporting (e.g. to limit reputational risk from inaccurate reporting identified
through independent verification) monitoring systems may improve. The PforR may also lead to
innovation in implementation since the agent will be able to capture the time and cost-savings of
any improvements in efficiency. The risk of the PforR approach and an increased focus on
monitoring of results including (i) increased incentive to focus on the output indicators being
measured at the expense of those that are not; (ii) misreporting of results, whether intentionally (in
an effort to outsmart the system) or unintentionally (poor monitoring and reporting systems); (iii)
crowding in of good quality implementers and/or high capacity project sites.

Budgetary support and continued program financing are the sole financial ‘rewards’ for provincial
implementing agencies under the PforR approach in Vietnam – there are no performance based
grants or other monetary incentives at the sub-national level. At project design, the task team
anticipated that MARD would set up internal mechanisms to reward performance. To date there is
no evidence that performance incentives are in place. The implicit incentive for provinces are the
cost savings, which can be reinvested in further works. Thus, the agent in this case is assumed to
act based on self-interest, reputation and status reasons. The key assumptions then underlying the
PforR are that provincial implementing agencies in Vietnam are (i) motivated by an intrinsic desire
to achieve a particular development outcome and that (ii) they have the capacity, both technological
and implementation, and financial resources to deliver on the outputs in the timeframe expected.

The results-based approach seeks to address the weaknesses identified in the NTP by shifting the
incentive structure of the program from one based on inputs (financial resources) and activities
(design and construction of water schemes) to one based on outputs (water connections, toilets
constructed) and outcomes (coverage and use of clean water / hygienic sanitation).

     II.     Background of the Program-for-Results in Vietnam
Stakeholders, institutional and implementation arrangements
The PforR is implemented at the provincial level, with provincial authorities holding primary
responsibility for planning, procuring, managing, monitoring and reporting on Program results,
while central government agencies are responsible for steering, developing and issuing guidelines
and regulations, requesting disbursement of funds, and overall reporting to the World Bank.
Central government agencies that are involved in the project include:10
(a) The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is the lead agency of the
    Program. MARD, through the General Department of Water Resources/Standing Office of the
    RWSS National Target Program performs monitoring, evaluation and follow-up of the PforR
    implementation progress, supervises overall Program implementation, and is responsible for
    leading the coordination with other agencies. In addition MARD supports the eight provinces to
    plan, deliver and monitor the Program and prepares the Comprehensive Results Reports for
    submission to the Bank and requests for disbursement;
(b) The National Centre for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NCERWASS) under MARD is
    responsible for supervision and follow-up of the PforR implementation progress, consolidation
    of results of DLIs implementation, and providing technical support to the Program;
(c) The Ministry of Health (MoH) coordinates sanitation activities including investments for which
    it is directly responsible and disseminates information to support sanitation and hygiene
    promotion. The agency is charged with leading the organization of Information, Education and
    Communication (IEC) activities. MoH also has the mandate for defining and checking drinking
    water and domestic water use quality standards. Vietnam Health Environment Management
    Agency (VIHEMA), an agency under MOH is responsible for rural household sanitation;
(d) The Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) monitors the implementation of school
    sanitation and leads elements of IEC delivered through schools;
(e) The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is responsible for final budget allocations to
    Program components;
(f) The Ministry of Finance (MoF), through State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), receives the funds
    disbursed by the World Bank and channels them to the Program Provinces.
In addition to the above agencies, the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) assumes the role of an
Independent Verification Agent (IVA). The agency provides independent verification and
confirmation of the results, namely the Disbursement Linked Indicators, reported by the provinces
through MARD, using verification protocols agreed with the World Bank. SAV contracts national
or international expertise as needed to assist with and undertake the verification work in accordance
with the agreed methodology. Based on the verification, SAV prepares an Annual Results
Verification Report, which is shared with MARD and the World Bank to guide disbursement.

At the provincial level, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) acts as the
lead agency. An NTP provincial Program Steering Committee (PSC) is also established in each
participating province, which is headed by a deputy or head of the Provincial People’s Committee
(PPC). Members of the provincial PSC are representatives from the Department of Agriculture and

Rural Development (DARD), Department of Education and Traning (DOET), Department of
Health (DoH), and the Provincial Center for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (PCERWASS).
The PPC provides overall oversight on resources management, the establishment of any
institutional structures required to deliver the Program, annual Provincial Plan, effective results
monitoring and reporting and coordination with other NTPs and other sectoral investment
programs.

In addition, the Department of Finance (DoF) and Department of Planning and Investment (DPI)
are involved in the provincial planning process and disbursement of fund. These agencies hold
responsibility for appraising the annual program plan and the budget allocation before it is
submitted to the PPC for approval.

Key Elements of the PforR – How the PforR works in practice


Provincial Action Plan (PAP) and Operational Manual (OM)
The Program Action Plan (PAP) and Operational Manual (OM) are the primary mechanisms used
to manage program risks in the daily operation of the PforR. Endorsed by the Prime Minister, the
PAP is developed following the risk assessments undertaken for PforR to contain important actions
that will be taken in the implementation of the program. Critical social and environmental
commitments are included in the PAP to augment the key practices under NTP, and cover areas
such as financial management, procurement, addressing corruption risks, strengthening financial
and results audits, dealing with land acquisition and engaging with ethnic minority program
beneficiaries. PAP actions are implemented through the OM, which complements existing NTP
manuals. The OM sets out Vietnamese regulations and laws related to the various aspects of the
Program, as well as additional provisions necessary to address gaps identified in the PAP.


Disbursement-Liked Indicators (DLIs)
Disbursements under the PforR are dependent on the achievement of results, referred to as
Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) usually measured at regular intervals within a project
timeline. The PforR of RWSS in the Red River Delta comprises three core DLIs, as follows:


1.      DLI 1 relates to the delivery of infrastructure, namely piped water connections and
improved household sanitary latrines. In the first year DLI 1.2 consists of improved household
sanitary latrines; for years 2-5, it consists of two inter-linked sub-indicators: (a) DLI 1.1 working
water supply connections; and (b) DLI 1.2 improved household sanitary latrines. The inter-linkage
between the two sub-indicators is designed to incentivize the achievement of the targets,
particularly for sanitation. A disbursement is therefore triggered only when at least some progress
in both water supply and sanitation is achieved.


2.     DLI 2 relates to the achievement of outcomes and for Years 1-3 consists of DLI 2.2
commune-wide sanitation; for Years 4-5, it consists of the two inter-linked sub-indicators of: (a)
DLI 2.1 sustainable water supply systems; and (b) DLI 2.2 commune-wide sanitation.11 As in the
case of DLI 1, the inter-linkage between the two sub-indicators is designed to incentivize the
achievement of both targets.
11
  Full definitions of sustainable water supply and commune-wide sanitation are in Annex 2 of the PAD which lays out the Results
Framework in full.

                                                                                                                              20
3.      DLI 3 is a measure of effective oversight, management and transparency of the Program
(including more responsive planning, monitoring and financing) at the provincial and national level.
It consists of two sub-indicators: (a) a Provincial Annual Plan for each province; and (b) a set of
nine Program Reports (one for each Participating Province and one consolidated Program Report
from MARD), which will include information on Program implementation progress and will be
disclosed to the public.12 This DLI is not scalable and both (a) and (b) have to be achieved to
trigger a disbursement.

Result verification, monitoring and transparency
The formal risk management arrangements for the PforR rely primarily on the specifications
included in the PAP and the guidelines set out in the OM, which are covenanted in the loan
agreement between the GoV and the World Bank. Supervision and monitoring is also a critical
aspect of the risk management arrangements in place.
Progress under the Program is reported through DARD to MARD and consolidated into program
reports and the CRR. The IVA, in this case State Audit of Vietnam (SAV), verifies achievement of
the reported results through desk review and physical inspection of the three core DLIs in
compliance with the verification protocol. Once the verification report is accepted by MARD and
the World Bank, funds are disbursed to the GoV.


Technical Assistance
A technical assistance (TA) package grant of USD 8 million was provided by the Australian
Government to support the PforR and is intended to provide technical support for many aspects of
the Program such as improving transparency, procurement, land acquisition and working with
ethnic minorities. 13 The PAD clearly states that the TA is ‘one of the conditions for the PforR
operation effectiveness’.




12
  Full definitions of the Provincial Annual Plans and the Program Reports are included in Annex 2 of the PAD.
13
  The TA has six components aiming at supporting capacity building at the provincial level in the areas of (i) Planning, Monitoring
and Evaluation, (ii) Water Supply Systems, (iii) Sanitation Services, (iv)Improved Governance, (v) Verification, and (vi)
Information Sharing and Communication. See World Bank, PAD (2012), p. 56

                                                                                                                               21
  III.            Main Findings: Program Targets and Results
In the first 2 years of program implementation the program targeted the following results:

            DLI 1.1: 80,000 New Functioning Water Supply Connections
            DLI 1.2: 30,000 Newly constructed Improved Household Sanitary Latrines
            DLI 2.2: 500,000 People with access to Commune-Wide Sanitation.
            Approval of provincial annual plans and public disclosure of program reports


Figure 2 below presents progress against targets in the first two years of implementation for all
eight provinces. At the mid-term review, program-wide results are positive, but there is wide
variation in achievement among the eight provinces, particularly for water connections. Overall,
64% of the annual targets for DLI 1.1 on new functioning water supply connections have been met,
but only three provinces, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam and Phu Tho achieved the targets set at the provincial
level. Bac Ninh province achieved 104 percent of the target number of connections for DLI 1.1,
while Hung Yen achieved only 3 percent.

In general, progress against sanitation related DLIs has been better than water DLIs. For all
provinces except Hung Yen and Vinh Phuc (DLI 1.2) the sanitation targets were exceeded. DLI 3
on Provincial Annual Plans and Program Reports was uniformly achieved.

Investments under the PforR represent a sizeable increase in overall program financing to
the Red River Delta region, providing a significant boost to implementation of NTP3, but
make it challenging to compare results in PforR areas to those in comparison areas.

One of the challenges faced by the evaluation was to be able to compare the effectiveness of the
PforR in achieving NTP3 results with that of a ‘non-results-based’ approach in comparison
provinces, when financing under PforR is so much greater than that received under the regular NTP.
Clearly, financial resources concentrated in PforR provinces were a significant boost to
implementation of NTP3. It’s not clear whether the achievements are replicable with lower funding
allocation.
                                                                                               22
For the 2015 implementing year PforR financing provided a further 684 billion VND (30 million
USD) of budget support to the NTP3 in the 8 provinces, while total NTP3 budget allocation in 2015,
excluding PforR financing, was 761 billion VND (34 million USD), spread across 63 provinces in
Vietnam. If these funds had been divided equally, each of the 63 provinces would be allocated 12
billion VND (approximately 500,000 USD).

In other words, PforR funding for the 8 provinces was a little less than the entire NTP3 budget
allocation for the entire country. In 2012 before the PforR began, the NTP allocated just 101 billion
VND (5 million USD)14 to the same 8 provinces, meaning that PforR funding for the 8 provinces is
almost 7 times the allocation prior to the commencement of the Program.


Achieving Results on Sanitation


Higher levels of funding have benefited sanitation, with the budget for these activities double
or triple that in non-PforR comparison provinces.

The NTP3 has been criticized for not giving adequate attention to sanitation and budget allocations
reflect this. In 2014 for example, the budget allocated for sanitation in non-PforR provinces was
just 30 percent of the provincial planning estimates, while the gap in PforR provinces was much
smaller –actual allocations were 75 percent of the estimate. Figure 3 shows budget allocations to
the various sanitation related activities for PforR and non-PforR provinces for 2013 and 2014.

scheme falls primarily on households, promotional activities (Information, Education and
Communication or IEC) are used to raise the rural population’s awareness of the benefits of piped
water supply and hygienic sanitation and to generate household demand. These activities may
include:

            1)         training courses on communication for provincial, district and commune staff;
            2)         training on construction and repair of hygienic latrines for construction workers;
            3)         group IEC sessions with households;
            4)         face-to-face IEC visits with households;
            5)         IEC via loudspeakers;
            6)         use of marketing materials such as flyers and banners in public places
The additional resources, two to three times those in non-PforR provinces, helped to strengthen
sanitation activities, increasing financial support for the construction of demonstration latrines on
the one hand, and reportedly increasing the frequency and coverage of communication activities.
Table 21 presents data from the Comprehensive Results Reports (CRR) of 2013 and 2014 16 ,
showing households that received support for building demonstration latrines in the first two years
of the program. Around 30 percent of households constructing new sanitary latrines received
support: 29.3 percent in 2013 and 37.1 percent in 2014.

 The Comprehensive Result Report of PforR is developed by MARD at the end of each year. It provides consolidated results of the
DLI matrix and provincial compliance with PAP of all 8 PforR provinces in the reported year. This report includes the list of all
beneficiaries and forms the basis for AnnualVerification of Results by the State Audit of Vietnam.

These figures are higher than reported by households surveyed for the evaluation (23.3 percent),
despite the fact that the survey is a representative sample of program beneficiaries in the first 2
years of the program. Across the provinces, Thanh Hoa has the highest proportion of households
receiving financial support (71.4% in 2013 and 83.8% in 2014), while Vinh Phuc has the lowest
proportion, which is consistent with the CRR.

With increased funding and attention to sanitation (through the DLIs), did access to sanitation
increase more rapidly in PforR provinces than in comparison areas? According to VIHEMA, the
annual increase of household sanitation coverage under the PforR Program is much higher than
under NTP, which averages 1-3 percent.17 The evaluation looked at trends at the population level
using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys for the years 2010, 2012 and
2014 (Table 5). But given different levels of baseline coverage and different trajectories in
sanitation coverage prior to the PforR (between 2010 and 2012) it is hard to attribute the changes
between 2012 and 2014 to the PforR.

To begin with coverage in the 8 PforR provinces is higher than that of the comparison provinces for
all years, even prior to the start of the PforR in 2013. In 2010 coverage of improved latrines is 68.5
percent in the 8 provinces, compared to 50.6 percent in comparison provinces.

For the period 2010-2012, before the start of the PforR coverage increased by 16.4% in the 8
provinces and 25.8% in the comparison provinces. The gains are large in both sets of provinces,
suggesting that there is a broader trend towards improved sanitation in the country. Although
coverage increased at a faster rate in PforR provinces than in the comparison provinces for the
period 2012 – 2014 (8.8% in PforR provinces vs. 8.1% in comparison provinces) these figures
should be interpreted with caution given the small number of observations (provinces) and other
confounding factors.

   The VHLSS studies eight types of latrines: (1) septic tank/semi-septic tank latrine, (2) sulabh latrine, (3) ventilated improved pit
latrines, (4) double-vault latrines, (5) buckets, (6) hanging latrines, (7) open defecation, and (8) other. Based on this, we categorized
them into two groups:
       *Hygienic latrines include (1) septic tank/semi-septic tank latrine, (2) sulabh latrine, (3) ventilated improved pit latrines, and
(4) double-vault latrines;
       **Non-hygienic latrines include (5) buckets, (6) hanging latrines, (7) open defecation, and (8) others.

Notwithstanding achievement of the sanitation targets, the project recognized from the beginning
that these targets were easier to achieve than water connection targets. In fact, the targets in years 1
and 2 of the program (15,000 IHSLs) are below expected natural levels of increase (based on
population of the PforR program area of approximately 15 million people, with 51 percent coverage
of hygienic sanitation, 15,000 latrines represent a 0.2 percent increase in coverage per year),
suggesting that even without doing anything coverage would increase at this rate. One of the main
challenges faced by the Vietnam Bank for Social Policy is the ability to keep up with demand for
subsidized toilet loans.

Importantly, as the program matures sanitation targets get more ambitious. By Year 3 the target for
DLI I.2 doubles to 30,000 IHSLs, 40,000 in Year 4 and 30,000 in Year 5. These targets will
become harder to achieve as those without access tend to live in more remote areas, have lower
income levels and lower awareness and demand for hygienic latrines.

Achieving the target for commune wide sanitation under DLI 2.2 will also become harder to
achieve. Whereas the incentive in the first years of the program has been to maximize the cost-
efficiency of implementation by targeting ‘low-hanging fruit’, that is, communes with coverage of
latrines near the target of 70 percent, but with a need for investments in institutional sanitation and
water facilities. Over time the number of communes with coverage levels approaching this
threshold declines, which should force the provinces to reach further into the rural areas where
services are lacking.


Achieving Results on Water Supply Connections

Financial and operational indicators were collected from 23 water schemes in the PforR provinces,
and 19 schemes in non-PforR comparison provinces. Table 6 shows the type of schemes surveyed.

  Non-PforR provinces include the provinces in the red-river delta and a number of northern provinces that share similarity of
geographic conditions with Thanh Hoa and Phu Tho.

Of the 23 schemes visited in PforR provinces, 15 had submitted targets for DLI 1.1 in 2014, with
the remaining schemes expected to submit targets for the 2015 verification cycle.20

On major indicators such as capacity and number of households supplied, water schemes
constructed under PforR are larger compared to those constructed in non-PforR areas, but
are also more costly in terms of cost per connection.

Data from water schemes constructed under the PforR showed they were designed to be larger and
to serve more households than schemes in the comparison provinces constructed under traditional
NTP (Table 7). Once operational the differences in capacity and number of households supplied
remained higher in PforR schemes, but were only borderline statistically significant. The average
cost per connection was significantly higher in the PforR schemes (36.5 million VND vs. 14.6
million VND; p=0.001) once they were in operation, and well over the cost per connection intended
by the program (12 million VND). This is largely due to the low connection ratios observed in the
first year that DLI 1.1 was measured.

   Data collection for water schemes was conducted in August 2015 so some schemes had just started operation and not
all data were available
21
   Four of the PforR schemes were not able to provide investment costs at the time of the survey. Missing data was
imputed using average values, separately for PforR and non-PforR schemes

                                                                                                                 27
Provinces have faced many challenges achieving the targets for water supply, stemming from
system over-design, high unit costs and a low procurement bid savings rate, suggesting that
not all provinces are capturing the intended cost savings.

The Government identified system inefficiencies as a major challenge to effective delivery of
services under the NTP3. Funding shortages are pervasive, with provinces tending to start
numerous schemes without certainty of availability of funds, resulting in many small-scale, low
capacity schemes, being started but not completed. These water schemes are typically designed to
serve a single commune and sometimes even a single village. Average construction periods under
NTP are double the engineers’ estimates. In some extreme cases, the construction of schemes may
take as long as 10 years to be completed.22 During this time the schemes incur additional costs for
maintenance and repair, further lengthening the time needed for completion.

In addition to linking disbursement to working household connections to eliminate these system
inefficiencies, the Program’s technical assessment identified a series of actions for the design of
Water Supply Schemes to help ensure cost efficiency in design, while also maintaining
Government of Vietnam water quality standards. These included: reducing the residual head in
piped schemes; reducing the peaking factors for the smaller rural water supplies; reduction of water
consumption estimates; and the need to have more conservative estimates of future population
growth. In addition, technical assistance packages were prepared for design and procurement of
larger, more efficient schemes, with a low cost per connection so that any cost savings could be
used to finance additional investments.

Design issues identified in the technical assessment have persisted, leading to high investment
costs for Water Supply Schemes in the early stages of the Program, and creating budget
constraints for meeting the remaining Program targets.

The midterm review documented several issues that together have led to low levels of cost-
efficiency in the first two years of the Program. First, a comparison of final design documents with
the detailed designs included in the feasibility study found the latter estimated unrealistic costs and
targets. Some provinces excluded these schemes and identified alternatives that could be
constructed under the program at lower cost. Others went ahead with the schemes identified by the
feasibility study, ending up with costs between 86 percent and 192 percent of the estimated cost.
Out of the 16 schemes originally included in the feasibility study that went ahead under the
Program, 12 of them (75%) exceeded the cost estimates.

In addition to the limitations discovered in the feasibility study, the technical designs developed for
schemes under the Program used unrealistic standards for consumption estimates. Rather than
conduct survey assessments of household water consumption needs and usage, technical
consultants based design calculations on set government standards that were unrealistic for rural
areas. According to the NCERWASS, consumption for rural communities in the Red River delta is
between 60-80 liters per person per day, while the standards used in the design of schemes under
the Program are 100-120 liters per person per day. To make matters worse, provinces opted for the
upper limit of these standards, citing long-term development planning needs. According to the
household survey conducted for the evaluation some households are consuming sizeable quantities
of water, but on average household piped water consumption in the month before the survey was 9
cubic meters (m3) or approximately 68 liters per person per day. The majority of households
consumed between 1 and 10 m3 in the previous month.

                                                                                                    28
As a result of these decisions schemes were designed to be larger than local requirements dictate
and the available capacity has outpaced demand in some of the targeted areas, contributing to lower
connection ratios than anticipated. Construction costs have escalated sharply due to the excessive
time horizon required to complete the schemes, leaving fewer available funds for future schemes.

To see this in perspective, the feasibility study estimated unit costs of USD 140 per person (VND
3,038,000), or approximately VND 12 million per connection, 23 while in practice unit costs of
PforR water schemes in the 8 provinces range from VND 4.5 million per connection in Phu Tho, to
VND 82.2 million in Bac Ninh.24 Besides the over-design issue and low connection ratios, several
additional factors are reported to contribute to these higher unit costs, including low population
density (e.g. Phu Tho and Quang Ninh), distance to suitable sources of surface water (e.g. Thanh
Hoa), and other geographic conditions (see Box 1).

Box 1: Rural Hydrographic Conditions: Thanh Hoa


A number of challenges are faced in achieving water connection targets. In Thanh Hoa,
due to the high level of salinity intrusion in target communes, the water source selected
for the construction of new water supply schemes had to be located far from the location
of the treatment structure and the intended beneficiaries. The expense to transport source
water to the scheme has had significant added construction costs. The water scheme in
Hau Loc has had to transport source water 11.8 km to reach the system. The high expense
of the piping and other materials made up 25% of the total investment of the scheme.

In Hoang Hoa commune, in addition to the distance of the water source (8.5 km), raw
water is taken from the Hoang Khanh pumping station to save capital expenses The
Hoang Khanh pumping station is a part of an irrigation system that operates on an
independent schedule according to the farming season and may restrict water to the water
supply scheme to ensure water provided for agriculture production is maximized. As the
restrictions may last up to 10 days it was necessary to construct a water reservoir at the
water supply scheme to ensure a stable water source of raw water for the scheme.



Early indicators suggest the water supply schemes constructed under the PforR are on the
right track for improved sustainability than comparison schemes in non-PforR areas.

The PforR was designed to address poor financial sustainability of water supply schemes
constructed under NTP3. Schemes face revenue problems due to low household connection ratios
stemming from availability of alternative safe water sources and low willingness to pay for water.
The incentives to improve financial sustainability of schemes was institutionalized through the
inclusion of a DLI on people served by connections to Sustainable Water Systems (DLI 2.1). The
Program Operational Manual (OM) defines a Sustainable Water System as one which: (i) provides
clean water; (ii) operates under a recognized management model; (iii) 85% of the number of
planned connections are working, and with bills issued and paid; (iv) recovers operation and
maintenance costs; and (v) non-revenue water is less than 25%.


23
  In our interview with NTP SO staff, this estimate is generally described as “remarkably low?
24
   In Phu Tho a scheme of VND 50,000 million investment with 11,000 connections; in Bac Ninh province one scheme with
investment of VND 41,107 million had only constructed 500 connections. Both are new schemes.


                                                                                                                        29
While it is too early to assess sustainability of PforR water supply schemes, indicators such as
operating under a sustainable management model and meeting water quality standards are generally
positive. All water schemes had undergone water quality testing prior to delivery of water to
comply with water quality standards, although some households expressed concern in focus group
discussions about the quality of piped water, recalling quality issues that were experienced in the
past with NTP schemes and noting that water quality certificates were not accessible. Moreover,
only 25 percent of respondents at the time of the survey believed that piped water was safe for
drinking directly from the source, but this did not affect the volume of water used in the past month.

Schemes constructed under the PforR are operating under either a (i) self-financing and non-profit
administration management model via PCERWASS (Vinh Phuc, Hung Yen, Quang Ninh, Bac
Ninh, and Thanh Hoa) or (ii) Enterprise model (Hanoi, Ha Nam, Bac Ninh, and Phu Tho) (Table 8).

Given the small scale of traditional NTP3 water schemes the Commune People’s Committee (CPC)
often takes over management and operation of scheme, but lacks the required technical and
managerial capacity. A PCERWASS model is used where the operation of stand-alone single
scheme may not be financially sustainable due to low living standards or the availability of other
water sources so cross-subsidization is needed. Both the PCERWASS and Enterprise management
models help ensure operations and maintenance cost recovery as well as debt repayment (30% of
capital investment is borrowed from central government, while 10% is in the form of beneficiary
contribution).


There is evidence that some households are not paying to connect to the piped water supply
systems.

In addition to the water tariff, beneficiaries are required to make a contribution to the capital cost of
the water scheme, as well as pay for a water meter and any other materials or labor to install the
connection. According to focus group respondents, these expenses are relatively acceptable to
households, but some participants complained about the additional water connection fee
(installation of the water meter) after a contribution to the capital cost of the system had already
been made. Focus group respondents expressed concern that these installation costs may deter poor
and near poor households from connecting to the system.



                                                                                                      30
Twenty percent of households that were able to recall costs associated with installation of the water
connection reported that they did not pay a connection fee, implying that the beneficiary
contribution may have been waived or subsidized for some households. The average expenditure
was VND 1.3 million for households who paid to connect.

Financial sustainability of the schemes may be jeopardized by low-connection ratios and
continued reluctance to charge tariffs that achieve cost-recovery.

A major determinant of sustainability of schemes will be the extent to which they are able to cover
operations and maintenance costs, by reaching target connection ratios (85 percent of planned
connections), beneficiary contribution to capital investment costs, and payment of tariffs. Lack of
financial sustainability has been a pervasive issue in NTP3 and many schemes have fallen into
disrepair due to lack of funds stemming from low connection ratios, low tariff collection rates,
mismanagement, and low technical capacity.

The PforR included TA to design information, education and communication activities specifically
targeted to increase demand for the use of piped water to prevent health related risks of using other
unsafe sources for drinking and cooking. The quality of alternative sources of water influences
usage patterns across the provinces according to the survey conducted for the evaluation. In Thanh
Hoa for instance, where water contamination is prevalent, usage of piped water is generally higher
than other provinces, whereas households in Bac Ninh, Ha Nam and Hung Yen maintain a habit of
using rainwater for cooking. In Phu Tho, groundwater is perceived to be of good quality and
households continue to use water from private tube wells. Alternative sources of water, such as
rainwater, boreholes and protected wells, are still used by a significant proportion of households for
drinking and cooking. Piped water has become the most common water source for 65 percent of
households surveyed, but water usage patterns show the continued use of multiple water sources for
domestic use

This IEC was also intended to result in more rapid connection to water schemes in order to achieve
the targets. However, there appears to be limited emphasis on using IEC to increase the speed of
connection. Most households surveyed for this evaluation reported they were told about piped
water through community meetings, which are usually conducted prior to or during the planning
phase of the scheme to solicit the 10 percent capital cost contribution from beneficiaries. Other
households recalled messages about piped water through household visits and loudspeaker
announcements. The evaluation did not assess the effectiveness of these methods.

The PforR does not explicitly address water pricing, but encourages appropriate tariffs to allow for
quality operations, maintenance and sustainability. Connection fees and tariffs are set annually by
the Provincial People’s Council, with little scope for deviation at the local level. Table 9 shows the
monthly water tariff per m3 of water consumed.

                                 Thanh Hoa              5,300
                                 Vinh Phuc              5,000
                                                                                                   31
In the water schemes surveyed for the evaluation tariffs reportedly ranged from 4,500 to 7,000
VND with an average tariff of VND 6,173 per m3 in non-PforR schemes and VND 5,734 in PforR
schemes (p=0.149).
To understand household willingness to pay for piped water and determinants of piped water
demand a complementary study to the evaluation was designed, which used random assignment of
price subsidies on household connection fees and tariffs. Experimental methods were not possible
for the evaluation. Instead, households were told a random tariff increase between 500 – 2000 VND
per m3, and asked how their consumption would change at that price increase. Just under half of
households told a price increase of 500 VND said they would reduce consumption, while 65
percent of households said they would reduce consumption of the tariff increased by 2,000 VND
per cubic meter.
A hypothetical small increase in the water tariff has a significant effect on household water
consumption behaviour. While a 500 VND increase does not influence stated water consumption,
households are 13.2% more likely to reduce the volume of water used when the tariff increases by
1,000 VND (US$ 0.045) based on a probit regression, and conditional on the current water tariff,
satisfaction with current water tariff, perception of the correspondence between service and cost,
household size, household poverty category and demographic characteristics of household head
(Figure 4). Households who express dissatisfaction with the current water tariff and who perceive
low correspondence between service and cost are more likely to reduce water consumption due to a
price increase, as are households designated poor or near-poor (Table 10).

      IV.       Main Findings: Institutional Strengthening

A second key objective of the Program-for-Results is to build capacity and strengthen country
institutions. The PforR of RWSS aimed to strengthen governance, fiduciary, and monitoring and
evaluation systems at all levels of government. Results midway through the program suggest that
this objective has not fully been met, with some institutions still struggling to adapt to the PforR
approach. At the same time the reliance on government systems has highlighted some of the
institutional bottlenecks and capacity limitations that have constrained the NTP in the past.

Not all stakeholders are fully on board with the change in the investment approach to results-
based budget support and continue to operate in an investment project mentality.

While implementation of the Program is fully embedded within the NTP government structure, in
practice a separate funding stream effectively earmarks PforR funding for PforR activities and bars
NTP funds from financing these activities, creating an artificial separation between NTP3 and
PforR. As a result, the Program is operating less as a budget support and more as a results-based
investment project, leading to confusion among some stakeholders who are familiar with the
traditional World Bank IPF and hindering the provinces’ ability to develop Program-wide plans.

At lower levels of the program structure the shift to a results-based approach is even less evident.
Annual budget allocations are based on a combination of the 5-year investment plan for each
province and the annual disbursement amount according to the financing agreement, with minor
adjustment based on the annual plan. In other words, there is no evidence that transfers to the
provinces are reconciled against achievement of targets in the previous cycle. Therefore, from the
perspective of the province there is little difference in practice between the results-based approach
and the investment project approach.

For the most part, only PforR funds are reaching the PforR provinces, despite counterpart
funding commitments at the program design stage that are necessary to achieve the targets.

Total program budget for NTP3 in the Red River Delta is 260 million USD, of which 60 million
USD has been earmarked as counterpart funds. According to the PAD counterpart funds are split
between central, provincial and beneficiary contributions, shown in Table 11, where beneficiary
contributions are made through water connection fees, payment of water tariffs and repayment of
Vietnam Bank for Social Policy (VBSP) loans.

To date however there has been limited financial contribution to the Program from these other

US$ of the 15 million US$ in counterpart funds from beneficiary households has been collected for
Program implementation, and just 7 percent of the overall counterpart funding envisioned has been
made available.27

The VBSP is one source of counterpart funding, which provides a concessional credit of up to 60
percent of the capital cost of a latrine to households to finance investments in domestic sanitation.
According to the household survey just over a quarter (26.5%) of households borrowed from a bank
to finance construction of the toilet. Of households that took a loan 43 percent borrowed from the
VBSP and 38 percent from the Agribank. The majority of households (78.8%) financed
investments in domestic sanitation using current income or savings, while 46 percent reported
borrowing from friends or family.

Scarcity of counterpart funds has led to lower overall program funding and affected the
ability of provinces to pre-finance large capital investment requirements of water schemes,
resulting in delays.

Heavy reliance on PforR financing coupled with disbursement of funds only in the second half of
the calendar year after results are verified, some provinces have had to seek out alternative sources
of funding from local budgets or from private sector. Budget constraints also reportedly result in
provinces prioritizing infrastructure investments, displacing funding for vital IEC activities. During
the first two years of the Program the Provincial Health Centres and other stakeholders have
mobilized funds from other government programs such as the National Target Program or Nutrition
Programs to finance IEC, but with the understanding that they would be required to reimburse the
funds once PforR disbursements were made.

A number of provinces have tried to pass the pre-financing risk onto contractors, requiring private
firms to shoulder the entire pre-financing burden. In extreme cases, it was reported that some
contracts stipulated that payment would be made only once the work was completed, the results
verified, and the Bank disbursed the funds. Indeed, an in-depth review of two awarded contracts in
Quang Ninh province that was prepared for the mid-term review shows that in one case 70 percent
of the works had been completed, but only 33 percent of the contract value had been paid, while in
the other case 90 percent of the works had been completed and just 47 percent had been paid. Such
practices restrict the pool of potential contractors to those willing to shoulder the financial risk of
delayed payments, in some cases by borrowing at commercial rates to anticipate the investment,
resulting in higher costs.

After two annual planning and implementation cycles, unrealistic planning continues to
persist.

Long term capital investment planning to meet pre-specified program targets represents a
fundamental shift in how implementing agencies plan for water and sanitation investments, thus
one of the overarching objectives of the PforR mechanism is to strengthen planning capacity at
subnational and national levels.


26
   SAV holds responsibility for program audits. To date SAV has audited all World Bank, Central and provincial
government expenses in the 8 PforR provinces. Private and other ODA expenses, including government counterpart
funds to ODA projects, have not been audited, but will be going forward.
27
   Of the 30 million USD in non-concessional credit counterpart funds earmarked from central and provincial
government sources, approximately 2 million USD has been made available for Program implementation, and of this
amount only 100,000 USD has come from the central government.

                                                                                                                  36
 Under the NTP, provinces prepare an annual plan that includes budget estimates for the coming year for endorsement by
  year for endorsement by PPC. Once endorsement is received at the provincial level each province submits its proposal to
submits its proposal to NTP SO for consolidation and submission to MPI (development budget) and MoF (recurrent budget)

Under the traditional NTP process provincial budget requests often exceed the resources that
provinces ultimately receive. As a result, provinces are accustomed to requesting more funds than
they can reasonably expect will be made available by the central level and compensating for lesser
availability of funds by shifting outputs to subsequent years. Furthermore, there is little
transparency in the decision-making process for these final budget allocations and there is no
opportunity for provinces to provide feedback once MARD consolidates and submits the initial
budget request.

In contrast, the PforR outlines set targets to be achieved over the project duration, which in theory
should facilitate project planning and budgeting. With the full program scope known in advance,
budget requests can be tied to the outputs anticipated for each year. However, as will be discussed
in further detail below, the targets were allocated uniformly across the provinces without regard to
heterogeneity in costs or conditions, so for some provinces the expectations were unreasonable
given the budget envelope. Budget requests under PforR continue to exceed available resources,

                                                                                                                      37
either because provinces are accustomed to requesting more than they expect to receive, or because
costs are indeed higher in those provinces.

Data on budget allocation for the first 2 years of the program reveals a significant gap
between the budget amount proposed by the provinces and the allocation actually received.

In most cases actual allocations are less than half the budget request of the provinces (Table 12).
The significant reduction to the proposed provincial budget suggests that provinces are still relying
on old habits of requesting more than they need, under the expectation that less will be allocated. At
the same time, it demonstrates a lack of technical oversight on the part of MARD and NTP SO,
who hold equal responsibility for ensuring the provinces submit realistic annual plans and budget
requests.

The designated coordinating bodies of the PforR, NTP SO and PCERWASS, have limited
capacity, but also limited authority, for planning and coordination of the Program.

The multiple stakeholders involved in the PforR at central and local levels necessitate a central
authority to ensure effective coordination. This capacity was assigned to the Standing Office for
the NTP (NTP SO), responsible for overall coordination of the NTP3 under PforR with a mandate
to reinforce Program objectives and ensure Program-wide targets are met. This coordinating role is
mirrored at the provincial level through PCERWASSs. However, both NTP SO and the
PCERWASSs have no direct decision making authority – MARD retains most of the decision
making power as the central ministry responsible for the NTP3, leaving NTP SO and the
PCERWASSs weak and powerless to coordinate the Program effectively.

At the provincial level the three key implementing agencies of the PforR are the PCERWASS,
Center for Preventive Medicine (PCM) and DOET, each working under the direction of the PPC,
while at the same time responsible to central line ministries: MARD (PCERWASS), MoH and
VIHEMA (PCM) and MOET (DOET). An NTP provincial Program Steering Committee (PSC)
was established in each participating province, headed by a deputy head (or even head) of the

Provincial People’s Committee (PPC). Members of the provincial PSC are representatives from the
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), Department of Education and Traning
(DOET), Department of Health (DoH), and the Provincial Center for Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (PCERWASS). The PPC provides overall oversight on resources management, the
establishment of any institutional structures required to deliver the Program, annual Provincial Plan,
effective results monitoring and reporting and coordination with other NTPs and other sectoral
investment programs. In addition, DoF and DPI are involved in the provincial planning and
disbursement of funds and hold responsibility for appraising the annual program plan and the
budget allocation before submitting to the PPC for approval. Thus, critical decisions regarding
finance, planning and procurement remain in the domain of the relevant ministries, their provincial
counterparts, and the PPC who have their own priorities and do not report to the NTP SO.

In some provinces where there is strong support for implementation of rural water supply and
sanitation activities, the Provincial People’s Committee has advocated on behalf of the
PCERWASS and provided the necessary decision making authority in relations with the line
ministries. However where there is less interest or enthusiasm for the program the PCERWASS
lacks the authority to effectively coordinate the program. The PforR’s reliance on the
administrative structure of the NTP has exposed some of the major bottlenecks to effective
implementation of NTP3.

The trickle down of performance incentives is hindered by the reluctance of MARD to
reallocate targets from “poor? performers to “good? performers.

The PforR as designed for this project disburses on the basis of program wide targets, without
regard to achievement at the provincial level. At the project design stage MARD and the NTP SO
uniformly assigned the program-wide targets and a corresponding budget envelope for DLI 1.1 to
each of the 8 provinces. This decision failed to take into account distinctive characteristics, capacity,
or locally adjusted unit costs of each province (see Box 2). Some provinces with higher capacity or
favourable local conditions have outperformed the others, but provided a set envelope and targets
that are capped, there is little incentive for provinces to over-perform. At the midpoint in the project,
some high capacity provinces have requested more funds to complete more connections. Yet,
MARD has been reluctant to reallocate targets to these high performers unless there is clear
evidence that other provinces will not meet the targets agreed at the beginning of the program.

To ensure these provinces, which have struggled to extend connections within budget until now,
will achieve the pre-defined targets, the NTP SO intends to cross-subsidise these provinces with the
good performers who have realized cost savings. As a result, the implicit incentive that the PforR
intended: i.e. cost savings can be reinvested in further works, could eventually dry up. On the other
hand, reallocation of targets is not without its challenges, as it risks crowding in good performing
provinces and unnecessarily penalizing provinces who lack capacity or favourable local conditions.

Box 2: Rapid Urbanization in Quang Ninh and ‘shrinking’ program areas

Some provinces have faced a dilemma of ‘shrinking’ Program-eligible areas,
highlighting the necessity of flexibility and adaptive ability in order to keep pace with
an ever changing context. The issue has become particularly prominent in Quang Ninh
province, which currently faces an unanticipated high rate of urbanization. Communes
slotted for extension of water schemes have surpassed population levels and density to
qualify as rural areas under NTP3. As these communes are officially upgraded to the
administrative level of townships they can no longer receive program funding. As a
result, PCERWASS in Quanh Ninh has encountered difficulties finding “qualified?
areas with suitable conditions for program implementation and has sought to lobby for
                                                                                                     39
a solution that would quality these newly recognized townships for NTP3 funding.



Bureaucratic hurdles, largely outside the span of control of the NTP SO and PCERWASSs
illustrate the vulnerability of the Program to local policy whims and conditions.

An environment of fiscal austerity imposed by the central authority has placed restrictions on
public investment, culminating in the Vietnam Law on Public Procurement, which took effect in
2015. This law states that at least 30% of the budget must be committed in order for a project to
proceed with approval. However, the law has been interpreted differently in different provinces. As
the PforR disburses only on achievement of verified results both Hanoi and Vinh Phuc PPCs have
interpreted this to mean PforR funds are not guaranteed and did not approve budget for construction
of new Water Supply Schemes, opting instead to prioritize existing schemes so as not to risk going
further into debt. Other provinces have received a waiver, allowing them to begin construction on
necessary schemes. The issue highlights again the lack of pre-financing capital and the problems
this leads to, as well as the need for ongoing dialogue between the NTP SO and the PPCs to
surmount these policy hurdles.

A second salient policy barrier voiced by program implementers is Joint Circular 0429, which limits
public spending on compensation for additional work or tasks completed for project collaborators.
The Circular limits the number of local collaborators, places a cap on compensation (100,000 –
120,000 VND (4-6 USD) per month), and does not provide for expenses and incidentals of
collaborators.

These financial regulations have reportedly affected resources available for monitoring as well as
Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities, especially for sanitation. To
effectively reach households and achieve the targets a large number of commune collaborators are
needed. On average, to encourage one household to adopt a hygienic household latrine requires a
collaborator to visit the household up to eight times. This does not take into account the day to day
work a collaborator has to do. Such regulations limit the pool of potential collaborators, which
could vary across project areas and is not sustainable.

Collaborative efforts between separate agencies on monitoring program results has increased
the efficiency and quality of reporting, but has not translated into improvements in NTP
monitoring.

NTP monitoring is a cumbersome, costly and arduous process. On an annual basis village heads,
health workers or representatives of local unions gather and report on 8 core indicators for NTP30.
Monitoring may require household visits or in some provinces village level data is reported using
the health monitoring information system. Collaborators at the commune and district level
summarize the data and submit it to PCERWASS, where it is digitized and transmitted to
NCERWASS at the central level.

The process is fraught with data quality issues stemming from insufficient funding, lack of training,
and limited supervision and oversight. The process relies on a full census of households, making it

impractical to conduct frequent monitoring. There is also a tendency for local staff to report higher
results, influenced by the ‘formalistic achievement issue’ 31 which is prevalent in the reporting
system in Vietnam.

Box 3: Over-reporting comes back to haunt


A baseline verification of commune coverage of commune-wide sanitation was
conducted in January 2013 at the start of the program. The purpose of the baseline
verification was to provide information on the reliability of NTP monitoring data as a
reflection of true coverage of hygienic latrines and to assess the level of effort required
for communes to achieve the requirements for DLI 2.2.

In four of the eight PforR provinces the baseline verification did not find statistically
significant differences between NTP monitoring data and coverage established through
the baseline. For the other four provinces, reported coverage of hygienic latrines in the
NTP system was statistically significantly greater than the coverage established in the
baseline verification.

Because it was not possible to estimate with precision the degree of over-reporting in the
NTP monitoring data, communes reported to have coverage greater than 70% were
categorically excluded from eligibility under the program. Some provinces later lobbied
MARD to re-verify eligibility of 29 communes they claimed to have lower coverage.


Given the limitations of NTP monitoring a main objective of the PforR is to improve sector
monitoring systems and processes. There are already indications that monitoring and reporting
capacity has increased and quality of data has improved substantially. But there is little evidence of
spillovers of these improvements to NTP monitoring – monitoring for NTP is still proceeding in
parallel.

Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the percentages of reported coverage of hygienic
latrines and verified coverage in each commune that claimed eligibility for commune wide
sanitation (DLI 2.2). The correlation between reported and verified coverage is lower in the first
year of verification, but increases in the second year suggesting that provinces may be conducting
more rigorous quality checks prior to reporting final results.

     This refers to the practice where the results are often over-reported in hoping of receiving recognition or other benefits.

Under PforR a collaborative approach is taken to monitoring and reporting results. The agency
holding front-line responsibility for the DLI is in charge of monitoring and reporting on it, with the
results collated across agencies at the provincial level and reported by the PCERWASS to the
central level. For example, DLI 1.1 is monitored by PCERWASS and is based on reporting from
contractors and supervision consultants of installed household water connections. DLIs on
sanitation (1.2 and 2.2) are monitored and reported by provincial PMC using the existing health
system reporting network, which relies on village health workers/collaborators to PHC. The DoET
monitors investment progress of latrines in schools as part of DLI 2.2.

Several differences in definitions and indicators between the PforR and NTP3 have made it difficult
to harmonize the two systems. Household water connections, sustainability of water supply
schemes, and Commune-wide sanitation are not tracked by NTP3, and the definition of hygienic
sanitation under PforR uses the more stringent MoH definition. There is also a slight, but
meaningful difference in the definition of ‘household’. Under NTP3 a household is a single unit in
the registration system while under PforR a household as a group of people living under the same
roof where all the family members live in regardless of the number of households registered. 32 The

     V.       Factors Associated with Achievement of Results
Concentration of resources among a set of pre-identified targets has contributed to success.
In a departure from the traditional NTP approach, the PforR in the 8 RRD provinces has
concentrated funding across a limited number of water schemes and communes in order to achieve
the DLIs. Spreading resources too thin was identified as a main weakness of the NTP, since funds
were rarely adequate to achieve target connections. The relative reliability and ring-fenced budget,
together with the pressure to achieve results, has helped to focus program plans on achievable
results and meet the targets.

Linking of targets on water and sanitation proved less influential for increasing focus on
sanitation than simply having a dedicated DLI
One of the key design elements of the PforR was to include dedicated DLIs for sanitation to ensure
a balanced focus between water supply and sanitation activities. However, rather than assign a
larger monetary value to sanitation DLIs, which were not commensurate with the cost associated
with these activities, the project design linked disbursement for water targets to those of sanitation,
under the assumption that the monetary value assigned to the sanitation DLIs may not be a
sufficient incentive. The lower of the target achieved for water or sanitation DLIs would determine
the disbursement of the DLI.

Linking the targets has proved cumbersome and there was insufficient evidence that this
incentivized sanitation: achievement of sanitation DLIs has been strong in the first 2 years of
implementation, and it is not clear that linking the sanitation and water targets was any more
effective than simply having a dedicated DLI for sanitation. As part of the restructuring at mid-term
review these targets were de-linked to ease cash flow constraints, and a new DLI on sustainable
school sanitation was developed. It remains to be seen whether these changes will influence the
attention given to sanitation under the program.

Endorsement of program targets and objectives by provincial leaders is associated with
achievement of targets.
The provincial steering committee, led by the Deputy Chairman or Head of the Provincial People’s
Committee (PPC), plays a critical role on managing and coordinating the implementation activities
among relevant actors, especially in light of the limited decision making power and authority of the
NTP SO. Working closely with staff at all levels, providing clear directions and interacting with
local residents have created the pressure incentive for better performance and more pro-active
attitudes by lower staff, smoother inter-agency cooperation and better awareness of local residents.

There are indications that where TA activities were carried out, they benefited program
results.
Effective coordination was still a major issue in the first year of the program, but improved
significantly in the second year with the support of the TA consultant. The TA packages for
sanitation are believed to have contributed to the significant improvement in sanitation results
between 2013 and 2014.33 The consultant was contracted in 2014 and provided strong planning and
coordination support to the provinces at the commune level. In 2013 just one province (Bac Ninh)
achieved the provincial level sanitation target, while in 2014 all except Hung Yen exceeded the
target.


33
  According to an official of VIHEMA, there are four technical packages for sanitation[1] that focused on capacity building for the
health staff on communication skill, planning and report writing, and development of supply chain management for sanitation in
rural area

                                                                                                                                 44
Results verification has improved outcomes. Independent results verification is a key element of
the PforR and there is strong evidence that verification has been an incentive to improve results
over time. For program staff at the central level verification helps safeguard the accuracy of
reported results especially given the recognized weaknesses of NTP monitoring. Stakeholders from
provincial to village level report that independent verification of results by SAV has created high
pressure for performance. Guaranteeing the reliability and integrity of the verification process has
been a critical task for the World Bank and Client team in designing an effective PforR.


The accuracy and reliability of monitoring under the PforR is further enhanced through
intense supervision activities.
Village health collaborators frequently visit households to guide the latrine construction process
and ensure the latrines meet the hygienic criteria outlined under the DLI. This is mandatory for
households receiving a subsidy or ‘demonstration’ latrine. According to the household survey
conducted for this evaluation, 57 percent of households reported that they were visited by a local
agent for evaluation and acceptance of the latrines after construction. Among them, 39.7 percent
had received a subsidy.

In addition, provincial staff supervise the construction of water schemes, connections, and
household latrines to get updated data on implementation progress and quality of work. From the
central level NCERWASS staff likewise conduct monthly supervision to the provinces to monitor
implementation progress and construction of water schemes. Prior to submission of the final
comprehensive results NCERWASS performs site-checks to verify the accuracy of the results
reported by the provinces and provides recommendations before the final CRR of the provinces is
sent to NTP SO. Finally, the World Bank has conducted various supervision visits to monitor
outputs and quality. These extra levels of supervision have led to better data and helped to improve
the cost-efficiency of verification.

  VI.      Recommendations for Program Design Variations
A key objective of the evaluation was to identify program design modifications, which could be
rigorously tested through impact evaluation during later stages of the program or future phases of
the NTP, and that could ease some of the barriers to achieving program objectives, results and
strengthening institutions. Based on the evaluation findings four main design variations are
proposed below. Some of these directly address the weaknesses identified in the NTP that the
PforR was not able to fully resolve in the first 2 years of implementation (see Table 13 below).

   (1) Experiment with innovative targeting mechanisms to align NTP with poverty
       reduction goals

The PforR of NTP in the Red River Delta was designed to be poor inclusive, but its main objectives
were to improve the cost-efficiency and sustainability of the NTP. Over the life of the program a
greater alignment between resource needs and community selection can be achieved, simply
through saturation of water and sanitation services in the region: those who remain without access
are more likely to be poor, marginalized and remote populations. Going forward, and in particular
as the rural Development NTP penetrates deeper into the Northern Mountains and Central
Highlands regions where the majority of poor, ethnic minority population live, it will become more
important to find ways to shift public resources towards those most in need. The design of future
PforRs should experiment with incorporating special provisions for poor communities, such as
requiring that a certain percentage of targets are achieved through service delivery to these
segments, or assigning higher monetary value to DLIs which target the poor.

   (2) Understand and address barriers to take-up of piped water connections

An understanding of household willingness and ability to pay for both connection fees, and other
connection expenditures, as well as for water usage will be critical – the evaluation confirms that
price is a major constraint to take up and use of piped water, especially in parts of the Red River
Delta where households are accustomed to abundant sources of free rain or groundwater. A
complementary experimental study on willingness to pay for piped water connections and tariffs is
underway with An Thinh utility in Bac Ninh province. Besides experimentally testing different
price subsidies, the study will correlate willingness to pay for piped connections (through Becker-
Degroot-Marschak method) with household characteristics, and combine this with data from the
Vietnam Living Standards Survey to predict willingness to pay for piped connections in the 21
provinces of the NM-CH PforR. The evidence from this study could inform whether targeted
subsidies to the poor are needed, especially as both PforRs penetrate more deeply into poorer areas.

Besides further understanding price incentives for adoption and usage of piped water, greater
innovation in IEC activities may be needed to meet the targets going forward. IEC activities
currently draw on outdated, didactic campaign approaches, which fail to address the rapidly
changing context in Vietnam (desire for convenience and modernity). If one of the main barriers to
adoption of piped water connections is availability of alternative, free sources, campaigns may need
to focus on the health consequences of these other sources (pollution in rainwater, unpredictable
rainfall patterns, arsenic or other contaminants in groundwater), or highlight the convenience and
prestige attributes of piped water.

   (3) Experiment with sub-national performance incentives

The overarching issue faced by the program at the midterm review are the high unit costs stemming
from system overdesign, uniform allocation of program targets across provinces with different

                                                                                                 46
underlying geographic conditions and cost structures, and low procurement savings. Provinces that
have successfully achieved the targets within the allocated budget are not able to benefit from their
good performance since MARD and NTP SO are unwilling to reallocate targets (and corresponding
budget). There is a risk that the implicit incentive for provinces to realize cost savings to reinvest in
further works could eventually dry up if good performing provinces are not rewarded.

The program could experiment with performance-based incentive grants at sub-national level, i.e.
to the PCERWASS, to demonstrate whether targeted funds for additional investment are an
effective and cost-effective approach to achieve better results. This could also incentivize provinces
with higher underlying costs to find innovative ways to reduce cost.

   (4) Introduce innovations in results monitoring and verification to streamline the process
       and reduce costs

The use of mobile phones to monitor program outputs and conduct results verification has
massively reduced the cost and increased the transparency of monitoring and verification. However,
the cost of these activities is still high (approximately US$ 500,000 annually), and could be a
barrier to scaling up the PforR approach more broadly. For instance, verification of results of the
Results Based Scaling Up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program in 21 provinces located in
the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands regions is a major undertaking. If the same
approach as was used in the Red River Delta is used for this program the cost is over US$ 1 million
per year in verification costs alone.

Closer linkages between monitoring and verification could reduce the human resource requirements
of verification. For example, a GPS stamp of the location of a toilet collected by a monitoring agent
can be tracked by a verification agent to certify it is the same toilet. Sensor technology could also
be deployed at different points of the water system, and even at the household level, to monitor
quality and quantity of water supplied.

 VII.      Conclusion
The PforR of RWSS under the NTP3 in the Red River Delta is the first PforR in the East Asia and
Pacific Region, and the first in the Water and Sanitation sector. The GoV chose to pursue a PforR
to significantly improve the sustainability of water systems and the quality of the water produced,
as well as push the sanitation agenda and make institutional changes to enhance delivery of rural
water and sanitation services.

On the results front, the program has faced challenges, but program-wide targets are considered
acceptable. In 2013 96 percent of DLI 1 was met and 70 percent of DLI 2 was met. The targets for
sanitation were met or exceeded in 2014, while targets for water supply connections were partially
achieved (65%). In both years the targets for DLI 3 were fully achieved.

Overall program financing to the 8 provinces is almost a seven-fold increase from NTP allocation
to the same 8 provinces prior to commencement of the Program, and for the 2015 implementing
year PforR financing is just under the entire NTP3 budget allocation for the same year, excluding
PforR funds. Given the large disparities in funding it is difficult to compare results in PforR areas
to those in comparison areas and attribute any differences to the results-based approach. It also
raises the question of whether the approach in the Red River Delta PforR is scalable and replicable.
The new PforR on Results Based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply in the Northern
Mountains and Central Highlands (NM-CH) will allocate a credit of 200 million USD with
anticipated co-financing of 25.5 million USD from the Vietnam government over 21 provinces with
much greater need and lower capacity. Taking water supply connections as an example, the Red
River Delta PforR allocated the amount of 128 million USD towards 340,000 new functioning
water connections (US$ 376 per connection), while in the NM-CH PforR 73 million USD will be
disbursed upon achievement of 255,000 new or rehabilitated water supply connections (US$ 286
per connection), despite higher unit costs in the region.

The success of the PforR in strengthening institutions is less evident. Poor program planning and
budgeting continue to persist, largely due to budget allocation procedures that undermine the
results-based approach and lack appropriate incentives for good performance. The shift to a results-
based approach is even less evident at lower level institutions where program implementation
actually takes place. From the perspective of the province there is little difference in practice
between the results-based approach and the investment project approach. Additionally, the program
has struggled to operate under the budget support mentality, and only a fraction of the anticipated
co-financing has reached the program.

Capacity for program monitoring and verification is a notable exception and the evidence suggests
that increased attention to program results, increased rigor of monitoring and reporting, and
independent verification have improved the accuracy of reporting systems, and led to better results.

Going forward, and in particular as the rural Development NTP penetrates deeper into the Northern
Mountains and Central Highlands regions where the majority of poor, ethnic minority population
live, the PforR will have to adapt the approach to serve a less populous population with fewer
resources. Strengthened capacity of the central coordination body on aspects of planning, financial
management and procurement, and designated this central body with the authority to make program
will be critical for effective program implementation. Finally, it will be critical to understand
whether performance-based grants at the sub-national level are an effective incentive for achieving
results.

Households benefiting from the program are most often headed by males who are 54 years of age
on average, from the Kinh ethnic group and with secondary or high school education. The average
number of people living in the household is 4.4 and most households are categorized as non-poor,35
although 11% of the households benefiting from the program on sanitation are categorized as poor.

34
  According to the Decision No.9/2011/QD-TTG issuing the standards of poor and near-poor households applied for the period
2011-2015, a poor householdin rural areas is a household with income from VND 400,000 (USD18.27)/people/month and lower, a
near-poor household has income from VND 401,000 to VND 520,000/people/month (USD18.3 – USD23.75).For comparison
purpose, in this report, households that are neither poor households or near-poor households are generalized as non-poor
households.
35
   This is consistent with the national level of poverty rate, which is 9.8% in 2013 (General Statistics Office, Statiscal Handbook of
Vietnam 2014), especially taking into account the fact that PforR are not targeting the poor areas.


                                                                                                                                  53
Beneficiaries noted improvements in family member’s health and living environment due to piped
water service, and this was reflected in feedback from focus group respondents. While the majority
of respondents indicated no change in family members’ health or living environment, 38% said the
family’s health had improved and 48% noted improvement in the family’s living environment
(Figure 7).

Households are consuming sizeable quantities of water on average, approximating the standards for
which the schemes were designed. The average household piped water consumption was 9 cubic
meters (m3) in the month before the survey. Only 6.5% of respondents reported not having used
piped water. Reported volume of water consumption is highest in Hung Yen (12.8 m3) and lowest
in Quang Ninh (6.2 m3). In total households reporting consuming between 0 and 65 m3 of piped
water in the past month, but the majority of households consumed between 1 and 10 m3 (Figure 8).
Water consumption is significantly lower among poor and near poor: 6.8 liter versus 10.1 liter.

Quality of alternative sources of water influences usage patterns and variation is seen across the
provinces. In Thanh Hoa, where water contamination is prevalent, usage of piped water is generally
higher than other provinces, whereas households in Bac Ninh, Ha Nam and Hung Yen maintain a
habit of using rainwater for cooking. In Phu Tho, groundwater is perceived to be of good quality
and households continue to use water from private tube wells (Table 15).

Some households expressed concern about the quality of piped water in focus group discussions,
noting that water quality certificates were not accessible and quality issues were experienced
previously with NTP schemes.

Only 25 percent of respondents at the time of the survey believed that piped water was safe for
drinking directly from the source, but this did not affect the volume of water used in the past month.
Perceived safety of the water was related to water quality issues reported by the households.

Despite overall satisfaction, many respondents reported some issues with the water, such as odor,
turbidity, taste and color. Of those reported on water quality issues (Error! Reference source not
found.), a large proportion (45.1%) reported odor (chlorine), even though most households
acknowledged the presence of this odor as a characteristic of piped water. Turbidity was also
reported by 17.8% of households. Strange taste (salty, musty taste, etc.) and color (muddy white,
yellow, green, etc.) were reported by a small number of respondents.

Surveyed households are generally satisfied with the water supply services and the vast majority of
respondents have a positive evaluation on the appropriateness of the water supply service with its
cost.

Survey respondents report stable and continuous water service delivery. Only 17.5% of respondents
reported the water had been unavailable at some point since installation. The number of times water
was unavailable was 5.5 times, but households reported these cases mostly occurred during testing
or during the first days of operation so did not seriously impact household satisfaction.

Alternative sources of water, such as rainwater, boreholes and protected wells, are still used by a
significant proportion of households for drinking and cooking. Piped water has become the most
common water source for 65 percent of households surveyed, but water usage patterns show the
continued use of multiple water sources for domestic use (Figure 11). Especially in provinces of
Bac Ninh, Ha Nam and Hung Yen, most households still used rainwater for drinking and cooking.
At the time of the survey only around one-fifth of households exclusively use piped water for
domestic activities.

The cost-efficiency and sustainability of water schemes constructed under the PforR depends
greatly on household usage of piped water. Several factors may affect people’s demand for piped
water including income, people’s awareness of benefits of clean water, and availability of other
alternative clean water sources.

At the time of the survey, water tariffs ranged from VND 4,000– VND 6,000 (USD 0.18 – USD
0.27) and some provinces also apply quantity-based price discrimination (block tariff schedule),
charging higher price per cubic meter at higher quantities of water consumed.


A typical beneficiary household reported paying an average of VND 59,00036 (USD 2.7) for piped
water in the month prior to the survey (Table 16). On average households in Hanoi pay the largest
amount due to the larger volume of water consumed, up to VND 100,412 (USD 4.6). In contrast,
households in Quang Ninh paid the lowest amount VND 35,222 (USD 1.6) on average. None of the
households in Thanh Hoa had paid for water since installation.

In addition to the water tariff, beneficiaries are required to make a contribution to the capital cost of

     These data are calculated among households that have used water (the volume of water consumed > 0).


                                                                                                                 57
the water scheme, as well as pay for a water meter and any other materials or labor to install the
connection. According to focus group respondents, these expenses are relatively acceptable to
households. However, some participants complained about the high cost of installation of the water
connection (water meter), especially after the capital cost contribution had already been made.

Eighty-five percent of respondents recalled costs associated with installation of the water
connection, which captures any costs such as a connection fee, water meter, material costs, and
labor for installation. Of these, 20 percent reported paying nothing, while the remainder paid an
average of VND 1.3 million. Households that reported paying nothing were predominately non-
poor (84%) and reported costs for poor and near-poor households were on average higher than non-
poor households (VND 1.5 million vs. VND 1.3 million) (Table 17). Focus group respondents
expressed concern that the installation costs may deter poor and near poor households from
connecting to the system.

The majority of households (80 percent) used current income or savings to pay for the costs of
installation (Figure 12). Others sold agricultural products (14 percent) or borrowed from family.
Less than 2 percent of households had to sell off assets or take out interest bearing loans. Almost no
households reported receiving a subsidy for the connection. Out of the total sample of 40 poor and
near-poor households, one household reported receiving a subsidy.

Information about piped water supply is reaching households through the traditional channels of
community meetings and loudspeaker announcements. While a community meeting is usually
conducted prior to or during the planning phase of the scheme to solicit the 10 percent capital cost
contribution from beneficiaries, only 39 percent of respondents reported being informed about the
plan to build a water scheme. Community meetings are reported as the most common way for
households to receive information about piped water supply services, with 72 percent of households
being informed through this method (Figure 13). Loudspeaker announcements, public notice boards,
and personal communication through friends and relatives are other common sources of
information.

Households prefer to build bathrooms when investing in new toilet facilities, leading to large
expenditures on average. Due to farming and animal husbandry practices in the Red River Delta,
households often have separate rooms for latrines and for bathing, with the latrine often constructed
near the animal pens. When upgrading their latrine they prefer to wait to build the toilet as part of a
larger construction unit (i.e. bathroom). For beneficiaries in the PforR provinces, 85 percent built
the latrine along with a bathroom, resulting in very high costs compared to other rural sanitation
projects in Vietnam and the region.
On average, the amount spent on construction of a latrine alone is VND 15.7 million (USD 717.22),
of which materials account for the majority (64.7%) and labor for over a quarter (29.1%). For those
who build a bathroom expenditure was around VND 43.5 million (USD 1,987.2)38.
In general, the poor and near poor household have costs lower than the non-poor households. The
detailed cost of construction is shown in Table 18.

The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP), is one source of support for investments in domestic
sanitation through a lending facility that covers up to 60 percent of the capital cost of a latrine,
allowing households to spread the cost of improvements over five years. Interest rates are fixed
below current market rates, delivering a modest subsidy to borrowers. Just over a quarter (26.5%)
of households borrowed from a bank to finance construction of the toilet. Of households that took a
loan 43 percent borrowed from the VBSP and 38 percent from the Agribank. Reported loan
amounts from VBSP was VND 17.8 million, while from Agribank it was VND 54.9 million.


A larger proportion of poor and near-poor households borrowed for construction of the hygienic
latrine facility (37.8% vs. 23.6%) with average size of the loan the same across these groups for
VBSP borrowers, while loan size from Agribank for non-poor households was almost double that
of poor and non-poor households.

Construction of a hygienic sanitation facility is a substantial investment for rural households. The
average annual household income in the program area ranges from VND 20 million (USD 913.66)
to VND 30 million (USD 1,370.5), while construction costs of new hygienic latrines range from
VND 15 million (USD 685.24) for latrines up to VND 50 million (USD 2,284.15) for bathrooms.


                                                                                                                                                          61
There is a strong preference for water based latrines with septic tank, even among the lower income
groups, while this model generally costs more than other hygienic latrine options.

Among 400 surveyed households with newly constructed latrines, 23.3% received a subsidy for the
investment ranging from VND 1 million to VND 7 million (USD 319.78) (Table 20). On average, a
household received VND 3.1 million (USD 141.62) for construction of the latrine, accounting for
around 20% of cost for the average latrine. According to current regulations, latrine subsidies
cannot exceed 70% of the construction cost of the hygienic latrine for poor households and policy-
favoured households and 35% for near-poor households.39

Table 21 presents data from the Comprehensive Results Reports (CRR) of 2013 and 2014 41 ,
showing households that received support for building demonstration latrines in the first two years
of the program. On average, around 30 percent of the households receive support for construction
of latrines, according to the CRR: 29.3 percent in 2013 and 37.1 percent in 2014. These figures are
higher than reported by households in the survey (23.3 percent), despite the fact that the survey is a
representative sample of program beneficiaries in the first 2 years of the program. Across the
provinces, Thanh Hoa has the highest proportion of households receiving financial support (71.4%
in 2013 and 83.8% in 2014), while Vinh Phuc has the lowest proportion.

Preface


     In this preface, the World Bank task teams explains the background, modalities, output and outcome of
the Technical Assistance (TA) Impact of Rural Land Registration on Vulnerable Population in Romania
(P150499). The TA resulted in the preparation of the report Systematic Registration and Vulnerable Groups
in Rural Romania: Observations and recommendations. The report summarizes observations made a 6 rural
administrative areas (UATs), four of which were targeted by Systematic Registration. The report also
presents recommendations on how to increase participation of vulnerable groups in systematic registration.

    Background

     The World Bank support to the Land Registration Sector in Romania has been programmatic and
continuous since 1998. The General Cadastre and Land Registration Project (1998 – 2003) supported the
establishment of an efficient system for securing land titles and a cost-effective mechanism for land
transactions. The most significant result was the institutional reform from a dual agency land administration
system to a single land administration agency - in line with international good practice. The National Agency
for Cadastre and Real Estate Publicity (ANCPI) began operating in January 2005.

     The follow-on Complementing EU Support for Agricultural Restructuring Project (CESAR, 2009 –
2013) was to facilitate first registration to the land book, and it resulted in the establishment of a
methodology for a systematic land registration activity. However, during project implementation ANCPI
faced setbacks in securing budget allocation for systematic registration. In 2013, CESAR had to be
suspended due to the inability of government to fund the project. Despite this major setback, ANCPI sought
to restore its ability to pursue reforms and land registration campaigns that would enhance its daily
operations in a financially sustainable, efficient, customer-oriented, and socially inclusive manner.

     In this context, the Government of Romania requested Bank support through a Reimbursable Advisory
Services (RAS) task, the Real Estate System Modernization technical assistance (TA, P145716). The RAS
TA provided technical assistance to the government to reform the entire real property sector. The TA helped
ANCPI to initiate significant reforms in its policy, regulatory, and institutional framework. The TA
supported the preparation of a draft Strategy for Systematic and Sporadic Registration, a draft National
Program for Cadastre and Land Book, and a draft Application for EU financing of a major Rural Land
Registration Program during the EU’s Programmatic Period 2012-2020. The First Fiscal Effectiveness and
Growth Development Policy Loan (FEG-DPL I, 2014) supported parallel measures to improve the
operational and financial independence of ANCPI. In addition, both the RAS TA and the DPL supported
legal reform to draft a new Cadastre and Real Estate Registration law. The upcoming FEG-DPL II will
continue to support the sector in regards to the implementation of the new law and progress with the National
Program for Cadastre and Land Book.

     This PSIA was initiated in April 2014 as a complementary activity to the RAS TA, with the aim to
increase ANCPI’s capacity to include vulnerable groups in the systematic land registration program and
mitigate potential negative social impacts. ANCPI had piloted systematic registration under CESAR and was
planning on scaling up the work under the EU program (2012 – 2020) funded Systematic Land Registration
Program.

     The 2012-2020 Systematic Land Registration Program was expected to cover more than a third of
Romania's rural administrative areas (UATs). The overall economic impact of this program was expected to
be positive and significant. However, it was also recognized that specific measures needed to be adopted to
ensure that the rights of vulnerable groups (especially those of rural Roma communities) would be duly
registered and to monitor the impact of real property rights registration on these populations.

     Under the PSIA, the Bank and ANCPI agreed to: 1) Create of a typology of vulnerable groups in
Romania; 2) Conduct field surveys in UATs targeted by the CESAR project to investigate the impact of
systematic registration on vulnerable groups; 3) Assess the potential impact of the 2016-2020 Systematic

                                                                                                           1
Land Registration Program; and 4) Prepare guiding tools and methodologies to identify and address the
challenges of vulnerable groups in the Land Registration Program.

     Execution of work

     The PSIA work was contracted out to the Romanian firm Metro Media Transilvania.

     In line with the Terms of Reference, a mixed methods approach was used, combining quantitative and
qualitative methods (i.e. household survey, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions). Quantitative
analysis enabled comparisons between subgroups and by key variables (e.g. income levels, counties, project
vs. non project localities, etc.). Qualitative analysis generated rich detail and insights into underlying issues
not accessible through survey work.

     Fieldwork was carried out in February 2015. Six UATs were sampled in two counties. Four UATs were
drawn from a list of CESAR’s target UATs. Two UATs, which were not targeted by the project were also
included for comparison purposes. The sample included 480 households, comprising of 360 households from
Roma groups and 120 households from other vulnerable groups defined as disabled persons, illiterate
persons, elderly persons, convicts or indicted persons.

     A draft report was submitted to the Bank in March, 2015. The report was reviewed by the Bank, the
ANCPI, and a short term consultant (STC, Nils Junge, who was selected for this task given his past
experience with PSIAs. Based on the reviews, significant revisions were requested of the contractor. Among
others, Metro Media Transilvania was requested to include additional analyses, clarify the main findings, and
make the report more readable and accessible.

     A revised version of the report was submitted to the Bank in September 2015. While substantially
improved, the revised report still required further work and the Bank decided to hire Mr. Junge to work with
the Bank team and Metro Media Transilvania in the preparation of a final report.

     The final report was received by the Bank in e October 2015.

     Report’s finding and recommendations

     The report provides valuable information on the participation of vulnerable groups in the CESAR
project, as well as recommendations on how to improve the participation of vulnerable groups in systematic
land registration. These findings and recommendations will help ANCPI ensure that vulnerable groups are
included in future systematic land registration work. The report is particularly timely as ANCPI is now
scaling up systematic registration under the 2016-2020 Systematic Land Registration Program.

     Among others, the report shows that:

    1. Limited knowledge – Public information campaigns have a positive effect, but appear to be
       reaching a limited number of vulnerable households. In some areas, knowledge about land
       registration and procedures involved is extremely low. More intensive awareness campaigns
       are needed when implementing the National Program for Cadastre and Land Book and the EU
       financed Rural Land Registration Program’s systematic registration campaigns.

    2. Limited participation – Where CESAR was fully implemented, 27 percent of households
       still have no property documents, and 54 percent have ownership titles. Only a minority of
       respondents felt the project helped their household. This is a thought provoking, yet also
       questionable, finding in terms of such a large share of rural population not having property
       documents. Such should not be possible against what the Bank team and ANCPI knows. The
       finding underlines the necessity to systematically analyze the impact of every closing
       systematic registration campaign. Under the EU financed Rural Land Registration Program,
       this type of analysis will be covered by the Social Monitoring activity.

                                                                                                               2
    3. Lack of identification documents –Constraints inhibiting registration – The most common
       reasons given for why people did not obtain property documents were lack of money and the
       fact that municipal authorities did not issue documents required in the process. Another
       issue inhibiting land registration is the lack of identification documents by beneficiaries. The
       matter was addressed by the CESAR project together with local authorities, but going
       forward it is important to mainstream more strongly ID documentation to the systematic
       registration campaign.

    4. Willingness to pay to obtain proof of ownership is quite low – The majority of respondents
       declared being unwilling to pay to obtain proof of ownership. Therefore, without external
       support, interest in land registration among is likely to remain low. This finding relates to
       the access and costs of notarial certifications, as well as inheritance and transfer taxes that
       have jointly made rural land registration unfeasible for an average family. The matter is
       addressed in the systematic registration process, but the finding (again) highlights the fact
       that the matter should also be addressed in the sporadic (transaction by transaction)
       registration process.

    5. Short-term benefits of systematic registration – Systematic registration appears to help
       vulnerable groups registering an address, entering into contracts with utility providers,
       completing inheritance processes and resolving family conflicts. This confirms one of the
       logics of Romania investing in rural land registration campaign, which is that the systematic
       registration is a key action to end perpetuated marginalization from the formal society.

    The report also presents a number of recommendations on how to improve systematic registration,
which are highly relevant to the design and implementation of the National Program for Cadastre and Land
Book, and the EU financed Rural Land Registration Program. These recommendations include:

    1. Improve communication with beneficiaries – ANCPI should pay greater attention to the
       public awareness campaign, a key factor in assuring owners’ effective collaboration.
       Communication with beneficiaries should present the expected benefits and clearly specify
       that registration is free;

    2. Improve community participation – Work with people from the community or institution
       representatives who are knowledgeable about private properties, conflicts, property size, etc.
       Some of these people may have witnessed old transactions and they could help mediate
       conflicts, should they arise.

    3. Strengthen partnerships – Promote good communication and a true partnership among key
       actors, notably between the Office for Cadaster and Land Registration (county branch of
       ANCPI), contractors, and local public authorities.

    4. Supplement OCPI personnel – There appears to be a lack of sufficient personnel at the level
       of the local authorities. Ensuring closer involvement of local authorities and supplementing
       OCPI personnel could make the process more efficient and improve communication.

      The Bank team recognizes that the report has some methodological limitations, largely due to
insufficient funding and the limited capacity of the contractor to conduct complex evaluations. As a result,
the findings should be interpreted with caution for the following reasons:

    1. The report covers only two counties which are not representative of the country as a whole,
       and sampling units were not chosen randomly and they were small in size;



                                                                                                          3
    2. Some respondents were not selected randomly, but based on information provided by local
       authorities;

    3. The survey only targeted vulnerable individuals and does not compare vulnerable and non-
       vulnerable populations.

     Despite the mentioned methodological and coverage limitations, this PSIA provided substantive
recommendations to ANCPI in improving its efforts to reach out and interaction with vulnerable groups,
most of which have already been adopted by ANCPI to the National Program for Cadastre and Land Book
and the EU financed Rural Land Registration Program design and implementation. Therefore, this PSIA has
met its development objective to increase the ability of ANCPI to include vulnerable groups in the
systematic land registration program and mitigate potential negative social impacts and can therefore be
closed. However, the PSIA also reveals the importance of continuous monitoring of the impact of systematic
registration to vulnerable groups and the Bank will need to pay attention that vulnerability mapping/social
monitoring exercise remains as a mainstreamed part of the systematic registration process in Romania. More
generally, the PSIA provides important background information and specific recommendations to other the
Bank supported discourse and activities related to the inclusion of Roma (and other vulnerable groups).

                     Systematic Registration on Rural Romania



Introduction

     The objective of this Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) is to assess the impact of
systematic registration on vulnerable individuals, in general, and Roma, in particular. Specifically,
this PSIA focuses on the systematic registration approach piloted under the Complementing EU
Support for Agricultural Restructuring (CESAR, 2009 - 2013) Project, which was supported by the
World Bank. The World Bank involvement in the sector dates back to 1998 and the General
Cadastre and Land Registration Project that supported the establishment of an efficient system for
securing and trading land titles.
     When CESAR became effective in 2009, the lack of reliable information on real property rights
in Romania was a major issue affecting the development of the country. Since the early 1990s,
Romania, implementing a post-communism land reform, had issued land titles to most property
owners. However, the titles were of variable quality, often inaccurate, and rarely registered in
Romania’s real property rights registration system (the Land Book). Owners had the option of
registering their property rights sporadically, however, most had not done that due to associated
costs and hurdles. Therefore, a systematic approach to register real property rights was seen as
critical to the establishment of a reliable and market facilitating real property rights system.
    CESAR piloted a systematic registration approach including approaches to identify and
monitor the participation of vulnerable groups. Prior to initiating the work, the National Agency for
Cadastre and Land Registration (ANCPI) conducted a survey (called vulnerability mapping) to
identify vulnerable groups and individuals in the target administrative-territorial unit (UATs). These
vulnerable groups and individuals included disabled, illiterates, elderlies, convicts, widows, minors,
and ethnic minorities. During implementation, work was announced through public awareness
campaigns, and the surveying firms contracted to carry out the systematic registration work were
required to pay particular attention to the identified vulnerable groups. Also, registration fees were
waved in order to encourage participation. Finally, CESAR contracted specialized firm for social
monitoring to verify the result of the process to the identified vulnerable groups.
     The World Bank support to CESAR was closed in 2013 with a number of unfinished
systematic registration contracts due to consistent problems to authorize budget for the activity.
While CESAR failed to make a mass impact, it was successful in piloting the systematic registration
of real property rights in 50 UATs and creating (and establishing in law) a new participatory
systematic registration methodology to Romania.
     Despite the challenges, the government continued to implement the systematic registration
campaigns including the initially Bank financed contracts. After CESAR, ANCPI focused on
restoring its ability to pursue new reforms and land registration campaigns to enhance daily
operations in a financially sustainable, efficient, customer-oriented and socially inclusive manner.

     When this PSIA was initiated in 2014, ANCPI had initiated the preparation of national level
systematic land registration program with the Technical Assistance (TA) by the World Bank, which
was financed by the EU’s Operational Program for Technical Assistance. Among others, the TA
was helping ANCPI to initiate significant reforms in its policy, regulatory and institutional
framework. Importantly, the TA materialized into a draft Strategy for Systematic and Sporadic

                                                                                                        5
Registration, a draft National Program for Cadastre and Land Book, and a draft Application for EU
financing of a major Rural Land Registration Program for EU’s Programmatic Period 2012-2020.
     The overall economic impact of the National Program was estimated to be extremely positive
with eightfold return to the investment. However, it was also recognized that specific measures
needed to be adopted to ensure that the rights of vulnerable groups (especially those of rural Roma
communities) would be duly registered and to monitor the impact of real property rights registration
to vulnerable groups and individuals.
     This PSIA was conceived as a complementary activity to the TA to increase ANCPI’s capacity
to monitor the social impact of the systematic land registration program and to encourage the
participation of vulnerable groups. To do so, the PSIA assesses the pilot approach introduced under
CESAR to identify, formalize and register the real property rights of vulnerable Roma communities
and other vulnerable groups, households and individuals. The PSIA tries to determine to what
extent the CESAR approach led to the formalization and registration of the real property rights of
vulnerable people. The analysis also seeks to produce evidence of the impact of the pilot on the
occurrence of land conflicts, their perception of tenure security, access to credit, and investment
behavior.
     The findings of this PSIA are directly relevant to the EU financed Rural Land Registration
Program design, which has adopted the vulnerability mapping and social monitoring approach, and
seeks to improve it. Early PSIA results have also contributed to the dozens of systematic
registration contracts signed under the National Program, which are registration fee financed.
Contractors are required to pay particular attention to the vulnerable groups.
     This PSIA was conducted by the Romanian firm Metro Media Transilvania from 2014-2015. It
is largely based on a field survey carried out in February 2015 by the same firm in 6 UATs, 4 or
which were targeted by CESAR. The sample included 480 households, comprising 360 households
living in Roma settlements, and 120 vulnerable people living outside of these settlements such as
analphabets, elderlies, convicts, and widows. The results of this survey are anecdotal; however, they
provide valuable information on the participation of vulnerable groups in CESAR and highlight
possible improvements in the systematic land registration process.


Main Findings and Recommendations

     The majority of the families surveyed lived in precarious conditions – While 80% of the
respondents had access electricity, only 14% had access to running water, and over a third did not
have access to water at home. Only 7% declared having a bathroom, and 56% were living is houses
that were in bad conditions. A third of the respondents declared that their house had been built with
a construction permit, another third without, and the reaming third preferred not to answer. With an
average income per capita of 128 lei, those who were living in Roma settlements were the poorest.
     Most respondents did not know about CESAR – In UATs where ANCPI had completed
CESAR, only 42% of the respondents had heard about the project. In UATs where CESAR was
ongoing, only 10% of the respondents declared knowing about the project, while a mere 1% of
those living in UATs that were not targeted by CESAR were aware of the systematic registration
project. Those who had heard about CESAR generally knew it as “the project that allows land
registration for free? or “the project of the land registration office people?.
    Many respondents living in target UATs did not register their rights – In UATs where ANCPI
had completed CESAR, 27% of the respondents did not have property documents. The reasons
provided for not registering rights included the lack of resources, information, and documents, as

                                                                                                    6
well as the fact that the property had already been registered under the name of someone else.
Another issue inhibiting land registration is the lack of identification documents, although CESAR
may be encouraging persons to rectify this.
     While interest in regularizing property rights is high, willingness to pay for it is low – The
great majority of respondents without documents reported that they wish to obtain a formal proof of
ownership. At the same time, only 18% declared being willing to pay to obtain such a proof. While
this percentage was slightly higher in target UATs, these observations suggest that, without external
interventions, interest in land registration among vulnerable groups is likely to remain low.
     There are visible short-term benefits of systematic registration – CESAR appear to help
respondents registering an address, entering into contracts with utility providers, completing
inheritance processes, and resolving family conflicts. There may be other positive effects of
systematic registration such as greater tenure security, incentive to invest in house improvements, or
increased economic opportunities. However, they will only become visible in the longer term and
would require a much more robust analysis.
    These findings suggest a number of possible improvements to ANCPI’s systematic registration
approach, the first of which is that ANCPI should pay greater attention to public awareness
campaigns. Public information campaigns have a positive effect but appear to be reaching a limited
number of vulnerable households. Campaign should make clear that registration is free of charge
and clarify the short- and long-term benefits of registration. Increasing awareness could help
address what seems to be a lack of interest in land registration among poor households.
     Vulnerable families should receive adequate financial and legal support – The fact that many
respondents declared that they were not able to register their rights because they could not afford it
or were not able to obtain the required supporting documentation suggest that support provided may
be insufficient. For respondents, even notarizing documents was challenging because the closest
notary was far – more than 20km on average – and the vast majority of those who had used notary
public services declared that they were costly.
     Strengthen the involvement of local public authorities – ANCPI contracts out part of the
systematic registration activities, and respondents felt that some contractors were interested in
finishing the work rapidly without paying due consideration to the specificity of their case. OCPI
staff could participate more actively in the process, accompanying the contractors during the data
collection phase. OCPI staff have an important role to play in advising families, notably on the
required documents. This is critical to resolve issues families may face.
    Supplement OCPI personnel – There appears to be a lack of personnel at the level of the local
authorities. Ensure closer involvement of local authorities and supplementing OCPI personnel could
make the process more efficient and improve communication.
    Improve community participation – ANCPI should ensure that community representatives
who are knowledgeable about the local land tenure arrangements actively participate in the
program. These people witnessed old transactions and they can mediate conflicts, should they arise.
    Strengthen partnerships – Promote good communication and a true partnership among key
actors and notably Office for Cadaster and Land Registration (county branch of ANCPI),
contractors, and local public authorities.

Methodological framework

    The PSIA uses a mixed methods approach combining quantitative methods (household survey)
and qualitative methods (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions). Quantitative analysis
enabled comparisons between subgroups and by key variables of interest (e.g. income levels,
counties, project vs. non project localities registered vs. non-registered Roma, etc.) while qualitative
analysis generated rich detail and insights into underlying issues not accessible through survey
work.
     This observations and recommendations made in the PSIA draw from a survey of 480
households, comprising 360 households from Roma groups and 120 from households from other
vulnerable groups. At each household, the head of the household or the most knowledgeable person
responded to the survey, face-to-face, at the respondents’ residence. Every household was also geo-
referenced with GIS coordinates of latitude and longitude, using a smartphone application.
     Households interviewed are evenly distributed between 6 UATs from the counties of Mures (a
better off area located in the region of Transylvania), and Olt (a poorer area in the region of
Wallachia). The rationale for selecting these two counties was to capture differences associated with
the cultural dimension of land use and possession, and land registration practices.
      The 6 UATs were selected based on the following criteria:
              1) Large presence of vulnerable groups, defined as Roma communities1, disabled
          persons, illiterate persons, elderly, convicts, widows, single mothers or poor people;
              2) Status of the CESAR project. In each county, 1 UAT where CESAR had been
          completed, 1 UAT where CESAR was ongoing and 1 UAT where CESAR had not been
          implemented. In this way, the analysis sought to get a sense of the influence of the CESAR
          project.

      Households were selected using different methods.

               - For Roma communities: Roma settlements were initially mapped and then
          households were selected within the settlements area.
               - For other vulnerable groups: Household selection was based on information
          collected from social assistants (employed by the mayors’ offices in each county who are
          responsible for identifying, mapping, and providing support for poor households). Some

 Note that there are a very few cases of persons who do not belong to Roma ethnicity living in Roma
settlements (but usually married to Roma). For the purposes of simplicity, however, they are included under
the phrase ‘Roma population’ and ‘Roma households’.
                                                                                                         8
        vulnerable people were selected based on the vulnerability status of the household head,
        age (for elderly) and some were based on presence of a vulnerable family member.

    The qualitative component of the study included 16 in-depth interviews with local and county
stakeholders in each sampled UAT. The interviews were carried out with the following categories:

    At the local level:
                    o Representatives of the Public Local Authorities (Mayor, Vice-mayor, City
               Hall secretary, clerks involved in systematic registration)
                    o Informal leaders (Roma community leaders, teachers, doctors, other leaders)
                    o People involved in land acquisitions/transfers - tenants

    At the county level:
                   o OCPI representatives
                   o OCPI managers
                   o OCPI clerks involved in systematic registration.
    Focus-group discussions were held with vulnerable persons in 5 counties (Iancu Jianu, Brebeni,
Saschiz, Bahnea, and Nades).

Limitations

     The survey and focus group discussions only targeted vulnerable individuals (Roma and ‘other
vulnerable’) and thus an analysis of differences between vulnerable and non-vulnerable populations
is not part of the study. It is therefore important to keep in mind that the findings apply only to these
two populations, and not the population in the surveyed areas as a whole, which may have
significantly different characteristics and been affected by the project differently.
     The findings cover only two counties, Mures and Olt, which cannot be considered as
representative of the country as a whole. They were selected for the diverse nature of their
characteristics. The vast differences between the two counties for numerous variables (e.g. 75% of
Mureș respondents made property improvements, compared with just 14% of Olt respondents)
indicate that if the survey was to be repeated in other counties, results would likely be quite variable
and hard to predict, although presumably other counties in Transylvania would have more in
common with Mures and counties in Wallachia more in come with Olt.
     The survey respondents were not selected using randomized sampling methods, but based on
information collected from social assistants working at the municipality authorities. This means that
the findings cannot be considered statistically representative of all vulnerable groups, even in the
counties they are from, let other project areas.
     The study design would not meet evidence standards of cause and effect. Because the UATs
are systems, because sampling units were not chosen randomly, and because of the small samples
size (essentially two for each type of area – intervention, partial intervention and non-intervention),
the study design is far from a robust. The data is ‘clustered’, so that households are nested in the ir
UATs, and are thus their characteristics, and impacts are likely to be similar to one another because
they live in the same administrative, geographic, cultural area, under the same administration. A
true quasi-experimental research design would have, for example, randomly selected, for example,
100 UATS and assigned them randomly to participate or not participate in the project, and then
treated each UAT as a unit of analysis. Comparisons would have been between the aggregate
indicators of 50 treatment and 50 non-treatment UATs. Of course, the costs of the study would also
have increased substantially.

                                                                                                       9
      Just because a household has an ‘other vulnerable’ member, this doesn’t mean that the
household as a whole is vulnerable. Insufficient information is available on other household
members to be able to determine how critical the vulnerable member’s situation is for the entire
household. Some OV households may not be vulnerable at all, e.g. if they have more than enough
resources and capacity to care for their vulnerable member. Lacking data on non-vulnerable groups,
it is not possible to determine how similar or different the OV category in the survey is compared
with the population at large.
     The sample size is relatively small, especially for OV groups (120 respondents) which can
become an issue for subgroup analysis. For example when only a minority of OV respondents
report being aware of the CESAR project, confidence in more nuanced responses (which then fall to
the single digits), such as ‘reasons why’, is quite low, and such findings must be taken as indicative,
not representative.
     Using different methods (survey, focus groups and interviews) the research and analysis could
somewhat mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, the implications of these limitations are that the
PSIA study’s findings may not broadly applicable, i.e. beyond the two regions surveyed, or even
true. For now, the results should be treated as tentative. Any follow-up measures should take into
account local conditions and population characteristics.

Housing Conditions

    Housing conditions in the study areas are poor. Virtually everyone in the surveyed
areas lives in a detached house. Most homes consist of 2 or 3 rooms, kitchen included.
While 80% have electricity, just 14% have running water, and 55% use a well with a
bucket. Over a third of the households surveyed do not have access to water in the house
or even in their yard (including running water or a well). Only 7% of households have a
bathroom, and most houses (56%) are reported to be in a ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ state of
repair.
     Vulnerable people who are outside of Roma settlements are more likely to have
access to network utility services and to have a well (Figure 2). Access to water is a
more acute issue in Roma settlements where 45% of the households reported no access,
compared to 10% for those who were interviewed outside of these settlements. Such
figures underline that those who live in Roma settlements are the most vulnerable. Indeed,
living conductions are related to income, and better-of Roma households (those who
declare earning more than 300 RON per capita) do have better access to utilities.

     There is a stark difference in socio-economic conditions between household
survey inside and outside or Roma settlements. In Roma settlements, the average
income per person is just 128 lei, compared with 308 lei for those who live outside (Figure
3). In Roma settlements, 49% of the individuals aged 16 and over reported earning no
income. This is nearly twos time higher than outside of these settlements (27%). In Roma
settlements, 46% of the households interviewed reported having no income at all,
compared with 33% outside of these settlements.

     Those who are living in Roma settlements are poorer than the vulnerable people
who do not leave in Roma settlements. As Table 3 shows, households interviewed in
Roma settlements are more likely to fall into the lowest per capita income group (32.2%)
and much less likely to fall into the highest income group (12.5%), while the reverse is
true for those who leave outside of these settlements. The same patterns persist across
almost all variables.

Education and employment

     Those who leave in Roma settlements have lower educational attainment than
those who live outside. Three quarters of the population in Roma settlements (74%)
attended maximum 8 years of school (and more than half did not go beyond 4 years),
whereas in the case of households living outside Roma settlements, only 56% did not go to
school beyond 8 years. In line with these education attainments, the share of population
graduating from mid-level vocational education is just 18% in Roma settlements and 27%
outside Roma Settlements.

Regional differences

     There are significant regional differences in income between Mures and Olt.
Income levels (both per capita and per household) vary widely for those who do not live in
Roma settlements, and to a lesser extent for those who live in Roma settlements. These
trends seem to be associated with historical and geographic factors that make Romania’s
northern Transylvania historic region better off.

    Mures county households differ from Olt. In Mureș, nearly all unemployed
individuals declared that they were looking for work, whereas in Olt, more than 40% of
the persons without work described themselves as uninterested in finding employment.
The difference may be explained by cultural attitudes toward work and linked to
municipality support: 31% of Mures respondents receive various forms of social assistance
(Child-raising allowance or other social benefits for families with many children,
Guaranteed Minimum Income - VMG), which requires registration with the AJOFM
(County Agency for Employment).
                                                                                       13

than those who live in Olt.

     As the regional discrepancies underline, ethnicity and vulnerability are
contributing factors but not defining factors. Throughout this report, differences
between the two regions (which are often substantial) will be highlighted, demonstrating
the importance of factors beyond ethnicity or vulnerability and beyond project effects and
activities.


Land Use and Ownership

Owners, Possessors, and Tenants

    Property ownership is common. Nearly three quarters of the respondent declare that
they own the lost they occupy (72% of Roma and 81% of OV households), while 26% or
Roma report being possessors compared with 18% of OV households. Only 1% declared
being tenants.

     The presence of the project is not associated with higher ownership status, which
is instead closely associated with region (and income levels). Ownership levels are far
higher in Mures (86%) than in Olt (61%), and this pattern holds true irrespective of project
status. Ownership is highest in CESAR UATs and among Roma with rights registered,
and lowest among Roma in CESAR UATs without rights registered. In only 2% of cases
could differences in the property status, i.e. the coexistence of different legal rights over
land as held by the same family, be identified.

     Most plots that are not under direct ownership belong to relatives (68%). Only
6% of all respondents indicated that they lived in public housing, and a further 9% indicate
other persons (outside the family). While we could not identify any statistically significant
differences, it can be seen that the utilization of land owned by the Municipal
administration (public property) is correlated with lower income and is more frequent in
Olt County, in localities not included in the CESAR project, and in Roma settlements.

11% were acquired from local authorities. Most land plots were acquired from relatives.

     The main issue specific to those who live in Roma Settlements is the lack of legal
documents for their properties, a requirement for recording property rights, which
applies to about 20% of households in Roma communities. The following explanations for
lack of required documents were given:
       Construction without building permits or without performing subdivisions of the
        land (e.g. dwellings built in the past few years for younger families near parents’
        houses without any legal document or permits). Representatives of vulnerable
        groups reported that this happened because they do not possess other plots and the
        authorities failed to provide additional residential land for them.
       Houses built outside legally approved residential areas, on unused arable land
        where Roma live based on verbal agreements with the owners. Several cases in
        Iancu Jianu and Nadeş were mentioned. No legal documents or building permits
        were issued, making them vulnerable to inspections and possible demolition.
       Roma and OV groups living in homes acquired from sale with uncertified
        documents, only handwritten agreements
       Lack of income to make succession acts or acts to legalize old, handwritten
        agreements. Moreover, in some cases, the previous vendors make financial claims
        by exploiting the handwritten agreements.
       A case in Saschiz and Nades (Mures County): where there are Roma and OV
        groups living in old abandoned houses of the previous Saxon population who had
        emigrated to Germany. Although these houses have not been claimed for over 60
        years, the registration process must take into account the previous owner’s, or
        their successor’s, rights.


Size of land plots

    Land plot size correlates closely with income, increasing by about 500 m2 or more
between income categories. Roma households with rights registered own larger plots than
Roma without rights registered. In localities where CESAR was fully implemented, total
land surface area is double (1825 m2) compared with partial implementation (942 m2) or
no project (890 m2), but since purchase of most land predates CESAR, this difference
cannot be attributed to the project.

Usage of land plots

     OV categories, income levels and project UATs are positively associated with
household engagement in agricultural activities. Households most likely to report being
engaged in agricultural work are OVs (48%), high income (48%) and CESAR completely
(40%) or partially (45%) implemented. In contrast, only 26% of low income households
(under 75 lei) and Roma in non-project settlements (18%) have very low engagement in
agriculture activities.
     Agricultural activity is low, with most plots used for residential purposes. While
all primary lots are used for residential purposes, about 22% of these are also used for
agricultural purposes. Of the minority (13%) who own more than one lot, most use their
other lots for agricultural purposes, with a small share (2%) using them for related
purposes (e.g. hayfield, and orchards). Agricultural activities are associated with higher


                                                                                        16
income levels indicating that households who engage in this way have the resources to
invest in the land.
     Poverty and dependency may mitigate against agricultural practice. Two key
aspects define the structure of rural poverty. First, engaging in agricultural activities
requires certain preconditions, namely finances, knowledge, and a market, and these
conditions tend not to obtain for the poorest households and poorest villages. Second,
social assistance (e.g. guaranteed minimum income, other forms of allowances),
widespread in poorest villages, may discourage private initiative, with families receiving
assistance tend to be dependent and not get involved in other income generating activities.
    A small minority of persons are engaged in income-generating activities and
employment rates are low. Whether on a temporary or permanent basis, in the public or
private sector, persons engaged in income-generating activities is 15% (11% for Roma and
29% for OV households). The percentage of people without employment is 70% in the
case of Roma settlement residents, compared to only 40% for active age-group
respondents from the OV communities.

Property investments and improvements

     Nearly half (43%) of respondents reported making improvements to their plot
(including their homes). The survey assessed both the use of authorization permits, and
the likelihood of improvements, as indicators of stability and ownership security. The
majority of improvements consist of repair work, with a significant share (about 20%)
extending their residence by adding one room. As the range of possible interventions is
diverse, their associated costs vary significantly (from 200 lei to 60,000 lei). Investments
made on plots which include their residences cover a wide range of activities to preserve
and increase the quality and value through construction or addition of amenities.
Improvements include roof repairs, adding a new roof, adding one or more new rooms,
redecorating the kitchen, adding a second level, and fencing.

        The likelihood of a household reporting property improvements is highly
dependent on region, rather than the presence of the CESAR project. There is vast
variation not just by county but by UAT. Three quarters of Mureș respondents reported
making improvements, compared with just 14% of Olt respondents. The proportion of
residences with improvements is extremely high in Bahnea, at 91% (Mures) even though it
is only partial CESAR, and extremely low in Iancu Jianu (Olt) although CESAR is
completed there. In the other Olt UATs of Brebeni (19%) and Stoenesti (11%) it is also
extremely low. There may be a social effect at play, e.g. the likelihood of a household
making an improvement rises if others are doing it.
        Residence in Roma settlements, low income levels, and residence in Olt region
reduces likelihood of using construction permits. Overall, a minority (35%) of
respondents reported that their residence was built with the proper construction
documents, with the remainder reporting they did not obtain proper documents (30%) or
declining to answer (35%). OV households were more than twice as likely to report using
a construction permit (61.7%) compared with Roma households (Figure 9). It was also
more common to obtain a permit in Mures (40.4%) compared with Olt (25.4%). OV and
high income categories were the most likely to report authorized construction (62% and
63% respectively), as expected.

        In Roma communities, CESAR implementation is associated with a higher
rate of residences built with proper authorization. In CESAR project areas (complete
or partial) 38% have used a permit, compared with 23% in non-project area, while in
Roma settlements in CESAR UATs, almost double the number of people with registered
rights have residences built with proper authorization. CESAR’s appears to be having a
disciplining factor on building. (The survey shows that where CESAR is partially
implemented, authorized construction is far more likely (52%) than where it completely
implemented (28%) or not implemented (22%). This counterintuitive finding is largely
explained by the differences between counties.)


Property documentation

Possession of identity documents

     The process of land registration requires that a set of preconditions be met by
the land users / owners, one of which is identity documents. Absence of identity
documents limits the ability to assert property rights and other benefits from formal state
institutions.
    The percentage of Roma without identity documents is approximately 20% (and
6% for household heads) about twice as high as in OV households. The findings
highlight how Roma settlements are disproportionally affected by this issue, as compared
to OV households (Figure 10.)

    The issue of ID possession is strongly correlated with municipalities’ actions to
collect data and formal evidence about their citizens, as can be seen by the large
differences between the two counties. Therefore, we cannot isolate the CESAR impact in
clarifying personal ID situation, although Roma households with their rights registered
have a higher incidence of IDs than in the households without rights registered.

Property rights documentation

     Almost half the land in possession (of the 562 lots owned by the 480 respondents)
is held under ownership title, while 31% of lots have no documentation at all. Other
documentation is in the form of ownership certificates (present in 14% of lots), and
purchase / transaction documents (16%). Some 9% hold certificates of fiscal registration
(which are not property deeds, but prove that the holder is a taxpayer and could be
registered as a land possessor, although not a land owner) filed with the municipal
administration, which shows that the tax for the estate has been paid (Figure 11).

                                                                                                   19
   -   Families with a high level of income (over 300 RON/HH member), at 77%, as
       compared to families with low income, where the share is 24%;
   -   Settlements included in the CESAR project, 54%-58%, as compared to those that
       are not included, where the share is 27%;
   -   People from OV groups, 68%, as compared to households in Roma settlements,
       where the share of lots with ownership titles is 42%.

    Certificates also tend to be held by the same categories, except this document is held
to a larger extent in Mureș County, 22%, as compared to Olt, 2%.

    Sales transaction contracts are more frequently found in households with higher
incomes, those in Mureș County, and those where the CESAR project was not
implemented. Roma settlements do not stand out in this respect.

     Problems regarding the owners’ identification: particularly regarding vulnerable
groups: lack of inheritance papers, sales hand written contracts unauthenticated at a notary
office, papers which could not be use in this project. More houses built on the same land
(usually by owner’s inheritors), without building permit and without inheritance
subdivision of the land. The incidence of plots without any ownership document is higher
among:
         - Households with low income, of maximum 75 RON/member monthly (almost
            half of them have no ownership documents),
         - Settlements in Mureș,
         - Settlements not included in CESAR (50% of the lots have no documents as
            compared to about 25% in the case of program settlements),
         - Households in Roma settlements, with over twice as high a share of lots
            without documents as in the households of OV groups.

     In settlements where CESAR was fully implemented, 27% of households still
have no property documents, and only 54% have ownership title. This is better than in
non-project UATs, where just 27% report having ownership title, but suggests there is
significant room for improvement.

Registration under the project

     As expected, households in project areas were more likely to have obtained
documents in recent years. In settlements under CESAR, about 23% of documents were
issued in the last 5 years (2011-2015), while in non-project settlements the share is just
1%. The share of documents recorded in the last 5 years in households in Roma
settlements is 21% as compared to 8% in the case of OV groups. For over 50% of the lots,
respondents also hold other documents, such as proof of tax payments or utilities bills.
However, for 18% of the lots they hold no documents at all.
     The project appears to have had a significant impact on attempts to obtain
documentation. For lots with property rights documents, attempts to secure such
documents were only made in 30% of the cases. CESAR appears to be the key factor: for
lots in CESAR UATS, 40% of those where the implementation is partial, and 50% of
those where the implementation is complete attempted to secure documentation, while in
non-project settlements, the share is just 4%.
     Most respondents who registered their property report that the title describes
the land plot accurately. Only a small percentage of respondents (6%) said that the title
of their property was incorrect. In most cases (80%), the person who holds the title of the
property is the head of the household.
     Interest in regularizing property rights is high. The great majority (90%) of
respondents without documents report that they wish to obtain the documents to prove
their property rights.
     However, many people did not manage to obtain the documents because of lack
of money (27%) and the fact that the municipal administration did not issue the
documents (24%). In addition, for 14% of the lots, the owner did not know the procedure
to obtain the documents. While lack of funds is more frequent in Olt (43%), failure to
issue the document is more frequent in Mureș (39%). All those that did not know the
procedure to get the documents are from Roma settlements. Over half of the documents
obtained did not involve costs. For the rest, the maximum fee was 500 lei.

     The right to change the status of the land (sell, build on, change the use of the
land, etc.) rests with the head of the household in an unrestricted manner in only one
third of cases. In another about 25% of the cases, the head of the household has no such
right. In other situations (e.g. construction, change of use, mortgaging) the need for
approval by the local authorities was mentioned.

Property disputes

     Most disputes are family affairs - nearly 80% of those who fear a conflict
consider it likely to involve other family members. The highest level of suspicion is
directed toward relatives, but not immediate family members (spouses or children). The
owner of the land plot or the local authorities are also indicated, 19% and 25%
respectively. Neighbors are not seen as a cause for concern with regard to potential
disputes over the rights of ownership or usage. The main concern relates to security of
inheritance or usage rights, as well as to the risk of eviction, mentioned in nearly 50% of
cases.
     Property disputes are relatively rare - in only 3% of cases did disputes arise.
Although there are no statistically significant differences between the various categories
included in the study, it is notable that 40% of those respondents who had a history of
dispute over land continue to be wary of the potential for other conflicts in the future.
     Most property disputes are rapidly resolved. The duration for resolving conflict is
2 years in about half of all conflicts, while a quarter take at least 10 years (and the rest
remain unresolved). In over 50% of the situations, conflicts were resolved without
involving costs. For another 24%, the costs varied between 200 and 10,000 lei (the limited
number of cases does not recommend calculating mean values). In general, the conflicts
which were resolved rapidly did not involve costs, while those resolved over a period of at
least 10 years affected the financial situation of the household to a larger extent.
     Conflicts were said to usually be settled amicably or resolved on their own, while
less than 20% were taken to an arbitration authority, whether to the representatives of the
local authorities or the court of justice. In most of the settled conflicts, the decision was to
the respondents’ satisfaction, and only a fifth of them were unsatisfied with the ruling.
    Concern over property disputes is higher in fully implemented CESAR UATs
(17%) than in non-project UATs (5%). Overall, one in every 8 respondents is worried
over potential conflict with regard to ownership or usage rights. Concerns also correlate
                                                                                                          22
negatively with income. It is also higher in Olt country. Roma respondents are more
worried regarding their ownership/ usage rights than the OV groups.

Costs and willingness to pay

    No notary public’s offices are located in the settlements surveyed, and the
average distance to the nearest notary is 20-23 km, in both counties. In general, notary
public services are considered very costly or somewhat costly by about 75% of
respondents who have used them
    Willingness to pay to obtain proof of ownership is low. Most respondents either
didn’t respond or didn’t know (60%) or would be unwilling to pay for a document to
prove ownership of land (23%), with just 18 percent willing to pay, in amounts ranging
from 100 to 2,000 lei.

    In settlements where CESAR was not implemented, median willingness among
those interested in formal proof of ownership pay was far higher (150 RON) compared
to those where it was Implemented (50 RON). In non-project settlements, among the
55% of respondents interested in formal proof of ownership and willing to pay for it, the
median2 amount was 150 RON (and the mean was 529). In CESAR project areas, only
34% of respondents interested in proof of ownership were willing to pay, a median amount
of 50 RON (and a mean of 106 RON). This may reflect the awareness in CESAR UATs
that fees have been waived. However, a key consequence of CESAR project
implementation is that more people are now informed about the actual costs of obtaining
property rights documents, and have a realistic reference for these costs.

      We present the median willingness to pay levels because they reduce the effect of a few
extreme outliers and can be considered as closer to the value (in RON) given by of most
respondents.

CESAR project awareness and sources of information
Project awareness

    Project awareness is far higher in Mures than in Olt. When taking into account
project status, respondent awareness of the CESAR project is about twice as high in Mures
(55%) compared with Olt (28%). As expected, project implementation is closely
associated with awareness levels. Differences in awareness rates between Roma and OV
are minor (43% and 37% respectively). Most residents do not know the project as
‘CESAR’, but as ‘the project which allows land registration for free, or the project of the
people from the Land Registration Offices.’

     Few respondents who reported being aware of the project said they had
registered following implementation of the CESAR project.3 Only 34 out of 73
respondents had registered during the project period. Among those who did not register
their, 20% reported it was because the land was already registered, because they lacked
detailed information on the project (7%), lacked documents (6%), or lacked of money and
opportunities (20%).

     Exposure to public awareness campaigns is extremely low. From the evidence, it
appears that public awareness campaigns were not carried out with the same rigor in Olt as
in Mures. Just 10% or fewer respondents in UATs where CESAR was complete said they
received a flyer, or saw a poster, or saw a TV or radio commercial about land registration.
Roma are less likely than OV groups to have seen or heard TV or radio ads. In CESAR
partial areas the numbers are even lower. This means that Roma and OV groups (and
maybe others) are not being reached and points toward a opportunities for improving
communication.

    The CESAR project is better known among respondents than ANCPI and OCPI
(19% versus 14%, and 13%, respectively). Awareness is higher in some socio-
demographic categories, such as in terms of age, in the range of 36-65 years, high school,
and post-secondary school or higher education graduates. Also, in Mures County and in
areas where CESAR was completely implemented, the project was more likely to be
known by respondents.

where the project is completed than where it is partially complete. Breaking down
respondents by project status, Awareness levels for both institutions is at similar levels, of
42.5% in Mures for completed project UATs, and much lower where it is partially
complete. Differences in awareness levels between Roma and OV groups are not large
(Figure 21).

     CESAR UATs are associated with a higher rates of awareness of the main
national and county public agencies involved in land registration. Also, in CESAR
UATs, Roma households which registered their land are more informed about these
institutions than the Roma households which didn’t perform this procedure.
     This is confirmed by focus group and in-depth interviews, which indicate that the
Focus group respondents mostly were able to recall the measurements stage for
houses and lands (bearing in mind that it had been a few years since the initial stages of
the implementation activities). People from Bahnea (where the project is implemented
about 40%) or Brebeni (where the project is implemented at about 90%) are eager to
receive their land books.
         They went from door to door. They measured everyone. Yes, they wanted to cross
    our land and see that changed. They asked you to allow them to take photos – of the
    house, from the front, from the back, to measure the space. And the garden,
    everything. And then two years later they came from Târgu Mureş. And it was already
    entered. And they would ask ‘Are you pleased? Is it well measured?’ and things like
    that, and they showed us, yes. (FG Saschiz)
         And then, at home, they explained broadly what it was about, ‘I want to make a
    contract for you’ and they did the measurements, where your place is. ‘That far’, and
    they wrote, they … Yes, I prepared an application; applications … so this is how it
    was done, we had to submit applications. To have the neighbor sign on, the right hand
    side neighbor, to sign if he agrees with the perspective… both neighbors had to sign.
    (FG Bahnea)
     Local authorities are reported to be the main information source, the most
common way of informing respondents on land registration is via discussions with
municipal authorities (20% of respondents). The second way of information commonly
found among the obtained responses is discussions about land registration with family,
relatives, friends or neighbors.
    People who have not completed any level of formal education used, on average, a
larger number of information sources than educated people. The same situation is

                                                                                       29
found in the case of employed people, of those who earn more than 300 lei per month,
residents of Mures County, and of those who live in areas where CESAR project was fully
or partially implemented.

Information levels

    The self-reported knowledge of the procedures to register land is quite limited,
but far higher in Mures than in Olt. Close to half of the respondents do not know these
procedures at all, while only 18% know them somewhat or well. Broken down by region,
in Mures 41.3% reported knowing the procedures for land registration compared with just
8.8% for Olt, although the share is similar in partially completed areas (Figure 23).

    Roma report being considerably more aware of procedures in CESAR areas
than OV groups. Where the project is complete, 29.2% of Roma respondents were aware,
compared with just 12.5% of OV. They also have higher awareness rates in partially
completed UATs, though not in non-project areas.

     While the variables pertaining to individual status (age, education, occupation)
are not associated with knowledge of land registration, there is a negative association
with income. What is interesting is that in settlements with complete implementation of
CESAR, the percentage of those who know nothing about the procedure is above the
average of the sample. This aspect informs the conclusion that the experience of CESAR
implementation depends on the performance of both the central institutions involved, and
of the local authorities.
    In an indication of the low perceived relevance of land registration, when asked
to spontaneously mention a few steps that must be taken to register the land, almost
70% of the respondents could not think of anything. Most of the rest could mention
only a single step of the procedure. In general, they referred to the institutions involved
and the actors with a role in the procedure.

                 Participation in activities implemented the CESAR project

     Unsurprisingly, among the 20% of respondents who had heard of the CESAR
project most participated in project activities. Thus, 72% of this group participated in
activities such as information sessions, meetings with specialists, land demarcation and
registration. Only 16% of them did not take part.

     While Roma households may have less access to media, for reasons related to
poverty, they nonetheless report being slightly more likely to be engaged on issues of
property rights than OV households. Based on the survey, Roma households are more
likely discuss issues around property registration with family, friends, neighbors, etc. to
discuss them with the municipal authorities, to participate in meetings, and to request
information. There is a tendency for engagement to be more common among higher
income households than lower income households.

     Interviews and focus group discussions found there were no individuals who
would refuse to be part of the project. No one interviewed expressed anything against
participating in the project. Rather, there were cases where, due to lack of official
documents people could not be registered as owners, and many people who simply
weren’t aware of the project, for a variety of reasons.
    Those less likely to report having participated in activities were unemployed, and
vocational school graduates. Individuals who did not participate in activities within the
CESAR project reported that nobody invited or called them to participate (47%). Other
impediments were lack of time, or being away (8%).
    Representatives of vulnerable groups who had legal documents (the majority), did not
express discontent with regard to the implementation of project front CESAR, or their
discontent was not different from the rest of the population. Also, the respondents
mentioned a set of sub-activities implemented in the CESAR project:
       i) Selection of a private implementation company (the provider) which will take
           care of communication, measurements and elaboration of the deliverables for
           OCPI
      ii) Preparation of the preliminary report by the provider company
    iii) Public information campaign implemented by the provider company in
           collaboration with city halls
     iv) Measurements and household interview sheets
      v) Data corroboration
     vi) Publication reception of the results

    ix)    Sending the land books to the owners

     Then we did this information campaign. They began to put up posters in the
communes. …They organized this together with the municipal authorities, in order to
explain to people what will be done, so the people would give them access, that in every
household they’re about to take measures, to collect data. Then, the people had to provide
the ownership titles. …people had some questions; …because there were many situations,
there were small to large problems, many inheritances undiscussed…Almost everybody
had an issue. (OCPI Mureș)
     It was explained very clearly what it was about. …. We are doing measurements. This
is a free cadaster. We register your estate, and I think it was clear enough.
    They resisted – when they had to give the documents to the provider, to study them to
make copies. You know people in the countryside, they are old, eh, what can one do? They
say “they take away our land, they leave us without papers.?

Challenges to CESAR project implementation

     Challenges included delays in assigning the implementation contracts to providers
(for example in Mures, the project implementation team was set up in 2009, and the
contract with the provider was signed in 2011) and attribution of the contracts to
companies that were not experienced, competent or responsible with project’s deadlines
(e.g. in Bahnea)
        At Bahnea we had and we still have problems with this division, At Saschiz it was
    okay. The provider made a good division of cadastral sectors which is very
    importantThere are some national geodesic points, from the national network of
    points, on this basis, when work is being done, (OCPI Mureș)
    Lack of sufficient personnel at the level of OCPI, especially in the verification
phase and results reception. The OCPI representative from Slatina reporte that if they had
been allowed to be in the field during data collection, the amount of complaints would
have been reduced from 800 to a maximum of 200.
        The inability to check on the provider, although we had it in every technical
    specification, we could not resolve this, because we simply could not be present
    physically. As we had too few, here in the office, and at the general register, it was
    almost impossible, we would have collapsed, if they had sent us all to do check-ups.
    (OCPI Slatina)
     Lack of sufficient personnel at the level of the local public authorities who could
have made the process more efficient and would solve communication problems with the
owners. Insufficient collaboration from the local public authorities (e.g in. Bahnea, and
to a lesser extent in Iancu Jianu)
    Errors in ownership titles, difference in surface area entered in papers and the area
used by the owner.
         So we first divided the land and then we started measuring it. And we had a
    surprise at the general cadaster. Yes, we found lots that had not been actually
    measured then, and the ownership title said more than what was found in the field.
    (Solicitor Brebeni)
     Problems regarding the owners’ identification: particularities regarding vulnerable
groups: lack of inheritance papers, sales hand written contracts unauthenticated at a notary
office, papers which could not be use in this project. More houses built on the same land
                                                                                         34
(usually by owner’s inheritors), without building permit and without inheritance
subdivision of the land.
   Owners who built without a building permit or owners who didn’t own the land
where they built the house
        We found house owners without them being the owners of the land, and without
   authorization to build on the land. The previous mayors, several years ago, made them
   owners. That is, they told them to build the house there, but they did not give them
   documents, or maybe just a written record of what was done on the land, the people
   kept them at home, but they had no right to ownership. (Secretary Brebeni)

    Project obstruction before sending the land book to the owners (Brebeni or
Bahnea). Individuals who have only old written contracts or other unauthenticated papers
are now subjects of a new situation: the old owners require them to pay if they want the
papers legalized.
        They can hardly wait for them to not get the document so that they can make an
   extra 10 million, or 7 million. The old owners? They don’t have documents. No-one
   admits what was in the past. But the receipt is done with witnesses, which was the rule
   at the time. Now that the times changed, what can I do? If I have the receipt, they
   cannot do anything. If you don’t have the receipt and you just talk, then they can eat
   you alive and sell you ten times over. I have the receipt (FG Brebeni)

     The problem regarding the residential area (within settlement boundaries). In
both counties most problems were connected to the surface within the settlement limits
and fewer problems related to the out-of-own lands. The mayors in Mures county stated
that as concerns the residential areas, the lands inside the villages should not have made
the object of the project, because they had very accurate land books from previous years.
        One aspect that, in my opinion, especially in the villages of Transylvania where
    there is a Land Book and where the built-up areas have a Land Book excerpt
    shouldn’t be the subject of the project… in my opinion, the built-up areas should not
    be covered. But if the built-up area is re-measured, is there a conflict with the old
    land book or…? No, but mistakes occur. (Mayor, Saschiz)
    The fact that the public authorities were not involved in the Commission of
Reception Results produced by the provider. A too small sample (10%) of the land
books used for validation of the provider’s work. Too short time and too few people for
checking the provider’s activity.
        So it is pretty clear in the pilot manual. So when there aren’t any inaccuracies to
    be corrected, in the reception committee report, the data will be downloaded by
    OCPI, and they will issue the certificate for accepting the work. Based on the
    acceptance report signed by the reception committee at OCPI. Signed by the
    reception committee from OCPI. So we were not involved. They took it and checked it.
    But we need to verify when we give them to people because they tell us that they don’t
    have that respective land. We contact the OCPI and we send the citizens to Iancu
    Jianu, or we send them to Slatina. (Iancu Jianu Mayor).

    The land books were issued in the names of the old owners, most of whom are
dead, and without having the inheritance process completed. This was an issue
because the heirs had problems understanding that they will all be owners of an undivided
land book.

                                                                                        35
Benefits associated with registering property

     A minority of vulnerable persons who registered believed the project helped
their household. Of the 88 persons who had heard of the project, 82% of households
participated in the project (either the respondent or a household member), and or 47%
responded that it helped them ‘to a great extent’ (24%) or ‘to some extent’ (23%), while
24% said that it did not help at all. Perceived benefits (combining to a great extent’ and ‘to
some extent’) were greater in Mures (52.6%) than in Olt (35.5%). Differences between
Roma and OV do not appear significant.
    Only 12 percent of households could think of any benefits, and these related
principally to technical outputs (as opposed to social or economic outcomes or
impacts). The benefits identified by the 59 out of 89 respondents who were aware of the
project concerned land measurement (30%), land and house registration (9%), obtaining
the property documents (24%), and obtaining useful information about the project (8%).
One percent reported ending the conflicts between neighbors as a benefit (Figure 29).

    Focus groups and interviews mentioned a series of additional project benefits, which
have been divided into administrative, social, economic categories. It should be kept in
mind that most of these apply to all stakeholders, not just vulnerable households:
Administrative benefits
   The ability to register one’s address
   A significant increase of the proportion of owners with land books, from
      approximately 5% in all localities to almost 100%
   Computerized demarcation of the properties;
   Development of the systematic new land book system at no cost to the owners or
      the local public authority;
   A clear image of land plots and the opportunity for the public authority to better
      calculate taxes;
                                                                                           36
Social benefits
     The social value of having registered title to land, legitimating ownership status
     A clear image of land plots, reducing conflicts over land delimitation;
     Greater degree of security, especially among vulnerable groups, or people who
        have not inherited the land, and are constantly afraid that previous owners might
        come and evict them. These situations is especially common among those who
        illegally occupy land, who built a house without a permit, or made transactions
        using mutual or written but not authenticated (by notaries) agreements.

Economic benefits
    Opportunities to engage in various property transactions (sale, mortgage, rent,
     inheritance);
    The existence of land registrations in the new book land system makes it easier and
     cheaper for individuals to resolve their inheritance or make a mortgage
    Having an ownership title for ID papers, for receiving social benefits or for the
     contracts with public utilities (electricity, gas), insurance contracts
    Ability to access European funds for both owners and the local public authority;
     (e.g. Greenhouse program)

     Lack of funds and low expectations of selling were reasons given for weak
interest in updating property registration in the absence of the project. Key
informants felt that vulnerable groups would not have updated their property registration
(at anywhere near the ratio achieved) without the project. This was attributed mainly to
lack of money and lack of motivation. Most Roma and OV households do not possess
agricultural land, and thus had little interest in engaging in economic transactions or
making investments, since most do not expect to sell their houses, planning instead to pass
them on to family members as inheritance.
     In Saschiz households face an issue particular to Transylvania, where many
Roma live in old houses abandoned by the Saxon population who had emigrated to
Germany. The Mayor of Saschiz and OCPI representatives pointed out that the project’s
initial goals would have been achieved had inheritance issues been sorted out so that the
new land books could be issued in the name of the actual living owners. The documents of
these properties were recorded by the previous owners and it was necessary to open
succession trials. CESAR did not provide support for these trials, and instead it was
envisioned that the National Union of Notary Publics would handle the successions, in
order to regularize the cadastral situation for the current owners. However, this proved too
costly. CESAR thus failed to all the cadastral problems from Saschiz and while the
benefits are real, they are less than optimal. For inheritance process, the people will now
have to pay to have their land books updated.
        Eighty percent of the land book extracts are with deceased owners. From an
    administrative point of view, the problem remains unsolved. Why? Lease contracts
    are between the living and then we have the land register extract in the father’s
    name…And then the owner or the person who inherits the property comes and says,
    "Well, I don’t have the money to do the inheritance process." (Mayor, Saschiz)
    Responses on perceived benefits from land registration are similar to anticipated
benefits About one third of respondents think that land registration brings a many or some
benefits. However, a significant segment of respondents (36%) do not expect any potential
benefit from this procedure (with Roma being more pessimistic, at 40%, than OV, at

                                                                                         37
32%). Again, responses from Mures households are more positive, with only 23%
expecting no benefits compared with Roma, where the figure is 53%.

        The ownership title is helpful, first of all you get all the documents, and if you
    want social assistance, the full allowance, from ASF, state allowance, that is, it
    proves that you are the owner, you are the rightful owner, right? (Roma leader,
    Brebeni).

                                        somewhat, 16%



    Most likely related to awareness levels, respondents’ positive expectations of
registering land are associated with living in CESAR UATs. The share of those who
think land registration will bring benefits to a great extent or some extent is much higher
in CESAR UATs (53%), compared with partial CESAR UATs (32%), and non-project
areas (15%). Roma with their rights registered are more aware about land registration
benefits.
     Almost two thirds of respondents could not think of a specific benefit . Among
those who were able to, the largest share (12%) referred to gaining ownership, followed by
the ability of leaving the estate as inheritance, obtaining proof of ownership and the ability
to sell the property (Figure 31).

Conclusion

Awareness and information levels

    Public information campaigns have an effect, yet appear to be reaching few
vulnerable households. Living in a project area does increase the chances a household
                                                                                                               39
has heard of it. Nonetheless, where CESAR is being, or has been, implemented, less than
10% of respondents had received public information flyers, or seen posters, or seen TV ad
or heard radio ads. Project awareness among vulnerable groups is relatively low: just 42%
(where CESAR was completed) and 13% (where CESAR is ongoing), suggesting there are
considerable opportunities in this area. Because the survey did not cover non-vulnerable
households, it is unclear whether this is a targeting issue (of Roma and vulnerable) or a
problem with awareness raising in general. Also, the fact that Mures county respondents
were almost twice as likely to have heard of the project as those from in Olts county points
to public information campaign implementation issues.

    In some areas, knowledge about land registration and procedures involved is
extremely low. In Olt county, fully 70% of respondents reported that they did not know
about land registration procedures at all (in Mures this figure is only 19%) while only 9%
(41% in Mures) reported knowing the procedures ‘to a great extent’ or ‘somewhat’.

     While Roma households may have less exposure to media (possibly for reasons
related to poverty) they nonetheless are more likely to be engaged than OV
households on issues of property rights. Based on the survey, Roma households are
more likely discuss issues around property registration with family, friends, neighbors,
etc., to discuss them with the municipal authorities, to participate in meetings, and to
request information. There is also tendency for engagement to be more common among
higher income (Roma or OV) than lower income households.

Project effects and outcomes

     It is too early to speak of CESAR’s impact on Roma or other vulnerable (OV)
group households in terms of either land transactions or economic impacts. Project
activity in the surveyed UATs is not associated with higher ownership status or property
investments, which are more closely linked to region and income levels. While the survey
identified differences in terms of project awareness, and perceived project benefits
between project and non-project areas, these have not yet translated into discernable
outcomes or impacts, such as investments in housing or land, or increased property
transaction activity.
     A range of factors may be impeding better outcomes. There appear to be multiple
factors which suppress more positive impacts from manifesting themselves: i) not all
property owners have participated yet; ii) low interest in registration because of low
property values; iii) low investment ability (i.e. poverty may explain weak interest in land
registration, and in improving living conditions, quality of life and property values; and iv)
effects from regularizing land rights take time to materialize.

     For vulnerable groups, the most significant short-term benefits of formalizing
property ownership appear to relate to registering an address, entering into
contracts with utility providers, and resolving inheritance processes and family
conflicts. Project benefits are thus not necessarily associated with the opportunity to sell
or engage in other transactions. Even though the survey shows that many vulnerable have
not yet taken advantage of project support, without CESAR it is even less likely that they
would be able to register their properties, or would even consider doing so. These positive
effects may potentially lead to other outcomes, such as better quality public services,
greater security, etc. Eventually, they may translate into improved welfare levels. If this
study were repeated in five years, project impacts should become more apparent.

                                                                                           40
     Only a minority of respondents felt the project helped their household . Correlated
with the above, the project does not appear to be reaching vulnerable persons at levels
which would be considered optimal. Thus, even in areas where the project is complete, i.e.
settlements where CESAR was fully implemented, 27% of households still have no
property documents, and only 54% have ownership titles. There is clearly more work to be
done.

     Financial constraints inhibit registration. The major reasons given for why people
did not manage to obtain the documents were lack of money (27%) and the fact that
municipal authorities did not issue the documents (24%). In addition, for 14% of the lots,
the owner did not know the procedure to obtain the documents. There are big differences
by region, with lack of funds is the most frequent reason given in Olt (43%), and failure to
issue the document in Mureș (39%).

     Willingness to pay among households to obtain proof of ownership is quite low
(with majority willing to pay zero, and median willingness to pay between 50 and 150
RON (in project and non-project areas) Without external interventions (such as CESAR),
interest in land registration among is likely to remain low, at least among vulnerable
groups.

Property ownership status

     The presence of CESAR is only one factor among others that influence
registration rates, while regional differences, implementation issues, and income
levels are key. Based on the data collected, the biggest differences in responses (across a
range of variables) appear to relate to region (Mures vs. Olt) and household income levels.
Across many indicators Mures households are better off than Olt households, and
households with higher incomes have better land registration indicators, in terms of land
registration, than lower income households.

     Because of the informal nature of many property transactions, even clarifying
property status through the project may lead to disputes between current owners
and other relatives, because previously it had not been an issue. Land transaction, and
disputes are mostly a family affair – in many cases, property was transferred to the present
owner (through inheritance, purchase, or gift) from relatives. Often the transaction was not
formally documented or registered, creating an informal, undocumented situation, and
complicating ownership. Accordingly, trust issues and land disputes are reported to be far
more common between family members than with others. However, despite a relatively
few individuals being worried about potential conflicts, findings show that in CESAR
UATs Roma with rights registered are less worried over property than Roma without
rights registered.

     A key issue inhibiting land registration processes is lack of identification
documents, although the CESAR project may be encouraging persons to rectify this .
One in every five residents from Roma settlements has no identification documents.
During legalization procedures lack of ID can lead to serious delays and additional costs.
The lack of identity documents for a large part of the population may be related to ongoing
difficulties in formal interactions between individuals and public institutions or systems,
irrespective of their nature: educational, civil registry, labor market, or, in the present case,
systematic land registration. However, in CESAR UATs, the share of Roma households
without IDs (for all household members) is lower among households who have registered

                                                                                              41
their rights than those who haven’t. This suggests the project may be having a secondary
effect of encouraging people to obtain IDs.
     CESAR appears to be the key factor in encouraging attempts to secure
documents proving property rights. For respondents living in CESAR UATs, 40%
made attempts to obtain documentation where implementation is partial, and 50% of those
where the implementation is complete. In the settlements where CESAR is not
implemented, the percentage of those who have attempted to secure property rights
document is only 4%. The project is clearly having an effect in this area.

     The high rate of construction without proper authorization is another indicator
of informal conditions associated with real estate, with political economy a possible
factor. A strong correlation between legal construction and income levels points toward
the (perceived) high costs of obtaining authorization. Relations between vulnerable
groups and state institutions probably also play a role. Informal agreements are said to
exist between local authorities and Roma populations, whereby, in exchange for election
support, the authorities turn a blind eye to informal construction.

      The possession of ownership documents is positively associated household
income, assets and, as expected, with CESAR program implementation. Owners have
title deeds or property titles covering only 70% of plots under their control. Fear of
disputes over ownership is higher in cases where there is possession of property
documents (65%). The great majority (90%) of respondents without documents wish to
obtain the documents to prove their property rights.


CESAR project implementation challenges

    Delays in assigning the implementation contracts to providers and provider
competence. In the case of Mures, the project implementation team was set up in 2009,
and the contract with the provider was signed only in 2011. Attribution of the
implementation contracts to companies which were not experienced, competent or
responsible with project’s deadlines, such as the provider for Bahnea.

    Lack of sufficient personnel at the OCPI level, especially during the verification
phase and results reception. The OCPI representative from Slatina reported that if they had
been allowed to be in the field during data collection, the amount of complaints would
have fallen from 800 to a maximum of 200.

   Lack of sufficient personnel at the local public authorities level who could have
made the process more efficient and would solve communication problems with the
owners. Insufficient collaboration from the local public authorities, for example in
Bahnea, and to a lesser extent in Iancu Jianu.

     Project obstruction before sending the land book to the owners (in Brebeni and
Bahnea). Individuals who have only old written contracts or other unauthenticated papers
are now subjects of a new situation: the previous owners require them to pay if they want
the papers legalized.

    Issues regarding residential area within settlement boundaries. In both counties
most problems were connected to the surface within the settlement limits and fewer
problems related to out-of-own lands. The mayors in Mures county stated that as concerns

                                                                                        42
the residential areas, the lands inside the villages should not have been included in the
project objectives, because they had very accurate land books from previous years.

    Lack of involvement by public authorities in the Commission of Reception
Results produced by the provider. A too small sample (10%) of the land books was used
for validation of the provider’s work. There was too little time and too few people
checking the provider’s activity.

    The land books were issued in the names of the old owners, most of whom are
dead, and without having the inheritance process completed. This was an issue
because the heirs had problems understanding that they will all be owners of an undivided
land book.

                                 The Enterprise Analysis Unit is a joint World Bank and IFC team of economists and survey experts specialized in private sector development. Surveys implemented
                                 by the team reveal what businesses and firms experience across the world by interviewing representative samples of the formal, non-agricultural, non-extractive,
                                 private sector with 5 employees or more. The resulting globally comparable firm-level data is used to construct business environment indicators and measure firm
                                 performance. The findings and recommendations help policy makers identify, prioritize, and implement policy reforms that support efficient private economic
                                 activity.

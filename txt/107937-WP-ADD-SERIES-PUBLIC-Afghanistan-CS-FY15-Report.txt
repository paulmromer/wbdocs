II. Methodology
In December 2014, 500 stakeholders of the WBG in Afghanistan were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO);
office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local
governments; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private
foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations (CBO);
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; youth groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 407 stakeholders
participated in the survey (91% response rate).

Some respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to
face. Others received and returned the questionnaires via mail or email. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Afghanistan; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund, the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Afghanistan; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’12 and FY’08. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition
in three years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present in
all three fiscal years were not included in the comparison.

II. Methodology (continued)
Respondents who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a
result, means of the FY’ 15 data and the total number of respondents in three years are slightly
different from those of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, E, G, and H. For the
weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix F (page 154).

A. General Issues Facing Afghanistan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   Afghanistan is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty, and how
   “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): their familiarity with the WBG,
   its effectiveness in Afghanistan, WBG staff preparedness to help Afghanistan solve its
   development challenges, the WBG’s local presence, its collaboration with the UN, the
   WBG’s capacity building in Afghanistan, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Afghanistan, and in which sectoral areas
   the WBG should focus most of its resources.

C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent
   to which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Afghanistan, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Afghanistan’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the extent the WBG helps build existing country systems, the importance for the
   WBG to be involved in thirty five development areas, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness
   in these areas, such as security/stabilization/reconstruction, education, and anti corruption.

D. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund: Respondents were asked about their levels
   of familiarity with the trust fund, and their levels of agreement with several statements about
   the trust fund.

E. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.

F. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their levels of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is selective, and the extent to which the WBG promotes private
   public partnerships in Afghanistan.

II. Methodology (continued)
G. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Afghanistan: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Afghanistan and which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country. They were asked what areas the
   country would benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would
   benefit most from other donors.

H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, and were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its
   social media channels, the easiness to find information and to navigate the WBG websites.

I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, gender, whether they currently collaborate or previously collaborated with the
   WBG, their exposure to the WBG in Afghanistan, which WBG agencies they work with,
   their geographic locations, and whether they think that the IFC and the World Bank work
   well together.

        familiar with the WBG (mean levels of familiarity = 6.0) than respondents in the FY’08
        Country Survey (mean levels of familiarity = 5.2)4. Respondents in the FY’12 and this
        year’s Surveys had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (mean levels
        of familiarity in FY’12 = 6.3).
       Stakeholder groups and locations: Respondents across stakeholder groups and
        geographic locations had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG.
       Collaboration: Respondents who currently collaborate with the WBG are significantly
        more familiar (mean levels of familiarity = 7.0) with the institution than those who
        previously collaborated with it (mean levels of familiarity = 5.9) and those who never
        collaborated with the WBG (mean levels of familiarity = 5.3).

        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Afghanistan, and
        significantly, moderately correlated with the respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s
        relevance to Afghanistan’s development or its ability to help achieve development results
        in Afghanistan.

What Would Contribute Most to Reducing Poverty (continued)
     Year comparison: In the FY’12 Country Survey, respondents indicated that the greatest
      contributors to poverty reduction in Afghanistan were
      “security/stabilization/reconstruction? (41%) and “economic growth? (39%). A little over
      a third of all respondents in the FY ’08 country survey indicated that “education? (34%)
      would contribute most to poverty reduction in Afghanistan. This year’s respondents
      believe that “security/stabilization/reconstruction? and “economic growth? will
      contribute most to reducing poverty in Afghanistan.
     Stakeholder groups: While overall “education? is perceived as the greatest contributor
      to poverty reduction in Afghanistan, respondents from the office of parliamentarian were
      significantly more likely consider it the greatest contributor to reducing poverty in
      Afghanistan than respondents from other stakeholder groups.
     Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations all tended to agree that
      “security/stabilization/reconstruction? and “economic growth? would contribute most to
      reducing poverty in Afghanistan.
     Gender differences: Female respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that
      “economic growth? would contribute most to poverty reduction than male respondents.
     Collaboration: Respondents who currently collaborate or never collaborated with the
      WBG were significantly more likely to indicate that “economic growth? would contribute
      most to poverty reduction than respondents who previously collaborated with the
      institution.
     Areas of specialization: Respondents across sectoral focuses all agreed that
      “security/stabilization/reconstruction? and “economic growth? are the top two
      contributors to reducing poverty in Afghanistan.

Factors Contributing to “Shared Prosperity?
      Stakeholder groups and geographic locations: Respondents across stakeholder groups
       and geographic locations all tended to agree that “better employment opportunities for all

       more likely than male respondents to indicate that “better employment opportunities for
       women? would contribute most to achieving shared prosperity in Afghanistan.

Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failures of World Bank-assisted reform efforts to “government working
       inefficiently? (53%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, consultants working on WBG
       projects and respondents from ministries/PMUs were significantly more likely to indicate
       that slow WBG-assisted reforms should be attributed to “the WBG being not sensitive
       enough to political/social realities on the ground,? compared to respondents from other
       stakeholder groups.
      Geographic locations: Respondents located in Kabul were significantly more likely to
       indicate that slow WBG-assisted reforms should be attributed to “the WBG being not
       sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground,? compared to respondents
       from outside Kabul.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
      Stakeholder groups: There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’
       ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in nine of the thirty five sectoral areas. In most cases,
       respondents from the Office of President/CEO/Minister gave the highest ratings for the
       WBG’s effectiveness, whereas respondents from the media tended to give significantly
       lower ratings. There sectoral areas include:
                Transport;
                Urban development;
                Regulatory framework;
                Poverty reduction;
                Local governance and institutions;
                Disaster management;
                Regional integration and cooperation;
                Social protection; and
                Climate change.

      Geographic locations: There were no significant geographic differences in respondents’
       ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness any of the thirty five sectoral areas.
      Areas of specialization: It is worth pointing out that respondents who specialize in
       “education? (16% of the sample) gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in six of the thirty five sectoral areas (listed below) than respondents
       specializing in other areas.
                Information and communications technology;
                Regulatory framework;
                Communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                Rural development;
                Regional integration and cooperation; and
                Climate change.

      Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 78) that primarily
       informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
       “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
       areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Afghanistan,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty five
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Afghanistan.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and,
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Afghanistan, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
              The WBG’s effectiveness job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
      Stakeholder groups: There were significant differences in respondents’ levels of
       agreement with four statements about the WBG (listed below). In most cases,
       respondents from the Office of President/CEO/Minister had significantly higher levels of
       agreement than respondents from other stakeholder groups:
            The WBG treats clients and stakeholders in Afghanistan with respect
            The WBG effectively monitors and evaluates the projects and programs it
              supports
            The WBG disburses funds promptly
            The WBG provides effective implementation support
      Geographic locations: Respondents located in Kabul were significantly more likely to
       agree that “the WBG’s ‘Safeguard Policy’ requirements are reasonable? compared to
       respondents located outside Kabul.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions: Collaboration
        Collaboration: Respondents who currently collaborate with the WBG had significantly
         higher levels of agreement with the statements that “the WBG disburses funds promptly,?
         “the WBG’s conditions on lending are reasonable,? and “working with the WBG increase
         Afghanistan’s institutional capacity,? compared to respondents who previously or never
         collaborated with the institution.
        Collaboration: Although respondents generally had high levels of agreement on the
         WBG being respectful, respondents who previously collaborated with the WBG had the
         highest levels of agreement that “the WBG treats clients and stakeholders in Afghanistan
         with respect? compared to respondents who now collaborate or never collaborated with
         the WBG.

Appendix F: Responses to All Questions by Year17
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY15 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.
FY ’08 Number of comparable respondents = 346  FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 327
 FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 326
By weighting, FY08, FY12 and FY15 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either
involved in development in Afghanistan or who observe activities related to social and economic
development. The following survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Afghanistan,
greater insight into how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to
assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop more effective strategies that support
development in Afghanistan.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity
and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, IFC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

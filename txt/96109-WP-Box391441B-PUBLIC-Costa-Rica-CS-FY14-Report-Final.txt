II. Methodology
In April – June 2014, 310 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Costa Rica were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President; office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; project management
units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 127 stakeholders participated in
the survey (41% response rate).
Some respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of an independent fielding
agency. Others received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Costa Rica; their overall attitudes toward
the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Costa Rica; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing in Costa Rica.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Costa Rica: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Costa Rica is
    headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
    development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
    and generating economic growth in Costa Rica, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
    achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
    their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
    Costa Rica, WBG staff preparedness to help Costa Rica solve its development challenges,
    WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity building in Costa Rica, their agreement with various
    statements

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Costa Rica, in which sectoral areas
   the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also asked to
   respond to a few questions about capacity building and whether they believe the World Bank
   Group should have more or less local presence.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Costa Rica, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Costa Rica’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in twenty nine development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty one of these areas, such as transport, economic growth,
   public sector governance/reform, poverty reduction, and trade and exports.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the WBG reports, including which of them are the most
   useful, whether they raised substantive new information, and whether they provided them
   with useful information in terms of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG’s speed in disbursing funds,
   and whether the WBG is risk-averse.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Costa Rica: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Costa Rica, and which
   services the Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has
   moved to the right direction, and the future role international development cooperation
   should play in Costa Rica.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Costa Rica, which WBG agencies they work with, whether IFC and the Bank work
   well together, and their geographic location.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Costa Rica,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Costa Rica. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Costa Rica, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

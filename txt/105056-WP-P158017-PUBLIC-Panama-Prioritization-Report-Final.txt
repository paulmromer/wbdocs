Introduction
Infrastructure services are significant determinants of economic development, social welfare,
trade, and public health. As such, they typically feature strongly in national development plans.
While governments may receive many infrastructure project proposals, however, resources
are often insufficient to finance the full set of proposals in the short term. Leading up to 2020,
an estimated US$836 billion - 1 trillion will be required each year to meet growth targets
worldwide (Ruiz-Nu√±ez & Wei, 2014; World Bank). Global estimates of infrastructure
investments required to support economic growth and human development lie in the range of
US$65-70 trillion by 2030 (OECD, 2006), while the estimated pool of available funds is limited
to approximately US$45 trillion (B20, 2014).
The past twenty years have also seen a shift towards decentralized infrastructure planning.
Many subnational governments, regional entities, and sector agencies have been delegated
responsibility for infrastructure planning promote local responsiveness, but responsibility for
allocating funds often remains with a centralized finance agency (CFA). While constituencies
may propose numerous projects, governments often have insufficient financial resources to
implement the full suite of proposals.
As such, government must make difficult decisions about which projects to select for
implementation within a given investment period. This implies grappling with the relative
efficiency and effectiveness of investments as well as project costs and benefits. The multiple
considerations of project selection demand improved decision support frameworks that are
sufficiently rigorous to accommodate multiple facets, yet practical to implement.
Good practice suggests that economic and strategic project appraisals and feasibility studies
provide a good basis for project prioritization via highest societal net present value as a ranking
metric. The reality, however, is that capacity, resources, and time are often too short in supply
to support extensive economic analysis across full project sets. Decision-makers may only have
partial information on project costs and benefits, particularly since many are difficult to
quantify and monetize. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based infrastructure decision
support that is consistent and data-driven but pragmatic and responsive to the needs and
current capacities of a government.
The World Bank‚Äôs Infrastructure Prioritization Framework (IPF) responds directly to these
demands by offering a systematic approach to infrastructure prioritization that places
financial-economic and social-environmental factors at the forefront of decision-making. The
framework is transparent and objective, following a clear step-wise approach, but allows space
for deliberation in order to remain responsive to policy priorities.
The IPF framework is differentiated in four ways from other approaches to infrastructure
decision-making. First, it incorporates national policy goals, social and environmental
sustainability considerations, and long-term development aims alongside financial and
economic indicators. Second, it is predicated on parsimony and pragmatism. Third, it makes
space for policy debate via criteria identification and the selection of projects from mid-priority
categories. Fourth, it provides decision-makers with an intuitive, graphical interface upon
which to compare alternative investment scenarios.
IPF is not intended to replace traditional planning or policy analysis, which remain critical to
identifying problems, assessing their relative importance or urgency, and selecting from
amongst alternative solutions. These remain important pre-prioritization activities. IPF also


                                                                                                 2
does not propose to substitute extensive economic analysis with more basic appraisal in the
long term, or for major projects. Rather, IPF can be used employed as a catalyst to improve
data collection in order to progress more sophisticated and extensive appraisal methods,
including social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA).
This report presents the IPF methodology and results of the pilot application to a select set of
transport and water and sanitation projects in Panama. The report first gives background
information on infrastructure prioritization in Panama, then follows with a description of the
IPF in technical and implementation terms. Next, we present the results of the pilot and close
with recommendations for implementing IPF to a wider set of proposed projects.

Background
In Panama, the current economic outlook and institutional supports spurred pilot application
of the IPF. First, GDP growth and economic buoyancy in 2014 motivated an ambitious public
investment program, accompanied by a high number of infrastructure project proposals to the
Ministry of Economics and Finance. This was coupled with political commitment to narrow the
deficit, and thus demanded that Government select some projects and postpone others for
implementation during the following five-year strategic period.
Institutionally, the application of a prioritization methodology was endorsed via the
Government Strategic Plan 2015-2019, which called explicitly for systematic prioritization of
public investments and consideration of socio-economic and environmental indicators. In
keeping with the 2008 Social Fiscal Responsibility Law, the Government Strategic Plan sets
forth action areas for investments in economic sectors, social, infrastructure, developments of
people, environmental and governability over a five-year period. The 2015-2019 Plan is
premised on achieving social equity, better standards of life for all Panamanians, and
sustainable economic growth. The indicative plan is to be reviewed and updated annually to
account for changes in forecasted income and expenses and the availability of capital to service
project costs. As such, it recognizes that project execution is dependent on the availability of
sufficient finance.
The Strategic Plan accounts for public investments of approximately US$19.5 billion for the
following five-year period. Of this planned total, 15.2% (US$2.96 billion) is marked for road
projects, whereas 18.9% (US$3.69) is designated for water and sanitation. The Strategic Plan
is also linked to the Five-Year Investment Plan, which specifies allocations to various
Government ministries, agencies, and corporations for public expenditure.
The 2014 World Bank Panama Country Partnership Framework (CPF) also calls for technical
assistance to Panama on infrastructure prioritization (p. 19). In keeping with the Strategic Plan
and CPF, in April 2015, the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Panama engaged the World
Bank to undertake a technical advisory project to prioritize a select set of projects in the
transport and water and sanitation sectors. Nineteen projects in transport and 35 in water and
sanitation are the purview of the IPF pilot application herein.

Developing Panama‚Äôs Infrastructure
Infrastructure features heavily in Panama‚Äôs Government Strategic Plan 2015-2019, based on
(a) an aim to reduce infrastructural constraints on per capita GDP (see Loayza et al, 2004, and
Araujo, et al, 2014); and (b) recognition that national growth has stemmed largely from the



                                                                                               3
transport, commerce, and construction sectors. Construction has become a key economic
driver due to investment (public and private) in residential and non-residential infrastructure
(1.9% contribution over the past five years). The sectors also created most of the new
employment from 2007 to 2012, particularly for low-skill workers (World Bank, 2015).
While there is evidence of economic constraints from infrastructure, Panama has been ranked
highly in international comparisons: it is one of the most competitive countries in the region
on infrastructure developments, according to the Global Competitiveness Ranking prepared
by the World Economic Forum, and the country has positioned itself as a key trade and logistics
hub, naturally centered around the Panama Canal. Nevertheless, certain infrastructure
subsectors have lagged, including urban connectivity and energy.
With respect to the decision processes for infrastructure funding, a medium-term fiscal
framework sets the budget ceiling for the central government, decentralized institutions,
public companies and financial intermediaries. Institutions register programs and projects that
require budgetary resources into a project bank (BP) maintained by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF). The BP links pre-investment activities (e.g., proposal and appraisal) to
budget execution. Assessments of proposed projects take into account the budget ceiling and
the physical and financial performance of each institution. Based on this, the Directorate of
Investment Programming (DPI) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) provides a
preliminary recommendation. This is then reviewed and modified by another MEF directorate,
the Directorate of National Budget (DIPRENA), which assigns the final figure for each institution.

Transport
Roads are Panama‚Äôs weakest link with respect to trade infrastructure. Contrary to the country‚Äôs
elevated position on international rankings for port and air transport infrastructure, Panama
ranks 44th in the quality of road infrastructure (WEF, 2015), and road density is amongst the
lowest in Central America. Rectifying this is particularly important, as Central America has yet
to take full advantage of potential gains of regional integration and trade connectivity. The
physical trade network limits bilateral trade, and logistics costs can be as much as 50% of the
final price of traded goods. Estimates suggest that exports stand to double with integration
(Marcelo, et al, 2010).

Water
In the water sector, three government bodies are responsible for policy and investment: (a)
the Ministry of Health, via the Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DISAPAS), oversees sector
planning and service delivery in towns and rural areas; (b) the National Water and Sewerage
Institute / Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN) is responsible for
urban areas and rural communities with over 1,500 inhabitants; and (c) the National Authority
for Public Services (ASEP) supervises and regulates urban provision (World Bank, 2015).
There are observed coordination problems, as infrastructure investments may be made in
parallel, with no integrated sector investment plan. In this way, a structured prioritization
process has much to offer in the way of organizing project selection, both within and across
water agencies. One move towards better coordination, however, is in the development of a
new Interagency Commission for Drinking Water and Sewerage (CIAPAS), involving the three
agencies responsible for water and sanitation policies and investments. Regular meetings of
working committees are held to address water and sanitation policy issues and disaster risks.



                                                                                                4
Whereas 94% of Panama‚Äôs population has access to an improved water source, only 73% have
access to improved sanitation (World Bank b, 2015). Development needs in the sector are
concentrated in the comarcas, 1 where many residents have little or no access to improved
water supplies and sanitation. While public service quality, coverage, and reliability is generally
lower in dispersed rural areas, services are particularly poor in the comarcas (World Bank,
2015). Poor water and sanitation coverage has major implications for child health, including
the prevalence of diarrheal illness, and life expectancy overall. As such, if improving access to
water and sanitation in the comarcas is identified as a key policy goal, this can be coded into
future analysis via the inclusion in the social-environmental indicator.

Poverty
The concentration of poverty in rural indigenous areas has important implications for
infrastructure development. 2 Indigenous residents of comarcas have markedly low access to
basic services and infrastructure, and, whilst needs are also evident in urban areas and
amongst other segments of the population, slow development and particularly low conditions
in these areas cannot be overlooked. This requires that decision-makers deal with the
inherently different economic performance of proposed projects in rural areas in some sectors
in a way that does not penalize the communities where needs are greatest.

Infrastructure Prioritization Framework
The Infrastructure Prioritization Framework is a quantitative approach that synthetizes and
displays financial and economic as well as social and environmental indicators at the project
level and considers these alongside the public budget constraint for a sector. Results are
displayed graphically to map comparative performance along these dimensions.
While the IPF is quantitative in nature, it employs knowledge that is practice-based or political
and opens space for deliberation in criteria and project selection. The approach recognizes

1.   Comarca ind√≠gena or ‚Äòcomarcas‚Äô in Panama are five indigenous regions, representing 20% of the national
     territory, which hold special administrative status alongside provinces. The comarcas are Ngobe-bugle and
     Campesino, Kuna Yalar, Embera-Wounan, Kuna de Madugandi, and Kuna de Wargandi.
2.   42% of Panama‚Äôs extremely poor residents live in the comarcas.


                                                                                                            5
that project selection cannot be entirely dissociated from the political economy of a sector.
Particular projects may be chiefly valued by governments and other stakeholders due to key
policy goals which are non-economic in nature, or due to considerations that objective
indicators cannot measure, such as upholding election promises, promoting social cohesion,
or honoring culture. As such, the IPF accommodates policy and political responsiveness in two
ways: through the selection of criteria (indicators) for assessment and by leaving a degree of
freedom in decision-making through provision of two references for judgment (the indices).
The IPF was created in response to observed government demand, including a needs for (a)
improving infrastructure planning at national and sector levels; (b) considering large projects
sets with scarce planning resources; (c) meaningfully addressing environmental and social
factors; and (d) balancing analytical efficiency, derived from standardization, with policy and
political responsiveness. Institutionalizing a systematic approach to prioritization is further
justified by public demand for evidence, value, and legitimacy in infrastructure decision-
making. These logics are detailed in Marcelo, et al, 2016. To be deemed legitimate and
comprehensive, prioritization must be based on sound evidence that affords meaningful
comparison. Many project comparisons are inherently technical; thus, IPF is designed to
employ quantitative measures to the greatest extent possible to limit subjectivity.
Furthermore, comprehensiveness requires that project comparisons make space for multiple
policy goals and facets of project selection. This lends support to employing multi-criteria
approaches, with criteria selected to reflect considerations of effectiveness and value, as well
as sector and national policy goals. The IPF captures the strengths of multi-criteria decision
approaches, but also allows use of inputs from cost-benefit analysis (CBA). 3
The process by which infrastructure is prioritized must also be administratively and politically
feasible. This suggests that governments adopt the principle of parsimony ‚Äì using the least
amount of relevant information needed to inform a decision. Administrative feasibility means
that approach can be implemented within limits of institutional capacity, cost, time, and data
availability. And political feasibility accepts that prioritization cannot be totally unresponsive
to political factors. In summary, most infrastructure policy contexts demand the reconciliation
of highly technical and objective policy analysis with more political and practice-based inputs,
all within the resource means of government.

The IPF Process

Implementing the IPF is relatively straightforward, following five steps: (1) selecting decision
criteria; (2) gathering project indicator data; (3) calculating social-environmental and financial-
economic indices; (4) plotting projects and budget limits; and (5) selecting projects (see Figure
2). In this section, we describe implementation in terms of these steps, with direct reference
to the Panama pilot. An extensive technical description of the IPF methodology is also detailed
in Marcelo, et al, 2016.



3.   We recognize multiple approaches to investment decision-making, including social cost-benefit analysis
     (SCBA). For an extensive discussion of alternative approaches, see Marcelo, et al, 2016. Whereas SCBA
     requires fully monetized information on costs and benefits, IPF makes use of available inputs (e.g., financial
     CBA). IPF‚Äôs value-adds to CBA are in (a) directly treating non-marketed impacts in ‚Äònatural‚Äô units; (b) relieving
     the burden of making and justifying assumptions required to monetize benefits and costs; and (c) dealing
     directly with issues like equity and social justice.

One important pre-analytical step is the delineation of proposed projects to which the IPF will
apply. This may include the full universe of projects proposed to Government, or a select set.
In the case of the Panama pilot, experts from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), in
consultation with participants from the Ministry of Public Works / Ministerio de Obras P√∫blicas
(MOP), Ministry of Health / Ministerio de Salud (MINSA), and the National Water and Sewerage
Institute / Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN), a consultant in charge
of the Government‚Äôs Strategic Plan, and experts from the World Bank, randomly selected 34
and 19 projects in the water and urban mobility sectors, respectively.
Basic information for these projects was obtained from the Banco de Proyectos, the platform
of the National Public Investment System (SINIP), where all public investments carried out by
state agencies are recorded at the national level. Only projects above US$ 5 million were
included in this exercise, as they are bound to meet the data requirements of Article 12 of Law
25 (amending Article 23 of Law 34 on Social and Fiscal Responsibility). This law indicates that
investment projects with proposed costs equal to or greater than 0.1% of the General State
Budget must include studies on costs and social benefits, whereas projects less than 0.1% but
more than five million dollars (US$ 5,000,000) require at least prefeasibility studies.
The 19 transport projects included in the analysis are listed in Annex 1, along with project costs
and the raw data on indicator values. The 35 water and sanitation projects included in the
analysis are listed in Annex 2, along with project costs and the raw data on indicator values.
Participants from the Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers (IDAAN), Ministry of Public Works
(MOP), and Ministry of Health (MOH) were included in the implementation stages.

Step 1. Identifying criteria

The first step in applying the IPF is to select the criteria used to compare projects. The selection
of variables seeks to preserve the principle of parsimony. Accordingly, this methodology



                                                                                                                            7
requires a minimum level of relevant information to assess the various expected outcomes of
proposed infrastructure projects. The selection of variables may differ amongst application
contexts, based on government policy goals (e.g., particular sectorial, social, and
environmental aims) and stakeholder consultations, but will generally include indicators of
value, efficiency, and social and environmental impact.
This step is an opportunity to leverage professional knowledge and allow policy-makers,
experts, and other key stakeholders to reach consensus on the decision factors most important
to project selection. In this way, the step crystallizes the Government‚Äôs agreed goals of
infrastructure development. In the Panama pilot, the initial list of variables was agreed during
a technical workshop including participants from the World Bank team, Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF) technical staff, National Water Supply and Sanitation Administration /
Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers (IDAAN), Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Public Works
(MOP), and Ministry of Government (MINGOB).
The variables are organized into two categories: social-environmental and financial-economic.
The indicators originally selected were as follows:

          Social-Environmental Indicators                 Financial-Economic Indicators
     ‚Ä¢ Beneficiaries (people served)                 ‚Ä¢ Internal rate of return
     ‚Ä¢ Jobs created                                  ‚Ä¢ Multiplier effects
     ‚Ä¢ Negatively affected (people and costs)        ‚Ä¢ Externalities (e.g., avoided diseases)
     ‚Ä¢ Poverty (coverage map)                        ‚Ä¢ Implementation risks
     ‚Ä¢ Environmental footprint (positive,
      neutral, negative)


Infrastructure projects are meant to improve quality of life. A number of direct social and
environmental benefits are relevant, including improved access to public services and job and
income opportunities created during construction and operation. These benefits come at a
cost, however. Engineering works may require clearing forested areas, polluting and
endangering natural environments, or resettling communities. The IPF directly considers
relevant social and environmental benefits and costs via indicators used to construct a social
and environmental index (SEI). In Panama, the SEI initially consisted of five indicators: the
number of direct beneficiaries; direct jobs created; people affected by repurposing of land use;
poverty; and the environmental footprint (categorized as negative, neutral, or positive).
The financial and economic viability and fiscal burden of a project is a central issue in all
infrastructure decision-making. Four indicators were initially selected to comprise the
financial-economic index (FEI): the internal rate of return, economic multiplier effects,
monetizable externalities, and implementation risk.

Adjusting criteria variable specification
One key lesson drawn from the Panama pilot was that a need to adjust some of the original
indicators may arise. An indicator may be found to be analytically problematic due to lack of
sufficient data, calculation problems, or other issues such as imprecision in the variable
specification or specifications that do not capture policy goals. This is an iterative process, and
indicator problems are likely to be discovered during data collection (Step 2) or index
calculation (Step 3). In the case of Panama, the major constraints that emerged were (1)



                                                                                                 8
variable incalculability, (2) unavailability of data, (3) insufficient precision in variable
specification, and (4) sector-specific needs. These are described in the following table.

 1. ‚ÄòNumber affected‚Äô eliminated from SEI             No data available
 2. ‚ÄòEnvironmental footprint‚Äô eliminated from SEI     Indicator found too imprecise (1-3) to reflect scale of differences
                                                      between projects.
 3. Transport SEI variables controlled for project    Beneficiaries and jobs created per dollar gives an indication of
    size (cost); original SEI variables transformed   relative efficiency of projects. In contrast, SEI variables for water
    and expressed as ratios of cost (e.g., number     projects were not adjusted, as doing so would have privileged urban
    of beneficiaries / jobs created per dollar)       projects over rural.
 4. Absolute number of potential poor receiving       Poverty rates are higher in less densely populated areas, but in
    service used instead of poverty ratio (%) to      absolute terms, poor are mainly concentrated in urban areas. The

                                                      when using PCA. Using absolute values corrected the problem.
 5. FEI for both sectors limited to benefit-cost      Insufficient data for multiplier effects, externalities, and

                                                      monetized benefits

An important adjustment was made to the calculation of FEI. The FEI was originally expected
to include the internal rate of return (IRR) and/or economic rate of return (ERR) of projects,
depending on data availability, in addition to several other indicators. Since many of these
investments were proposed for projects with no direct monetary benefits and largely indirect
economic effects (i.e. mainly projects with a large public good component), however, the
calculation of IRR would have produced unrealistic or incalculable results.
The alternative would have been to account for all indirect positive effects and estimate
benefits. This would require data on monetized benefits for such effects, which was not
available. For these reasons, we relied on the NPV (assuming given discount rates) of available
information to calculate benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). The BCRs also allowed us to control for
project size and avoid penalizing projects with higher costs but possibly higher benefits.

The Social and Environmental Index (SEI) and the Financial and Economic Index (FEI) are each
built on sets of quantitative variables combined into one index via an additive model. To
condense disparate data types and scales of measurement into indices, three data
transformations are required. One must (a) transform ordinal qualitative data into usable
quantitative scalar data; (b) standardize criteria to isolate the various units of measure; and (c)
establish weights for each criterion in the additive model.


                                                                                                               10
Because all of the variables selected were already quantitative, we did not have to perform the
first transformation. We did, however, standardize the numerical values via a typical
standardization formula. The standard score Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß of a raw score Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• is
                          Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚àíÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ó
         Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ =                            ,
                                 Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ó

where Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá is the sample mean and Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé is the standard deviation of the variable j. The
standardization formulas are coded into the Excel platform.

Step 3. Constructing the SEI and FEI

Indices are used to combine information from multiple variables into one composite indicator.
In IPF, there are two variable classes that comprise the social-environmental index (SEI) and
the financial-economic index (FEI). In the case of Panama, since the FEI was comprised of a
single component (the standardized benefit-cost ratio), its calculation was based on the
standardization and normalization steps (see Step 2) only.
The SEI, on the other hand, was constructed by an additive model that combined variables with
associated weights. The function may be expressed as
         Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±Ü = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§1 √ó (Ì†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µ) + Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§2 √ó (Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É) + Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§3 √ó (Ì†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞ΩÌ†µÌ∞Ω),
where weights, Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ , are associated with each of the social-environmental indicators.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to determine the weights Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ of each variable in
the additive function. PCA is an information reduction procedure that seeks redundancies in a
set of variables. These redundancies can be expressed as linear combinations or ‚Äòprincipal
components‚Äô of the variables comprising the set, where each principal component is a
weighted average of the original indicators. 5 The first principal component corresponds to the
linear combination of variables that retains the maximum information of the original data set
(Pearson, 1901). One of the main characteristics of PCA is the ability to calculate coefficients
based solely on the statistical relationship between variables. This is particularly useful when
there is a preference to objectively assign weights. Nevertheless, other methods such as equal
weighting or expert-decided weighting may also be employed for reference. 6
After the SIEs and FIEs are calculated for each project, they are normalized and rescaled to
generate scores between 0 and 100 for each project‚Äôs index score. The rescaled Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ score is
                                                              Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚àíÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö
         Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö (Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ) =                                        √ó 100
                                                          Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö ‚àíÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö

where Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö is the minimum value for variable Z and Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö is the maximum value. These
rescaled scores are used as the SEI and FEI scores for plotting in Step 4.




5.   The coefficients, or weights, associated with variables in each principal component are those that maximize
     the variance of each. The notation for the first principal component Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶ is:
     Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶ = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§1Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ +Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§2Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ +‚Ä¶+Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õ ,
     where Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ denotes each observation and Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õ denotes the weight for the nth variable Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• . The coefficients Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±õ of
     each ‚Äòfirst principal component‚Äô are taken as the weights associated with each variable Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• .
6.   The simplest mode of weighting is equality, where all criteria are equally considered. An alternative method
     is negotiated expert guidance, where a panel of decision-makers decides weights based on experience.

Transport Index Scores
The SEI index scores were based on PCA-determined weights of .650, .439, and .633 associated
with beneficiaries per dollar (BEN_COS), employment per dollar (EMP_COS), and poor people
served per dollar (POOR_COS), respectively. The results are shown in Figure 3.

in Step 4. The alternative tested for Transport was equal weighting of SEI variables. Figure 5
shows that project rankings by SEI changes very minimally.

Determining the Budget Limit
The SEI and FEI rankings are used to determine the set of projects fundable under the budget
limits for the visual interface to follow in Step 4. Budget limits are mapped separately for SEI
and FEI rankings, but using the same budget limit value. In other words, the limits are imposed
on each index ranking, according to the hypotheticals that projects would be entirely selected
according to SEI or to FEI, respectively.
The process is simple: the available budget is ‚Äòallocated‚Äô to the top-ranking project on the SEI,
followed by the second, third, and so on, until the available resources are exhausted. For
example, the total cost of proposed water and sanitation projects (excluding Project 2) was
US$622,091,173. Based on recommended figures from the MEF (DIPRENA and DPI), in turn
based on the Draft Annual Budget, the limit for water and sanitation was assumed to be 55%
of the total cost of proposed projects, equaling $342,150,145. Considering the costs of the top-
ranking SEI projects 15, 3, 23, and so on, the budget would be exhausted after Project 29, at
which the cumulative expenditure would be $318,906,839. Since Project 12 costs $60,000,000,
there is insufficient funding to include it.

The same is done for the FEI. For water and sanitation, the last project that could be funded
was also Project 29, with a cumulative expenditure of $304,002,232. The cumulative totals are
different because the ranking of projects according to each index are different.

For transport, the budget constraint was estimated based on historical allocation of about 60%
of requested funding. This resulted in an estimated $139,586,000 budget limit.

Step 4. Using the Visual Interface: Plotting Results on the Investment Frontier

A ‚Äògood‚Äô project, in terms of financial and economic performance, may nevertheless be
undesirable from a social and environmental perspective, and vice versa. As such, decision-
makers must consider projects along both dimensions. Projects can be compared by their
respective SEI and FEI scores on a visual interface called the Infrastructure Prioritization Matrix.
Step 4 involves plotting each project on a Cartesian plane, with axes defined by the SEI and FEI.
In Figure 9, each point represents a proposed transport project, whose location on the plane
is determined by (x,y) coordinates defined by the (FEI, SEI) score pair.
Once projects are plotted, the budget limit described above is imposed onto the plane,
perpendicular to each axis, at the point where the budget would exhausted if project funding
was determined solely according to each index. Since this is done along each axis, four
quadrants are formed. In Figures 9 and 10, the red dotted lines represent the budget constraint
for the sector that delineates the four quadrants.
Projects that fall inside the budget constraint along each axis (i.e., above the dotted line,
respective to the y or SEI axis, and to the right of the dotted line, respective to the x or FEI axis)
represent the Investment Possibilities Set for each dimension. The set of projects in Quadrant
A are those that fall in the Investment Possibilities Set for both SEI and FEI. These are
categorized as ‚ÄòHigh Priority‚Äô projects. Projects in Quadrant B are categorized as ‚ÄòHigh Priority
SEI‚Äô projects, and Quadrant C projects are categorized as ‚ÄòHigh Priority FEI‚Äô projects.
For transport, an estimated budget of $139,585,800 is available. If the high priority projects
are implemented first, totaling US$77,430,000 (see Table 4), a remainder of US$62,155,800 is
available for other proposed projects that may be selected from quadrants B or C depending
on policy priorities.
In the case of the water sector, the budget available for water and sanitation projects is
US$342,150,145. Table 5 shows that, after funding high priority projects for a total of
US$144,509,839, a remaining $197,640,306 is available for other prioritization categories.

Considering Subsectors: Separating Water and Sanitation
A look at the project rankings and Figure 10 shows that water projects tend to score higher on
FEI than sanitation projects. As such, the ranking of projects together results in a matrix that
classifies no sanitation projects as ‚ÄòHigh Priority‚Äô nor ‚ÄòHigh Financial-Economic Priority‚Äô. The
three ‚ÄòHigh Social-Environmental Priority‚Äô projects, conversely, are all sanitation projects.
This observation reaffirms the need to target investments specifically to sanitation to ensure
that much-needed resources are secured for implementation of sanitation improvements. By
allocating resources by subsector, the government can identify the sanitation projects that are
positioned in the high priority space and carve out budget specifically for the subsector.
To determine additive weights for SEI, we again performed Principal Components Analysis, but
separately for the water and sanitation project sets. This would be done for FEI also, if more
than one input variable was involved.
Table 6. Revised Water and Sanitation Project SEI PCA Weights
                                                            BEN     EMP         POOR
 Combined water and sanitation PCA weighting                0.687   0.233       0.688
 Water only PCA weighting                                   0.625   0.42        0.657
 Sanitation only PCA weighting                              0.598   0.516       0.613

Next, we estimated separate subsector budget constraints based on 55% allocation of total
subsector project costs for each. And finally, we created separate Infrastructure Prioritization
Matrices that identified two sets of High Priority projects based on the separate analysis.
Whereas no sanitation projects were classified as High Priority in combined analysis, separating
the subsectors promotes sanitation Projects 23 and 24 to High Priority status. The analysis does
not change the ranking of projects within each subsector.

Sensitivity Analysis
To improve the robustness of prioritization results, a sensitivity analysis was introduced. The
sensitivity analysis tested how much the ranking of projects change when using alternative
weighting schemes on the SEI scores for transport, water, and sanitation projects. Again, the
weights assigned to variables in the SEI may be determined by PCA, or other methods, including
equal weighting or a weighting scheme that reflects particular policy goals. For example, if
there is an emphasis on extending services to the poor or creating employment, these factors
in the SEI may be weighted more heavily. However, PCA is best when there is a preference to
objectively assign weights. A prioritization scheme where decisions rely on subjective judgment
may reduce legitimacy to government decisions, especially in environments with low
institutional capacity.
For transport, we tested two alternative weighting scenarios to compare outcomes with the
project ranking by PCA-determined SEIs. These alternatives were equal weighting 7 and a
weighting scheme that hypothesizes a government emphasis on most beneficiaries served and
most jobs created. These alternative weights are summarized in Table 9.
Table 9. Transport SEI Sensitivity Analysis
                                           BEN_COS      EMP_COS   POOR_COS
 PCA Weighting                                0.638      0.439       0.633
 Alternative scenario 1: Equal weighting      0.577      0.577       0.577
 Alternative 2                                0.650      0.650       0.394

Similarly, for water and sanitation projects (still evaluated separately), we tested alternative
scenarios of equal weighting and ranking by the combined water-sanitation PCA weights. The
latter (termed ‚ÄòAlternative 2‚Äô) can also be thought of as hypothetically representing a policy
priority on overall beneficiaries and poor due to higher weights for these variables. These
weighting scenarios are summarized in Tables 10 and 11.
Table 10. Water SEI Sensitivity Analysis
                                                BEN        EMP        POOR
 PCA Weighting                                0.638       0.439       0.633
 Alternative scenario 1: Equal weighting      0.577       0.577       0.577
 Alternative 2                                0.687       0.233       0.688

                                                 BEN      EMP         POOR
 PCA Weighting                                  0.598     0.516       0.613
 Alternative scenario 1: Equal weighting        0.577     0.577       0.577
 Alternative 2                                  0.687     0.233       0.688

To demonstrate the results of sensitivity analysis, we present three Infrastructure Prioritization
Matrices each for transport, water, and sanitation. The results in Figures 14, 15, and 16 reveal
an important finding, namely that project rankings change very little with alternative weighting
scenarios. This suggests that SEI scores are much more sensitive to the values of input variables
themselves that to the weighting system applied to combine them. It also demonstrates the
robustness of results generated by the PCA-weighted Infrastructure Prioritization Framework.
Nevertheless, alternative weighting may be still applied to meet policy requirements.

Step 5. Selecting Projects

Projects categorized as ‚ÄòHigh Priority‚Äô in Quadrant A are natural targets for project selection,
as they represent the set of projects that score highly with respect to both social-
environmental and economic-financial considerations. Projects in Quadrants B and C, on the
other hand, score relatively high on either the SEI or FEI, but not both. If all Quadrant A projects
are selected, the remaining budget could be allocated to either (a) all projects in Quadrant B,
if social-environmental factors are privileged over financial-economic ones, (b) all projects in
Quadrant C, if financial and economic factors are most important, or (c) a combined array of
select projects from each.
Selection of a mixed set from amongst Quadrants B and C makes space for expert review,
flexibility, and informed political debate. The negotiated process of ordering projects within
Quadrants B and C (and even those clustered around the quadrant intersection in Quadrant D)
allows IPF to capture important information from the professional and political bases of
knowledge amongst decision-makers. In other words, the framework informs decisions
regarding projects in the medium-priority set, but leaves room for structured professional and
political judgment.

Considering Projects at the Intersection
It is important to note that projects in Quadrant D are not automatically removed from
consideration. While categorized as ‚ÄòLower Priority‚Äô, they may be considered alongside High
Priority FEI and SEI projects when they are clustered around the intersection of the budget line
and also score relatively higher than some projects in Quadrants B or C along one dimension.
This is demonstrated in Figure 10 above, where some Quadrant D water and sanitation projects
clustered around the axis score relatively higher on SEI than some projects in Quadrant C, ‚ÄòHigh
Priority FEI‚Äô. For example, Project 12, located in Quadrant D near the axis, has a higher SEI score
than Projects 5 and 13 in Quadrant C, which have a higher FEI but low social-environmental
rating. If government prioritizes social and environmental considerations above financial
aspects, some projects in Quadrant D may compete strongly with those ‚ÄòHigh Priority FEI‚Äô
projects with relatively low SEI scores. Conversely, some ‚ÄòHigh Priority SEI‚Äô projects score lower
on FEI than do the ‚ÄòLower Priority‚Äô projects clustered near the axis.

Tradeoffs: Considering High-Cost Projects
In some cases, a project with a very high cost may fall within Quadrant B or C but score low on
one dimension. As such, when considering the Quadrant B and C projects, implementation of
the high cost project may mean that Government must forgo funding a number of other
smaller projects. In this case, it would be recommendable to acknowledge tradeoffs between
one large project and many others ‚Äì a decision that comes with political ramifications.
For example in Transport, Project 3 is positioned in Quadrant C, and is one of three very high
cost projects (the others are Projects 2 and 6) with a total cost of $ 58,668,000. By foregoing
Project 3, the Government could instead fund seven projects (Projects 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 17, and 18)
in Quadrant B, which all score higher with respect to SEI and total only $33,545,000 combined.

Next Steps: Implementing IPF
The following section discusses challenges to IPF in Panama, key lessons drawn from the pilot,
and next steps for full implementation.

Challenges and Lessons
The main challenge to overcome in moving towards full implementation of the IPF is the limited
and deficient technical, financial and economic data at the project level. Calculation of the SEI
and FEI depends on the availability and consistency of indicator values for each project. At
present, these are missing for some projects or of undetermined accuracy.
In 2001, the Public Investments System of Panama (SINIP) was created under the Panama
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to store project-level information. One of the main
institutional goals of the SINIP was to provide an information system for designing, evaluating,
training and monitoring investment projects in the public sector (Executive Decree 148,
December 11, 2001). While this could be a useful platform on which to base IPF, information
consigned in the SINIP database is not currently sufficient to implement the framework. There
are no established basic information requirements for all projects, and the definitions and
consistency of variables stored vary from project to project, even within a particular sector.
Moreover, this analysis has identified important data limitations in the selected sectors.
For example, between 1995 and 2005, the Panama Ministry of Public Works (MOP) carried out
economic evaluations based on the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM),
versions 3 and 4. Technical and economic evaluations of road projects were based on the HDM.
However, this practice was suspended 10 years ago, and since then, there is no systematic
production of data for proper financial and economic analyses of transport projects.
To strengthen the SINIP database and make it suitable for the IPF, we recommend adding a
prioritization module to systematically gather a minimum set of relevant information to assess,



                                                                                                                       27
rank and select projects. This model would be used to populate the database on which to run
the IPF analysis, as described in the steps above. Building this platform would require (a) a
redesign or at least modification of the existing SINIP platform, and (b) a training plan to
develop the institutional capacity within MEF to monitor the quality of data, interpret results
and update the IPF platform.
Three main lessons have emerged from this analysis. First, although a full CBA assessment for
each of the proposed infrastructure projects to the MEF is unrealistic given the information
requirements, set assumptions, and extensive technical and resource needs, we recognize the
value of incorporating CBA elements on the financial and economic side of the IPF. To integrate
available CBA elements into the framework, we calculated Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) that
contrasted the net present value of observable monetary (monetized) flow of revenues against
the observable flow of costs per project. While this information significantly enriched the FEI
estimations, it is still insufficient to provide a comprehensive picture of the financial and
economic aspects of the infrastructure projects. For a full implementation of the IPF, we
recommend to combine the BCR information with other financial and economic aspects, such
as externalities, multiplier effects, and implementation risks.
The second main lesson, drawn from sensitivity analysis, is that IPF is more sensitive to
indicator values than the weights assigned to each variable. This finding shows that PCA
weighting is a good approach to combining indicators into index values, as it is both objective
and robust. The objectivity of index construction lends credibility to project selection and helps
protect against over-politicization of project selection or allegations of particularistic policy
making.
The third lesson is that it may desirable to prioritize projects at the subsector level. In the
separation of water and sanitation projects in the pilot, we see the benefit of prioritizing
subsectors separately. This could also reasonably apply to the consideration of construction
versus rehabilitation projects within a sector such as transport. The advisability of separating
project analysis by subsector will depend on the number of projects to be prioritized, patterns
in the results of combined analysis, and policy goals. To the first point, there should be a
sufficient number of each sub-category of project to justify disaggregation. To the second point,
if a certain category of project regularly scores comparatively low but is responding to a
particular policy goal (e.g., sanitation projects), they may be considered separately.
There are some additional needs related to variable definitions that must be dealt with moving
forward. For one, variables must be carefully defined to ensure that PCA applies as intended.
In the pilot, poverty levels (in percentage terms) were inversely related to other desirable
factors (e.g., jobs created, beneficiaries). This resulted in PCA-determined weights that
negatively weighted poverty, which stands at odds with policy goals. This may be dealt with in
several ways, but our approach was to select a different poverty metric, the absolute number
of poor beneficiaries, which both reflected poverty levels and also yielded positive PCA weights.
Another variable decision, which may be made on a sector or subsector basis, is whether to
choose indicators that are reflective of effectiveness or efficiency. For example, if the number
of beneficiaries is known (as an input to the SEI), one could use the absolute value to help
answer questions of effectiveness (e.g., expansion of service to the most people possible). On
the other hand, an indicator such as ‚Äòbeneficiaries per dollar spent‚Äô or ‚Äòdollars per beneficiary‚Äô,
would demonstrate a measure of efficiency.



                                                                                                28
Lastly, it is important for decision-makers to be aware that project outcomes tend to be better
in high-income areas. In a past pilot application to Vietnam, we discovered an inherent bias
towards infrastructure projects in wealthier regions attributable to better project preparation
and generally better social-environmental indicator scores for direct beneficiaries or jobs
created. Whilst the poverty score can counter-balance this, the issue is important to keep in
mind. This can be further tested by mapping results to location and local economic and
development conditions.

Implementation Requirements
Implementing the IPF to full infrastructure sectors will require the commitment of staff and
resources for data collection and analysis, as well as the establishment of an institutional set-
up and decision-making structure that can facilitate the IPF and translate its outputs into
decision-making. In this section, we propose organizational and resource recommendations
for implementation.
Recalling the IPF process map, we identify three sets of requirements for each step:
participants, capacities, and resources.

The table above proposes that the levels of authority required for successful implementation
of each step are highest in the first and fifth steps, whereas technical analytical skills are highest
in the second through fourth steps. The beginning (criteria selection) and final stage (project
selection) of IPF are the most inherently political and require sufficient authority over
infrastructure policy setting for IPF to be effective. In other words, the participants in Steps 1
and 5 must be actors who also have the authority to make investment decisions.
The technical steps (2 through 4) may be relegated to technical analysts or consultants with
sectoral experience and familiarity with quantitative analysis. The latter is important for
checking the reliability and soundness of inputs sourced from project information sheets, and
specialists may also be required to perform their own estimates of projected benefits,
environmental impacts, and risk, depending on the data supplied by government.

Improving Project Data
There are two areas where project data may be improved: in the SINIP system and in pre-
feasibility and feasibility studies. In consultation with MEF and line agencies, the SINIP can be
made to include a prioritization platform that specifically requires the submission of IPF data
during project proposal. The platform should include some data points that are generally
applicable to all sectors, but may also be customized to reflect particular policy goals of a sector
or subsector. For example, if the reduced congestion or improved connectivity are key
transport policy goals, metrics can be designed for inclusion in the platform for transport
projects.




                                                                                                                     30
Other data may be gathered from more detailed feasibility studies. At present, the proposed
projects over 0.1% of the General State Budget require feasibility studies, and projects under
this amount but over $5 million require pre-feasibility studies. The content of these studies
and their basic requirements can be customized to meet the needs of implementing IPF. In
particular, the feasibility studies must also be made to justify and explain the calculations or
estimates of key social variables, such as number of beneficiaries and number of poor served,
and important financial-economic inputs such as benefit-cost ratios, internal rates of return,
or net present values. This requires better data on the streams of costs and revenues over a
project‚Äôs lifecycle, as well as better projections of service, which are key to ensuring that the
indicators submitted for each project are comparable across projects.
In addition to improving data collection, index construction would be improved by better
indicator specification. For example, the FEI would be strengthened by consideration of other
important financial-economic factors, beyond the BCR, as well as by capturing other measures
of benefits. For example, economic multiplier effects could be estimated with further
disaggregation of national input-output tables by service sector for the construction industry.
Better measures of implementation risk could help quantify the costs of potential
implementation challenges. And the quantification of benefits could also be improved. To this
last point, whereas transport estimates involved maintenance costs saved from rehabilitation
and water estimates accounted for ‚Äòbenefits‚Äô via tariff revenues, there was little data available
to capture the benefits of sanitation projects, such as mitigation of health and productivity
costs. Work done by the World Bank 8 on estimating the costs associated with under provision
could be useful to inform estimation of these benefits.
With respect to social and environmental indicators, measures of environmental impact (e.g.,
carbon footprint) may be greatly improved to reflect the environmental costs of proposed
projects, and a measure of social risks should be better specified to capture potential human
impacts. At present, a simple high-medium-low score was given to reflect these risks, which is
too imprecise to be useful for IPF or decision-making, in general. These variable specifications
need to be further developed in consultation with decision-makers.
The pilot application of IPF demonstrates the analytical power of a systematic infrastructure
investment decision framework and offers an approach to improve the evidence base for
infrastructure decisions. The approach is objective and data-driven yet based on the
application of consensus-determined decision criteria. This allows for transparency in
investment decisions alongside improved responsiveness to policy goals. Furthermore, the use
of evidence is balanced by a degree of flexibility to accommodate sector-level policy and
incorporate valuable practice-based, professional, and political knowledge at multiple levels of
government.

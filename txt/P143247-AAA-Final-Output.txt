Executive Summary


In the early 2000s, governments began to recognize the uneven implementation and mixed
success of past privatizations. Meanwhile, the critical voices denouncing the adverse social
effects of privatization were gaining traction in a context of rising unemployment and sluggish
investment. Privatization efforts began to stall or even see a partial reversal. In the Arab
Republic of Egypt, for example, a highly public squabble over the department store Omar
Effendi ended in the re-nationalization of the chain.1

The governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is a crucial issue for economic and social
development in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for four main reasons. First, these
enterprises play an important role in key sectors of the region’s economies, including banking,
transport, and industry. Second, SOEs have benefited from connections to the ruling elite, at the
cost of citizens, as debated in post-revolution Tunisia. Third, as the room for fiscal
maneuverability becomes increasingly narrow in many MENA countries such as Tunisia and
Morocco, it is important to assess the budgetary risks associated with state-owned enterprises
and institutions. Finally, although the participation of the state in the productive sector has
developed in many countries in the MENA region using various instruments, new governance
models are being developed.2

The main objective of this report is to identify the main governance problems related to SOEs
and their main impacts on economic development in the selected countries.

This report builds on four background papers, each on a MENA country: Egypt, Iraq, Morocco,
and Tunisia. Morocco was selected because it carried out a well-known reform in the early 2000s
and has a much more diverse and sophisticated SOE portfolio than most countries in the MENA
region. Egypt and Tunisia were selected because they have been lagging behind in reforms, and
SOEs have been used to generate employment since the Arab Spring (2011–12). Finally, Iraq
was chosen because of its problems related to its post-conflict situation and the fact that SOEs
have traditionally been major economic players in this country3.

Each background paper presented the same aspects: descriptive statistics on the size of the
“sector?, legal definition of SOEs, main governance problems, main reform attempts and their
outcomes and examples of governance problems/reforms for some emblematic SOEs.

Good governance of SOEs in MENA region has always been a stated goal in countries in which
their economic and social roles are important. It has been difficult empirically to identify

1
  By matching sample firms (privatized) with control firms (SOEs) over 1994 –98, Omran (2004) demonstrated that
privatized firms did not exhibit significant improvements in their performance relative to SOEs and then questioned
the benefits of Egyptian privatization during this period.

Musacchio and Lazarrini (2012).

  World Bank engagement has also been important regarding SOEs reforms in the four selected countries
and provided us useful information.
universally the most economically and socially efficient type of governance for SOEs. Because
SOEs are likely to remain, in the medium term at least, state-owned in MENA countries,
governments are seeking to ensure that they perform as well as possible.
Over the last two decades, MENA countries went through a corporatization4 process, along with
some privatizations. The main stated objective was usually to reduce subsidies and public
funding to SOEs. In several countries of the region, some PPP (public-private partnership)
arrangements with private capital were developed. Despite such major reforms, the results have
usually been mixed at best, with the remaining governance problems characterized by
overemployment (exacerbated since the Arab Spring) and recruitment of cronies, fiscal risks, and
pervasive opacity.
SOE reforms were congruent with the implementation in the 1990s of new public management
(NPM) ideas in countries such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The
main underlying idea of the NPM approach was that, to be more efficient and effective, the
public sector should behave much more like the private sector. In fact, SOEs are usually
constrained in the following areas: appointment of managers, employment level, wages and
benefits for staff, procurement, selling prices, and investment levels (Nabli 2001).

The NPM approach was adapted to SOEs at the end of the 1990s (Wettenhall and Thynne 2002).
Based on the idea that private-like management of SOEs would improve their efficiency, several
tenets were adopted for SOE reforms such as the need to corporatize SOEs (because the
approach implied a new governance structure in which the board would serve as the main
management institution), the need to give more autonomy to the SOE management and board (to
reduce political interference), and the need to have the state act as an owner, looking for profits
and efficiency. As noted by Wettenhall and Thynne (2002), “devolution? and “let managers
manage? have been the mottoes of the principles of governance in SOE reforms.

The guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECCD) on
the governance of SOEs (OECD 2005) identify the main principles of good governance that
would lead to better performance (mostly from a profit maximization perspective). Table ES.1
sums up the main expected changes to SOE governance structures if the OECD guidelines were
applied in a reform process.5

  Corporatization is the process of transforming state assets into joint stock companies. The state retains
majority ownership of the SOE but strives to introduce it to corporate and business management
techniques.

  Rigorous empirical evidence of such impacts is difficult to reveal and is not plentiful. (Vagliasindi
2008a).

  The report focuses on supply-side aspects of SOEs reforms since demand-side has been usually weak in
the region and, even in the OECD guidelines, relations with stakeholders are not necessarily with services
users.

Table ES.2 outlines how the four selected countries perform along the four principles defined by
the OECD guidelines (OECD 2005): (1) transforming the role of the state from manager to
owner; (2) strengthening the autonomy of SOEs; (3) corporatizing SOEs and ensuring the
independence of boards; and (4) increasing transparency and accountability.

Morocco has achieved some steps on transparency, professionalizing SOEs, monitoring, and
even giving more autonomy to some SOE management. By contrast, the three remaining
countries, despite some reforms on paper, have not improved much and mainly continue with a
governance style of SOEs characterized by strong political interference and opacity. Morocco
excepted, none of the selected countries have an explicit and well-articulated policy for State
ownership, which is often considered an element of a sound SOE governance environment.
Based on the four case studies, the four main messages of the report are the following:
   1. Most SOEs of the selected countries are in great need of reform in light of their economic
       and social weight and the governance issues they are encountering.
   2. However, most MENA countries are suffering from a low governance environment that
       prevents ambitious reforms, and can explain the relatively weak outcomes of past
       reforms.
   3. Golden standards usually fail in MENA and may even be counter-productive in the
       MENA political environment by creating “false reforms?.
   4. There is room for a more modest and progressive approach for SOE reform in MENA,
       adapted to the specific environment of each country.

There is a real disconnect between window dressing attitudes and actual behavior8 toward SOE
reforms in the MENA region. As a result, reality is hidden, and reforms do not materialize and

8
  Anthropologists and organizational sociologists began to document ?institutional mimicry? in the 1970s and
1980s, demonstrating that beyond reforms on paper there is strong tendency for organizations to continue with the
prevalent practices (see Bugnicourt 1973).
remain largely on paper. Institutional mimicry prevails, which explains why, despite reforms on
paper and governance arrangements closer to those of the private sector, an administrative
approach to SOE management continues and administrative practices remain largely intact.
Indeed, the disconnect between the stated ambitions and the reality of the day-to-day functioning
of SOEs remains strong.

Organizational sociologists have pointed out that “organizations often arrange their core
activities according to accepted models, or templates, in their field? (D’Aunno, Succi, and
Alexander 2000) or “tend to model themselves after similar organizations in their field that they
perceive to be more legitimate or successful? (DiMaggio et al. 1983).

It is not surprising, then, that politicians and bureaucrats strive to copy the OECD model of SOEs
because OECD countries are the ones rightly perceived as the most successful ones. Their
organizational characteristics are mimicked in the region by undertaking corporatization, placing
independent members on boards, strengthening units in charge of monitoring SOEs,
strengthening financial audits, introducing more transparency, developing special vehicles with
PPP frameworks, and so on. This development has also been promoted by the fact that most
donors and international financial institutions (IFIs) have supported the same type of model of
SOE reform.

However, as noted by Bugnicourt (1973), “mimicry exempts from thinking about possible
alternatives? and the likelihood that such reforms will materialize on the ground is extremely low
(as we will present in this report) for two main reasons: first, an “organization is highly sensitive
to the cultural environment within which it lives? (Seiznick 1996) and, second, “weak
competition makes [organizational] change unnecessary? (D’Aunno, Succi, and Alexander
2000).

Mimicking private sector practices in the public sector in the MENA region is unlikely to
succeed because political interference remains widespread. 9 For example, in most MENA
countries, on paper boards of directors are supposed to be the major decision-making bodies of
SOEs, but in reality that power remains in the hands of politicians. Therefore, as long as
politicians continue to interfere in SOE management to generate employment, subsidize parts of
the population directly (or indirectly) to win votes and popular support, or interfere in public
procurement, reforms will not have a strong impact on the ground.

Moreover, in the MENA region most SOEs operate in a noncompetitive environment and derive
part of their revenues from a monopoly situation. Therefore, there is no pressure to innovate,
compete, and increase performance.10

That does not mean that the institutions and governance of SOEs should remain as they are but
that the governance of SOEs in the MENA region (as in any region of the world) is a deeply
political process. Formal SOE reforms across the board in the region (especially in countries

9
     This was an underlying message of Benhassine (2009) on the main constraints of private sector growth in MENA.
10
  This was also demonstrated empirically for samples of SOEs in China by Su and He (2012) and Kang
and Kim (2012). There, SOEs perform more poorly than private companies, all other things being equal.
such as Egypt, Iraq, and Tunisia) are unlikely to achieve tangible results, especially if reforms
simply consists of transplanting a “universal? governance model of SOEs.

The report is structured as the following: the second chapter is an overview of the SOEs reforms
in the MENA region, then a detailed assessment of the four case studies is presented; the fourth
chapter presents the common challenges facing SOEs and their impact and the final chapter
presents the main policy recommendations.
Chapter 1            Introduction

This chapter begins by defining a state-owned enterprise (SOE) from a legal perspective, then
presents briefly what has been and is the rationale for SOEs in the region. It concludes by
describing the trends in SOE reform over the last 50 years.

Defining SOEs, a Legal Perspective
The SOE landscape has become increasingly diverse. There used to be some relatively
well-defined criteria, but with the growing complexity of state participation in the economy,
there is no longer a uniform definition, and especially because the definition of a SOE has
always been country-specific. Nor is there a uniform legal regime.

Box 1.1 Legal Form, Legal Regime: Key Distinctions between a Statutory SOE and an
Incorporated SOE


Statutory SOEs. 12 Statutory entities are established by a law or a decree, and they are not
incorporated as commercial companies. As a result, statutory entities tend to be legally hybrid
entities because their governance framework often borrows features from both the public sector
and the private sector. Having a distinct legal personality from the state, they are autonomous
from the state and benefit from rules of operation that are somewhat more flexible than purely
governmental institutions, although they remain in essence an emanation of the government with
a high level of political interference in management. Statutory SOEs typically include research
institutions and regulatory or public domain management agencies, although denominations are
rarely a reliable indicator of the nature or regime of a SOE.

Corporatized SOEs. These SOEs are registered under the legal framework applicable to
commercial companies and therefore operate according to rules comparable to those governing
the private sector.13 The enterprise will thus generally have capital and shareholders, a board, a
management with clear delineation of responsibilities, and control mechanisms. In theory, their
main objective becomes making a profit. In practice, however, SOE regimes may differ
significantly based on (1) the law by which they abide (often there are several exceptions to
corporate law), (2) the extent of the ownership, and (3) the modality of the ownership.


The Rationale for SOEs
The traditional rationale for state ownership relies on various notions of market failure such as
natural monopolies, public goods, externalities, and information asymmetries, combined with
imperfect contracting.14 A major problem is that market failures may sometimes be perceived
but not real because they may be difficult to measure.

In the case of a natural monopoly, 15 economies of scale prevent the achievement of cost
minimization unless output is produced by a single monopolistic supplier. This is most common
in sectors that require a network infrastructure, such as utilities and transportation, or that require
high initial capital investments, such as natural resource extraction. After the Great Depression,
12
   Often referred to as public establishments or établissements publics in civil law countries.
13
   This is what is generally referred to as “corporatization?that is, transformation into a private business–type of
corporation. This term, however, is not used consistently. In some cases, it simply refers to the use of a corporate
structure rather than a clear application of private sector rules.
14
   For a summary of these arguments, see Christiansen (2013) and OECD (2005). For a more detailed account of the
historic thinking on state ownership, see Shleifer (1998).
15
   A type of monopoly that exists as a result of the high fixed or start-up costs of operating in a particular
industry. It is usually considered for utilities such as power and water because the cost of creating a
network to produce electricity or water for all households is very large and can deter investment if there is
competition.
economists thus advocated the nationalization of railroads and utilities (Simons 1948) and of
land, mineral extraction, and telecommunications (Lewis 1949). The thinking was that a
monopolistic state-owned enterprise could ensure wider provision of services at lower prices
than a private monopoly or a competitive sector. The government’s public service
obligationfor example, to connect remote areas of the country to the road network or to deliver
mail to all householdswas an additional reason for state ownership of these businesses.

Failures in the market provision of public goods also provide a rationale for state intervention.
Public goods such as defense and national security services are not excludable, meaning that
their consumption cannot be limited to paying individuals. A private company, which can collect
returns only from paying customers but not from free riders, would thus underprovide these
goods and services.

Another market failure that motivates state provision is externalities. In a pure market economy,
goods causing negative externalities (e.g., pollution) are overprovided and goods with positive
externalities (e.g., health and education) are underprovided. Vaccinations, for example, reduce
the risk of infection not only for the vaccinated population but also for those not vaccinated. The
social returns thus exceed the private returns to vaccination, and state intervention is desirable to
achieve the socially efficient level of consumption. Based on a view of the negative externalities,
Meade (1948) advocated the nationalization not only of iron and steel production but also of the
chemical industries.

Finally, information asymmetries in the form of moral hazard and adverse selection problems
may warrant state ownership of businesses such as insurance (Lewis 1949) because only the state
has the power to mandate the purchase of insurance and thus guarantee a certain degree of risk
heterogeneity in the insured population (Lewis 1949; Akerlof 1970; Stiglitz and Weiss 1981).

Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990), and Hart (1995) developed a theory of
incomplete contracts in which contractual incompleteness gives the owner of an asset greater
control and bargaining power and thus stronger incentives to improve quality or reduce
production costs. Sappington and Stiglitz (1987) showed that market failures can be addressed
through state ownership if the government is benevolent. In this case, government ownership
avoids the information, contracting, bargaining, and renegotiation costs incurred when providing
a contracting service to the private sector.16

In addition to mitigating market failures, governments may value state ownership for strategic
reasons. First, governments use state ownership as an industrial policy tool to support nascent
industries that may have economies of scale in the long run (the “infant industry? argument),
preserve declining sectors (e.g., shipbuilding), prevent takeover by foreign companies (e.g.,
mineral resources), and accelerate technology transfer. Industrial development in Japan and the
Republic of Korea and the post–World War II reconstruction of Europe were largely based on

16
   Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) consider the choice between private and public ownership through
the lens of the Grossman-Hart-Moore theory, with an application to prison management. They conclude
that government ownership is desirable when there is a strong trade-off between cost reduction and
quality enhancement, innovation is unimportant, and competition and the reputational mechanism are
weak.
state ownership of strategic companies.

Second, governments also employ state ownership to achieve broader economic development
goals such as supporting economic growth through state-owned banks, guaranteeing
employment, and developing remote areas (Burgess and Pande 2003).

Third, state ownership is a political economy instrument. It allows the government to control the
prices of certain goods and thus helps to distribute subsidies in a context of underdeveloped
welfare systems. State enterprises are also used to reward political allies through employment
creation, above-market wages, and transfers (Shleifer and Vishny 1994; Shleifer 1998). For
example, it was arguably for political reasons that the British government continued to run
loss-incurring coal mines for three decades after World War II.

The Principles of Good Governance of SOEs
According to Nabli (2001), if implemented according to plans, SOE reforms could have major
positive impacts not only by reducing fiscal risks by decreasing hidden subsidies, direct
transfers, and overstaffing, but also by strengthening competition and developing capital
markets.

As noted by Megginson and Netter (2001) and Gómez-Ibáñez (2007), SOE reforms in
developing countries began in the 1960s because of the poor performance of many of the SOEs.
The reform movement sought to strengthen the internal capacity of SOEs. The second wave of
reforms in the 1980s emphasized the lack of managerial accountability and autonomy and led
mainly to performance contracting and corporatization. The latter implied revising the
governance structures of boards of directors, who became the main decision-making institution.
These SOE reforms were encapsulated in several documents published in the early 2000s.

To enrich the discussion about possible avenues for performance-enhancing SOE reforms, the
rest of this chapter presents the main principles of good governance of SOEs with references to
the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (OECD 2005).
This theoretical framework, mainly based on those guidelines, will be useful in the next chapter,
which assesses the governance of SOEs in the four selected countries in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region.

In its guidelines, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
codified in the area of SOE management policy recommendations to improve the governance of
SOEs. This OECD document has been used by several countries undertaking SOE reforms in
recent years, and the OECD guidelines seem to have influenced the thinking and design of some
SOE reforms in the MENA region. This document is divided into six parts: (1) an effective legal
and regulatory framework for state-owned enterprises; (2) the state as an owner; (3) equitable
treatment of shareholders; (4) relations with stakeholders; (5) transparency and disclosure 17; and
(6) the responsibilities of the boards of state-owned enterprises.

In the selected countries in the MENA region (except Morocco), most of the SOEs do not have

private shareholders (or those with a small minority of shares). Therefore, the third part is
marginally relevant. Moreover, because this study focuses more on economic, financial, and
governance issues, the fourth part seems to be less interesting for this purpose.

Therefore, four main principles have been selected to present governance-related issues linked to
SOEs:
       1. Transforming the state’s role from management to ownership (part 2 of the OECD
           guidelines)

       2. Increasing SOE autonomy vis-à-vis the state in the areas of staffing, public controls,
          and procurement (part 1)

       3. Increasing corporatization and strengthening the role of boards of directors (part 6)

       4. Increasing transparency with financial reporting/disclosure (part 5).



Principle 1. Transforming the State’s Role from Management to Ownership




State ownership creates two potential problems. First, the state as owner may not pursue pure
profit maximization; it may have many more objectives (social or even political). This may result
in setting specific objectives for the SOE that divert the day-to-day management of the company
away from the profit-maximizing path such as through targeted hiring, subsidization of some
public institutions or individuals at noncommercial rates, and pressure on investment levels and
locations. The second problem is that the state is not only the owner but also the manager, and
the combination of these two roles creates a conflict of interest and thus inefficiency.

                        




Principle 2. Increasing SOE Autonomy vis-à-vis the State




In this regard, financial autonomy is especially important because only when financial autonomy
is granted and companies are allowed to keep a share of their profits can they actually base
decisions on profit maximization, make more rational economic and financial decisions, and take
an interest in their performance. When SOEs operate only for the government and remit all their
returns to the government, their incentives to increase profits for the government are usually
minimal.


18
  For more information on the debate, see Vagliasindi (2008b). The centralized model (in an agency or
not) has often resulted from the implementation of privatization programs.
19
   This can be somewhat difficult to define, but a commonly accepted definition is that such activities produce or
deliver specific goods or services that identified individual clients are willing to purchase - and SOEs derive the bulk
of their income from such activities.

21
   “Corporatization is the act of reorganizing a SOE into a legal entity with corporate structures similar to other
companies, including a board of directors, management, and shareholders. The main goal of corporatization is to
allow the government to retain ownership but still enable it to run SOEs efficiently and on a more commercial basis
like other companies? (Kikeri et al. 2014).
22
  Vagliasindi (2008b) has shown that firms with higher proportions of outside directors and smaller
boards tend to make better (or at least different) decisions about replacing chief executive officers
(CEOs), all other things being equal.

Principle 4. Increasing Transparency with Financial Reporting/Disclosure
                                                                     




Transparency is crucial to limiting the misappropriation or waste of public resources in SOEs
and to limiting poor decisions such as in public investments. Better financial reporting and
disclosure reduce the information asymmetry between the SOE manager and politicians or civil
servants in charge of monitoring SOEs (Gómez-Ibáñez 2007). Finally, and not least,
transparency and good financial reporting and disclosure enable better scrutiny by civil society
of the allocation of spending in SOEs in order to limit waste of public resources, thereby
improving firm performance.
Chapter 2              Overview of SOEs in the MENA Region
The independence of the Arab Republic of Egypt (1954), Morocco (1955), and Tunisia (1956),
as well as the Ba’athist revolution in Iraq (1968), led to the creation of nation -states whose
development strategies were built on socialist values, inward-looking economics, and
nationalism. The creation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) thus reflected these values and
served purposes beyond simple economics. SOEs were (and continue to be) utilized as a social
safety net and to garner the loyalty of citizens. Social objectives such as job creation, subsidies,
and income redistribution rivaled economic ones. Nationalization of strategic sectors and natural
resources made way for monopolies that allowed the government to use SOEs to wield power
and control, putting politics above productivity, profit and loss, and management procedures.
Some of the benefits were that public investments were made in infrastructure, health, and
education, which boosted industrialization and translated into high growth. The economic growth
of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region at this time was among the highest in the
world, averaging 7.1 percent per year in the 1960s and 5.8 percent on average in the 1970s
(World Bank 2004).

During the late 1950s and 1960s, governments moved from regulating private sectors to direct
control of production through the nationalization of private assets. In response, public sectors
became the dominant employers in many MENA states. Wide-scale public provision of social
services rapidly expanded state bureaucracies, absorbing many new entrants into the public
sector. In a number of states, public commitments to the development of human capital took the
form of populist education policies that provided free, universal access to higher education and
guaranteed public sector employment to secondary and university graduates.

A Brief History of SOE Reforms in the MENA Region
1970s–1980s
As early as the 1970s, some of the MENA countries such as Egypt and Tunisia began to
reevaluate social policies and take tentative steps toward economic liberalization. By the 1980s,
the triggers of an economic crisis were well under way. Worldwide, falling oil prices, high
interest rates, and general economic decline ensued. High government debt from inefficiencies,
poor performance, high costs, and little to no revenue generation from public enterprises further
deteriorated the economies of Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, and Tunisia. Governments struggled to meet
their public wage bills, which ranged from 6 percent to almost 20 percent of their gross domestic
product (GDP).

Inward development policies coupled with weak regulatory environments discouraged private
investment, reduced opportunities for trade and industrial development, and increased public
debt. Unemployment levels increased as the gap widened between policies and the capacity of
governments to sustain their social commitments. Governments thus faced growing
pressure—both domestic and international—for economic reform.

1990sPrivatization
The early 1990s was marked by sluggish economic growth, weak labor productivity, and high
unemployment. GDP growth averaged only about 1 percent over the decade. Rising debt levels
and fiscal deficits created budgetary pressures and made the maintenance of loss-making SOEs
unsustainable. In this context, several MENA countries, including Egypt and Tunisia, embarked
on structural adjustment programs (SAPs) under the guidance of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank. 24 Seeking to restore the macroeconomic balance through
liberalization and deregulation, these programs advocated SOE privatization to increase
government revenue and competition.

The results of the privatization process in the 1990s were mixed. In some countries, the proceeds
from privatization were significant. In Tunisia, for example, the total sale proceeds of SOEs from
1987 to 1993 amounted to US$134 million.25 Thirty-three public sector enterprises were entirely
or partially privatized. In Morocco, privatization proceeds also provided considerable revenue
for the state and were used to fund public investment projects under the Hassan II Fund for
Social and Economic Development.26

However, the privatization process also encountered significant popular resistance, leading to
large demonstrations and strikes, and faced bureaucratic and administrative challenges. In Egypt,
for example, the process of evaluating SOEs and tendering lacked transparency and consistency.
The combination of weak institutions and widespread corruption led to a preferential treatment
of those connected in business, who disproportionately benefited from privatization. In Iraq, only
limited privatization efforts were undertaken in 1987, after the cease-fire with Iran, and the size
of the state portfolio did not shrink further in the 1990s.

Where Does MENA Stand Now? Some Stylized Facts on SOEs in the
Selected MENA Countries27
It is always difficult to generalize about SOEs because there are country and sector specificities.
However, we sought to create some macro proxies based on employment and losses data. Figures
2.1 to 2.4 mainly portray two categories of countries (of the four selected) in reflecting SOE
characteristics. The first category consists of Egypt, Iraq, and Tunisia, and in the other is
Morocco. In the first category, SOEs are large companies (over 1,400 employees on average),
and they remain relatively large employers (employing from over 1.5 percent up to 3.2 percent of
countries’ populations aged 15–64). They are also major loss makers, with annual transfers equal
to up to 6 percent of GDP. Morocco has a multitude of SOEs, over 700, 28 with numerous small
subsidiaries, but overall the sector is indebted, mainly because public investment is largely
carried by the country’s SOEs. The sector does, however, generate a large cash flow (over $5
billion in 2011).
Figures 2.1 to 2.4 are based on government sources. Data are for 2011, or 2007 in the case of
Tunisia.

     The IMF recommended privatization and SAPs for Egypt and Tunisia for instance.

   The Hassan II Fund for Social and Economic Development is a public financial institution created in 2000. It
grants financial assistance for investment projects in some industrial sectors (e.g., to acquire professional buildings
or new equipment).
27
     For more details on some case studies, see OECD (2012).

     This high figure largely stems from a much wider definition of SOEs (discussed in chapter 1).

A Brief Look at the SOE Landscape in the Selected MENA Countries29

29
  More information is given on Morocco since it is the country were, by far, among the selected
countries, transparency on SOEs and SOEs reforms is the most widespread.
Egypt
In 1952 Egypt’s private sector accounted for 76 percent of economic investment. Following the
nationalization plans carried out by President Gamal Abdel Nasser, this percentage drastically
shifted within a few decades to government investment accounting for over 80 percent of
economic investment (Carana Corporation 2002). This figure included all banking, insurance,
foreign trade, medium and heavy industry air transport, and public utilities, as well as many retail
stores, newspapers, maritime transport, construction companies, and large infrastructure assets.
Most laws governing the SOE sector in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s focused on the
organization and reorganization of the sector, yielding little impact on overall company
performance, management, or efficiency. Because of the worsening macroeconomic condition of
the Egyptian economy, external debt burden, and inflation, privatization was legalized through
Law 230/1989 and was part of the recommendations of the Economic Reform and Structural
Adjustment Program (ERSAP) in 1991 between the government of Egypt and the International
Monetary Fund. Actual privatization of SOEs began slowly. Between 1990 and 1993, only 11
SOEs were liquidated, but over the next 15 years over 400 companies were privatized.

In Egypt, there are now 52 economic authorities, 102 service authorities, and 146 state-owned
enterprises that are affiliated with nine holding companies. 30 Service authorities depend on
recapitalization or operate on a subsidized business model. SOEs either are under specific
ministries or are companies 100 percent controlled by the state and operating under the authority
of line ministries. These are mainly companies considered “strategic? in sectors such as
electricity, ing, aviation, banks, housing, and petroleum. They also may be under the Ministry of
Investment, a category that includes most agricultural, textile, chemical industry, mining
industry, transport, construction, tourism, pharmaceutical, and food processing holdings.




Iraq
Since the 1968 Ba’athist revolution, Iraq’s economy has been heavily centralized and dominated
by SOEs. Substantial income from the oil boom of the 1970s, the prohibition of non-Arab
foreign direct investments, and very few “assistance? efforts contributed to a large state role in
controlling and directing production and distributive activities, diminishing the private sector and
increasing the importance of SOEs in the economy.

A short-lived wave of privatization took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the
auspices of restructuring and streamlining enterprises as well as trying to control bloated SOE
employment. About 40 SOEs were privatized in the cement, construction materials, food

30
  The number of holding companies fell from 27 in 1991 to 9 in 2012, and the number of affiliated companies fell
from 314 to 146 during the same period.

canning, and distribution sectors, among others. However, in 1992 the state reversed its decision,
bringing most of them back under state control. Iraq became essentially a closed economy and
suffered further breakdown and isolation during the years of the United Nations embargo
(1991–2003) in which SOEs were denied raw and intermediate materials, leading to significant
production decreases as well as the spread of a large informal economy.

After the fall of the Saddam regime in 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) 32
pursued a privatization effort and began to shut down some SOEs. This effort caused significant
problems, including job losses for well over half a million Iraqis in less than six weeks.33 The
U.S. Department of Defense later acknowledged the importance of SOEs to Iraq’s economy and
created the Task Force on Business Stabilization Operations, whose objective was to restart
many of the SOEs that the CPA had closed. According to the latest estimates, Iraq’s SOEs
number about 170 (down from 192 in 2003–2004 and 176 in 2010–2011). They are distributed
among various ministries. The Ministry of Industry and Minerals holds the largest share (71),
followed by the Ministry of Oil (16), Finance (13), and Construction and Housing (11). SOEs are
organized in various holdings, regional branches, and factories.

Tunisia
In Tunisia, state-owned enterprises have had a major impact on the economy. At independence,
the Tunisian government inherited the control of key sectors of the economy such as mining,
transportation, and banking. At the time, state-owned enterprises and institutions were regarded
as essential to developing projects whose interests went beyond those of the private sector such
as phosphate mining, oil exploration, cement production, and oil refining. In addition, these
enterprises were quickly assigned socioeconomic objectives, such as employment and income
redistribution, for the benefit of the community, and the sector thus grew. In the mid-1980s,
SOEs represented 30 percent of jobs in the formal sector, distributed among some 190 SOEs.
However, public policies dealing with the creation of state-owned enterprises have “lacked any
comprehensive vision [because] they have been created in an ad-hoc manner over time, mainly
in response to economic and social pressures? (Ben Letaïef 1998, 70). Transportation, industry,
and banking are the three main sectors with the highest number of state-owned enterprises.
Because of poor performance, high costs, and structural adjustment programs, a wave of
privatizations took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s.34

Morocco
After two decades of privatization, the Moroccan government continues to maintain substantial
equity shares in a large number of major Moroccan firms. Among the top 10 largest Moroccan

   The CPA was established as a transitional government formed after the ousting of the Saddam Hussein
regime in 2003. Citing UN Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), and the laws of war, the CPA vested
itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the CPA's
inception on April 21, 2003, until its dissolution on June 28, 2004.

companies in 2012, four were controlled entirely or partially by the Moroccan state. It is the
controlling shareholder (with 96 percent of total shares) in the Office Chérifien des Phosphates
(OCP), the largest exporter with almost 30 percent of the country’s total exports. The Moroccan
state is also a major shareholder in three listed companies 35 that are among the 10 largest
capitalizations in the national stock market. In December 2012, these companies accounted for
almost 30 percent of the total market capitalization of the Casablanca stock exchange, the second
largest stock market in Africa. Public investment is mainly carried out by the SOEs. Investments
undertaken by Moroccan SOEs quadrupled from 2001 to 2011, growing at a 14 percent annual
average rate. These investments, covering all sectors of economic and social activity, constituted
8.6 percent of GDP in 2011 versus 4.6 percent in 2001.

Over the last decade, Morocco has undertaken an extensive reform program aimed at
modernizing its legal and regulatory framework and adapting its institutions to new dynamics,
particularly those driven by privatization and liberalization. These trends have led to profound
changes in both the private and SOE sectors. The corporatization of public operators and the
development of state shareholdings in limited liability companies have drastically changed the
SOE sector and have had far-reaching institutional implications.

Morocco has developed some new forms of state participation in the economy. Several
companies have been established for the purpose of acquiring new participation in the economy
a minority or majority stake in SOEs or in private businesses whether or not they are publicly
listed. Several companies have also been established to promote investment in a sector (e.g.,
tourism, public housing), and they may play an active role in private financing mechanisms.
Indeed, the growth of both domestic and foreign investment has become a stated objective of the
Moroccan government. Sector strategies have identified specific investment needs, often based
on the identification of specific projects. Several agencies have since been put in place to
facilitate the implementation of sector strategies and their investment objectives.

The roles of these agencies vary, depending on the needs of each sector. Table 2.1 summarizes
these various roles. One role is project engineeringfor example,              Agence pour le
Développement Agricole (ADA) identifies agricultural projects in all regions and markets them
to investors, and Société Marocaine d’Ingénierie Touristique (SMIT) is in charge of engineering
turnkey tourism projects aligned with the objectives of the tourism development strategy, Plan
2020. Another role is sector coordination. Some agencies are in charge of coordinating major
transactions relating to a sector. For example, the ADA is responsible for coordinating and
managing the leasing of state-owned land. The investment promotion agency Agence Marocaine
de Développement des Investissements (AMDI) primarily focuses on promoting investment in
the industrial sector, whereas investment opportunities in other sectors tend to be promoted by
the specialized agencies in the area such as ADA and the Fonds Marocain de Développement du
Tourisme (FMDT)). However, AMDI cannot itself contribute to the structuring or financing of
projects. Yet another role is participating in sector-specific investment. Some agencies such as
Société d’Investissements Energétiques (SIE), SMIT, and FMDT are mandated to invest capital

Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), and 79 percent of Compagnie Générale Immobilière (CGI). IAM is the
largest capitalization in the national stock exchange market with almost 20 percent of the total
capitalization.
in large projects they develop. Finally, the sector-related agencies provide financing for major
capital investments supporting the implementation of sector strategies. For example, the Fonds
Hassan II pour le Développement Ecoomique et Social (FDSHII) and Caisse de Dépôts et de
Gestion (CDG) play the role of developers, sponsors, or shareholders in many large projects,
particularly in infrastructure and territorial development.

The development of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure or utilities, which often
involves complex legal structures (e.g., that distinguish between asset holding companies and
operating companies or that specify the use of special-purpose vehicles under project finance
schemes) is yet another example. The recent PPP trend may accelerate with the adoption of the
draft PPP law, which would provide a uniform framework for PPPs and therefore challenge the
traditional definition of SOEs and raise new governance questions.

Numerous Reforms Attempts in the Region
In Egypt, Law 203 (1991) corporatized many SOEs. Egypt has adopted some SOE laws of
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
and adjusted them to suit its legal context. Another wave of reforms occurred during the period
2004–11 when the Egyptian cabinet took measures to reduce SOE debt from LE 33 billion ($5.6
billion) to LE 9 billion ($1.5 billion) and sought to be more transparent on subsidies and
transfers. The same period also saw the establishment and empowerment of regulatory bodies in
all sectors. One of the most notable reforms during that period was lifting all restrictions on
foreign ownership of privatized SOEs. However, some strategic and national security–related
sectors did not allow more than 49 percent ownership by foreigners. Finally, the government
adopted a PPP strategy in 2006 with the establishment of a PPP Central Unit in charge of
planning and managing PPP projects.

In Iraq, action plans and strategies have called for reforms as well as in Iraq’s cooperation with
the international donor community. Examples are the International Compact with Iraq, 2007;
Task Force for Economic Reforms (TFER), 2010; National Development Strategy, 2010; and
Governance Action Plan (“supporting ongoing SOE reform and PPP?), 2013. However, the
reform strategies, which focused on corporatizing SOEs, were characterized by a lack of
coordination, recurrent neglect of gaps in local absorption and institutional capacity, and absence
of execution.

In Tunisia, state-owned enterprises are legally defined in Law 89-9 of February 1989. This
document was amended in 1996 and 2001, but it has not been substantially modified. The legal
framework for SOE accounting was established by Law 89-9, supplemented by the 1997 decree
on external audits and, for some SOEs, by corporate law.

Over the last decade, Morocco has undertaken an extensive reform program aimed at
modernizing its legal and regulatory framework and adapting its institutions to new dynamics,
particularly those driven by privatization and liberalization. Contrary to the efforts of other
countries, these reforms have led to profound changes in both the private and SOE sectors. The
corporatization of public operators and the development of state shareholdings in limited liability
companies have drastically changed the SOE sector. In particular, the Moroccan government has
taken measures that define a new legislative framework governing SOEs. Adopted in 2003, Law
69-00 on the financial control of SOEs is the cornerstone of corporate governance systems within
the SOE sector. Creation of the Department of Public Enterprises and Privatization (DEPP),
which was designed to play the role of the state as shareholder, was a leading measure in the
monitoring and governance process of SOEs. The contractualization of relations between the
state and SOEs is also a flagship program of the Moroccan government, established by Law
69-00.

In 2008 Morocco adopted a
                                                                  Both the code of 2012 and a
proposed revision to Law 69-00 call for a systemic conclusion of such programmatic contracts.
In 2013 a directive by the Prime Minister’s Office also called for the preparation of multiple
annual plans to later be converted into programmatic contracts. A guide has also been issued by
DEPP on the preparation of such contracts.




36
   Though not binding, those codes put forth useful recommendations along the lines of the OECD principles of
2005. The role of the state is three-pronged: (1) as a strategic leader in order to define orientations and policies likely
to create the conditions for economic and social progress and regional development (the main instrument to this end
is programmatic contracts); (2) as a controller as per the provisions of Law 69-00; and (3) as a shareholder with the
main objective of promoting an open economy, maximizing the contributions of SOEs to growth, improving the
valorization of state participation, and giving SOEs the incentive to commit to social goals and defend the country’s
interest. Such objectives should be transparent, including through an annual report on SOEs submitted to Parliament.
Other recommendations include a transparent nomination process for SOE boards with due consideration of
professional ability (technical, economic, and financial) and nomination of external, independent directors; the
promotion of fair competition; and the adoption of dividend policies to allow for both remuneration of the state and
development of the SOE. It is also suggested that an annual report on governance and compliance with the Code of
Good Governance be prepared.
Chapter 3   An Assessment of SOE Reforms in the
Selected MENA Countries
Before presenting in more detail the various weaknesses of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
SOE-state relations, this chapter describes the growing complexity of the SOE landscape
(especially in Morocco), which has important consequences for the transparency and
management of SOEs.

Growing Complexity of SOEs
The term SOE refers to neither a unified legal regime nor a uniform reality. In recent years, with
the development of state capitalism and the resurgence of SOEs in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) region, the SOE landscape has grown more complex.37 Legal forms (statutory
SOEs or corporations), legal regimes (subject to public procurement rules or not, to civil service
rules or not), the extent of public ownership, and the modality of ownership vary drastically.

This situation may be understandable in view of the variety of SOEs and country specifics, but it
can create confusion when trying to summarize suggestions for better governance and may lead
to the implementation of ill-suited constraints for some companies.

The following sections illustrate this phenomenon in the MENA region based on three criteria
commonly used: extent of ownership, modality of ownership, and competition.

Extent of Ownership
In some countries, state enterprises are defined as 100 percent state-owned enterprises
(enterprises with state participation of less than 100 percent can also be found in some countries
but are called something other than state enterprises). Partial ownership (and therefore partial
private participation) is also possible. It is also possible that shares of the public corporation will
be offered publicly on stock exchanges. Another form of mixed public-private participation is
when a company is established jointly by a public party and one or several private partners (joint
ventures), or when a public institution or a SOE acquires participation in a private corporation.

Modality of Ownership
Ownership can be either direct or indirect. Directly owned SOEs establish subsidiaries, or they
can participate in other enterprises. Indirect ownership is a method of participation that has
expanded over recent years.

Competition
Some SOEs operate in a competitive environment, vying with privately owned corporations
offering similar goods or services. Other SOEs might benefit from a monopoly situation
(guaranteed by law or de facto). The decision to have a SOE operate within a monopoly situation

37
   Musacchio and Lazzarini (2012) present the current trends on a growing multiplicity of various forms
of state capitalism.
touches on a wider economic governance debate that remains relevant, including as part of the
new forms of state capitalism.

This multitude of criteria makes it difficult to come up with a simple classification of SOEs, even
within a given country. For example, Morocco has a sophisticated SOE landscape in which more
than 700 companies have state participation. In parallel with the significant efforts to privatize a
number of classical SOEs, the number of institutions controlled by the state has reportedly
increased over the last decade, mainly in the form of subsidiaries (with at least 50 percent of
shares) established by public corporations or statutory SOEs such as Caisse de Dépôts et de
Gestion (CDG), a financial institution that manages significant amounts of regulated savings.
Overall, it may be more difficult to define a SOE in Morocco than in other countries because of
the multiplicity of legal texts governing state participation in the economy (see box 2.1 for the
legal definition of a SOE in Morocco).


Box 3.1 The Legal Definition of a SOE in Morocco




An Assessment of SOE Reforms in the Selected MENA Countries

                                                                             principles for
SOE reform developed in chapter 1 using the OECD guidelines: (1) transform the state’s role
from management to ownership; (2) increase SOE autonomy vis-à-vis the state; (3) pursue
38
     For such enterprises, the law says that control mechanisms will be provided for under the concession agreement.
corporatization and strengthen the role of boards; and (4) increase transparency with financial
reporting/disclosure.

Based on these four principles, 10 criteria have been selected, using worldwide experiences with
SOE reforms (such as Gómez-Ibáñez 2007 and Vagliasindi 2008b) and the OECD guidelines to
describe concretely the four main principles. This classification obviously generalizes
excessively the situation for some SOEs in some countries, which may be in a better situation
than most other SOEs. Therefore, some criteria may appear to be “partially? met.

This typology could prove useful in representing as concretely as possible SOE reforms and their
implementation in the selected countries:

      The role of the state as owner is usually carried out through a permanent structure
       monitoring SOEs (criterion 1), frequent reporting on SOEs (criterion 2), performance
       contracting between the state and SOEs (criterion 3), and monitoring of contracts
       (criterion 4).

      SOE autonomy is difficult to measure, especially the absence of strong political
       interference in SOE management. The difference with state ownership may also be
       problematic because when the state plays an ownership role, it usually gives more
       autonomy to SOEs. For that reason, we use some proxies of SOE autonomy and reduced
       political interference: the extent of interference in SOE employment (criterion 5) and the
       frequency of recapitalization (criterion 6).

      For corporatization and the power of boards, the presence of independent board
       members is usually considered as a proxy for SOE reform (criterion 7) as well as the fact
       that boards are not legally subject to a minister’s approvals (criterion 8).

      Finally, to assess transparency of SOE management it is crucial that financial statements
       be prepared, audited, and published regularly without delays (criterion 9) and reports on
       SOEs published annually (criteria 10).

The subsequent assessments were based on background papers that included legal and document
reviews and interviews with SOEs manager and key stakeholders.

Note : partially gives ½ point.
Based on the table 2.1, it appears that Egypt and Iraq are in a similarly difficult position in which
what is considered to be good practice for governance of SOEs has not been undertaken in the
areas of SOE monitoring, transparency, or boards, for example.

In its study of the Egyptian business climate in 2010, the OECD reached a number of
conclusions that signal why Egypt’s SOEs may face some problems. The enforcement of a legal
framework when assessed against OECD principles was at an implementation rate of 46 percent.
Some reforms were undertaken in the early 2000s, but they remain largely on paper and are not
being fully implemented.

However, progress is currently being made on financial disclosure in the broader public sector in
Egypt. Ministry of Finance Circular No. 3 of 2012 mandates the disclosure and publication on
the ministry’s website of key budgetary and financial information such as approved annual
disaggregated budgets, financial statements, and disaggregated final accounts for 46 of the 52
economic authorities and more than 160 public sector companies (both individual and holding),
including petroleum, electricity, gas, water, tourism, chemical, agriculture, mining, food
processing, and transport. If implemented, this mandate should tremendously increase
transparency in Egypt regarding SOE financial performance.

Tunisia is in a relatively better position, but it lacks some basic reforms in transparency, SOE
autonomy, and board composition and functioning.

Among the four selected countries, only Morocco has undertaken some major reforms and
implemented them. However, some progress remains to be made on political interference and the
autonomy bestowed on SOE management.

The issue of political interference is the core problem in SOE governance in the region. In
countries such as Egypt, Iraq, and Tunisia, politicians usually interfere in SOE management,
creating serious constraints in many areas (appointments, employment conditions, pricing of
goods or services, procurement, or investment decisions). This situation is costly for SOEs, and
therefore controls are usually multiplied and the accountability of managers is reduced, all of
which leads to frequent recapitalization and higher subsidies.
Chapter 4    The Common Challenges Facing SOEs across
the Region and Their Impact

This chapter describes the current reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the selected
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Despite the more advanced reforms in
Morocco, SOEs suffer from strong constraints and the weaknesses common in the selected
countries:
    States intrinsically continue to manage and monitor SOEs without permanent and
       well-staffed structure.

      Most SOEs suffer from limited autonomy from the state.

      The powers of boards of directors remain limited despite corporatization and ample board
       mandates on paper.

      Transparency and disclosure of information remain limited.

Transforming the State’s Role from Management to Ownership
With the exception of Morocco, the state continues to manage and not act as owner in the
selected MENA countries.

On the one hand, at best there is a central permanent structure to monitor SOEs (an example of
this structure is the Department of Public Enterprises and Privatization, DEPP, in Morocco see
box 4.1). In most cases, however, various structures are in charge of monitoring SOEs, and yet
reporting on SOEs is highly erratic, and performance contracts are mainly rhetorical exercises.
As explained in the report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on SOEs in the MENA region: “ambiguous objectives and fragmented oversight can
make SOEs easy prey for non-commercial and sometimes overtly political operatives? (OECD
2013, 24). For example, in Tunisia three structures (under the Prime Minister’s Office and the
Ministry of Finance) are in charge of (theoretically) monitoring SOEs. Overlapping mandates
and fragmentation of oversight weaken state ownership.

On the other hand, the state usually continues to manage SOEs, sometimes on a daily basis with
all the problems it creates.

Over the last decade, in efforts to improve the performance of SOEs using the model inherited
from the new public management approach to public service, performance contracts were
prepared and signed in some countries such as Tunisia or Morocco. The original idea was to let
SOE managers have more leeway when leading companies in exchange for generating revenues
and services for the state as a shareholder.

However, the expected impact seems to have been much higher than the actual impact. Indeed,
several ministers were not committed to these contracts, or they expected the state to refuse to
comply with the contracts and therefore did not sign them. Moreover, most contracts in Tunisia
did not have quantitative indicators with baselines, and no sanction mechanisms were defined.
Therefore, the contracts were more a declaration of intention without any binding effect, which
explains why many heads of SOEs assumed this process was simply a rhetorical one. Indeed,
most contracts were discussed very briefly at the board level, perhaps reflecting the fact that
political interference in the management of SOEs remains strong. As noted by Gómez-Ibáñez
(2007), achieving positive results from performance contracts is usually difficult because of the
information asymmetry between ministers and SOE managers and then complexity of
negotiating them that usually leads to easily achievable targets.

Box.4.1 The Example of DEPP in Morocco




Law 69-00 provides for the possibility of programmatic contracts ( contrats de programme) that would be concluded
between the state and SOEs. Those contracts, which are signed on behalf of the state by both the Ministry of Finance
and the sectoral line ministry, define over a period of several years mutual undertakings as well as technical,
economic, and financial targets, together with the means to attain them and the modalities to monitor
implementation. Contracts can also be concluded with subsidiaries, either directly by the state or by the SOE holding
the participation.


SOE Autonomy
In practice, SOEs usually suffer from political interference that takes various forms: appointing
politically affiliated managers, setting employment levels and forcing managers or boards to
recruit staff, placing pressure on managers to grant some public contracts to some companies and
utilities, and interfering in investment policies. In this context, boards are largely dysfunctional
and the important decisions bypass them. Despite wide mandates on paper, they are mainly
rubber stamps.

The following subsections present the key constraints on SOEs related to employment and
boards.

The Constraints on Employment and Human Resource Management
In many countries worldwide, SOEs are used as political tools of employment for social
purposes, resulting in both overemployment and politically motivated recruitments. As explained
by the OECD, “maintaining employment through SOEs is not an uncommon strategy across the
region, regardless whether this employment is productive or not? (OECD 2013, 60). The poor
organization of SOEs is also a factor that contributes to overemployment or inadequate
employment, especially the lack of a properly organized human resources department.

“Employing enterprise staff under the public service systems of owning states was soon
recognized as a primitive arrangement; mostly, the corporations were separated from those
systems and thus enabled to develop staffing arrangements appropriate to their particular
functions? (Wettenhall and Thynne 2002). In Tunisia, the number of non-administrative public
establishments (Etablissements publics non-administratifs, EPNAs) continues to grow because
they offer the management teams of these institutions more latitude, which can be explained in
part by the greater wage flexibility provided by this form of SOE. The growth in the number of
SOEs makes the task of monitoring them more difficult and is questionable from the perspective
of the criteria for defining a SOE. This may explain the fact that EPNAs are sometimes
arbitrarily created by a supervisory ministry.

Moreover, the “reform of large SOEs, especially those located in remote locations, can be
contentious since it may result in layoffs which may be socially and hence politically
unacceptable, particularly when alternative employment opportunities are difficult to find?
(OECD 2013, 60). In remote and impoverished regions, SOEs are usually used for employment
generation. According to the Tunisian press, Groupe Chimique Tunisien (GCT) recorded losses
of some TD 2 billion over the last two years, which can be explained in particular by the fact that
the headcount of its main subsidiary, Compagnie des Phosphates de Gaza, tripled between 2010
and 2012, rising from 5,000 to 16,000 by 2012, while production fell from 8 million tons in 2010
to 2.5 million tons in 2012. GCT is by far the main employer in a remote region of Tunisia where
unemployment is very high as well as social pressure. This situation stands in sharp contrast to
the sound health of the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) in Morocco over the same
period.39

Too Many or Too Few Controls?
SOEs suffer either from a proliferation of multilayered controls without a clear delineation of
mandates or from minimal controls, depending on the political economy or the size or strategic
interest of the SOE.

In Egypt, SOEs that are 25% or more owned by the public sector are required by Law 203 to be
externally audited by government agencies. Law 203 companies are not required to hire private
external auditors (and over 90% of the companies surveyed in the Corporate Governance Report
(2008) did not use private audit services).

Companies are required by Law 203 to submit quarterly performance reports and an annual
report to the holding company. In addition most holding companies have developed a range of
other internal (but informal) monitoring mechanisms but implementation of such measures
depend on the holdings.


39
     http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/11294/print.
In Iraq, the external audit system is essentially formed by three governmental entities: Board of
Supreme Audits (BSA)(Law 31/2011), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) (CPA Order 57),
and The Commission of Integrity (CoI) (Law 30/2011). It is characterized by (i) actual lack of
independence and transparency, (ii) overlapping and confusion of roles and tasks of the BSA and
the OIG, deriving also from misinterpretation of the original CPAs and subsequent Laws, (iii)
lack of capacity and human resources to undertake tasks such as management and operational
performance assessments), (iv) disputes between Ministers and IGs, (v) consequent downgrading
of the role of the OIG limited de facto to external monitoring.

Moreover, internal controls of SOEs are executed by an “ad hoc? committee of employees
depending directly on the Director Generals of the Ministries in charge of the SOEs. Internal
controls seem rather limited in scope, focusing more on administrative and financial procedures
than on actual performance of SOEs.

In Tunisia, “to meet this requirement [of controls], the public authorities’ response has often
been to create additional structures responsible for that function. By increasing the number of
bodies involved, these attempts at reorganization have instead generated increased complexity,
overlapping, and duplication of work? (Ben Letaïef 1998, 441).

There is a paradox in control systems for state-owned enterprises. In theory, SOEs should be
weighed down by controls from the supervisory authority, the regulatory body, the state auditor,
and the statutory auditors. In practice, however, although some enterprises are inspected, others
seem more able to act at their leaders’ discretion.40 The proliferation of controls usually results
in lack of transparency, incoherent decisions, and sometimes deadlocks.

Control takes multiple forms and is more an issue of regulatory compliance (of procedures and
processes) than real and fundamental dysfunctions (in the outcomes or efficiency of processes or
procedures). There is excessive polarization among the regulatory bodies, emphasizing form
over substance and procedures over results. This attitude toward controls may explain why SOE
results and effectiveness are overlooked in favor of their procedures. Moreover, no matter the
size or sector, all SOEs are subject to the same controls and regulations.

Unlike in Morocco, the concept of risk is almost completely absent in Tunisia. There, audits
often cover up to four or five years. Under these conditions, it is difficult to verify both the
accuracy of the accounts and SOEs’ economic and financial management, or their financial
practices, efficiency, effectiveness, or good governance. Because of the scale of Tunisia’s
extended public sector,41 the number of staff devoted to SOE monitoring appears to be very
limited, with fewer than 120 people working in the horizontal regulatory bodies and 80– 90

40
   In Tunisia, in control bodies such as the corps de contrôle, which are subject to the hierarchical
authority of their respective ministers (prime minister or minister of finance), inspectors receive
off-program assignments that are often dictated by ad hoc considerations.

   The sectors subject to controls include the state’s administrations, local governments, and any
enterprises in which the state is a majority or minority stockholder or that receive public funding. The list
of SOEs, even if limited to those in which the state has majority holdings, includes over 150 entities.
magistrates in the Court of Accounts, whereas the list of SOEs, even if limited to those in which
the state has majority holdings, includes over 150 entities. As a result, only the largest companies
are subject to in-depth audits with any degree of frequency. Between 1981 and 2008, all 160
SOEs were audited by the Court of Accounts at least once. The problem this poses is all the more
acute because the SOEs’ internal audit departments and state controls are often deemed
insufficient, if not nonexistent. In addition, inspectors may be faced with asymmetrical
information and may not have the skills or the information they need to perform their work
effectively.

Moreover, some politically sensitive companies benefit from limited controls but with
subsequent fiscal risks. In Iraq, the control system of SOEs is characterized by uneven
enforcement of current legislation, overlapping competencies of implementing agencies, and lack
of institutional capacity in procurement and audit.

In Morocco, according to Article 23 of Law 69-00, the Caisse de Dépôts et de Gestion (CDG) is
exempt from the SOE monitoring mechanisms established by this law. The CDG is overseen by
a supervisory committee composed of the governor of Bank Al-Maghrib, a representative of the
head of the government, a representative of the Ministry of Finance, and two representatives of
the Supreme Court. This committee, however, has only an advisory function and lacks de jure or
de facto authority to review management decisions made by the head of the CDG.

With the exception of the CDG, Morocco has a fundamentally different approach to control of
SOEs and can also be viewed as a relatively good example of giving greater autonomy to SOEs.
In Morocco, the philosophy of control has been fundamentally altered by adjusting the level of
control to the level of risk (see box 4.2 for more details). Thus the main criterion for defining the
different types of control is the quality of the SOE’s information and management systemin
other words, its ability to anticipate and manage various operational and financial risks.

The control type is not linked to the SOE’s type of activity (commercial or otherwise) or its legal
status. Law 69–00 distinguishes between two main categories of control: ex ante controls and ex
post controls. Ex ante controls apply to SOEs whose information, management, and monitoring
systems do not offer the levels of security needed to anticipate risks. The aim is to regularly
monitor the management of these organizations and to ensure that their economic and financial
operations comply with the laws, regulations, and charters that apply to them. Control is
exercised through three main agencies: the Ministry of Finance, the state comptroller, and the
paymaster responsible for the compliance of expenditures, who may be authorized by order of
the minister of finance to audit revenues.

Instead of ex ante controls, supporting controls apply to state-owned enterprises and institutions
(établissements et entreprises publics, EEPs) that can show they have effectively implemented
an information, management, and internal monitoring system, duly approved by the minister of
finance and comprising a number of management tools. This type of control aims to reduce the
level of control, including the elimination of prior approvals, and bring enterprises up to standard
by putting a management system in place that can guarantee sound risk management.


Box 4.2 Financial Controls in Morocco
Morocco has an unusual approach to financial controls in the MENA region because Law 69-00 provides for two
regimesone for ex ante control and the other one for ex post control. The selection of the former or latter depends
on the financial risks the state faces and the quality and reliability of information systems. In the other countries,
SOEs are, in theory, subject to the same ex ante and ex post controls.

State-owned enterprises with direct control by the state are, in principle, subject to the ex post control regime. The
main features of Law 69-00 include the following:42
        Approval by the minister of finance of budgets, draft financial estimates, and decisions pertaining to the
         allocation of profits
        The presence of a state controller who sits on the board with a consultative role. Specific control
         attributions can be assigned to the controller by the minister of finance over a number of operations.
        The preparation of a series of instruments, including a transparent regime for employees (e.g., on
         recruitment conditions, pay policies); a company chart setting organizational structures and their
         attributions, including management and audit; a manual describing operating modes for those structures
         and internal control mechanisms; a policy governing procurement and control ; accounting principles
         allowing for the establishment of transparent financial statements to be audited by certified external
         auditors; a three-year activity program with economic and financial projections; and a yearly management
         report
        The establishment of an audit committee to include the state controller and two to four members nominated
         by the board or the deliberating body. Its mission is to control the proper operation and performance of the
         enterprise and to supervise internal and external audit missions.
        The mandatory transmittal to the minister of finance of a number of documents, including yearly financial
         statements and a management report, a report on participations, an audit report from the external auditors,
         and consolidated financial statements.


The Problem of Subsidiaries to Circumvent Controls
In a country like Morocco, the most spectacular development related to corporatization has been
the proliferation of subsidiaries. More than 350 SOEs were created over the last decade (Semmar
2012), and most of them are limited liabilities and are entirely or partially controlled by public
operators (see table 4.1).

According to the SOE directors interviewed in Morocco, the underlying reason for this trend is to
seek greater flexibility in the management of certain specific activities, to build partnerships with
private companies, and to attract new private investors.
Achieving such goals would obviously produce more flexibility because some SOEs use private
sector rules of management43.

However, it could also create some potential problems because of the absence of oversight that
can lead to circumventing regulations on public employment and wrongdoing, as well as possible
losses of state capital. For example, the 182 subsidiaries of Caisse des Dépôts et de Gestion,
which account for 38 percent of total subsidiaries in the SOE portfolio, are not subject to review
by the Ministry of Finance and DEPP. This absence of oversight is even more problematic
because most of newly created firms are involved in sectors highly exposed to risk such as
tourism and real estate, and in more than half of all cases the CDG is the only capital provider.

Corporatization and Independence of Boards




                                                           In Egypt, SOEs were corporatized, but
the government remained in the driver’s seat in the chain of command. The central role was
awarded to the prime minister, who appoints the board of directors of the holding companies and
their general assemblies, and the minister of investment, who heads the General Assembly. This
clear lack of independence increased the criticism directed at the privatization program and,
above all, created an overall social and public cynicism about the reform program.

43
   A large SOE may be expected to have subsidiaries for a number of legitimate reasons (operational, legal, tax for
instance).
44
   It is worth noting again that one of the key issues with corporatization is employment status. One of the first
questions usually raised is whether labor contracts should be transferred to the new corporation and their legal
status, including whether employees should, as the case may be, retain a civil servant status. This explains why
corporatization usually raises concernsor oppositionamong the workforce and trade unions. What is in general
implemented is a mix of civil servants and contract staff with widely differing benefits, which creates tensions and
demotivation among some staff.
The preponderance of politicians on SOE boards underscores the primacy of the political agenda
over the economic performance of the company, which may work in favor of political short-term
objectives. “Despite SOEs’ de jure autonomy, boards staffed with administrative and political
elites that are not nominated through a structured process by the state can arbitrarily intervene in
management decisions due to high centralization of bureaucratic power? (OECD 2013, 24).

In Egypt, the appointment of executives in holding companies falls within the norms of the
findings of the Hawkamah–International Finance Corporation (IFC) survey of 2008, which
concluded “that being a high-profile public officer remains a primary criterion for nominating a
director to the board of a SOE and that competency and skills are secondary requirements.?
Therefore, in a number of SOEs the directors do not seem to have a strong command of the
strategic issues in the sector in which the company operates, mainly because of the absence of a
clear and transparent nomination process. In practice, nomination processes for board posts in
the MENA region are often based on criteria other than competence, and board membership is
sometimes used as a compensation award for retirees. In Egypt, a director's length of service as a
board member and tenure on various board committees is not properly defined for most
companies, and the attendance records of board members at board and committee meetings are
not standardized as is the practice in most companies. Meanwhile, the qualifications of board
members are not disclosed, the links between remuneration and company performance and
commercial and noncommercial objectives are not well-defined, and the remuneration policies
for executive and non-executive directors are not developed.

In theory, boards of directors have substantial powers in Tunisia. However, in practice these
powers are considerably reduced for SOEs because of two factors: (1) the board of directors does
not in fact designate the enterprise’s chief executive officer (CEO), and (2) the board’s decisions
are only confirmed after “approval by the supervisory authority? (Law 96 -74 of July 29, 1996,
Article 10, new). 45 As for EPNAs, the state appoints the CEO directly by decree (Law 89-9
amended, Article 33.8). The board of directors acts on a consultative basis only. Finally, the
supervisory authority approves the SOE’s budget forecasts, balance statements, operating
accounts, and income statements.

In Morocco, a prime example is the composition of the OCP board. Of the 10 directors, there are
three ministers, five secretaries general of different ministries, the head of the Treasury, and the
CEO of Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP). 46 Moreover, despite the relaxation of the rule of

45
   In practice, this approval is often considered tacit because the supervisory ministries do not formally approve
these decisions.
46
   Other than the Treasury, BCP is the only shareholder in OCP; it holds 5.88 percent of total shares.
appointment of heads of SOEs foreseen in the constitution of 2011, it remains a significant
obstacle to boards of directors performing their function of monitoring and, specifically,
exercising the right to remove the company manager.47

The lack of independent directors is another major limitation on the role of a board of directors.
The creation in 2009 of the Moroccan Institute of Board Members (IMA) has not yet remedied
the virtual absence of professional directors.48

A limited number of ministers and senior government officials sit on several boards
simultaneously. For example, the director and the secretary general of the Caisse de Dépôts et de
Gestion sit, as a director or a member, on more than 30 boards of the different subsidiaries of the
group.

Transparency, Reporting, and Accountability

              In the selected countries, transparency is usually dysfunctional at the SOE level and
at the “sector? level (“aggregate reporting?), the only exception being Morocco.

In Morocco, DEPP produces a comprehensive report annually 49 , whereas Egypt, Iraq, and
Tunisia are characterized by opacity. In Egypt and Iraq, the number of SOEs is not easily
available, and one needs to compute manually, for example, the aggregate losses or transfers to
SOEs. It is even more difficult to have accurate data on employment levels and benefits: “The
Egyptian Ministry of Investment does not possess any information about companies overseen by
the defense, transport or other ministries or the military which is estimated to control a large
number of companies in a variety of sectors? (OECD 2013, 18). However, that situation should
change in the near future.

In Tunisia, the situation is not necessarily better because the available information is often
fragmented and sometimes uncertain, with the last full report on state-owned enterprises dating
back to 2007. The “Report on the Results of State-Owned Enterprises and Public Institutions?
(“Rapport sur les Résultats des Entreprises et Etablissements Publics?) was published by the
Prime Minister’s Office (2007) and prepared by the unit assigned to monitor the productivity of
state-owned enterprises and institutions. The report merged the results of 181 state-owned
enterprises and institutions (out of 189) for 2006.50


47
   Law 02.12 governing the appointment of senior government officials has expanded the prerogatives of the
Government Council, bringing the total number of nominations by the council to 1,181 senior positions compared
with 17 in the past. It has also empowered the council, chaired by the head of government, to suggest candidates for
the management of the 39 “strategic SOEs? established by this law. Nevertheless, the final hiring decisions on the
appointment of managers remain at the discretion of the king, by decree ( dahir).
48
   The IMA, Institut Marocain des Administrateurs, was created in 2009 to train directors and to professionalize the
practice of corporate directorship.
49
   This report is presented to the National Assembly, is available online and presents detailed analysis and
is approximately 100-page long and more.
50
   A shorter version of this report (20–30 pages long) was published in September 2014 with the main
aggregated figures.
The quantity and quality of the financial information published by state-owned enterprises in
Tunisia is very disparate and largely short of the minimum required for adequate transparency
and accountability to the Tunisian community. Most SOEs in Tunisia do not publish their
financial statements on their websites. Although they are required to publish them in the Official
Gazette (Journal Officiel), this method is both costly and impractical for users compared with
electronic publication. For three out of five SOEs studied in details in Banque Mondiale (2014),
the external auditors’ or legal auditors’ reports on SOEs’ financial statements contain
reservationsthat is, they do not certify that the annual accounts portray an accurate image of
the SOEs’ financial positions and results.
Without transparency of any kind on employment levels, the extent of transfers or subsidies, and
even the number of SOEs, the accountability of SOE managers and politicians is minimal, which
opens the door for misuse of public funds and corruption (as illustrated shortly) without talking
about poor performance.
Indeed, a vicious cycle of inefficiency and embezzlement seems to have taken hold in several
MENA countries (see figure 4.1). A system of governance that is poorly constructed from the
start results in poor public resource management, which leads the authorities to strengthen
controls, but at the same time those controls further divest the managers of these enterprises of
responsibilities.

For example, in recent years in Egypt, Iraq, and Tunisia thousands of jobs have been created in
SOEs mainly based on political decisions rather than on needs assessments. As a result, many
SOEs in those countries are virtually bankrupt. For example, in Tunisia, a SOE doubled its wage
bill because of the recruitment of hundreds of employees in 2012, and so it cannot cover its
expenses (after having been profitable). In this context and because of the importance of
recapitalization and the increased drain of public resources, financial controls are numerous. In
fact, in Tunisia no less than three a posteriori control bodies can potentially control any SOE.
Because of this, managers feel less and less accountable to their boards or to the population.
They feel that they are only accountable to the minister or prime minister who appointed them.
Because of the financial impact of political decisions on SOE management that usually are made
opaquely, managers do not feel responsible, and they simply request regular recapitalization and
more subsidies to cover the higher expenses. Therefore, politicians feel they can request more
employment and more investments because they are the ones able to grant SOE managers more
public resources. The process, then, comes full circle. Managers are only accountable to
politicians, and so they do not have any incentive to enhance the performance of their companies
(because such a goal would not align with the goals of politicians), and politicians are not really
constrained from using SOEs for political purposes to please some individuals, regions, or
stakeholders.

The Impacts of Poor Governance of SOEs: Corruption, Misuse of
Public Funds, and Overemployment
There is limited empirical evidence of how the poor internal governance of SOEs affects their
performance except for some recent work on SOEs in China. Su and He (2012), using a sample
of 744 publicly listed manufacturing firms in China between 1999 and 2006, demonstrated that
firm efficiency, as estimated using stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis, is
negatively related to state ownership. In addition, they found out that firms with more
independent boards are more efficient, supporting the argument that a board of directors can be
an effective internal governance mechanism.

In the MENA region, the literature on the governance of SOEs is relatively limited, and it rarely
touches on the economic and financial impacts of poor governance.

One obviously needs to be cautious when generalizing about the impact of poor governance on
the misuse of public funds. Underlying factors, such as cronyism, may explain the misuse of
public funds despite the good internal governance structure on paper.

However, in Tunisia the bad practices and misuse of public funds in SOEs were scrupulously
documented. According to a report published in November 2011 by the National Commission for
the Investigation of Cases of Corruption and Embezzlement (Commission Nationale d'Enquête
sur la Corruption et les Malversations), there were recurrent poor practices at several SOEs:

        Access to state-owned land at prices completely out of step with market prices was a
         highly lucrative practice, especially in a climate of booming property development.

        Public services and SOEs were used for personal purposes in order to give companies in
         the Ben Ali family significant competitive advantages.

        Abuse of state assets for private purposes was evident, such as the use of Tunisair
         services by Karthago Airlines without paying for them.

        The regime's state banks were used for special access to credit under advantageous terms.

Moreover, a state can find a multitude of ways to keep SOEs afloat: direct support in the form of
subsidies or indirect support such as through access to finance under preferential conditions (e.g.,
via public banks), state guarantees, public contracts that would not be subject to regular
procurement procedures, preferential tax and regulatory treatment, or schemes to benefit from
various state facilities. In the literature, it is what Kornai (1986) calls the soft budget constraint.

In Egypt, SOEs drain public resources because the state has to invest public resources in assets,
but SOEs do not generate profits and depend on subsidies, despite the fact that some of them
benefit from monopolies. Although the assets of the SOEs under the Ministry of Investment,
including the assets of their affiliated companies, accounted for almost 7.5 percent of Egypt’s
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 and their profit did not exceed 0.1 percent of GDP. The
companies not falling under the Ministry of Investment realized profit of about 0.2 percent of
GDP, although their asset share of GDP was almost 2 percent. Moreover, the so-called economic
authorities amassed an aggregate operating loss of more than $15 billion (LE 114.5 billion) in
2013. Only the economic authorities of three sectors (out of nine) had a net profit without
subsidies (see table 4.2).51

In Iraq, the federal budget increasingly subsidizes SOEs by means of loans through state banks,
capital allocations (state bank loans for implementing and rehabilitating projects in SOEs), and
special funds for emergencies (unforeseen expenditures and such but also misused to finance
salaries).

In Iraq, according to 2010 data, about 30–50 percent of SOE employees were not working
(excess labor or non-active employees) because of overemployment that greatly increased SOEs
in 2005–07. Subsidies were thus created to generate employment and rents because wages and
salaries are 30–50 percent higher in the private sector than in the public sector.

Within the energy sector in Tunisia, the existence of several state-owned enterprises allow
cross-subsidization, which can conceal the ineffectiveness of some of them. The absence of good
practices in this sector in Tunisia is illustrated here by referring to the main criteria defined
earlier in this volume:
          State acting as an owner. The energy sector has not been under scrutiny because the
             units in charge of monitoring SOEs (Direction Générale des Participations et Unité de
             Suivi de la Productivité des Entreprises Publiques) have had difficulty gaining access
             to economic and financial data and are staffed with only a few people.

           Autonomy. Some of these companies, such as STIR, Tunisia’s refinery, and STEG,
            the enterprise in charge of power generation, have been constrained by recruitment
            campaigns in recent years, which partially explains their recent extremely difficult
            financial circumstances.

           Boards of directors. The boards of energy sector companies consist of civil servants;
            these companies do not have independent boards of directors.

           Transparency and disclosure. Opacity prevails because the cross-subsidization has
            not been made public (at least with aggregate figures). Moreover, some companies
            such as STIR have delayed publishing their audited accounts. STIR receives a major
            subsidy from ETAP, the national petroleum company.

Thus in an opaque environment cross-subsidization 52 enables companies such as STIR and
STEG to appear in a much better situation than they really are (see figure 3.2 for an indication of
the cross-subsidies among ETAP, STIR, and STEG). Tunisia’s energy SOEs operate in an
environment that is not conducive to financial discipline (whereas this is crucial to have
performing SOEs 53). Moreover, this subsidy system is not transparent (in terms of its policy
objectives, the amounts involved and how they are allocated) and fair.

In the aggregate, if both STIR imported crude oil and STEG imported natural gas based on prices

52
   ETAP imports oil and gas on behalf of STIR and STEG. In doing so, ETAP imports crude oil and sells
it at 30 percent of its cost to STIR (TD 50 per barrel), or less than half the price on the international
market.
53
   For more details, see Kikeri et al. (2014) in chapter 5.
in the international markets, over TD 1.2 billion in additional funds would have to be transferred
from the Tunisian state budget to the two companies. Furthermore, because ETAP’s profits are
currently being used to reduce a portion of budget transfers (approximately TD 300 million),
STIR and STEG would benefit from TD 1.5 billion in indirect subsidies, or over 2 percent of
GDP. If this amount were incorporated within the budgeted energy subsidies, the total would be
50 percent higher than 5 percent of GDP, for a total in excess of 7 percent of GDP.

The state transfers the price subsidy on petroleum products to STIR and regularly allows that
SOE to import such products. As a result, this model appears to be very costly (through the loss
of revenue for ETAP and little incentive for STIR to increase its efficiency) as well as opaque
(over procurement unit prices, etc.). In 2013, over TD 200 million was transferred from ETAP to
STIR and over TD 1 billion from ETAP to STEG.

Chapter 5   What New Reform Priorities Could Change
SOE Governance in the MENA Region?
In his fair assessment of reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Gómez-Ibáñez (2007) points
out that “it should be no surprise that the efforts to reform SOEs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s
were disappointing. . . . Given the record, . . . it is difficult to recommend specific reform
strategies with great confidence.? Vagliasindi (2008a) also notes that “we still know very little
about the effects of board structure or corporate governance more generally on firm value or
performance.?

The Limits of Ambitious SOE Governance Reforms in the MENA
Region
Lack of a good record of reforms and little empirical knowledge should make countries and
donors cautious as they move forward in this area.

SOE Governance Reforms in a Low Governance Environment
As noted earlier, it is difficult to directly link governance and firm performance, and benchmarks
are rare and usually subject to criticism.54
However, what has been demonstrated empirically and theoretically is that the characteristics of
a country are an important determinant of firm-level governanceits costs and benefits. Firms
benefit from good governance because it allows them to access external markets on better terms,
but that benefit is not of much value in countries with weak and inefficient capital markets
(Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz 2006).

Therefore, in low governance countrieswhich include most countries in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) regionSOE governance reforms are unlikely to bring the results that
would be expected in a country with good governance. For example, in countries with extremely
thin capital markets, what benefits might a SOE derive from disclosing financial statements on
time? In a country where civil society does not scrutinize the use of public resources and
collective action is difficult to achieve, what could be the impact of more transparency on
subsidies to SOEs or on waste of public resources? SOEs operate in a governance context, and,
even though governance structures could be amended, it does not mean that practices would
radically change.

The Success or Failure of SOE Reforms and the Political Process
As one observer puts it, “Opportunities for reform arise when events temporarily alter the
political economy of the firm? (Gómez-Ibáñez 2007). And Nabli (2001) said the following about
SOE reforms in the MENA region: “The feasibility of SOE reform is related to the costs of
reform and to the political pressures opposing it.?

In most countries, SOE reforms are essentially designed to include corporatizing SOEs, changing
boards and board compositions, and increasing transparency and disclosure.

54
   Despite those problems, Megginson and Netter (2001) quote some studies on the impact of
privatization on firm performance and explain the usual rationale for privatization of SOEs.
On one side, the losers in such reforms are usually quite numerous and politically powerful such
as the employees of utilities, some high-level civil servants, and politicians. Indeed, reform in a
SOE usually




                               




Overreliance on Form over Results
It is unclear whether implementation of the four principles of SOE reform described earlier
would prevent the effects of cronyism and patronage.



55
     Reforming the labor code, however, is a task that goes well beyond restructuring a SOE.
56
   See Brockmeyer et al. (2015) for more details. This is an element mentioned by Krueger (1990) in
favor of privatization.
There is a disconnect between window dressing attitudes and the behavior57 surrounding SOE
reforms in the MENA region. As a result, the reality is hidden, and reforms do not materialize,
remaining largely on paper. Institutional mimicry prevails and therefore explains why, despite
reforms on paper and governance arrangements closer to those in the private sector, an
administrative approach to SOE management continues to prevail and administrative practices
remain largely intact. In short, there is a strong disconnect between stated ambitions and the
reality of the day-to-day functioning of SOEs.

According to organizational sociologists, “organizations often arrange their core activities
according to accepted models, or templates, in their field? (D’Aunno, Succi, and Alexander
2000) or “tend to model themselves after similar organizations in their field that they perceive to
be more legitimate or successful? (DiMaggio et al. 1983).

Therefore, it is not surprising that politicians and bureaucrats strive to copy the SOE models
followed by member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) because they are the ones rightly perceived as the most successful ones. Their
organizational characteristics are mimicked in the region: corporatizing, placing independent
members on boards, strengthening the units in charge of monitoring SOEs, strengthening
financial audits, introducing more transparency, developing special vehicles with public-private
partnership (PPP) frameworks, and so on.

In conclusion, where political control over SOEs remains quite high, such as in the MENA
region, the usual reforms are unlikely to succeed and a different approach should be used.
Because this objective is usually has a medium-term perspective, a push for transparency is most
probably needed on the cost of SOEs, employment levels and wages, productivity (but combined
with training for the media), and the actual state of SOE management and its impact on taxpayers
and on the economy in general.

A Gradual Path toward Success: Lessons from the Corporatization of
the OCP in Morocco

        he Office Chérifien des Phosphates




57
   Anthropologists and organizational sociologists have documented ?institutional mimicry? since the 1970s,
demonstrating that beyond reforms on paper there is strong tendency for organizations to continue with the prevalent
practices (an important article is that by Bugnicourt 1973).
                                                                                 




Alongside its commercial mandate, the OCP assumes a vast developmental mandate in a variety
of areas. This includes the promotion of agriculture (such as mapping fertile lands in Morocco,
promoting the sustainable use of fertilizers by small farmers, or promoting innovative
agricultural projects through its innovative agricultural fund), the promotion of employment
(such as a large training programs for youth known as OCP Skills and an initiative to fund small
and medium enterprise development), the promotion of the chemical industry sector (with the
proposal that some OCP facilities be made available to the industry such as laboratories for

59
  The monopoly applies to exploitation but also to the distribution and commercialization of phosphates and their
by-products.
research and development), and its overall participation in a debate on how to promote food
security worldwide (conceived as a public policy mandate).




It is extremely difficult to link governance reforms with specific performance changes. However,
from interviews of various stakeholders, the recent reforms of OCP management had enabled
better performance. For example, the OCP’s contribution to the Moroccan state is increasing. As
of 2012, the OCP’s total financial contribution to the state (taxes and dividends) amounted to DH
4.72 billion (or over $500 million), making it the main contributor among SOEs to the state
budget. Today, the OCP remains the world’s largest exporter of phosphate products, and it holds
stakes in the capital of a number of subsidiaries, mostly in the chemical industry but not
exclusively (e.g., real estate), including a series of joint ventures in emerging markets such as
Brazil, India, and Turkey.
What could be inferred from the OCP changes? The OCP does not follow the first best
governance model, and accountability to the board of directors may not be the most important
factor explaining the success of OCP reforms. However, the main lesson could be that although
the de jure institutional architecture may not be the most important factor in the better
performance of SOEs, it can nevertheless provide a cornerstone for in-depth reform. Indeed, the

                                 OCP management has definitely gained managerial autonomy
and the financial means to invest and recruit, while the company continues to have a large
developmental mandate for the country.

Partnerships with the private sector are important to enable SOEs reforms.

Reforming SOE Governance through Partnerships with the Private
Sector
External pressure and innovation from private players can prompt SOEs to increase their
competitiveness and adapt to new market rules. This has been proven in the banking sector and
in logistics and transport services. But when competitive forces are not sufficient to push SOEs
to reform, mixed ownership can be an alternative approach to create the necessary reforms from
within. Mixed ownership brings talent, ideas and processes right to the heart of a company's
decision-making process and challenges the core functioning of the organization.

Faced with tighter fiscal space and the need to accelerate their growth rapidly, most non-oil
MENA countries need to shift their public investment objectives toward sectors with high
potential for productivity gains, which will be critical to achieving sustained high rates of growth
in their gross domestic products (GDPs), in particular through exports. These non-oil MENA
states would benefit from encouraging more private sector participation in the sourcing,
preparation, financing, and implementation of investment projects within the framework of
public-private partnerships, where SOEs could play a proactive role. From this perspective,
SOEs will need to shift their role from a direct one to that of provider of investment
opportunities to be achieved by local or foreign private investors. This new role should notably
be framed through partnerships with the private sector.
Which role for the World Bank on SOEs reforms?




Table 5.1: Do’s and don’ts of SOEs reforms in a low governance environment
Appendix              The Legal Definition of SOEs in Egypt, Iraq,
and Tunisia
Egypt

Egypt has about 260 public enterprises operating under different regulatory regimes. They fall
under four broad categories:

    Economic authorities (52) and service authorities (102). Economic authorities are....
     Service authorities depend on recapitalization or operate on a subsidized business model.

    Public business sector companies under specific ministries. These companies, which
     include the Egypt Electricity Holding Company (EGELEC) and the Egyptian Company
     for Water and Waste Water, are 100 percent controlled by the state and operate under the
     authority of line ministries. These are mainly companies considered “strategic? in sectors
     such as electricity, telecom, aviation, banking, housing, and petroleum.

       Public business sector companies under the Ministry of Investment. This category
        includes most agricultural, textile, chemical industry, mining industry, transport,
        construction, tourism, pharmaceutical, and food processing holdings as well as the
        Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS). These holdings fall under Law 203 on
        corporations. A relatively large series of what were formerly “government units? have
        been corporatized under a new regime established in 1991 (Law 203) as part of the
        privatization effort. Law 203 puts forth a regime that is close to private sector
        corporations in their day-to-day operations, including the establishment of a board of
        directors as well as control and reporting mechanisms.

    Private business corporations with state participation. Both the Ministry of Investment
     and line ministries may hold stakes in the capital of private sector corporationsfor
     example, in the form of joint ventures.
    For some ministries, holding companies have been established grouping 10–25
     state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or public companies. The shareholders’ meetings of
     holding companies are chaired by the minister and attended by the board of directors,
     which is composed of political appointees. In affiliated SOEs, the shareholders’ meeting
     is headed by the chair of the holding company board and attended by board members of
     the holding company. Up to four board members are selected by the holding company
     shareholders at their meeting. Shareholders’ meetings approve board reports, distribution
     of profits, and continuation or dismissal of the chair and directors. As a result of
     privatization, a certain number of Law 203 SOEs have private sector shareholders.
Iraq
Iraq’s economy is still largely controlled by the state and, compared with other countries in the
region, is relatively unsophisticated when it comes to the methods for state participation in the
business sector:

    State enterprises. These enterprises are defined by Law 22 of 1997 as “financially
     self-sustainable and fully (100 percent) state owned economical units with moral
     personality and financial and administrative autonomy and operating under economic
     principles.? Law 22 provides for a regime governing their establishment, operation, and
     liquidation. This regime, however, is relatively limited in its provisions. Although
     companies have capital, no reference is made to shares or to shareholders.

       The main corporate organ is the board of directors, comprised of eight members, of which
       six are designated by the minister to which the enterprise is attached.

       The general manager is nominated by the cabinet. In practice, in Iraq’s largely centralized
       and state-controlled economy, state enterprises reportedly operate as ministerial
       departments.

    Mixed companiesand other participations. The state can also participate in companies
     jointly with the private sector. Mixed companies have state participation of above 25
     percent and are subject to a specific regime, defined under Law 21 of 1997 (amended in
     2004). Law 1997 also defines the regime of regular private corporations. Under this 25
     percent threshold, the company is subject to general corporate law. Shares of companies
     established under Law 21 can be publicly listed.

Tunisia
A series of texts govern state participation in entities active in the productive sector in Tunisia.

Law 89-9 of 1989, pertaining to statutory SOEs, enterprises, and participations, provides a
definition of SOEs (Article 8). SOEs include:

      Statutory SOEs of a non-administrative nature fixed by a decree
      Corporations whose capital 100 percent owned by the state
      Corporations whose capital is at least 50 percent owned by the state, local governments,
       statutory SOEs, or corporations 100 percent owned by the state.

These SOEs are governed by a mix of specific laws (statutory SOEs) or general corporate law
(corporations), together with the provisions of Law 89-9. Issues covered by Law 89-9 for SOEs
include representation by the state at meetings of the board of directors and control modalities
over board decisions, rules pertaining to the recruitment of personnel, communication of
information to public authorities, audits and control mechanisms, and procurement.

It should be noted that, although the terms corporation and statutory SOEs of a
non-administrative nature may seem to refer to productive activities, these criteria are not clearly
set by Law 89-9. In practice, it is reported that the list of statutory SOEs of a non-administrative
nature includes a number of establishments whose activities cannot be considered productive.

Law 89-9 also provides rules pertaining to issues such as state participations, defined as
participations held by statutory SOEs or 100 percent-owned corporationsparticipations whose
exact nature is not defined, nor are the thresholdsand the restructuring of “enterprises with a
public participation.?

It appears that Tunisia recognizes all of the forms of state participation: statutory SOEs and
corporations, direct and indirect participation, total and partial ownership, monopolistic or
subject to competition. It is, however, very difficult (if at all possible) to summarize the regime
applicable to these various forms of participation.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Burundi perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Burundi
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Burundi
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From January to April 2015, 312 stakeholders of the WBG in Burundi were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, the office of the Prime Minister; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; PMUs; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 209 stakeholders
participated in the survey (67% response rate).

Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via post or courier. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Burundi; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Burundi; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 56%, N=325). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 103).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the Office of a Minister were
      combined with those from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; respondents from
      ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants
      working on WBG-supported projects were combined; respondents from the financial
      sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
      respondents from NGOs/CBOs, private foundations, trade unions, faith based
      organizations, and youth groups were combined in the “CSO? category. Few respondents
      from bilateral/multilateral agencies and independent government institutions were
      included in the “Other? category. Note, there were no respondents from the judiciary
      branch.

Geographic Location
     Stakeholder responses across all geographic locations were compared for indicator
      questions. Only significant geographic location differences in ratings on indicator
      questions will be discussed in the body of this report. Geographic location comparisons
      can be found in Appendix C (see page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’12 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 6.29; weighted mean in FY’12 = 5.98)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Burundi, the extent to which the
        WBG achieves development results in Burundi, and the extent to which the WBG plays a
        relevant role in development in Burundi.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Burundi, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Burundi. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at demobilization/disarmament/reintegration.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Burundi, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Burundi: Year Comparison6
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had significantly higher
        levels of agreement that “Overall the WBG currently plays a relevant role in
        development in Burundi? (indicator question) and that “The WBG supports program and
        strategies that are realistic for Burundi? when compared to respondents in the FY’12
        Country Survey.
       Stakeholder groups: For the two indicator questions in the chart below, respondents
        from “Other? organizations had the highest levels of agreement, whereas respondents
        from the media had significantly lower levels of agreement.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 288  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 184

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

    The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) is a global partnership program administered by the World Bank. It
    was established in 2003 to develop output-based aid (OBA) approaches across a variety of sectors — among them water,
    energy, health, and education. As of September 2015, through a portfolio of 44 projects with US$228 million in commitments
    for subsidy funding and ongoing technical assistance activities, GPOBA is demonstrating that OBA can deliver a diverse
    range of services and lasting results for the poor. The program’s current donors are the United Kingdom’s Department for
    International Development (DFID), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Directorate-General for International
    Cooperation of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),
    and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). For more information about GPOBA, please visit

1 Introduction




Since its establishment in 2003, the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA),
managed by the World Bank (WB), has completed 12 water supply projects in 10 countries –
in Cameroon, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, the Philippines,
Uganda and Vietnam. This report presents the result of an examination of these projects, to
explore the potential of Output-Based Aid (OBA) in water supply, identify lessons and
opportunities for mainstreaming OBA in the sector, and to reflect on the impacts that the
projects have had.


The water access challenge
Convenient access to safe water is central to human health and development. Water-
borne disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the world, much of which
could be eliminated by a combination of better water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The
World Health Organization estimates that around 502 000 deaths a year in low and middle
income countries from diarrheal disease are attributable to unsafe water, and that over 1 000
children under 5 die each day from diarrheal disease caused by inadequate WASH (WHO
2014). The WHO also estimates that between one-third and two-thirds of global under-
nutrition and its consequences are attributable to poor WASH. Beyond the health impacts,
lack of convenient access to water is a major cause of drudgery and diversion of productive
time. UNWomen estimates that in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, women and girls spend 40
billion hours a year collecting water (UNWomen 2014). The time spent collecting water has
been valued at around $20 billion a year (WHO 2012).

Over three-quarters of a billion people do not have access to safe water. While the
Millennium Development Goal target of halving the proportion of people in the world without
access to safe water was declared to have been met in 2012 (UN 2012a), there is still a long
way to go to achieve the goal of universal access. This is reflected in the continued emphasis
on this goal in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was adopted by UN
member states in 2015 (Appendix A). More than a third of the people who are currently
without access live in just three very populous countries - China, India, and Nigeria (Figure
1.1, top panel) – but there are many smaller countries where there is a long way to go to
achieve universal access (Figure 1.1 bottom panel). Nearly all of these people are poor – in
fact some development organisations consider that absence of access is itself an indicator of
poverty. Over 80 per cent of these people live in rural areas – although in the period to 2030,



                                        Page 11 of 66
70 per cent of the projected additional people needing access will be in urban areas (Appendix
table A.1).

1.1     The water access challenge




Note: The indicators in the figures relate to access to water from an improved source and draws on information collected by the Joint
Monitoring Program of WHO and UNICEF. An improved water source is one which is by nature of its construction or through active
intervention, is likely to be protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter. Water from an
improved source is not necessarily safe to drink – it may still be affected by microbial or chemical contaminations (Bain et al 2014).

World Bank Strategy on Access to Water
In its 2004 Water Resources Strategy, the World Bank laid out some key strategic
considerations for improving the access of poor people to safe and affordable water, focusing
on the related issues of reducing costs and increasing accountability.


                                                             Page 12 of 66
Urban and rural areas require rather different approaches (box 1.2). This reflects a mix
of the impact of population density and agglomeration on the economics of alternative
technological and institutional solutions, historical legacies with respect to management of
network infrastructure, and the nature of available water sources and their requirements for
treatment.


1.2   Reducing costs and increasing accountability

The Bank’s Water Resources Strategy envisages different areas of emphasis in increasing
the access of poor people to safe and affordable water in urban and rural areas (World
Bank 2004).

In urban areas, the pursuit of cost reductions and accountability means:
 targeting subsidies to the poorest, largely unserved consumers to partially finance up-
  front costs of connection;
 incorporating the preferences of poor communities for service quality standards,
  delivery modality and management arrangements;
 permitting entry and fair competition between conventional utilities and small-scale
  service providers; and
 structuring contracts, regulatory incentives and legislation to facilitate extension and
  upgrading of services to poor communities.

In small towns and rural areas, the pursuit of cost reductions and accountability means:
 empowering communities to make informed choices about their participation, service
  levels and service delivery mechanisms;
 realigning the rights and obligations of key stakeholders;
 vesting communities with ownership rights and authority to select service providers;
 building local capacity to support community decision making in planning,
  management and delivery of services; and
 establishing financial policies and instruments that provide incentives for
  communities to contribute to capital costs and pay for all operation and maintenance
  costs.


As the strategy points out, these approaches have to be embedded in broader efforts
to stimulate the development of financially sound, operationally efficient and
consumer-oriented utilities, and must also create space for the entry of the private
sector. This may require, among other things: realigning policy, regulatory and service
provision functions and governance structures to enhance accountability and incentives;
strengthening regulatory oversight capacities, institutions and processes; building
commercially oriented and customer-focused utilities to ensure sustainability of service;
strengthening government capacity to contract services in transparent and accountable
ways; balancing remuneration with allocation of risks; increasing the creditworthiness of
water providers to enhance their capacity to mobilize financing for long delayed

                                         Page 13 of 66
investments in rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion; gradually raising average tariffs
to reflect actual costs and instituting predictable, transparent adjustment mechanisms;
eliminating generalized supply-side subsidies in favour of narrowly targeted subsidies to
achieve specified outcomes; and promoting the development of financial policies and
instruments that facilitate more efficient allocation of public funds and increased access
to local capital markets.


Output-Based Aid and GPOBA
There have been elements of OBA in development assistance for service delivery for
some considerable time (one of the earliest OBA schemes provided reproductive health
services in South Korea in the 1960s (IDA, 2009)) but the World Bank Group (WBG)
adopted a more formal approach in 2002 with the launch of its Private Sector
Development Strategy (IDA op cit). In 2003, the GPOBA was established to systematically
pilot OBA and to analyse experience to support greater use of the approach.

What is OBA in water? OBA is one of a number of Results-Based Financing (RBF)
mechanisms designed to enhance access to and delivery of infrastructure and social services
through the use of performance-based incentives, rewards, or subsidies. RBF mechanisms
have in common that a funding entity (typically a government or sub-governmental agency)
provides a financial incentive, conditional on the recipient undertaking a set of pre-determined
actions or achieving a pre-determined performance or outputs. Resources are disbursed not
against individual expenditures or contracts on the input side, but against demonstrated and
independently verified results that are largely within the control of the recipient. OBA is used
to support the delivery of basic services where policy concerns justify the use of explicit,
performance based subsidies, and is typically used to facilitate access to basic services for the
low- income segment of the population. A key feature of OBA, as with other forms of RBF, is
the transfer of the risk of poor performance to the service provider. OBA in water often
addresses “last mile? challenges where the main infrastructure is already in place and the task
is to physically reach poor end-users, but it has also been used to support installation of
complete small scale systems where this is the best way to provide services. Appendix B
presents more information on GPOBA and its approach to OBA.


This report
The purpose of the study on which this report is based is to analyse, capture and synthesise
lessons learned from closed GPOBA water projects in order to evaluate the impact of the
subsidy schemes and inform the scale-up and replication of OBA approaches. These lessons
offer insight to successes and failures of project design and implementation as well as
solutions to more complex projects and/or less tested environments.

A case study approach has been employed, drawing on desk research, to examine the
effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of the projects. As pilots, the projects
have all been small, and not consistently subject to World Bank project completion and
evaluation requirements; and monitoring and evaluation has not typically focused on

been the subject of an Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), (the ICR for one
project, Uganda small towns project (P102462), was not published) and for only 4 of these
reports was a post-project survey undertaken. Further, the portfolio itself is small, so even
were there more data, quantitative analyses would not be appropriate.

This report looks into questions of project performance to glean lessons for delivery of access
to energy. The term “science of delivery? originates in healthcare and has been promoted by
the World Bank and its president Jim Yong Kim, MD/PhD. Calling for creating a science of
delivery, he notes:

   “Many countries have strong, coherent development policies and programs on paper but...
   are not getting the results they want… [However,] delivery is crucial for the public
   sector… as part of government’s social contract with citizens... [While] we can point to
   individual examples of delivery success in countries at all levels of income,… we need to
   move from isolated examples to broad global progress… There is an urgent need for a
   science of delivery… but that science does not yet exist. We must create it together... We
   must advance from the experiential know-how of individual practitioners to the level of
   analytical knowledge—the level of science.?1

Combining lessons on project performance with insights about impact of completed projects
allows to see the impact of access to water on poor people’s lives. An even more
comprehensive approach which is termed as “quality infrastructure? includes both how
infrastructure was built and is managed as well as what impact it achieves. This report will
look both into awareness campaigns which are part of project implementation and longer-term
issues such as sustainability of water services.2

This report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the portfolio in more depth and its
linkages with broader efforts in the water sector of partner countries. Chapter 3 examines the
performance of the projects in the portfolio. Chapter 4 draws on these assessment to see what
lessons can be learnt about sectoral and country preconditions for the successful use of OBA
and presents overall conclusions and recommendations arising from the study.

2 GPOBA’s water portfolio and its linkages to
  World Bank Group sectoral engagement



The portfolio
To date, GPOBA has completed 12 water supply projects, serving an estimated
1.5 million (mainly poor) people. Consistent with the aim of piloting OBA in the sector, the
projects have been (table 2.1):
 Located in rural, peri-urban and urban areas in a range of low and lower middle income
  countries spanning East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle
  East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean;
 Working with small, medium and large, state-owned and private, community and non-
  governmental organization service providers;
 Operating in sectors with different regulatory regimes;
 Delivering services through a range of modalities, from infill and expansion connections
  to existing large scale networks to construction of whole green-field and brown-field
  small-scale systems, and using household and yard-tap connections, public water points
  and kiosks.

Typically, projects have provided one-off subsidies, covering part of the cost of
connecting targeted households to a piped water supply system. The cost of connection to
which the subsidy applied may include varying elements of primary and secondary
infrastructure cost, depending on the nature of the system being supported. (In urban areas,
GPOBA projects have mostly been aimed at helping connect poor households to existing
networks, but in rural and some peri-urban areas, the projects have engaged with building a
new small-scale network.) In all cases, disbursements have been based on evidence of
connections being made and of a period of satisfactory service delivery (3 to 6 months).

The majority of projects have used geographic targeting as a means of directing the
subsidy to poorer households, operating in areas where poverty levels are known to be
high. In some cases, easily measured characteristics of housing or access to infrastructure
services were used to target poor households, in addition to or instead of geographic targeting
(table 2.1). The project in Cameroon used no explicit targeting, but it was expected that the
nature of the connections made available (low volume) would lead to a degree of self-
selection, and that absence of a connection was itself an indicator of deprivation.

       In total, nearly $35 million has been disbursed on these projects. Disbursements range
       between $800 000 and $7 million, and the number of beneficiaries ranges between 27 000 and
       291 000. The average grant disbursement per person served is around $24, the smallest is $5
       (the Uganda – Kampala project), and the largest is $117 (Morocco – where sanitation as well
       as water connections were covered) (Figure 2.2).

A number of GPOBA projects have been implemented in the context of prior sector
reforms (often supported by WB and IFC). These reforms have included:
 commercialization/corporatization of state utilities (Cameroon, Mozambique);
 reform of arrangements for financing state provision of water services (for example as
  associated with decentralization of service delivery responsibilities to local and provincial
  governments – Indonesia, Uganda, Kenya);
 out-sourcing of network operations to private concessionaires (Philippines, Indonesia,
  Morocco), or through use of lease, management and affermage3contracts (Cameroon,
  Uganda); and
 reform of regulations and the institutional mechanisms for regulatory oversight (Honduras,
  Kenya, Morocco).

These reforms have established important pre-conditions for OBA approaches to be
applied, creating circumstances where parts or all of the sector service are responsive to
price-related incentives, where prices are allowed to cover costs (or at least operating
costs), and impediments to new non-state entities becoming service providers are
removed. In some cases reforms have also clarified issues such as the terms of access to
water sources, service quality requirements and their monitoring, or have addressed
impediments to network expansion or creation of new systems.




3 An affermage arrangement is one where operation of a utility is transferred to a private operator,
while investment remains the responsibility of the government.

                                                                        Page 18 of 66
These reforms have enabled GPOBA to find suitable service providers.
 In Cameroon, Mozambique, Philippines, Indonesia (Jakarta), Morocco and Uganda
  (Kampala), the chosen service providers were commercialised public utilities or private
  concessionaires/lease operators whose structure and/or role in water supply was strongly
  affected by reforms.(In Cameroon, the OBA arrangement was a formal part of the Public-
  Private Partnership (PPP) agreement established under the reforms.)
 In Uganda (small towns), Vietnam, India and Kenya, the projects could use private,
  municipal, and community operators because of regulatory and structural reforms that
  created the framework for decentralised and private operation of water supply schemes,
  and the ability of these operators to accept the associated risks of an OBA approach.

In addition to building on sectoral reforms, some projects were closely linked to World
Bank operations, or built on significant technical assistance delivered by Bank managed
programs. For example:
 The GPOBA operation in Cameroon was initially conceived as an integral part of an
  Urban and Water Development IDA loan which provided support to implementation of a
  PPP that established an affermage arrangement involving a newly created state-owned
  asset holding company and a lease contract with an internationally led consortium. This
  support also included financing priority rehabilitation to production and distribution
  systems, and expansions to the tertiary network to be used by the GPOBA operation.
 In Kenya the World Bank managed Water and Sanitation Program and the Public-Private
  Infrastructure Advisory Facility provided active support in the development and
  implementation of the GPOBA project, working with the commercial bank that was the
  grant recipient and manager of the project.
 In Mozambique at the time of appraisal of the project, the Bank was preparing the Water
  Services and Institutional Support Project (WASIS), which would support system
  expansions in the major cities outside of the capital Maputo, where the project was also
  expected to operate.
 At the time that the GPOBA project was being developed in the Philippines, the Bank’s
  Manila Third Sewerage Project (MTSP) was under implementation. Project preparation
  benefited from sector analysis and dialogue with the Government of the Philippines and
  the concessionaire MWCI in water supply associated with MTSP and its predecessor.
 In Honduras, the project was developed in the context of implementation of the
  Government’s Strategy for Modernisation of the Potable Water and Sanitation Sector,
  which had been developed with help from the Bank and PPIAF.
 In Uganda, the IFC developed a Small-Scale Infrastructure Provider Program that assisted
  suppliers to access bank finance.

A variety of methods for selecting activities/subprojects and service providers were
utilized. Some projects selected sub-projects and providers on the basis of competitive bids
or evaluation of proposals from project proponents (Honduras, Uganda small towns, Kenya).


                                        Page 19 of 66
In other cases, bids were sought to implement pre-identified sub-projects (Vietnam), and in
others both the sub-projects/targeted communities and providers were identified as part of
project design (Cameroon, Indonesia - Jakarta and Surabaya, India, Morocco, Mozambique,
the Philippines, Uganda –Kampala).

All projects contracted external Independent Verification Agents (IVAs). In some cases,
procurement of IVAs was handled by the grant recipient, and in others directly by GPOBA. In
at least one project (Honduras) the expectation at appraisal was that a Government regulatory
agency would take on the IVA function, but it was judged not to have sufficient capacity.


World Bank operations and OBA pilots
The relationship between GPOBA pilots and other World Bank Group operations in the
water sector is particularly important. By themselves, the pilots are too small and focussed
to deal with all of the sectoral pre-conditions needed for successful OBA. It would appear that
many GPOBA pilots were developed precisely because WBG operations were addressing
these preconditions, or providing service providers with resources needed to build network
infrastructure that the pilots could use to offer access to the poor. Further, the WBG
operations provided a platform and an opportunity for the dialogue needed to elicit partner
country interest in implementing OBA pilots.

GPOBA projects were typically developed in the context of World Bank Country
Assistance Strategies that included a pillar relating to access to services. Analysis of
World Bank Country Assistance Strategies - and their evaluations over the period of design
and implementation - indicates that many GPOBA pilots were implemented where WBG
engagement was at the stage of trying to translate policy and regulatory reforms into
improved service delivery (Appendix C). Among other things, this meant that the pilots could
often draw on Bank work that facilitated preparatory analysis to inform project design. This is
particularly important since the design of access subsidy schemes requires a thorough
knowledge of demand and supply issues in the sector, and the likely costs of investments
required to provide access.

3 Assessing the performance of the water
  portfolio



This chapter assesses the performance of the water portfolio against four criteria –
effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability. The questions informing this assessment
are described in Box 3.1.


 3.1   Criteria for assessment of projects

 The analysis considers the performance of the portfolio against the criteria of
 effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability. Questions it addresses include:
  Effectiveness - how well have OBA projects performed in terms of delivering the
   intended results, what practical lessons can be drawn from objective setting, are OBA
   projects more effectively delivered by private or public sector, and what aspects of
   OBA can be delivered at scale?
  Efficiency – what value for money does an OBA project deliver, how are providers
   incentivized, what pre-conditions or other requirements are needed for OBA to work,
   what are the various ways of incentivizing providers, and how well have different types
   performed, and how efficient are the independent verification mechanisms?
  Impact - what has been the overall impact of OBA projects in water, what are the
   positive additional impacts or knock-on effects, if any, from these projects, have there
   been any unintentional negative consequences arising from the OBA projects, and are
   there limitations to the type of service providers who might be able to engage in such
   projects?
  Sustainability – what is known about service delivery after projects have closed, what
   are the prospects for long-term sustainability of results under OBA, and how could
   OBA design be improved to increase sustainability of the outputs and hence outcomes?


Since GPOBA’s portfolio of water projects has been developed to test the viability of
OBA in the water sector, and whether OBA can deliver services and lasting results for
the poor, this evaluation has to consider not only the performance of each project, but
also the broader question of whether the portfolio has delivered proof of the concept in
the sector. For a pilot program, depending on the reasons, failure of a project may not
necessarily mean failure of the portfolio, if the project generates important lessons for
implementation of the overall approach.

Effectiveness
Eight of the 12 projects achieved 95 per cent or more of their final output targets, with 5
exceeding targets by 15 per cent or more. In all projects, the specified outputs were
household connections or households served. (Given the verification processes employed,
installed connections would also have met the specified service targets). According to the
documentation accessed by this study, four of the 12 projects had their targets revised
downwards (from numbers presented in project appraisal or commitment document), and one
had the targets revised upwards (table 3.2).

The reasons for revisions cannot always be determined from the documentation, but it seems
that in:
 Honduras and Morocco cost increases lead to a downward adjustment in connection
  targets;
 Indonesia in the Jakarta project the downward revision was made in the light of a decision
  not to proceed with a second phase targeting slum settlements, given regulatory
  restrictions facing the concessionaire;


                                                          Page 22 of 66
 Uganda in the Kampala project, the downward adjustment was made in the light of
  revealed household preferences for public water points rather than yard taps; and
 Vietnam, cost increases led to a reduction in connection targets in the originally targeted
  areas, but a decision to include slightly larger privately developed and operated schemes in
  the Mekong Delta enabled adoption of a higher target.

Unwarranted optimism about sectoral reforms, and failure to foresee problems with the
regulatory environment played a key role in projects that fell well short of targets. For
the two projects which achieved less than two-thirds of their connection targets, the main
reasons for underachievement were as follows:
 in Cameroon (63.1 per cent of target) - external factors including a major deterioration in
  the financial position of the entity responsible for pre-financing connections, due in part to
  Government failure to comply with financial agreements, and internal factors such as
  delays arising from late contracting of the Independent Verification Agency, and the
  complexity of disbursement and eligibility specifications (World Bank 2014a); and
 in Indonesia – Jakarta (43.4 per cent of target) – exclusion of a number of target
  communities due to application of the Government of Jakarta’s spatial planning policy
  criteria which disqualified all slum communities, and cancellation of a phase aiming to
  provide connections to households in informal settlements, given problems encountered
  piloting the approach.

Nearly all of the projects reported initial delays in implementation, and at least 10 were
extended once or twice – but the reasons for delays do not seem too much different from
those encountered in normal investment projects. Lack of familiarity with project
procedures was a common cause of delay – but delays were also attributed to:
 complexity of eligibility criteria for subsidy payment (Cameroon);
 grant recipient and implementer lack of capacity (Cameroon, Kenya);
 delayed procurement (Cameroon, Indonesia –Jakarta, Uganda – small towns, Kampala);
 problems in mobilising pre-financing (Honduras);
 problems in finding replacement communities where initial selections proved unsuitable
  (India);
 slow delivery of parallel infrastructure (Indonesia – Jakarta, Morocco, Mozambique);
 coordination of multiple agencies at start-up (Indonesia – Surabaya);
 regulatory delays (Kenya);
 non-renewal of leases for expected implementers (Mozambique);
 World Bank processing of payments (Vietnam);
 addressing challenges caused by land tenure, gaining access to install distribution
  networks (Philippines), and problems with acquiring land for network facilities (Uganda);
  and

 negotiating with vested interests controlling alternative water supplies in informal
  settlements (Philippines), and dealing with political interference in the location of
  connections (Uganda).


Risk

A defining feature of OBA is the transfer of elements of performance risk to the service
provider – a challenge for project design is to ensure that the distribution of risks is
consistent with the ability of various parties to manage them. The literature on OBA and
other forms of RBF identifies payment, demand and cost risks that typically occur in water
projects, as well as political and regulatory risk. An important element of the approach that
GPOBA’s portfolio has taken to water is the determination of the connection subsidy offered
to households – here many of the demand and cost risks are brought together. Service
providers should in principle be able to assess the risk of the subsidy being incorrect, and
most projects have carried out extensive analytical work and consultation to determine
subsidies. But experience has shown that there are other risks affecting performance that have
not always been as well assessed.

Demand

GPOBA’s water pilots have primarily involved supporting profit oriented or cost
recovering water supply operations – where success depends on target households’
willingness to pay a tariff that at least covers costs. Demand characteristics, and especially
the impact of competing sources of water, have to be carefully assessed.

Evidence tends to indicate that many poor people (especially in urban and peri-urban
areas) pay considerably more for water than they would pay if connected to a network
(see, for example, Sy et al 2014). However, connection fees often represent a significant
share of annual cash incomes for poor households, and there are few mechanisms available to
the poor to spread the costs of connections. Some projects also found that vested interests in
informal settlements associated with alternative water supplies were able to resist or sabotage
project attempts to deliver piped water (Uganda - Kampala, Philippines, Indonesia – Jakarta).

However, in many rural areas, poor households have periodic access to very low cost
sources of water (for example, rain water for in-house use) or more consistently
available lower quality water (such as surface water for outside-the-house uses). This
challenge, which was encountered in the Uganda small towns project, can mean that
implementers need to carefully calculate the appropriate size of systems and their fixed costs
to deal with significant seasonal fluctuations in demand.

Evidence also suggests that poor households are willing to pay for particular levels of
service – such as consistent cleanliness and 24 hour availability, and in many
circumstances place a considerable value on having household connections, as opposed
to community water points (Sy et al 2014).



                                         Page 24 of 66
 An attempt in the Jakarta project to provide water in informal settlements through
  community meters was abandoned, in part because it did not provide the kind of service
  households wanted.
 The Honduras project assumed that there would be a demand for yard taps, but found that
  what users wanted and were willing to pay for was house connections
 In contrast, the Uganda Kampala project expected that there would be significant demand
  for yard taps. This was not realized and the project instead focused on public water points.
  An assessment of the project (Mimmi, 2012) suggested that peri-urban areas are often
  characterized by landlords reluctant to invest in their properties, high levels of mobility of
  residents reducing households’ interest in significant investments, and lack of clarity
  concerning responsibilities for O&M, all of which diminish interest in household
  connections.

A number of projects devoted effort to building awareness in target households of the
benefits of participating in subsidized access projects, and willingness to pay surveys
were an important part of project preparation and sometimes used to inform selection of
target communities.
 Morocco – the ICR concluded that organization of awareness and information campaigns
  was critical to guaranteeing the population’s buy-in to the social program.
 India – the ICR observed that community awareness and social marketing campaigns
  played a key role in getting beneficiaries to accept the benefits of using treated water and
  paying cost-recovery tariff.
 In Indonesia, the Jakarta concessionaire employed an NGO to help with promotion and
  socialization of the project, including creation of community based organizations to help
  with billing and collection.
 In Vietnam the project proponent (an NGO long established in the country) used a
  consultative approach to inform, build ownership, and ensure the commitment of
  prospective beneficiaries and local authorities to the development process and to
  responsibility-sharing among all stakeholders. An integral part of the consultation process
  was an information, education and communications (IEC) campaign. The IEC campaign
  not only sought to raise awareness about the merits of piped clean water but also to teach
  the community about improved sanitation and hygiene practices.

Costs

The other side of the coin in determining the appropriate amount of subsidy lies with the
costs of making household connections.

In some projects, typically those where a public utility, concessionaire or leaseholder is
the chosen implementer, regulations often set both the tariffs and connection fees that
could be charged (for example, Cameroon, Morocco, Mozambique, Indonesia –Jakarta
and Surabaya and the Philippines). Tariff structures may be designed to offer some kind of
cross-subsidization to poorer customers, but this may in fact act as a deterrent to providers to


                                         Page 25 of 66
connect poor households. Similarly regulated connection fees may be based on network-wide
historical costs of connections – but they may not cover all of the costs associated with
reaching poor communities because additional network investment may be needed to reach
them.

This leads to some complex interactions between the allowable connection fee, the OBA
subsidy, the household and service providers’ contributions and the incentives for both
suppliers and households to do business.
 In Cameroon, where the project subsidised in-fill connections, the subsidy varied
  according to the length of the connection, based on cost estimates drawn from the service
  provider’s data base. Initially, connection fees reflect the actual cost of connection, but
  mid-project a Government decision fixed the fee regardless of cost.
 In Indonesia, for the Jakarta project, subsidy payments were based on actual costs of
  connections, and used a complex formula designed to share some of the market risk. In the
  Surabaya project, cost and subsidy data were based on a random sample of actual costs
  incurred by the local utility, with the subsidy being fixed for in-fill connections, and
  varying according to length for expansion connections.
 In the Philippines, subsidies were based on the regulated connection charges.
 In Morocco, subsidies were developed based on benchmarking of concessionaires’
  connection costs.

In the face of cost and exchange rate variations, with a fixed subsidy, and if the
Government intervenes to set connection fees, there can be quite significant shifts in the
distribution of costs across stakeholders. Figure 3.3 shows how the distribution of the unit
cost of a connection across the project implementer, the Government of Cameroon,
beneficiaries, and the GPOBA subsidy varied over the course of the project. At the beginning
of the project, fees were based on actual costs, but after 2010 the Government fixed the
connection fee and household contribution. Household contributions were always higher than
the 5 per cent envisaged at appraisal, and varied between 10 and 22 per cent of cost. (Note
that after the Government decision, the project ceased recording actual connection costs. It
appears that after the decision, the implementer limited the length of connections it would
cover, and charged beneficiaries for the extra costs of longer connections. (World Bank
2014a).

Determining costs can be rather more complicated when an OBA project deals with a
collection of greenfield and brownfield water supply systems. In these cases, service
providers will be determining the appropriate scale of system to build, given expectations of
up-take from customers, and both construction and operational costs may vary considerably
across different schemes. Factors such as transport costs for materials, energy for pumping,
and dispersion of households to be served will all affect system costs. Some projects
(Honduras, Uganda- Kampala, Vietnam) set subsidies on a case by case basis, requiring
proponents to submit costings as part of a competitive evaluation process. While this may
solve some of the cost-subsidy issues, using a required subsidy as a rationing device between
alternative subprojects can bias choices in favour of intrinsically cheaper schemes and
discriminate against harder-to service poor communities. (GPOBA, 2014).

Other risks

Other risks have surfaced in GPOBA projects – not all of them have been properly
anticipated and some were clearly beyond the service provider’s competence to manage.
These included:
 inadequate water resources – in the Uganda small towns project, at least one site for which
  firms bid to build a water network proved to have inadequate groundwater resources. In
  other projects (such as Indonesia - Jakarta), the project had to be modified because of lack
  of water;
 problems with land tenure and access to land – as mentioned above, this was an issue in
  the Uganda small towns project and in the Philippines; and
 regulatory risk – in the Jakarta project the design envisaged that it would be possible to
  provide connections to informal settlements, but the municipal government would not

                                                          Page 27 of 66
   amend regulations requiring proof of title for utilities to make connections, and in Kenya,
   expected changes in regulations affecting licensing of water systems were delayed.

Public utilities and large scale private operators of utilities are typically able to cope
with the impact of these risks being realised: but where providers are small scale local
enterprises, capacity to manage such risk is limited.


Targeting

GPOBA water projects have all been concerned with issues of access, rather than
broader public health dimension of water supply and use. As such, a key intention is to
increase the access of poor households to water that in some case is clean, and in other case is
potable.

This aspect of the projects is typically pursued by targeting, to ensure that the subsidy is both
effective and efficient. Some sources have argued that absence of access to safe or improved
water is an indicator of poverty in its own right, but more projects have tried directly or
indirectly to target households that meet income or other criteria for poverty.
 Many projects have used geographic targeting because more specific targeting is too
  difficult, but this has meant that a (typically unmeasured) number of non-poor households
  may have also benefited.

 As indicated earlier, households that do not own their residences are often excluded from
  projects, even when they are clearly poor – a particular problem in peri-urban and informal
  settlements.

 The project in the Philippines was the only one for which an explicit effort was made to
  examine if beneficiary households met an income/consumption poverty test.

 Some projects (for example India) explicitly excluded very poor households on the
  grounds that did not have the capacity to pay existing water tariffs, even if their
  connections were subsidised

Some projects made changes in eligibility criteria during implementation.
 In Mozambique, with 18 months of the implementation period remaining, the
  implementing concessionaire requested an adjustment to the eligibility criteria for
  beneficiary households. The original criteria had been a positive list of housing
  characteristics – i.e., if a residence displayed a minimum number of criteria (for example,
  dirt floors, no exterior wall on the property, no paint finishes on the walls of the house) –
  which was seen to be eliminating households that should otherwise have benefitted from
  the program. Eligibility was revised to be a negative list of housing characteristics, the
  presence of at least three of which would disqualify a household. This appeared to ensure
  inclusion of more obviously poor households.

Others had problems with implementation of criteria.



                                          Page 28 of 66
 In Cameroon, there were considerable problems with respect to eligibility of connections
  being made by the implementer, and the ICR report argued that targeting was pragmatic
  but the eligibility criteria were not clear. This led to challenges in identifying connections
  that were eligible for the project subsidy, but the ICR concluded that the project did reach
  the targeted low-income households.

On balance, the targeting seems to have been reasonably efficient.


Experience with different types of service provider

GPOBA projects have worked with a range of service providers: public, private and
community based/NGO. The experience has been varied and no clear picture of a
preferred type of provider emerges.
 One clear test was in Vietnam, where the project worked with three different management
  models: privately designed and owned schemes, cooperatively owned schemes, and
  schemes owned and operated by Commune Peoples’ Committees. The grant recipient and
  project manager (an international NGO) surveyed schemes and found that the private
  schemes scored better on technical and financial performance and customer satisfaction.
  (It should be noted, however, that in this project, the grant recipient bore the pre- financing
  risk, which may have helped private operators.)
 In the Philippines, the private concessionaire performed very well. (It is worth noting that
  the concession agreement included strong incentives to achieve 100 per cent coverage of
  households in the concession area.)
 In Morocco, where there were private and publicly owned water system operators, there
  was no clear evidence of better performance by either type. (However, the strong
  commitment of the government to improving service access, and the way this was factored
  into government/operator interactions was an important factor.)
 In Honduras, both private and public service providers were involved, but the project
  tended to favour public providers, for whom financing was made available to them,
  whereas private operators had to source financing on their own.
 In Mozambique, the private sector utility operator’s performance was considered to be
  fairly weak (including a marked reluctance to connect poor households), and performance
  improved markedly after the utility was taken over by the state-owned asset holding
  company.
 In Indonesia, the public utility in Surabaya took on more performance risk than the private
  concessionaire in Jakarta, agreeing to receive the whole subsidy payment on evidence of
  both connections and 3 months of service delivery, compared to a 75-25 per cent split in
  the Jakarta project.

A recent review of results based financing in WASH argued that the case for using RBF with
public providers is weak because they lack a profit motive, and may lack the financial
flexibility to fund capital expenditures ahead of receiving RBF payments (Castalia 2015). The
experience with GPOBA’s portfolio does not really support this view, since a number of

                                         Page 29 of 66
public utilities and not-for-profit entities have been quite successful partners (for example,
Morocco, Honduras and India).

The key factors appear to be that operators have an incentive to recover costs, which
some non-private water service providers have, combined with a contractual or implicit
community service obligation. The pursuit of cost recovery encourages providers to
maximise capacity utilisation, which in turn can create an incentive to expand connections.
But poorer households typically consume less water, so they may be inherently less attractive
customers than wealthier households for network providers. Pro-poor connection subsidies
may not, therefore, of themselves provide sufficient incentive for operators to seek out poor
customers.

An important issue with regard to all types of partners is their ability to handle the
challenge of pre-financing. OBA was originally designed around formal private enterprises
with their own sources of finance. As the range of implementers has broadened to include
NGOs, CBOs and SMEs, the issue of access to finance and the capacity of the local financial
sector to adopt more innovative lending practices has risen to the surface, and/or the
desirability of OBA projects to include support to access finance. A number of projects
included - either by design or as a response to experience during implementation - measures
to assist implementers to access finance or to provide such finance.
 The project in Kenya delivered the project through a commercial financial institution
  specializing in micro-finance. That institution bore a share of the pre-financing risk, and
  also used its own resources to assist prospective implementers to access its financial
  products and provide pre-financing.
 The project in Honduras, delivered through a Social Investment Fund, provided financing
  to public sector implementers (through funds provided to the SIF by the government). It
  also provided 10 per cent of the projected subsidy payment at the time of contract signing.
 In Mozambique, the ICR observed that the private sector concessionaire operating in
  Maputo was facing severe cash constraints due in part to the nature of its concession
  contract with the Government.
 In Vietnam, the NGO that received the grant and managed the payment process for private
  operators, disbursed payments before receiving GPOBA clearance, since operators were
  unable to use the use the water systems as security for bank loan.
 In the Uganda rural growth centres project, subsidy payments were phased in, with 55
  percent of investment costs reimbursed against intermediate milestones and 45 percent of
  the subsidy paid on working connections and water delivered

At least one project implementer/recipient observed that the costs of pre-financing were
increased by the time taken by GPOBA to process payments:
 On average, the World Bank/GPOBA disbursements were received 79 days after the end
  of each quarter. Since connections were made on a continuous basis, the “average?
  connection was completed 45 days before the end of the quarter or four months before the
  corresponding disbursement was made. Furthermore, entity bearing the financing risk

      incurred the expenditures on planning, design, construction, and commissioning
      subprojects long before the completion of the household connections. This gives an
      average time-lag between expenditures and receipt of the GPOBA funds of around eight
      months—with GPOBA’s procedures accounting for roughly half of this time lag (Kumar
      et al, 2014).


ICR ratings

Table 3.4 presents the assessments of effectiveness made in the ICR reports for the seven
projects for which an ICR was prepared. One (Cameroon) was found to be moderately
unsatisfactory, and one (Mozambique) was found to be of low effectiveness assessed against
the original development objectives, but substantial against revised objectives set after a
considerable restructuring. The other five were rated satisfactory or higher.

 Effectiveness – summary of findings

 Overall, the portfolio of projects has been effective – across all projects, slightly more than
 100 per cent of target connections have been made, and only two projects fell significantly
 short of their targets. (OBA projects are intrinsically effective in converting aid inputs into
 outputs, because if outputs are not delivered, aid is not disbursed.)

 Unwarranted (in hindsight) optimism about sectoral reforms, and delivery of solutions to
 problems with the regulatory environment played a key role in those projects that fell well
 short of targets.

 All projects suffered delays, suggesting that GPOBA consistently under-estimated the
 challenges of implementation and over-estimated the capacities of grant recipients and
 service providers. Design flexibility was an important reason why delays did not translate
 into failure to deliver outputs.

 While the projects delivered connections, they do not seem to have uniformly tested if
 they only connected poor households, or that the poorest households were included in the
 program. Pragmatic selection of targeting methodologies has made necessary trade-offs
 between accuracy and cost of implementation necessary. Because all projects subsidised
 connection costs only, they would not have covered households that were unable to pay
 water tariffs.




Efficiency
Output-based aid aims to increase the efficiency of resource use in producing results
(compared to traditional input based aid) by exploiting the profit seeking/cost
minimising behaviour of commercially oriented service providers and transferring the
risk of non-performance. However, as recent studies have pointed out, the available data
cannot prove that GPOBA’s water projects are more efficient than alternatives (Castalia,
2015). Chart 3.5 reproduces data presented in the Castalia report - the best information that is
available on costs of service delivery across 8 GPOBA projects. Because there is so much
variation - within and between projects – in terms of investments required to deliver
connections and the type of connection supplied, it is not really meaningful to compare the
observed average unit costs per person.

However, two projects did generate data suggesting that connection and subsidy costs
were considerably lower than in similar schemes using traditional input-based
approaches. For Vietnam, a comparison of costs of connection under the GPOBA project and
similar government schemes suggested that project was much more cost-effective (Kumar et
al). And the ICR report for the Uganda small towns project presented data indicating that
subsidy costs per connection were much lower than for similar extension and green- field
projects in the country (World Bank, unpublished ICR Report). (This result in Uganda may
have been due in part to a unique feature in the design, by which sub-project implementers
bid, on the basis of desired overall subsidy, for the right to build and operate previously
selected water supply projects).

A further complication, which also applies to many traditional water supply projects, is
that individual projects will not necessarily include all of the expenditure required to
enable connections to be made or to make it feasible for commercial operators to engage
with connecting poor households. As section 2 has shown, many GPOBA projects built on
sectoral reforms, and others were predicated on investments in primary and secondary
infrastructure that was supported by other donor-funded projects. And in other cases, the
GPOBA projects were paralleled by extensive technical assistance and capacity-building
provided by other partners. This does not necessarily mean that the GPOBA projects were
relatively inefficient, just that direct comparison of unit cost data from water supply projects
does not shed much light on the question of efficiency.

The commercial imperative facing most OBA implementers creates a strong expectation
of efficiency. However the incentives faced by service providers depend very much on the
particular market and regulatory environment in which they operate. For example:
 For providers involved in some kind of PPP, the specific elements of the PPP agreement
  play an important role in shaping how private concessionaires and leaseholders respond to
  an opportunity to extend provision to poor households.
   – In the Cameroon project, where a public sector asset holding company (CAMWATER)
     was responsible for network investments, and a private implementer operating under an
     affermage agreement (CDE) was responsible for making and serving connections,
     problems arose because CAMWATER was not replenishing the fund set up to finance
     connections, and was slow in implementing network extensions required for some
     targeted connections.
   – In the Philippines project, the concessionaire was required by its contract to achieve
     100 per cent connectivity in its concession area - a strong incentive to utilise the
     GPOBA project since tariff rebasing under the contract was determined in part by
     progress in meeting connection targets.
   – In the Indonesia-Jakarta project, the concession agreement between the municipal
     government and the concessionaire provided for remuneration on the basis of the
     volume of water supplied, and not revenue collections: this diminished the
     concessionaires’ incentive to expand connections to low-income households which
     typically have low levels of consumption.
 The specifics of regulation of water supply –whether built into PPPS or more general
  sector-wide regulation, strongly affect responses. As an GPOBA working paper (Tremolet
  and Halpern, 2006) has pointed out, OBA aiming to provide water services to poor
  customers requires regulatory arrangements that provide:
   – incentives (or obligations) for utilities to extend services (a number of GPOBA projects
     encountered situations where utilities were prohibited from supplying to households in
     informal settlements – for example, Philippines, Morocco, Indonesia);
   – a tariff level and structure that fosters access without jeopardizing financial stability –
     this was not the case in the Indonesia project in Jakarta, as the above discussion shows;
   – a flexible approach to service quality in order to give incentives to service providers to
     experiment and to cut costs while respecting basic quality requirements (an important
     issue here is the need to match quality standards to people’s requirements, and to the
     ability of regulatory agencies to enforce such standards);
   – a competition framework which allows a wide range of service providers, including the
     main utility and alternative service providers to compete on a level playing field (there
     is often tension because network suppliers operate in a world of economies of scale,
     and struggle to be financially viable where people have access to alternative sources of
     supply: but at the same time there are significant risks in restricting the operation of
     alternative suppliers when network performance is not assured); and

      – mechanisms to address complaints from all customers, including the most
        marginalized.


Economic returns

Economic analyses undertaken in project ICRs suggest that some GPOBA some projects
have been economically efficient. As figure 3.6 shows, for those projects where an EIRR has
been reported, the rates of return vary from 31 per cent (Cameroon) to 126 per cent
(Philippines): significantly higher than the standard discount rates employed by the Bank (10
or 12 per cent). Even a project whose outcomes were rated by its ICR as moderately
unsatisfactory (Cameroon) had an EIRR of 46 per cent.

These estimates reflect the significant benefits from providing access to safe and convenient
water – they do not necessarily imply that the OBA modality is intrinsically efficient. The
available ICRs do not provide enough information to draw conclusions about the
administrative efficiency of OBA in water: but the prevalence of start-up delays and slow
rates of disbursement suggest that the projects have challenged administrative capacities in
some countries. The unpublished ICR for the Uganda small towns project observed that the
share of the total project subsidy taken by advisory and financial intermediary costs was
higher (12 per cent) than for traditional input based projects (4-8 per cent.)


IVA mechanisms

Independent verification is a critical element of all OBA, helping as it does to enhance
the performance of service providers and to mitigate the risks of misuse of funds. In
GPOBA’s water portfolio, independent verification agencies (IVAs) have been engaged to


                                                          Page 35 of 66
certify that contractual outputs have been delivered, and to verify service providers’
reimbursement requests. IVA activities have involved validating documentation, carrying out
sample or full physical checks, and in some cases advising grant recipients and service
providers on technical, managerial and financial issues. In most projects, the IVA was
contracted to the grant recipient: but in Vietnam and Morocco, the IVA was contracted
directly to the World Bank. In at least one project (Honduras), the initial expectation at the
design stage was that a government regulatory agency could take on the role, but in all
projects local or internationally linked consulting and engineering firms performed the IVA
function.

In projects where an ICR has been produced, IVA activities, where assessed, have
generally been considered to be satisfactory. ICRs have also stressed the importance of
contracting the IVA at the outset of the project. (In Cameroon, for example, there was a 24
month delay after credit effectiveness in recruiting an IVA.) In some cases, IVA processes
have caused some delays in disbursement in initial phases of projects, but this has usually
been rectified as service providers’ record keeping systems have become better aligned with
OBA requirements. Where interactions over reimbursements caused considerable delays, the
issue seemed to be more one of lack of clarity in eligibility criteria for reimbursement, and
lack of capacity in service providers and their systems (problems with project preparation and
design), rather than one of IVA performance. ICRs also report that a number of IVAs offered
useful assistance and advice to project implementers, as well as fulfilling their main
verification task.

On average, for those projects where information is available, the cost of IVA activities
have amounted to just under 3 per cent of total project costs, and just over 6 per cent of
GPOBA grant amounts (table 3.7). As the table shows, the share of grant amounts varied
between 1.8 and 12.9 per cent, but the share of total project cost ranged between 0.3 and 6.3
per cent.

 Efficiency – summary of findings

 The available evidence suggests that GPOBA projects are economically efficient. but it is
 not possible to draw a definitive conclusion as to whether OBA produces lower costs than
 traditional approaches - there is not enough directly comparable data. That said, at least
 two projects provided evidence that costs – overall project costs and subsidy costs – were
 considerably lower than for traditional projects.

 OBA is clearly an efficient use of aid, since it is only disbursed if outputs are delivered,
 and IVAs are clearly able to verify output delivery in water supply. What is not so clear is
 if it is an efficient use of resources, given that it does impose additional administrative
 costs – some, such as the verification agency, borne by the OBA grant, others, such as
 compliance with eligibility criteria, borne by implementers. And determining suitable
 locations and/or the appropriate connection subsidy may require considerable analysis of
 local conditions. (The difficulty in reaching a judgment on the basis of GPOBA’s portfolio
 is compounded by the fact that the projects have all been relatively small – so there has
 been no test of whether there are economies of scale in the OBA approach in water.)

 The ICR reports that have been prepared (8 in all) have rated the efficiency of projects as
 moderately satisfactory or higher.

 So far, IVA functions have not been delivered by national monitoring and regulatory
 agencies, limiting the extent to which GPOBA projects comply with aid effectiveness
 goals. This suggests a need for complementary efforts to build national government
 capabilities if OBA approaches are to be effectively scaled up.




Impact and sustainability

Impact

Ideally OBA projects should be designed to ensure a close linkage between targeted
outputs and the desired impacts. In the case of any project delivering access to safer and
more convenient water, the impacts are typically improved well-being of poor people from
the reduced burden of water-borne disease and time savings associated with collecting
household water. Most analyses of the impacts of access to improved water indicate that time
savings are a very significant driver of the economic benefits, along with increased
consumption of clean water (WHO 2012b). Unless the water is consistently potable, it may
still require some kind of treatment to deliver all of the potential health benefits – although the
increased availability of clean water may have indirect health benefits if it discourages
consumption of untreated water from other sources (especially ground water). Provision of
water through piped water systems, as all GPOBA project have done, has a high probability of
generating savings benefits, and of providing water that is clean, if not necessarily potable. As
table 3.9 shows, where water provided is potable both time and health related benefits can be


                                          Page 38 of 66
significant. These benefits are only achieved, however, if the water system continues to
operate after project completion – and there is evidence that traditional projects do not always
achieve this (Sy et al, 2014).

All of the GPOBA projects have required evidence that connections subsidised by the
project are still delivering services after installation – some projects requiring evidence
of 3 months consumption, others 6 months. This goes some way to ensuring that impacts
are likely to be delivered. (This compares with some piped water projects built using
traditional methods, where actual consumption from the scheme is much lower than expected
at design stage – a detailed study of rural water systems in Andhra Pradesh, Burkina Faso,
Ghana and Mozambique found that piped systems are frequently under-used, partly because
of chronic unreliability of the infrastructure (Burr and Fonseca, 2013).

Some projects have also required evidence of service quality. For example, the Philippines
project’s criteria for disbursement included evidence of 24 hour availability of water, and the
Morocco project required evidence of connections meeting service quality standard
incorporated in concessionaires’ agreements.

The extent of impact on poor people is not only a function of the availability of piped
water, but also of the extent to which people consume it in place of water from less safe
sources. Some GPOBA projects have monitored levels of consumption by beneficiary
households. Consumption is likely to be most strongly affected by price, but reliability of
supply may also be a factor. Because of their small size, few GPOBA projects have had a
post-project beneficiary survey to examine actual consumption. Available data from ICRs and
other reports indicates that in:
 India, 98 per cent of beneficiary households were still using the project’s water after
  closure;
 Morocco, a survey conducted 27 months after closure showed that all beneficiaries
  surveyed were consuming well over the 40 litres per capita per day target;
 Mozambique, a survey shortly after closure indicated that 84 per cent of surveyed
  beneficiary households had water every day, and average daily consumption of all
  beneficiary households surveyed was over 40 litres per capita per day, compared to 31
  litres for non-beneficiary households; and

                                                    Page 39 of 66
 Uganda, a study reported by UNDP found that reliability of water supply was affecting
  beneficiary consumption of water from GPOBA supported schemes: this was primarily
  due to problems with the water source (Bayliss and Watasa, 2011).


Sustainability

Most GPOBA water projects have closed quite recently, and it is rather soon to be able
to assess actual long term continuation of benefits. However, some documentation,
including ICRs offer judgements about potential sustainability. As table 3.10 shows, final
Grant Review and Monitoring reports and ICRs generally concluded that projects’ outcomes
were likely to be sustainable. However, it is far from clear that a comparable and objective set
of criteria have been used to support these judgments.

In principle, the fact that all projects required evidence of 3 to 6 months of service
delivery, and that customers received and paid bills for the service, suggests that some of
the pre-conditions for sustainability may have been met, at least initially. If tariffs have
been set to at least cover operation and maintenance costs, which appears to be the case, then
the prospects of financial sustainability are also positive.

Some projects undertook more formal assessments of potential sustainability. As box
3.11 shows, the IVA for the Vietnam project undertook a detailed assessment, which
supported a view that projects implemented by the private sector were more likely to be
sustainable. The appropriateness of some ICR/GRM ratings has been indirectly queried – for
example the UNDP study on aspects of the Uganda small towns project found that a number
of sub-projects were quite severely affected by lack of water, due to unsustainability of the
water source.

 3.11 Sustainability of sub-projects in Vietnam

 In Vietnam, the IVA conducted a long term sustainability assessment, which was based on
 the following criteria: (i) quality/adequacy of the feasibility study, project design; (ii)
 design/performance and condition of water treatment/water supply infrastructure; (iii)
 quality of documentation (record keeping) by scheme operator; (iv) adequacy of O&M by
 scheme operator; (v) financial stability/vulnerability as an enterprise; and (vi) level of
 customer use as measured by consumption and customer satisfaction. The results indicated
 that 85 per cent of schemes in the Mekong Delta (where private operators were involved)
 were considered to be operating in a satisfactory manner and were at low risk of decline.
 In the Central region, where community and commune Peoples’ Committees built and
 operated the schemes, 58 per cent of schemes were found to be operating in a satisfactory
 manner. Overall, 28 per cent of schemes were found to be at high risk of decline and
 increased probability of failure.

Across the portfolio, experience has demonstrated that a wide range of factors bear on
sustainability, and that their relative force is very context-specific. For example:
 In Vietnam, a significant threat to sustainability came from project design, as the ICR
  pointed out that improper scoping and feasibility for some systems led to development of
  schemes with: (i) inappropriate choice of treatment technology (technical specification and
  tailoring to local context); (ii) limited consideration for seasonal fluctuations or climate
  variability, which rendered established schemes obsolete and as result additional
  investment to identify new water sources was needed; (iii) miscalculation of water quality
  during dry or rainy seasons, which affected technology options; (iv) lack of consideration
  of power supply in the development of water schemes, which created problems during
  operation; and (v) demand calculations that were significantly higher than actual use,
  which led to overdesign of system and affected recovery of O&M costs.
   – In turn this seemed to be closely related to the nature of project proponents – design
     related problems seemed to be greater with community and local government owned
     systems.
 In Cameroon and Mozambique, threats came from incomplete implementation of
  structural reforms, which inhibited private operators’ ability to deliver sustainable water
  systems.
 In Uganda, a threat came from inadequate assessment of water sources, and inadequate
  system design to deal with water and energy challenges.

 Impact and sustainability – summary of findings

 The theory underpinning the case for providing households with access to piped water
 underpins a judgment that GPOBA projects are likely to be having a significant impact on
 beneficiary households. This judgment is supported by economic analysis carried out for
 project ICRs.

 Long term sustainability of project benefits has not been demonstrated – mainly because
 projects have only recently closed, and there have not yet been specific studies of medium
 term benefit delivery. However, there is reason to believe that a number of sub-projects are
 likely to be sustainable because of evidence of financial viability of operators.




The portfolio as a set of pilots: mainstreaming and scaleablity
A pilot program is more than the sum of its projects. A question which this review of
GPOBA’s water portfolio must address is whether it has met the objectives for testing the
applicability of the OBA approach to water, and whether OBA can make service delivery to
the poor more effective, accountable, and transparent, and can increase involvement of the
private sector. A related question concerns the evidence generated about the feasibility of
mainstreaming and scaling up OBA approaches in the sector.

As a piloting program, the portfolio has been more opportunistic than carefully planned
to test OBA in all conceivable water supply challenges.
 It has focused on piped water systems, even though the private sector is heavily involved
  in other service modalities (point sources, such as household tubewells).
 It has taken advantage of extensive World Bank group engagement, not only where that
  has created pre-conditions for an incentive-based approach to work (as in structural and
  regulatory reform), but also in technical assistance to build capacity in potential service
  providers and receptiveness in financial systems.

However, as Chapter 2 has shown, the portfolio has worked across a wide range of
country, sectoral and policy contexts, with a mixture of private, public, non-government
and community service providers, and with a mix of network service delivery modalities.
The portfolio demonstrates that OBA can work in a variety of contexts, but that considerable
effort has to be devoted to tailoring design to those contexts.

The available data indicates that OBA projects are both effective and efficient: but does
not tell us definitively if they are more effective and efficient than alternative
approaches.

By tying disbursements to evidence of service delivery as well as completion of
infrastructure and connections, the OBA projects have gone further than many
traditional projects in ensuring that the project does deliver the intended services.


                                         Page 43 of 66
Again, there is not enough data at this stage to say if projects deliver impacts that are
sustainable in the medium to long term.

Some projects have leverage additional resources from the private sector: but the larger
amounts of additional resources appear to have come from the public sector,
communities and beneficiaries. As table 3.12 indicates, around $46.2 million was leveraged
by GPOBA subsidies amounting to $32.8 million.

The projects where there was clearly leveraging of private sector resources (beyond
household contributions) were in Honduras, India, Morocco, the Philippines, Uganda
and Vietnam.
 In Honduras, the total OBA subsidy leverage of $4 million leverage an additional $3
  million from communities, municipalities, other donors, implementers and service
  providers – some of the latter were private sector entities.
 In India, the project – with a grant of $0.834 million mobilised $0.17 million of
  community contributions and $0.19 million of commercial loans (World Bank 2011).

 The project in Morocco is reported to have leverage $30 million of investment from a $7
  million grant (GPOBA 2014d). The additional funds are likely to have come from a mix of
  private and public sources, given that there were both private and public concessionaires
  participating in the scheme.
 In the project in the Philippines, the participating private concessionaire financed capital
  expenditure worth roughly 4 times the value of the subsidy ($1.19 million) provided by the
  project (World Bank 2013).
 In Uganda, in the small towns project, a total subsidy of $1.9 million leveraged additional
  private investment of $0.89 million (unpublished ICR.
 In Vietnam, in the Mekong Delta private investors contributed around $0.6 million to
  match the $1.5 million of OBA grant and $0.25 in household connection fees, whereas in
  the Central region, where projects were implemented by communities and local
  governments, project beneficiaries contributed $0.3 million in connection charges and
  $0.38 million in labour to match $3 million in OBA grant (Kumar et al).

In Kenya, while additional contributions came ultimately from local communities, a
commercial bank provided $3.4 million in loans (GPOBA 2014c).

A key test of the piloting is whether the projects have stimulated follow-on projects that
embrace and OBA approach. In this regard, there have been some notable developments.
 In Kenya the World Bank and GPOBA are scaling up the pilot with funding from the
  Swedish development agency, Sida, to test the model in urban areas. A grant of $11.70
  million will help county water services providers to access loans from local lenders to
  finance utility and water and sanitation subprojects, with OBA subsidies supporting access
  for low-income households. The grant, which became effective in December 2014, is
  managed by the Water Services Trust Fund of Kenya, a government fund for pro-poor
  investments in water and sanitation.
 In the Philippines the concessionaire implementing the project is reported to be building
  OBA approaches into its program for extending access to poor households.
 In Vietnam the Australian aid program is planning to use OBA to offer partial subsidies
  for rural water supply for poor households, using local agencies as IVAs, technical quality
  evaluators, and private firms to build systems.
 In Indonesia the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and AusAID supported an innovative
  (Hibah) program, piloting an output-based funding mechanism for water and sanitation
  activities in Indonesia. The program built on the GPOBA projects. The Water and
  Sanitation Hibah Program operates by paying an agreed amount for verified connections
  of households to water or sanitation services, installed by local water and sanitation
  utilities. It was being implemented by GoI with support from the Indonesian Infrastructure
  Facility, on behalf of GoI and AusAID. An $80 million scale up was planned for 2012
  onwards.




                                        Page 45 of 66
 In Morocco the Bank’s recently approved Rural Water Supply project appears to build on
  experiences with the GPOBA project and will include use of OBA approaches in the
  component aiming at increasing household connections.
 In Uganda, local operators are reported to be successfully implementing an OBA
  approach.

These developments show that the OBA approach in water can be extended: but there
are limits to what they indicate about the scope for larger scale OBA projects in the
sector. OBA has only been trialled in circumstances where relatively small scale investment
to extend or build piped water networks is a viable solution to water supply. As indicated in
the foregoing discussion, calibration of a connection subsidy is a critical feature of GPOBA’s
water designs. However, the level of subsidy that is appropriate will vary considerably across
locations, and across the circumstances of target communities, so pursuing scale through
expanding geographical coverage may not offer too many economies in project preparation.
OBA cannot substitute for sectoral reform, nor, without arrangements for further subsidisation
of water tariffs, can it address the issue of the very poor who cannot pay consumption
charges. Further, the need for providers to pre-finance investments and services remains a
challenge in countries where financial systems are reluctant to finance water projects,
especially smaller scale regional projects. As the Kenya project has shown, extensive
technical assistance is needed to facilitate commercial provision of finance to small-scale
water projects, even working with a bank with extensive micro-finance experience.

Scaling up may require modification to the OBA approach. The pre-financing problem may
be addressed by in part by providing some share of subsidies during construction - this was
the experience in the Uganda small-towns project, or as in Kenya by constructing guarantee
schemes with donor support. The scope for scaling up may be greater if local systems can be
used, as in the output-based disbursement approach used in the Surabaya Hibah project ( in
this regard, GPOBA is currently implementing a technical assistance project aimed at training
public auditors in verification in the water sector (GPOBA 2015).


Conclusion
The information presented in this chapter suggests that the water portfolio has been
successful in demonstrating that OBA can work in helping improve the access of poor
people to water through piped water networks. But it also demonstrates that success is
dependent on some key pre-conditions in those parts of the water sector where the project is
operating, and that developing effective designs requires considerable effort.
 OBA projects are more likely to succeed where country capability and the overall
  environment for providing access to basic services are strong. Similarly a sectoral and
  business environment in which service providers can respond to financial incentives is of
  paramount importance.
 Careful preparation and flexible designs (and hence thoughtful supervision) are pre-

4 Overall conclusions and recommendations



This review of GPOBA’s 12 completed water projects shows that OBA is a feasible
approach to the challenge of improving the access of poor people to safer water,
provided some important preconditions are met.
 OBA can work in very wide range of country and sectoral contexts, with service
  providers in the public, private and NGO/CBO sectors, in urban, peri-urban and
  rural locations, and where services are delivered through many modalities. Projects
  have worked successfully with public utilities, private concessionaires and firms operating
  under lease and affermage arrangements, with small enterprises and non-government, not-
  for-profit service providers, and with service delivery through infill and expansion
  connections to existing large-scale networks to construction of whole green-field and
  brown-field small-scale systems, and using household connections, public water points
  and water kiosks. However, in many cases, projects have only become feasible because of
  prior structural and regulatory reforms in the water sector that enable commercially
  oriented (or at least cost-minimising) operators to play a role in water supply.
 OBA is effective in delivering water to poor households through connections to piped
  water systems. OBA projects are intrinsically effective in converting aid inputs into
  outputs, since there is no disbursement without evidence that outputs have been delivered.
  The portfolio has not included work with other forms of water supply (such as household
  tubewells) – which in any case may be amenable to effective subsidisation using
  traditional project modalities.
 OBA can be deliver impressive economic rates of return. But there is no information to
  support a conclusion that it is more cost-effective than other kinds of aid, when total costs
  are considered – water projects that work typically do deliver good returns.
 There are reasonable prospects that OBA projects are sustainable, but further work
  is required to test this proposition.

However, because OBA is predicated on service providers and consumers being able to
respond to price related incentives, projects require a policy and regulatory environment that
facilitates such a response – both at the sectoral level, and at the level of the broader business
enabling environment. And they require careful design work and a thorough understanding of
the drivers of the market for water created by poor households.

Conclusions
With respect to the research questions addressed by this study, we can say that:

GPOBA’s portfolio of pilots in water supply have demonstrated that OBA is a feasible
modality for development assistance aimed at helping meet the Sustainable Development
Agenda’s water access objectives. The portfolio has shown that:
 OBA can deliver water to poor people in a wide range of country contexts with varied
  institutional structures, policy environments and capabilities.
 OBA can work with the more complex modalities of water supply, and in all kinds of
  localities. The pilots have only worked with piped water systems – delivering water
  through household, yard tap and pubic water point connections, in urban, peri-urban, small
  town and rural areas: but this is probably the way of the future if potable water is to be
  conveniently supplied to large numbers of people currently without access.
 OBA can leverage additional resources – not only from households but from communities,
  state enterprises, governments and the private sector.

There is no single formula for successful OBA projects - designs have to take account of
the presence or absence of certain pre-conditions in the water sector, and in those parts
of the sector where the project may engage, as well as the broader business environment.


The enabling environment

The experience of the GPOBA water portfolio has illustrated the importance of certain
elements of the enabling environment for OBA in the sector.
 Clearly, a regulatory framework that allows commercially oriented service providers
  to respond to price/subsidy related incentives is important. This includes regulation
  of tariff structures that support financial sustainability, licensing and certification that
  allow competition and entry while ensuring adequate safeguards are enforced. The
  capacity of regulatory institutions can be as important as the quality of the regulatory
  policies for which they are responsible.
 Where utilities are chosen as implementing agencies, the nature of their agreements
  with government, and the adequacy of funding of expenditures on infrastructure on
  which OBA projects may depend can be critical. This is true of public and privately
  owned utilities. It may also be the case that additional incentives - such as service
  obligations built into agreements with governments – may be necessary to persuade
  utilities to engage with providing access to the poor, since these are likely to be less
  profitable customers and provide lower rates of return on outlays than serving higher
  income customers.
 Regulations affecting network construction and providing connections can also be
  very important. Planning regulations may need to be modified to allow poor people in


                                         Page 49 of 66
   informal settlements to be connected to networks, and access to rights of way and land for
   network structures may need to be clarified and supported by the relevant level of
   government.
 Where small scale local service providers are to be utilised, projects also have to be
  assured that certain features of the business environment are in place. This may
  include:
   – financial products that allow SME water investors to manage pre-financing;
   – a business support sector that can help SMEs achieve the formalities required to
     borrow and to meet water sector licensing requirements;
   – an efficient water services sector that enables investors access to competitive services,
     such as site-surveying, well-drilling, component purchasing;
 Targeted communities have to have the willingness and ability to pay for water
  provided by OBA funded schemes. Project designs must address the type of services that
  poor households most value, and ensure that target communities buy-in to the benefits of
  paying cost-recovering tariffs for safe water.

This in turn means that designs have to draw on a thorough understanding of the
context in which projects have to operate, and be sufficiently flexible to adapt as issue
arise and more knowledge is gained.

Lessons
Key lessons emerging from this review with respect to the use of OBA in water supply
for the poor are:
 Various targeting mechanisms exist to include the poor. Project designs may have to
  make a trade-off between accuracy in selecting poor households and costs imposed in
  implementing the targeting scheme. Many projects used geographic targeting because
  more specific targeting is too difficult, but this can mean that an unknown number of less-
  poor households benefit from the subsidy. (At the same time, differentiating between
  households in small tightly knit communities may be a source of friction that can impede
  project implementation.)
 The characteristics of demand have to be thoroughly assessed. In urban and peri-urban
  locations, poor people often pay much more for water than they would if they had access
  to piped water, but connection fees, concerns about water and service quality, and lack of
  title may deter people from seeking connections. In rural areas, poor households often
  have access to very low cost sources of water (for example seasonal access to rain water
  for in-house uses, surface water for out-of-house uses or access to neighbour’s
  groundwater pumps). Where demand has been inadequately assessed, suppliers have
  encountered problems in covering costs. Further, different communities have different
  preferences for supply modalities: in Honduras, the project assumed there would be
  demand for yard taps, but people wanted, and would pay for, house connections. In
  Uganda the Kampala found that people preferred public water points to yard taps, which
  the project was originally expected to supply.
 For rural and small town water supply projects, considerable preparatory analysis
  may be required to identify suitable sites for projects, and to determine likely
  investment costs so that feasible subsidy arrangements can be devised.
 It is important to ensure that there is clear ownership and commitment to
  prior/contemporaneous sectoral reforms on which the OBA approach is predicated,
  and that government agencies have the capacity to perform functions that are
  necessary for the project. In Cameroon, the Government failed to comply with financial
  agreements under its contract with the concessionaire that was implementing the project,
  constraining ability to pre-finance connections and in Mozambique, concession contracts
  could not be signed for four target cities, so that the project had to be restructured to focus
  on Maputo only. In Honduras, the government agency earmarked to verify outputs proved
  too weak to take on the task.
 Project designers must ensure that sectoral regulation facilitates subsidised provision
  by implementers best equipped to reach targeted households. This includes regulation
  surrounding licensing of water supply schemes, registration of providers, and providing
  operators with exclusive rights of supply in the project area (which is a typical pre-
  requisite for commercial financing). It also means that agreements under PPPs do not
  discourage operators from expanding connections to poor households.




                                         Page 51 of 66
 Project designs need clear sequencing of components and need to be based on
  adequate preparatory work to assure, for example, the adequacy of water sources for
  sub-projects, and that there is reliable funding for any pre-requisite investment in
  network extension that is not covered by the project. Designs must be flexible,
  supervision adequately resourced, and information systems need to provide data for
  monitoring and to enable mid-course corrections. Design processes also need to clearly
  identify risks and their allocation, and identify mitigation measures up front.
 Sub-project selection procedures should avoid creating biases against serving the
  very poor that live in remote or scattered locations. In addition, care should be taken to
  ensure that competitive bidding on the basis of expected subsidy does not discriminate
  against serving localities where water extraction costs are high.
 Access to finance is a critical ingredient of successful OBA, but in many developing
  countries, local enterprises can struggle to mobilise finance for water supply projects.
  As the Kenya project demonstrated, in countries with a financial system that is active in
  financing small scale projects, support from development partners can lead to the
  development of appropriate lending financing instruments. However, more innovation and
  engagement is required if OBA is to be successful in facilitating water supply to rural and
  small-town households through smaller scale projects.
 Land tenure issues can negatively affect outcomes. Many poor people do not have
  formal title to the land on which they reside, and this may make it difficult to reach key
  beneficiaries. This can occur because sectoral regulations prohibit utilities from
  connecting households that do not have property titles, or because suppliers are unable to
  secure rights of way for distribution networks or land for infrastructure. It can also occur
  because without security of tenure, households (or landlords) are unwilling to make
  investments.
 Social marketing and education can increase demand and service provider revenues -
  in fact they may be a precondition for successful projects given the risks that
  providers face in an OBA project.
 Funding for technical support to small municipalities and implementers will increase
  project quality and speed of implementation. In many cases, these groups have only
  experience in O&M, not in project design and construction, and often not in financial
  management. Technical support to make a business case to sources of finance can also be
  valuable.
 Tariff structures need to match the poor’s ability to pay while also achieving cost-
  recovery. OBA projects have subsidised connection costs, but not ongoing payments for
  consumption. Tariff structures are usually determined externally to the project, so
  designers need to make sure that these structures are designed to reflect the poor’s ability
  to pay, while not jeopardising financial viability. Because poor households often have
  relatively low levels of consumption of network-supplied water, fully commercial network
  operators (such as concessionaires) may still need an additional incentive to invest in
  serving such households, as they may be less profitable than other consumers. This can,
  for example, take the form of performance obligations in concession or license agreements

                                         Page 52 of 66
 In some cases subsidies can leverage commercial financing from banks to make pro-
  poor investments viable and attract equity from communities to invest in their own
  future. However, in many developing countries, much work needs to be done to help
  banks consider financing small scale water projects.
 It is important to ensure that there is sufficient water to serve additional connections.
  This may be an issue if there is significant seasonal variability (typically an issue for rural
  systems), or if there has been insufficient upstream investment in reticulation/pumping
  systems (as has happened with some urban projects).
 Independent verification of delivery is a critical feature of successful OBA. But none
  of the projects were able to use national systems to undertake this function, even though in
  at least one case this was considered in the early stages of design. It is not possible to
  determine if the use of an IVA adds disproportionately to the transaction costs associated
  with OBA versus traditional approaches.
    GPOBA’s portfolio has helped governments and a range of interested parties in the
    private and NGO sectors to assess the benefit and feasibility of OBA approaches, and
    played a role in the broader adoption of OBA and related forms of result-based
    financing. However, more work may be required to translate a portfolio of pilots into
    mainstream use of OBA – this is discussed in the following recommendations.


Recommendations
Recommendations arising from this review are:
 GPOBA should intensify its dissemination and outreach activities with regard to the
  experience and lessons of its water portfolio to promote better understanding of the
  potential for OBA.
 GPOBA should undertake a program of post-project surveys to test sustainability of
  its portfolio outcomes. In principle, since all projects required evidence of a period of
  service delivery in which households received water meeting acceptable service standards
  and for which they were billed and made payments, and service providers were receiving
  revenues that covered O&M costs, it would appear that some of the key software and
  cultural elements for sustainable supply were put in place. It would be important to test if
  these circumstances continue to apply: if so, the pilot will have demonstrated that OBA
  can do better than many traditional water supply projects.
 Having demonstrated that OBA can deliver water to poor households if certain
  conditions are met, it would be appropriate to focus further work on addressing
  situations where the conditions are not met. This would involve working with other
  partners to address issues of access to finance for water projects, and ensuring that sectoral
  and business regulations facilitate rather than hinder provision of water to poor
  households. It would also involve experimenting with designs aimed at serving harder to
  reach poor households – either in urban and peri-urban informal settlements, or in more
  remote and scattered rural communities.

 GPOBA and the WBG should continue to pursue opportunities for integrating OBA
  approaches into larger, long term water sector investment and reform projects to
  consider embedding OBA approaches into traditional investment and sectoral
  reform projects. This not only helps to ensure that necessary sectoral and business
  environment pre-conditions are met for successful OBA, but also helps ensure that larger
  projects continue to have a credible pro-poor contribution. This may also require
  coordination with other development partners who may be able to work with parallel
  challenges, such as implementing solutions to the pre-financing problem.
 GPOBA and partners should also extend piloting to other forms of results-based
  financing that may be applicable within sector-wide engagements and that make
  greater use of national systems. In particular, GPOBA should consider working with
  other donors to develop output-based disbursement projects, given that it has been
  successfully adopted following at least one OBA pilot (in Indonesia). This could also
  involve experimenting with modifications to ‘pure’ OBA models to ease the pre-financing
  problem for small enterprises, by disbursing part of the subsidy on completion of steps
  prior to final output delivery and to incorporate water quality standards into monitored
  results.
 GPOBA should work with partners to test the circumstances when OBA or related
  forms of result-based financing can be scaled up, and if there are economies of scale
  in OBA-based support for water supply.

A SDGs and water



In September 2015, heads of member states of the United Nations formally adopted the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. Building on the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), the agenda expands the MDG focus on poverty reduction to now cover all aspects of
sustainable development in all countries of the world.

Among the 17 goals enunciated in the Agenda is a goal specifically dedicated to water and
sanitation – Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims to ‘ensure availability and
sustainability of water and sanitation for all’ (UNWater 2105). SDG6 expands the prior focus
on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the
management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. Within the goal, three targets
focus directly on safe water issues:
 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for
  all.
 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and
  minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of
  untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
 By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure
  sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and
  substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.

A set of indicators is being developed to enable countries to track performance. For water
access, the indicators is the Percentage of Population Using Safely Managed Water Services,
by Urban/Rural. It can be accompanied by complementary national indicators for drinking
water access for schools and hospitals.

In 2012, when the UN declared that the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number
of people without access to safe water had been met, an estimated 762 million people were
still without this access. Between 2012 and 2030, some 2.1 billion people will need to be
provided access to meet the SDG6 goal. While the 80 per cent of people without access in
2012 lived in rural areas, the majority (70 per cent) of the 2.1 billion needing access by 230
are likely to live in urban areas.

A.1 Number of additional people who will need safe water by 2030




Note: Calculated as the estimated population in 2030, less the estimated population with access to improved water in 2012
Data source: UN population projections, World Development Indicator urban and rural water access data


As figure A.1 shows, just under 40 per cent of these people will be in Sub-Saharan Africa,
and three quarters will be in countries currently classified as low and lower middle income.

It is important to note that these estimates may understate the task involved in meeting SDG
6. The MDGs used a concept of ‘safe’ water which related to access to an ‘improved’ water
source, where an improved water source is one which is by nature of its construction or
through active intervention, is likely to be protected from outside contamination, in particular
from contamination with fecal matter. Water from an improved source is not necessarily safe
to drink – it may still be affected by microbial or chemical contaminations (Bain et al 2014).
The Joint Monitoring Program of UNICEF and WHO has proposed that performance against
the access component of SDG be measured according to the percentage of the population
using an improved water source with is located on premises, available when needed and free
of faecal (and priority chemical) contamination. Meeting SDG 6 using this indicator will
require an escalation in the provision of water by piped networks, the kind of delivery
mechanism on which the GPOBA portfolio has focused, and strengthening mechanisms to
ensure water quality. The emphasis placed on equitable access also creates continued space
for smart subsidy arrangements, which OBA can deliver.

B GPOBA and Output-Based Aid



GPOBA is a global partnership administered by the World Bank. Created in 2003 by the
United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and the World Bank,
GPOBA designs, funds, tests, and documents pilot projects using OBA and other RBF
approaches. In addition to DFID, GPOBA’s current donors include the Australian Department
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Dutch Directorate-General for International
Cooperation (DGIS), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Originally designed to help prepare
OBA projects and document and disseminate lessons learned, GPOBA began funding subsidy
schemes in 2006.

GPOBA’s mandate is to fund, design, demonstrate and document output-based approaches to
improve the delivery of basic services to the poor. Its vision is to increasingly incorporate
OBA into infrastructure and social sectors and to become a centre of expertise.

OBA approaches have been tested in every region and applied in six sectors, including
energy, water and sanitation, health, solid waste management, education, and information and
communication technology (ICT). OBA projects have taken a diversity of approaches, each
one with a unique design and financial model, incorporating lessons learned from previous
experiences.

Pilots have been implemented in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas, employing public and
private operators, public-private partnerships (PPPs), nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), and community organizations as implementing agencies and service providers.

As of September 2015, through a portfolio of 44 projects with $228 million in commitments
for subsidy funding and ongoing technical assistance activities, GPOBA is demonstrating that
OBA can deliver a diverse range of services and lasting results for the poor, reaching over 8
million beneficiaries. GPOBA’s goal is to mainstream OBA approaches within projects
carried out by other development practitioners, including developing country governments,
international financial institutions, bilateral donors, and private foundations.

Box B.1 describes GPOBA’s approach to OBA.




                                        Page 57 of 66
B.1 GPOBA’s approach to output-based aid

GPOBA defines Output-Based Aid (OBA) as “a strategy for applying public money,
through performance-based contracts, to subsidize the cost of delivering basic services and
target these on the poor. OBA involves the delegation of service delivery to an operating
entity, under arrangements that tie the disbursement of funding to pre-specified services or
outputs that are delivered.? A distinctive feature of output-based aid is that “outputs are
defined as closely to the desired outcome or impact as contractually possible.? Unlike
some other RBF schemes, GPOBA’s model not only pays after the specified service is
provided by the private vendor or public utility but also includes targeting in the design of
the project to include market segments that would otherwise not be profitable to serve;
GPOBA also hires Independent Verification Agents to monitor and verify the outputs.

C GPOBA water projects and Bank CAS
  performance



OBA projects are undertaken in response to client commitment. Project selection is guided by
the rationale for piloting OBA. Hence, GPOBA formed its portfolio assessing client demand
against the goal of piloting water supply modalities in diverse risk contexts – country risks,
sector risks and risks related to the capacity of the implementing partner.

A key feature of OBA is the transfer of project risk to the implementing partner, while not
redistributing country and sector risks. (As in a conventional input-based project, country and
sector risks are addressed in a variety of ways, including, when they emerge after project
approval, by project restructuring). This risk transfer empowers the implementer but also puts
more pressure to deliver and to target the poor. It is not unnatural for the implementing
partners to prefer a traditional input-based financing as opposed to Output-Based Aid.
Therefore, understanding the circumstances when the clients have demand for OBA and
welcome more project risk can lead to important insights.

This appendix reviews documentation on 14 GPOBA water projects in 11 countries. 12
projects are currently closed, one is still active (Kenya Water Scale-up) and one did not
progress to the grant agreement because of political instability (Water Access in Bangui,
Central African Republic).

The context in these 11 countries is thoroughly documented by the World Bank through
Country Partnership Strategies (CPS), their progress and completion reports. Prepared jointly
with the client government, these documents are clearly structured into “pillars? and are
independently rated for both the overall outcome and outcomes of every pillar. The rating is a
six-point scale: three shades of “unsatisfactory? (highly unsatisfactory or “HU?,
unsatisfactory or “U? and mostly unsatisfactory or “MU?) and three shades of “satisfactory?
(mostly satisfactory or “MS?, satisfactory or “S? and highly satisfactory or “HS?) (IEG,
2015).

Tables C.1 and C.2 present the results of an analysis of 22 CPSs with timelines overlapping
with GPOBA project design and implementation. Each of them has a reference to basic
services in one of the pillars, although the emphasis varies from very specifically access to
water to a broad goal of improved governance and service delivery.

Out of 13 rated CPSs that overlap with OBA design, only one CPS – for Vietnam – was rated
“S? for “access? pillar with a distinct record of the progress towards water access. Four CPS
“access? pillars were rated “MU? or lower. Eight “access? pillars were rated MS, mostly with
the caveats about difficulty to measure progress on service delivery to the poor. The rating of


                                         Page 59 of 66
“access? pillars of the subsequent CPSs (i.e., during OBA pilots) illustrates the challenge
further: six “MU? out of 10 CPSs for which the rating is available (Note that some Strategies
are still under implementation.)

From further analysis of CPSs it becomes apparent that firstly, OBA pilot countries had good
sectoral strategies and regulatory environment and secondly, there were challenges with
delivery of water access and targeting the poor. Even the best-performing Vietnam CPS for
2003-2006 was cautious about delivery of basic services to minorities in the rural areas, and
in the subsequent CPS for 2007-2011 the rating of the social inclusion pillar was lowered to
“MS? (see table C.1 for a summary).

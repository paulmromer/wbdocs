Preface
          Emerging economies, including Indonesia, witnessed a marked reduction in their
          current account balances in the aftermath of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, driven
          by a combination of stronger domestic demand relative to developed countries and
          international interest rates at historically low levels, which allowed emerging and
          developing countries to finance consumption and investment by borrowing from
          abroad relatively cheaply. Growing current account deficits caused financing
          concerns in a number of countries, especially given the perspective of raising global
          interest rates following normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies.
          Appropriate policy responses depend on the structure of the economy and on the
          underlying drivers of current account dynamics. Understanding these drivers, in
          conjunction with external developments, is therefore crucial.

          The current account balance can be seen in two different and informative ways. First,
          the current account balance can expressed as the difference between the value of
          imports and exports of goods and services plus net factor payments and net transfers.
          As the trade balance tends to be the largest component of the current account, a
          current account deficit generally implies a trade deficit, although this need not be the
          case as countries also earn and pay income and send and receive transfers, most
          commonly in the form of interest and dividends and remittances. Second, the current
          account balance can also expressed as the difference between national saving and
          investment (both public and private). As such, the current account balance indicates
          the change in a country’s position as international net debtor or creditor.

          Although there is no strictly preferable current account position, certain positions are
          more consistent than others with a country’s stage of development. Developing
          countries tend to be net borrowers because, with less abundant capital, their
          economies offer higher returns to investment relative to those in developed
          economies. Particularly large current account deficits, however, may indicate that the
          economy is overheating, and may make the economy vulnerable to shocks.

          In this context, the World Bank’s Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice
          developed a toolkit to better understand the underlying drivers of current account
          imbalances, the financing structure of such imbalances, as well as their medium-term
          sustainability. The key objective of this toolkit is to provide policymakers with the
          deeper understanding of the issue which is necessary to formulate effective policy
          responses.

          The toolkit applies an innovative methodology that constitutes an improvement to
          existing frameworks used to examine external imbalances. The approach is country-
          focused. Rather than relying on cross-country panel estimations, the models are
          country-specific, which increases the policy-relevance of its conclusions. The “model-
          averaging” methodology used, in addition, addresses the frequently overlooked
          problem of uncertainty with respect to the true model that best describes the
          determination of the current account balance. 1



          1   In this context, model averaging means that different combinations of the potential current account determinants
              are used as models. The final estimate is obtained by averaging across all the estimated regressions using a suitable
              criterion to select model weights.
This report looks at the case of Indonesia through the lens of this toolkit. It aims to
inform policy by shedding light on the drivers of its current account dynamics and
the sustainability of the sustained deficits that have emerged since 2011. In addition,
this report gauges the sustainability of Indonesia’s current account balance under
benign and adverse external sector developments and in a scenario in which the
Government embarked in a large infrastructure development program

  Executive summary

                 1. Background

Rapid GDP growth,       Indonesia’s current account fell into deficit in late 2011 for the first time since the
weak external           1997/8 Asian Financial Crisis. The current account balance subsequently dropped to
demand and              -2.78 percent of GDP in 2012, to -3.27 percent of GDP in 2013, and -2.97 percent
declining commodity     of GDP for the first three quarters of 2014, with most of the deterioration happening
prices pushed the       in the balance in goods and services trade, which averaged 3.1 percent of GDP in the
current account into    period 2000-2007, and fell to 1.8 percent during 2008-2013. The goods and services
deficit in late 2011    trade balance dropped to -0.2 percent of GDP in 2012, further to -0.7 in 2013, and
                        recovered mildly to -0.4 percent of GDP during the first three quarters of 2014. These
                        changes over the 2011-2014 period were associated with rapid GDP growth, weak
                        external demand and declining commodity prices.

Current account         Prior to the 1998 crisis, Indonesia experienced three decades of robust economic
deficits are not a      growth and reduction in trade barriers, leading to an increase in integration in the
novelty in Indonesia,   global economy. The rapid convergence required significantly higher levels of
and not unusual for     investment. Indeed, starting at 28.5 percent of GDP in 1980, investment increased to
emerging and            37.2 percent of GDP by 1997. Constrained by low domestic saving, the increase in
developing countries    investment required and attracted foreign financing, which contributed to current
                        account deficits averaging 3 percent of GDP annually. 2 The foreign financing
                        instruments consisted mainly of short-term loans and portfolio inflows. As the Asian
                        financial crisis unfolded in 1998, external financing suddenly dried up and the current
                        account reverted to a surplus, alongside a collapse in the value of the rupiah. Since
                        then, policy reforms aimed at reducing external debt and building domestic buffers
                        against sudden stops in financial flows. During 1998-2011, Indonesia recorded
                        current account surpluses, averaging 2.44 percent of GDP. These current account
                        surpluses contributed to a substantial reduction in the stock of net foreign liabilities
                        which dropped from 70.2 percent of GDP in 2001, to 38 percent of GDP in 2011.

The recent shift into   The recent shift into deficit has been based on two structural developments and a
deficit reflects both   combination of adverse exogenous and policy shocks. First, since the early 2000s
structural              Indonesia’s economy has grown faster than its major trading partners. Second, while
developments and        investment growth has been generally strong, gross national saving have stagnated
policy factors          around 32 percent of GDP since 2009, dropping to 30 percent in 2013. In 2011,
                        Indonesia was hit by a major terms of trade shock as the end of a decade-long
                        commodity “super-cycle” hit exports prices, leading to a sizable drop in the value of
                        Indonesia’s commodity exports. The shock was compounded, until mid-2014, by
                        sustained high oil prices relative to non-oil commodities and strong domestic demand
                        for heavily subsidized fuel, as the country recorded a growing oil and gas trade deficit,
                        having become a net oil importer in 2004. Finally, the implementation of the partial
                        ban on raw mineral exports in January 2014 reduced revenues from this source.

Structurally, this is   At a high level, the reduction in the current account balance in the last 10 years is due
the result of very      to a combination of very strong private investment and public sector dissaving.

strong private         Between 2003 and 2013, the current account balance decreased by 6.7 percentage
investment and         points of GDP, shifting from a surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003, to a deficit of
public sector          3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Over the period, public saving dropped from 4.3 percent
dissaving              of GDP to 2.6 against a virtually unchanged public investment share, while private
                       saving increased from 24.7 to 27.8 percent of GDP, well short of the strong increase
                       in private investment from 21.9 to 30 percent of GDP.

Financing turned to    As the current account turned negative, financing has come to rely increasingly on
portfolio and other    portfolio and “other” investments (as opposed to foreign direct investment),
investments,           exposing Indonesia to short-term financing constraints. Foreign direct investment to

to short-term          hence insufficient on its own to finance the current account deficit. Global appetite

                       inflows into Indonesia, particularly into its higher-yielding government bonds, which
                       since early 2012 have provided the most stable source of portfolio investment.

The current account    Although total external debt-to-GDP remains moderate in Indonesia, at 9.3 percent
however is only a      of GDP as of end 2013 and 11.6 percent of GDP as of the Q1-Q3 2014 period, the
portion of overall     level of the external debt stock and amortization requirements has grown strongly,

and…                   external financing needs in 2013 of USD 83 billion, the current account deficit
                       accounted for only 35 percent, while private and public sector debt amortizations
                       accounted for 50 percent and 15 percent respectively. Short-term external funding
                       pressures could therefore emerge not only from a reduction in the availability of
                       external financing relative to the current account deficit, but also external debt
                       amortizations.

financing and          may reveal about the economy, is crucial for constructive policy responses. In
building buffers       Indonesia’s case, the evidence suggests that a current account deficit is “normal” in
                       the sense that investment needs exceed domestic savings. As long as investments
                       generate sufficient growth, meeting the resulting financing costs should not be a
                       concern. This points to the need to minimize unnecessary dis-saving (for example, by
                       reducing wasteful public spending on fuel subsidies, as intended by recent reforms),
                       raise the efficiency of investments, while managing short-term financing risks by
                       maintaining reliable external financing, and building policy buffers against volatility in
                       international markets.

                      exceeded that of its main trading partners by 2.25 percentage points per year. With
                      domestic growth faster than main trading partners” growth, import demand
                      outstripped export demand, leading to a gradual worsening of the trade balance
                      particularly since the global financial crisis in 2008/9. Indonesia’s export structure is
                      highly exposed to high income economies, most of which have struggled to emerge
                      decisively from the global financial crisis.

                          to sustain the current account adjustment to date.

structure                is likely to constrain the future reduction in the contribution of demographic factors
                         to the current account deficit.

economy…                 not symptomatic of economic overheating and does not warrant short-term policy
                         actions. Rather, policymakers should continue to focus generally on sound
                         macroeconomic management, and on tackling the long-run determinants of the
                         deficit, such as enhancing public investment efficiency, private sector
                         competitiveness, and deepening the financial sector so as to mobilize more domestic
                         savings and reduce financing risks.

                         returns to the domestic economy would also attract complementary foreign funding
                         to finance the temporary decrease in the current account balance.

                         4   A similar result is obtained when examining the link between lagged FDI and the trade balance, suggesting that
                             the effect of FDI on net exports is negative even before adding profit repatriation.

  A. Structure of the report
                              This report is structured as follows. First, it provides an overall description of trends
                              and developments in Indonesia’s current account over the last twenty five years.
                              Second, it presents an econometric analysis of the determinants of the current
                              account, identifying the contributions of each. In doing so, this report discusses the
                              scope for policy action. Third, taking a more structural approach, it analyses the
                              underlying drivers of the current account balance: saving and investment. It separates
                              their structural and cyclical components and identifies the determinants of each.
                              Finally, it simulates the possible path of the current account and NIIP under a number
                              of external developments and policy scenarios.

 B. CONTEXT
Box 1: What does the current account balance show?
 From a balance of payments perspective, the current account comprises three subcomponents: the trade balance, the income balance
 and the transfer balance. 8
 The trade balance records all transactions with the rest of the world related to the exchange of goods and services. The income
 balance records net interest and dividend payments, while the last component, the transfer balance reflects net payments (that do not
 correspond to purchases of any good, service, or asset) received or sent to the rest of the world, among which, the most notable
 corresponds to remittances received from nationals working abroad, and sent by foreigners working domestically.
 Current Account = Trade Balance + Income Balance + Current Transfers Balance
 From a national accounts perspective, the current account results from the difference between what an economy produces and what
 it consumes and invests in a given period (or alternatively, the difference between saving and investment). When countries consume
 and invest more than what they produce, they need to borrow from the rest of the world to finance that gap. The current account
 deficit reflects that amount that a country borrows from the rest of the world to finance the investment and consumption in excess
 of its level of production.
 Current Account Balance= [Output (GDP) – Consumption] – Investment Or Saving – Investment
 If Saving > Investment  The economy is a net lender of the rest of the world
 If Saving < Investment  The economy is a net borrower of the rest of the world
 The saving and investments can be decomposed further into the portions that are attributable to the public and the private sectors.
 Thus, the current account balance can be expressed as the sum of the private sector’s surplus (private saving minus private investment,
 Sp-Ip) and the government’s surplus (tax revenues minus government expenditures, T-G). This is why current account deficits and
 fiscal deficits are often referred as the “twin deficits”. Given the private sector balance (Sp-Ip), increases in fiscal deficits co-move
 with increases in current account deficits.
 Current Account Balance = (Savingp - Investmentp) + (Tax – Government Expenditures)
 From the relationship shown above, it is possible to see how a positive or a negative current account balance is not a bad thing per
 se, and it depends on the country’s specific circumstances. For example, if a relatively poor country in its path to growth, and
 constrained by low levels of domestic saving, finances its high investment rates through foreign capital, it might run into a current
 account deficit. This deficit may be inevitable for economic development, that requires firms building up capital stocks, and often
 the public sector investing in, for example, infrastructure upgrading. 9 Conversely, current account deficits can also arise from
 booming private or public consumption. When governments spend more than what they collect in taxes, or the private sector
 consumes more than it produces, countries can run into current account deficits. These deficits, however, are unlikely associated to
 faster future growth, and will generate concerns about their sustainability.
 These simple examples stress the importance of identifying the underlying sources of the current account deficit: is it mainly driven
 by fiscal deficits, by low private saving rates, or by high private investment rates?

                                8   Under the new IMF guidelines (Balance of Payments Manual 6, BPM6), to which Indonesia adhered in 2014, the
                                    current account comprises the following components: the “trade balance”, the “primary income balance”
                                    (equivalent to the income balance under BPM5), and the “secondary balance” (equivalent to the transfer balance
                                    under BPM5). Given that the analysis in this report focuses on the period in which Indonesia followed the
                                    BPM5, this structure is used to describe trends and interpret results. For more on the specific changes that the
                                    conversion from BPM5 to BPM6 entails, see IMF, 2013, “Sixth Edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments and

                                    equivalent to 1 percent of GDP boosts GDP by 0.9 points in the first year and 2.9 percent in the fourth. The
                                    effects are bigger in slow-growing economies when rates are low and competition for loans is subdued. Under
                                    those conditions, the boost in public investment leads to a 1.5 percent increase in GDP in the first year and 3
                                    percent in the fourth (Chapter 3 in IMF, 2014) “Is it time for an infrastructure push? The macroeconomic effects
                                    of public investment”).

               1. Recent developments in Indonesia’s current account
Indonesia’s current   Indonesia’s current account balance turned negative towards the end of 2011, and
account balance       remains negative to date, initiating the longest streak of negative current account
turned negative       records since 1998. Current account deficits are not a novelty in Indonesia, as the
towards the end of    country maintained a negative current account balance, averaging -2.7 percent of
2011…                 GDP between 1986 and end-1997. This reversed in the aftermath of the 1998 crisis
                      up until 2011, when Indonesia recorded positive, though generally modest, current
                      account balances averaging 1.7 percent of GDP from 2005 until the global financial
                      crisis, and 1.3 percent until the end-2011 swing into deficit.

…due to two           First, since the early 2000s Indonesia’s economy has tended to grow faster than its
structural            major trading partners. Domestic demand outstripped external demand and import
developments…         growth has been faster than export growth, particularly since the global financial crisis
                      in 2008/9. Second, while investment growth has been generally strong, gross national
                      saving have stagnated around 32 percent of GDP since 2009, dropping to 30 percent
                      in 2013. These dynamics have led to a rise, in dollar terms, of Indonesia’s net foreign
                      liabilities, the returns to which have pushed the income account deeper into deficit,
                      from about USD -3 billion in the 2005-2009 period to USD -6 billion thereafter,
                      adding a structural drag on the current account balance.

…and a combination    Indonesia’s once ample goods trade surplus suffered from a number of shocks since
of adverse            2011. First, in 2011, a major terms of trade shock following what has been described
exogenous and         as the end of a decade-long commodities “super-cycle” hit exports. The price index
policy shocks…        of Indonesia’s 6 main commodity exports, accounting for just below 50 percent of
                      export revenues, dropped by 28 percent from February 2011 to July 2014, and has
                      subsequently continued falling.

                      Second, Indonesia’s trade balance has been affected by a growing oil and gas trade
                      deficit since becoming a net oil importer in 2004, when domestic demand outstripped
                      declining exports. Oil exports have been on a long-declining trend, due to lack of
                      investment and new discoveries in the sector. Until the drop in crude oil prices over
                      the second half of 2014, this was aggravated by sustained high oil prices relative to
                      non-oil commodities, and strong domestic demand for heavily subsidized fuel.

                      Third, the implementation of the mineral export ban in January 2014 caused most of
                      the affected raw mineral exports to grind to a halt. Although some of the blockages
                      have been removed since August 2014, a number of mineral products continue to be
                      affected, and the longer-term impacts of the policy on the commodity sector remain
                      uncertain.

Box 2: Accounting relationships in Indonesia’s balance of payments
 The services and income components of Indonesia’s                   Figure 2: Services imports are a function of goods
 current account are fairly stable and structurally negative.        exports
                                                                     (year-on-year growth, percent)
 The services balance records all service related transactions
                                                                          50              Goods exports
 between residents and non-residents. Service related
 transactions can be imports or exports of freight financial              40
 or telecom services as well as tourism flows. In the last 3              30
 years, services imports have outstripped exports by about
 USD 2.7 billion per quarter, a figure almost entirely                    20
 explained by freight imports, which averaged USD 2.3                     10
 billion over the same period. Although Indonesia is a large
 exporter – chiefly of bulky commodities – most freighting                  0
 services are handled by foreign operators, which results in              -10
 freighting transactions between residents and non-residents
                                                                          -20
 for every export shipment. The correlation is clearly visible
 in Figure 2.                                                             -30                            Services imports

 transactions – that is payments of interest, coupons or
 dividends between residents and non-residents. Outbound Source: CEIC; World Bank staff calculations
 income payments in the last 3 years outstripped inbound
 payments by about USD 6.7 billion – causing, together with the service deficit, a structural drag on the current account
 of about USD 9.5 billion per quarter. Approximately USD 4.3 billion of the income payments are equity-related
 payments of dividends and USD 1.2 billion debt-related payments of interest and coupons. On the equity side, the large
 stock of foreign investor equity holdings gives rise to dividends to non-residents when corporate profits are high, for
 example, due to high exports or strong domestic income growth (Figure 3). In addition, the balance of payments
 treatment of retained earnings pertaining to non-residents is to consider them as paid to non-residents (causing a current
 account outflow) and invested by non-residents as FDI (causing a financial account inflow), creating an accounting
 relationship between outflows due to payments on equity and FDI Inflows (Figure 4).

                         a. Putting the recent decline in Indonesia’s current account balance in context

Comparing                     Indonesia, Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey were characterized in 2013 as the
Indonesia with the            “fragile five” 10 due to their sizable current account deficits, the financing of which
rest of the “fragile          depended on volatile capital flows. Comparing Indonesia to its “fragile” peers is
five”…                        informative and helps put magnitudes into perspective.

…Reveals                      However, there are sizable differences between the “fragile five”, and Indonesia’s
Indonesia’s position          position may not be as fragile as suggested, although it deserves careful attention.
may not be as                 Indonesia’s current account balance deteriorated rapidly since 2011, but in 2013, the
“fragile” as                  deficit was still lower relative to GDP than in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey. Indeed,
suggested, although           Indonesia only started registering current account deficits in 2012, while Turkey,
it deserves careful           South Africa, India and Brazil have been accumulating current account deficits since
attention                     as early as 2002 (Figure 6). 11 Indonesia’s net stock of foreign liabilities, however, is
                              the second largest of this group of countries, reaching 42.4 percent of GDP in 2012,
                              after Turkey’s that reached 53.4 percent of GDP in 2013. 12

Trade balances had            Trade balances have deteriorated across the “fragile five” since 2000 despite strong
been falling since            commodity prices through 2011, with weak commodities pushing them further down
before the                    subsequently (excluding India in 2013, Figure 7). As Figure 8, shows Indonesia’s trade
commodities price             balance in goods declined steadily over a decade that showed volatile yet raising
falls since 2011              commodity prices, pointing to the presence other (non-commodity price) factors
                              affecting the trade balance.

                                      of GDP is revealing. The current account deteriorated by 6.7 percentage points over
                                      the period, with public saving dropping from 4.3 percent of GDP to 2.6 against
                                      virtually unchanged public investment, and private savings increased from 24.7 to
                                      27.8 percent to GDP, although failing to offset an increase in private investment from

                                      2013, while the public sector continued to run a deficit (4.9 percent in 2003 and 4.4
                                      percent in 2013). In India, the private sector’s investment expansion contributed to
                                      increase the deficit despite the contraction in the public sector deficit. The 7.5

                                      private sector surplus from 7.7 in 2003 to 1.9 in 2013. During the same period, the
                                      public sector reduced its deficit from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.9 percent of
                                      GDP. In South Africa, both private sector and the public sector deficit expansions
                                      contributed to increase the current account deficit (Figure 11).

…and the                In the two decades following 1980, “Other” investments – largely constituting

                        collapsing with the crisis and recovering in the subsequent five years. During the mid-
                        2013 mini-crisis, described in more detail below, the basic balance (the sum of the
                        current account and FDI) turned negative, indicating that the financing of the current
                        account depends on portfolio investment. Portfolio investment only started playing a
                        role in financing Indonesia’s current account deficit in the last decade, prominently
                        through increased foreign purchases of domestic debt securities.

The mid-2013            Indonesia’s ability to meet its external financing needs was challenged in May-August

around current          current account deficit to a record USD 10.1 billion (4.5 percent of GDP). During
account financing       this episode, Indonesian equities fell by 24 percent from peak (20 May) to trough (27
                        August), Rupiah-denominated government bond yields rose by almost 400bp to
                        touch levels last seen in early 2011, and the Rupiah depreciated by 26 percent against
                        the US Dollar.

Indonesia’s position    Bank Indonesia’s response in tightening credit conditions contributed to a domestic

                        while non-commodity exports have failed to compensate for the ongoing weakness
                        of commodity exports.

                        gross external financing needs have risen significantly over recent years, to finance
                        the current account deficit, and to meet external debt amortizations. Indeed, of the
                        estimated total gross external financing needs in 2013 of USD 83 billion, the current
                        account deficit accounted for only 35 percent, while private and public sector debt
                        amortizations accounted for 50 percent and 15 percent respectively. Short-term
                        external funding pressures could therefore emerge not only from a shift in the
                        availability of external financing in general but also from a rise in financing needs as

                             to be a rise in external debt amortizations.

…but the greatest            Comparing the evolution of gross external financing needs across the “fragile five”
source of change for         it is evident that the most important development in Indonesia is the emergence of
Indonesia relative to        a current account deficit (Figure 15). Indonesia gross external exposures relative to
the “fragile five” has       GDP are well below the “fragile five” average, which are driven by the much larger
been the swing into          external exposures of Turkey and South Africa, but are still larger then Brazil’s and
current account              India’s. While the bulk of gross external financing needs still come from debt
deficit…                     amortization, the big driver of the increase in gross external financing needs for
                             Indonesia since 2010 has been the emergence of a current account deficit.

mix of external              of covering the current account deficit, Indonesia has remained dependent on more
funding, including           volatile portfolio capital flows. Encouraging the sustained growth of typically less

 Box 3: Current account deficits, reversals and sudden stops: how costly?
  Large current account deficits do not intrinsically represent an economic imbalance, but can rather be consistent with
  a country stage of development. However, large current account deficits tend to increase a country’s vulnerability to
  sudden stops in foreign financing.

  When external financing dries up, these large deficits need to be reduced abruptly. This phenomenon, often referred
  to as “current account reversals”, can be disruptive and costly for an economy and has received a lot of attention in
  academic and policy circles following the balance of payments and currency crises of the 1990s and early 2000s in
  developing economies.

  Sudden stops of external financing happen in response to changes in economic fundamentals or in market sentiment.
  They typically induce a sharp depreciation of the real exchange rate, and a reduction in imports, leading to the reversal
  of the current account to a surplus position (or to a substantial reduction of the deficit). The probability of a reversal,
  in turn, has been associated with high current account deficits, high external debt and service costs, a rapid rate of
  growth of domestic credit and low levels of international reserves. 14

  Indonesia’s experience in 1997/98 provides an example of how disruptive current account reversals induced by
  sudden stops can be. Indonesia grew robustly during the period 1990-1996, led by private sector investment, with
  fiscal accounts in surplus, and strong inflows of FDI, and more volatile short term capital flows that helped financing
  an apparently manageable current account deficit. Bank Indonesia set the value of the rupiah against a basket of
  currencies, and intervened in the market around that central rate, which depreciated gradually so as to stabilize the real
  exchange rate. A band was introduced in 1994 to allow some flexibility, and its width was progressively widened over
  time. This buoyant economy and ample foreign investment encouraged domestic firms to borrow directly offshore
  and through banks onshore in foreign currency, without hedging against foreign exchange risk, probably taking for
  granted that Bank Indonesia would defend the weaker edge of the band, at least long enough for them to hedge their
  foreign exchange exposure. 15 A number of shocks starting in the mid-1990s led to a progressive deterioration in
  market sentiment: the Mexican peso crisis, a slowdown in exports, more adverse terms of trade, and, finally, the
  collapse of the Thai baht. This was combined with a number of vulnerabilities that the Indonesian economy exhibited:
  growing overinvestment, financial fragility – rapid growth in risky lending, and the aforementioned currency
  mismatches in corporate and banks” balance sheets. 16 Sporadic speculative pressure occurred, and the collapse of the

  baht in July 1997 triggered sharp depreciations of the Indonesian rupiah – putting pressure on firms with dollar debt,
  and creating gloomy growth prospects. FDI and portfolio inflows dried up, and turned into outflows in the first
  quarter of 1998. The current account deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 1997 reversed dramatically to a 4.1 percent
  surplus. Real GDP declined by 13 percent in 1998. Investment fell faster than GDP, with the Investment/GDP ratio
  declining by 3 percentage points from 1997 to 1998, and falling a further 5 percentage points in 1999. CPI inflation
  escalated up to 58.5 percent in 1998, relative to a moderate 6.15 percent in 1997, with food prices soaring, affecting
  the poor disproportionately.

  The literature shows many episodes of these phenomena occurring in the developing world, apart from Indonesia.
  Calvo, Izquierdo, and Talvi (2006) looked at episodes of sudden stops and current account reversals in a number of
  countries. The authors found that output in Mexico declined by 4.8 percent between 1981 and 1983 and by 6.2
  percent between 1994 and 1995 (both periods corresponding to sudden stops and current account reversals), while in
  South Korea output declined by 6.9 percent between 1997 and 1998, and in Thailand by 11.7 percent between 1996
  and 1998. During these episodes, asset prices, such as the exchange rate and equity prices, also tend to experience
  large falls, wiping out wealth. 17

  The exchange rate regime in place also matters for the size of the real effects of these reversals induced by sudden
  stops of capital flows. Flexible exchange rates tend to act as shock absorbers. For example, through gradual
  depreciations, economies maintain export competitiveness and discourage offshore borrowing, which allows countries
  to accommodate better this type of external shock, and avoid the costly currency crises that are often times associated
  with reversals and sudden stops. 18 Indeed, Komárek and Melecky (2005) looked at the impact of these shocks on
  economic growth and found that the largest negative effects are associated with the combination of reversals and
  currency crises (that is, when the impact of the sudden stop on the real exchange rate is large).

  The effects on current account reversals differ across sectors. Craighead and Hineline (2013), for example, look at the
  effect of reversals by sector for a sample of industrial economies, finding that it matters how investment-intensive the
  sector is, and whether it is tradable. Investment-related sectors, such as construction, mechanical engineering and
  shipbuilding suffer significant contractions, while other sectors, particularly those related to tradable commodities, and
  particularly those that are also not heavily dependent on investment, may even benefit. These dynamics are consistent
  with real exchange rate depreciations and credit crunches accompanying reversals.

  Debt-dollarization makes current account reversals and sudden stops even more costly. When firms hold unhedged
  dollar-debt, as it was the case in Indonesia in 1997/98, their net worth falls since the sudden stop leads to a sharp
  depreciation of the real exchange rate. This often means that firms struggle to service their debts, which may have
  systemic consequences on the payments system. Public finances can also be severely hit by sudden stops. To the
  extent that in developing countries and large portion of public debt is denominated in dollars, sudden stops often
  increase the burden of public debt repayment, expressed in domestic currency. To maintain servicing of that debt, the
  authorities will have to run higher primary surpluses, with negative implications for aggregate demand and economic
  activity.

competitiveness is              affect their ability to earn foreign exchange through exporting and thus their current
key to reducing                 account position. Diversification of destination and product dimensions helps to
vulnerability                   reduce these vulnerabilities.


                                17 Empirical studies also suggest that the output effects of sudden stops vary substantially by country, depending on
                                   a number of factors including openness and exchange rate misalignments prior to the sudden stops. When
                                   exchange rates are aligned with equilibrium levels prior to the sudden stop, then the induced effect of the shock is
                                   not as large, and nor are the real effects on the economy. For more on the effects of sudden stops, see for
                                   example Milesi-Ferreti and Razin, 2000 or Freund and Warnock, 2007.

Indonesia is an               During the period 2000-2013, Indonesia’s exports and imports of goods and services
active participant in         as a share of GDP averaged 30.2 and 26.3 respectively. 19 These indicators are slightly
international trade           below the average that other countries with similar or even lower levels of
markets…                      development exhibit, such as Vietnam (63.5 and 70.2 respectively). However,
                              assessing integration into the global marketplace by just looking at export and import
                              ratios to GDP can be misleading. Many factors determine a country’s opportunities
                              to participate in international trade markets, apart from its relative level of
                              development. These include, for example, the size of its internal market, which affect
                              domestic firms” incentives to trade, or whether these countries are landlocked or
                              islands, which affect transportation costs. Figure 16 and Figure 17 show country
                              rankings of export and import orientation indices that factor in these elements. These
                              indices are zero when the actual ratio of export to GDP matches what would be
                              predicted given the aforementioned characteristics (i.e. if exports to GDP are at the
                              average level of those countries with similar characteristics). 20 When exports to GDP
                              are above average, then the index is positive (and vice versa). Indonesia’s export
                              orientation is well above the average, greater than China and India, and substantially
                              above those of Brazil, Turkey and South Africa. With respect to import orientation,
                              Indonesia is just above average, close to the scores of India, and China.

                        2011, Indonesia’s export growth slowed down substantially, on the back of sluggish
                        export demand and decreasing prices for its key commodities. Since 2011, Indonesian
                        exports of merchandise fell at a rate of 5.3 percent, while those of India, for example,
                        grew at a rate of 7.9 percent (Figure 18 and Figure 19).

…and import           Considering the most recent 2012-2014 period, and examine both merchandise
deceleration followed export and import trends we observe, first, that export deceleration was followed,
export deceleration   with a lag, by import deceleration. This pattern is predictable. Previous World Bank
                      analysis shows both a short and long run relationship between imports and exports. 21
                      Indeed, a large portion of the slowdown in import growth observed during 2012 is
                      explained by the contraction in exports (while the demand for imported inputs to
                      export production is estimated to have contributed almost all import growth in 2013).
                      As a consequence, during 2012-2014, the merchandise trade balance remained
                      relatively unchanged despite the reduction in import growth.

The last 10 years saw                                        In 2002/03, Indonesia’s five largest export destinations (Japan, USA, Singapore,
a decline in the                                             Korea, Rep., and China) accounted for 58 percent of total exports. In 2012/13, the
concentration of                                             largest five (with India now replacing Korea) accounted for 53 percent. The decline

five destinations,                                           concentration remains relatively high (Figure 21). Despite more than 50 percent of
reducing                                                     export earnings being concentrated in five export destinations, Indonesian exporters

…but quality,                                        An indicator of quality based on the prices that export products obtain in international

                                                     Until 2008, the average export quality was below that of India, Brazil, China, Malaysia,

                                                     22   The EXPY indicator estimates the sophistication of products on the basis of income levels of countries that
                                                          produce (and export) these products. If a product, say, internal combustion engines, is largely produced by rich
                                                          countries, that product would be revealed to be “rich” and sophisticated. This outcome-based measure of
                                                          sophistication for each product, called PRODY, is a weighted average of the per capita GDP of countries
                                                          producing that good. PRODY values of all products that a country exports are then weighted by the products’
                                                          share in the country’s total export basket, and summed to derive a country’s level of GDP per capita as inferred
                                                          from the sophistication of its export basket. Called EXPY, this measures the income content of a country’s
                                                          export basket, and it is the indicator used in this report. The indicator is regarded as a more inclusive measure of
                                                          sophistication than intensity in technology or R&D, and it is a predictor of a country’s future growth rates.
                                                          Indeed, countries with high EXPY tend to have higher growth rates in the future – countries “become” what they
                                                          export by converging to the income level implied by their export baskets.

Export survival is   The chances of Indonesian export flows that start in a given year to remain active
amongst the lower in past the first year is among the lowest, together with that of South Africa, among the
the group            comparator group. For countries to achieve fast export growth and diversification,
                     both successful entry into export markets and survival of export flows are crucial. In
                     fact, the literature finds exporting to be an extremely risky activity, and particularly so
                     in less advanced countries. In Indonesia, the chances that a specific product exported
                     to a given destination remains active for at least one year is 51 percent, similar to those
                     exhibited by South African (50 percent), Vietnamese (51 percent), Malaysian (52
                     percent) or Indian (52 percent) products, and substantially below those displayed by
                     Brazilian (56.4 percent), Turkish (59 percent) or Chinese (65 percent) products. The
                     probability of Indonesian export flows persisting for five years or more is the lowest
                     in the group (21 percent). 24 Among different types of products exported, Indonesia’s
                     footwear, rubber, and wood products are those with the highest chances of remaining
                     active for longer. More sophisticated products, like machinery and equipment and
                     transport equipment show the lowest survival rates. International empirical evidence
                     shows that networks and productivity are crucial for export survival. Firms that are
                     more productive tend to be more resilient to negative shocks, and to maintain their
                     exports for longer. In addition, networks have been found to positively affect export
                     survival by increasing the circulation of information related to compliance with
                     standards required to export specific products or to specific destinations. 25

 C. What is behind Indonesia’s current account deficit?
                                  This section analyses the determinants of the current account deficit over the period
                                  1988-2013. First, it discusses the estimated coefficients for a number of determinants
                                  (see Box 4, and Cusolito and Nedeljkovic [2013] for more on the methodology).
                                  Second, it combines information on the estimated sensitivities with the evolution of
                                  these determinants to calculate their contributions to the dynamics of the current
                                  account deficit.

Box 4: Conceptual framework for the analysis of determinants of the current account balance
 We begin with the notion, developed in Box 1, that the current account balance reveals the difference between national
 saving (private and public) and national investments (private and public). To identify the underlying drivers of the current
 account balance, we relate that balance with the drivers of national saving, investments, government deficits and trade
 competitiveness factors that may affect the current account directly (with indirect effects on saving and investment):

 CA( X CA ) = S P ( X S ) − I P ( X I ) + S G − I G
 where XS are private consumption/saving determinants, XI denotes factors that affect private investment and XCA denotes
 factors that may influence the current account directly (for example, the export/import determinants, past FDI inflows).
 Assuming exogeneity of the trade drivers XCA the current account balance is defined as:

 CA = g ( X S , X I , S G , I G , X CA )
 and the function g(•) is assumed linear. The prospective determinants are classified according to their sensitivity to policy
 decisions, and the sign of their expected effect on the current account balance (Table 1).

 The dependent variable in the analysis is the ratio of the current account balance to GDP.

 The explanatory variables and their relationship with the current account balance are described below:
 • Lagged current account balance: At an annual frequency, current account balances tend to show high persistence,
   associated with habit formation in consumption and saving, or agglomeration effects in investment.
 • Lagged Net International Investment Position (NIIP): net foreign assets can affect the current account balance in two
   ways. First, a large stock of foreign liabilities will require a country to run current account surpluses to pay them off.
   Second, the country will still pay interest on those liabilities, generating outbound income payments and thus tilting the
   current account towards a deficit.

  • Oil prices: for a net oil importer like Indonesia, oil prices directly affect the oil import bill, thus the current account. As
    Indonesia turned into a net oil importer only since 2002, oil prices are interacted with a dummy variable that takes value
    1 from 2002 onwards, and zero otherwise.
  • Commodity prices: a positive terms of trade (ToT) shock can improve the current account via increased saving due to
    larger current income relative to permanent income (the Harberger-Laursen-Metzler effect). On the other hand, ToT
    shocks can also affect the optimal capital stock and change investment plans, leading to bigger current account deficits.
    The greater the persistence of the shock, the more dominant is the investment effect.
  • Government expenditures: rising government expenditures increase aggregate demand and depress national saving.
    Increased demand will be partly satisfied by additional imports (Ahmed 1996). The financing strategy of these
    expenditures (taxes versus debt) may matter if current generations do not internalize future government debt repayments
    (Obstfeld and Rogoff 1996).
  • Openness: trade openness has ambiguous effects on the current account balance. Less open economies may import less,
    which may reduce the current account deficit. However, the same countries may have difficulties servicing external
    liabilities, resulting in higher debt service costs and a greater current account imbalance. On the other hand, greater
    openness typically allows countries to undertake more investment and to finance the resulting current account deficits
    with capital flows from abroad. International trade is also a conduit for the transfer of technology, leading in the long run
    to economic development, thereby improving the current account balance.
  • Real Effective Exchange Rates (REER): REER appreciations induce an expenditure switching effect away from domestic
    goods and into foreign goods, for a given level of expenditure, which increases the current account deficit, all else equal.
  • Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): FDI has ambiguous effects on private domestic investment and the current account. It
    can crowd out domestic investment when local and offshore firms compete for scarce domestic resources (e.g. labor or
    finance). FDI may also generate local spillovers that “crowd in” domestic investment. Gross FDI may also worsen the
    current account, depending on the balance of the import content and the amount of profits repatriated on one hand, and
    the export orientation of multinationals as well as the increase in their production that may substitute imports for
    domestic consumption.
  • Relative GDP growth: the effect on the current account balance depends on agents” expectations about the implications
    of growth for future income. If agents consider it permanent, then saving rates could decline, increasing the current
    account deficit. If instead it is perceived as temporary, saving will increase and the current account balance will increase.
    GDP growth is computed relative to Indonesia’s main trading partners. Faster trading partners” growth boosts demand
    for exports, increasing the current account balance.
  • Credit to the Private Sector: proxies financial deepening, and aggregate demand. Relaxed borrowing constraints can
    reduce private saving (increase current account deficits). Also, if it reduces transaction costs and improves risk
    management, credit may encourage private saving (decrease current account deficits).
  • Relative income: developing economies are expected to run current account deficits as they accumulate capital goods.
    Eventually, the country will be sufficiently developed to pay its debts by running current account surpluses.
  • Global uncertainty (proxied with VXO index 26): an indicator of global uncertainty in financial markets, increases in the
    VXO index are expected to increase saving and reduce investments, according to the buffer stock theory. Moreover,
    higher global financial market volatility is associated with lower availability of foreign financing for emerging markets,
    thereby contributing positively to the current account balance.
  • Energy subsidies: a subcomponent of government expenditures, energy subsidies are expected to also increase aggregate
    demand. The negative effect of energy subsidies on the current account balance is expected to be larger than that of
    general government expenditures, as these subsidies directly affect the consumption of imported goods (such as oil).

 Some of the factors proposed as potential determinants are in fact jointly determined with the current account balance
 notably including the real exchange rate, for example. To deal with this “simultaneity” problem, we instrument variables that
 are likely to be endogenously determined with the current account balance. The instruments consist of lagged values of the
 variable in question, which are predetermined at time t. 27 Pre-determination, however, does not necessarily imply
 “exogeneity” if anticipation effects are present. For these reasons, a caveat is necessary: the results presented here should be
 read as conditional associations between variables, rather than as strict causal relationships.

account balance                                    Indonesia’s current account balance is highly sensitive to a specific portion of
                                                   government expenditure: energy subsidies. It is likely that recent fuel subsidy reforms
                                                   will help reduce the current account deficit, by reducing the demand for oil, which
                                                   accounts for a sizable portion of imports. The dynamics of all other government
                                                   expenditures were found to be not statistically significant in the main specification,
                                                   although the result may be due to the small variation in expenditure as a percentage
                                                   of GDP in the non-fuel subsidy portion of government expenditure. The results from

                                                   negative sign of the government expenditure coefficient, suggesting that increases in

An expansion in the     A one percent of GDP expansion of the credit stock decreases the current account
credit stock            balance by 0.05 percent of GDP. The rapid expansion of credit in the years through
decreases the current   2012 is thus estimated to have pushed down the current account balance; for example
account balance         in 2013 by 0.13 percent of GDP. Slower credit growth since 2013 should help alleviate
                        current account pressures.

Trade integration       Indonesia’s trade integration in the global marketplace relative to its trading partners,

account balance         for Indonesia is in line with the findings for both developed and developing countries
                        reported in Gruber and Kamin (2007) and Chinn and Ito (2007). This implies that
                        further trade integration in the global marketplace relative to its trading partners
                        should have a beneficial effect on the current account.

investment attracted    three years leads to a decrease in the current account balance by 0.17 percent of GDP.

financing imports       capital goods and profit repatriations by more than they increase exports or induce
                        import substitution. A similar result is obtained when examining the link between
                        lagged FDI and the trade balance, suggesting that the effect of FDI on net-exports is
                        negative even before adding profit repatriations.

                        entrants, but also for domestic firms operating in the same market, which also benefit.
                        Duggan, Rahardja and Varela (2013) find that reducing barriers to FDI in the services
                        sector leads to increases in the productivity of manufacturers that use services inputs
                        more intensively, with gains larger when restrictions are reduced in transport and
                        telecommunications sectors.

Indonesia’s faster      Real GDP growth in excess to trading partners by 1 percent, leads to a decline in the
growth than its         current account balance by 0.3 percent of GDP. As domestic demand, and
trading partners”       consequently import demand, grows faster than external demand for exports, the
                        trade balance deteriorates, putting pressure on the current account. In this sense,

NIIP (reductions in net liabilities) result in increases in the current account balance,
and vice versa. The positive coefficient suggests two channels of influence on the
current account. First, the accumulated level of the NIIP has not presented a strong
external borrowing constraint for most of the past period. In order to control for
strong decline of the NIIP during the 1998 crises we include the interaction dummy
for the period 1998-2001. The estimated coefficient for the interaction term is
negative, implying a reduced impact of the NIIP on the current account deficit for
high levels of the NIIP. Second, the NIIP accumulation also leads to income outflows
in the current account, related to profit repatriations and the interest repayments on
debt instruments. This is in line with the difference in the magnitude of the
coefficients for the level and the interaction term (implying an additional impact
beyond the borrowing constraint) and the increasing contribution of the NIIP to the
current account balance over the most recent period which we discuss below.

                        33   The distinction between the sensitivity and contribution of a given determinant is important. The former
                             illustrates by how much the current account changes given a small change in one of the determinants. The latter
                             combines information on the sensitivity to a given determinant with the changes in such a determinant over the
                             period, and illustrates how much of the current account deficit observed during a given period is attributable to
                             changes in determinants. Take the case of credit. Indonesia’s current account is sensitive to credit growth, which
                             increases the deficit, all else constant. However, the contribution of credit growth to the current account deficit of
                             Indonesia has fluctuated over the period of analysis. Credit contractions led to improvements in the current

Adding a structural                 The analysis of the current account determinants presented so far identified key
versus cyclical                     drivers of the current account but did not distinguish either their origin (national
perspective                         saving or national investment changes), nor the cyclical or structural nature of their
                                    impact. This section investigates the cyclical and structural determinants of the saving
                                    and investment components of the current account, estimating an approximation to
                                    the cyclical and structural dynamics of the current account itself, which is helpful to
                                    assess whether the current account is in line with its fundamental value.

 Box 5: Methodology for the estimation of dynamics and determinants of saving and investment
  To analyze the persistence of the variables and the influence of the corresponding drivers we assume that the net
  national saving and net national investment (seasonally adjusted in percentage of GDP, Y) are the sum of its
  structural, cyclical and irregular components:

  Yt = Yt S + Yt C + ε t
  Further, in order to identify the individual components of the variable Y we use additional information embedded in
  the structural and cyclical determinants of the variable (discussed in Box 6) and specify the following law of motion
  for the components:


             −1 + β X t + ε t
  Yt C = θYt C         C                  C


  Yt S = ϕYt −1 + δX t + ε t
             S        S                   S


              
  where  , ɛ are structural and cyclical shocks which are assumed to be zero mean, normally distributed, serially and
  cross uncorrelated.  and           
                                                              , denote variables which affect the structural and the cyclical component of the variable
  Y, respectively. By using additional information embedded in the structural and cyclical determinants within the state
  space, the estimates                    � should be closer to the underlying economic movements in the variable in comparison to
                                 � , 
  purely statistical measures of                                      � . The choice of whether a variable impacts the structural or temporary segment
                                                             � , 
  of the variable Y is made a priori and is based on the results in the existing literature or statistical properties of the
  drivers. For example, variables which may have both a long-run and temporary impact (e.g. commodity price index)
  are decomposed into slow-moving (3 year rolling average) and cyclical components (current or lagged change) and the
  two are used as separate drivers of the two components of saving (investment).

  Both components and the parameters are estimated jointly in an extended state space specification. A Kalman filter
  with diffuse initialization is used for estimation of the state space. The application of the Kalman filter requires further
  assumptions on some parameters of the model. Following the literature on estimation of the natural rate of
  unemployment, we assume two “signal to noise” ratios – a ratio of the variance of the structural component to the
  variance of irregular component of 0.15 and a ratio of the variance of the temporary or cyclical component to the
  variance of irregular component of 0.4. 34 Alternative specifications of the ratio do not materially change the results.
  Due to the relatively small length of the sample and a large number of potential determinants, different specifications
  were estimated and the final specification is that which minimizes the AIC and BIC criterion.

 Following the estimation of the structural and cyclical component of the saving and investment component of the
 current account, the structural and cyclical components of the current account itself are calculated as the difference.

 Quarterly data over the Q1 1992-Q3 2014 period is collected from various sources. The sample size and the choice of
 variables below reflect data availability, as discussed further in Box 6.

 Data for a number of potentially important determinants of structural investment and saving were unfortunately not
 available or not compatible with the frequency and time period of the analysis. For structural investment, data were not
 available on labor cost dynamics (average wages or real wages), labor market policies (ratio of minimum to average wage,
 gross unemployment replacement rate) and the business and product market environment variables were not available for
 the period of study. For structural saving, data were unavailable on social security programs (public social or health
 spending), labor market policies (ratio of minimum to average wage, gross unemployment replacement rate) and
 urbanization.

 In the cyclical investment and saving components, some of the variables entered the specification with lags in order to
 capture the time-varying effects in investment and saving decisions. The specification also includes a dummy variable for the
 quarters with significant changes in the investment to GDP ratio during the 1998 crisis (1998 Q1-Q2), and in the saving to
 GDP ratio (1998 Q1-Q3).

Structural                     Figure 33 shows the breakdown of investment in Indonesia into its cyclical and
investment declined            structural components. The structural component of investment took a declining path
at the onset of the            at the onset of the 1998 crisis, which continued for the subsequent four years. The
1998 crisis,                   decline in structural investment was driven by heightened macroeconomic
recovering only in             uncertainty, and falls in economic activity and FDI inflows. The structural component
2003 and stabilizing           picked up around the year 2003, driven by favorable commodity prices and an
at around 29 percent           improved macroeconomic environment, encouraging the return of FDI inflows. The
of GDP in 2010                 contribution of productivity to structural investment became stronger after 2008,
                               while investment stabilized at a level of around 29 percent of GDP from 2010
                               onwards.

                      a. Structural component of investment

Productivity growth      Productivity growth is found to be a determinant of the structural component of
boosts structural        investment. Rising medium-term productivity growth increases firms” profit
investment…              expectations and consequently investment.

…as does                 Macroeconomic stability is positively associated with structural investment. Reduced
macroeconomic            macroeconomic and political risks and improvements in structural characteristics of
stability…               the economy (as captured by the ICRG indicator) lead to higher investment. This
                         result is in line with that previously reported by the IMF (2012). 38

…favorable               Due to the large size of the commodity sector, commodity prices play a structural role
commodity and            in investment. Commodity price changes over the medium-term tend to impact the
housing prices…          investment behavior of firms, reflecting the large importance of the commodity sector
                         for the overall dynamics of investment, and of economic activity in general. The
                         structural component of investment in Indonesia is also positively associated with
                         medium run trends in house prices.

…and past FDI            Lagged FDI inflows are positively associated with the structural component of
inflows help crowd-      investment rates. An increase in the average of the previous three years of FDI
in domestic              inflows by 1 percent of GDP, increases gross investment rates by 0.13 percent of
investment               GDP. This may be indicative of “crowding in” effects of past FDI on national
                         investment, given that the model controls for output growth and commodity prices.
                         This helps explain the finding of the previous section suggesting that increases in FDI
                         flows into Indonesia are associated with subsequent increases in the current account
                         deficit. As FDI increases crowd in further domestic investment, this increases the
                         needs for foreign financing, and therefore increases the current account deficit. The
                         result may also be capturing a “momentum” effect that operates beyond commodity
                         price effects or booms in economic activity. For example, if investment promotion
                         efforts are clustered together in a particular time period, then past FDI booms may
                         be correlated with current booms in investment (and the converse is also true).

                      b. Cyclical component of investment

Lower cost of            A fall in the lending rate lowers the user cost of capital and leads to higher
capital, and credit      investment. 39 The positive estimated impact of the credit expansion that took place
expansions, boost        through 2013 is in line with the experience of other emerging markets (consistent
cyclical                 with a still shallow financial market and the prevalence of bank credit as the source
investment…              of external finance for firms). 40

…as do real currency Increases in the cyclical component of investment are positively associated with real
depreciations…       exchange rate depreciation. A negative sign for the real exchange rate change suggests
                     that improvements in price competitiveness lead to export-led investment that tends
                     to dominate the increased cost of imported capital and intermediate goods. Real
                     exchange rate depreciations also encourage investment to substitute away from more
                     expensive imports.

                         38 The IMF explored the impact of two specific sources of macroeconomic volatility on aggregate investment:
                            interest rates and exchange rates. They found a negative correlation between the two volatility indicators and
                            aggregate investment. These two variables are included under the cyclical component of investment
                         39 IMF (2012) reports a similar result on the growth of aggregate investment.
                         40 For example, in Turkey and Georgia, two countries in which this toolkit was also piloted, revealed similar

                            responses of the cyclical component of investment to credit expansions. In Turkey, the estimated coefficient was
                            0.1388, while in Georgia it was estimated at 0.0345.

…upswings in global Commodity price gains are associated with increases in the cyclical component of
commodity prices… investment, with a one year lag. Increases in the index of Indonesia’s main 6
                    commodity prices excluding oil and gas tend to increase investment over the cycle.
                    Higher commodity prices incentivize investments in the commodity-producing sector
                    as its relative profitability increases. In addition, they also impact on the availability of
                    investable funds, thus relaxing credit constraints that may be impeding investment in
                    that sector or elsewhere.

                    a. Structural component of saving

Increasing real          An increase in real income (GDP per capita) over the medium term is associated
income per capita        with increases in the structural component of saving. The positive sign of the
adds to the structural   relationship is consistent with the empirical evidence for developing countries
component of             (Carroll and Weil 1994) that in growth-accelerating episodes, higher growth tends to
saving…                  precede and statistically cause higher saving, while the opposite tends to be the case
                         in developed countries.

…together with           Improvements in the overall state of the economy increase the structural component
economic stability…      of saving. The positive impact of the indicator of economic stability (proxied by
                         ICRG) on saving rates contrasts with the results typically found in the literature.
                         Generally, as uncertainty increases households and firms tend to save more for
                         precautionary reasons, and vice versa. However, in the case of Indonesia, the result is
                         the opposite. It is possible that if agents lost confidence in the banking sector and
                         financial markets as saving channels during the 1998 crises, subsequent reductions in
                         economic uncertainty led to an increase in confidence in the banking and financial
                         system, and therefore to increased saving rates.

…favorable               Commodity price gains over the medium horizon support savings-formation. Two-
commodity prices…        year averages of commodity price gains have a positive impact on the structural
                         component of saving, consistent with the gains being perceived as temporary (as
                         discussed in the current account determinants section).

…and a decline in    Structural saving is positively affected by a reduction in the proportion of the
the dependency ratio dependent population. The three-year average dependency ratio has the expected
                     negative sign, in line with standard life-cycle models. As the ratio of dependents to
                     the working population declines, saving will tend to increase.

                    b. Cyclical component of saving

Reduced by credit        Greater access to credit reduces saving over the cycle, by softening household and
expansions, and          corporate liquidity constraints. Equity returns and the growth of real GDP per capita,
boosted by GDP           conversely, have a positive impact on the cyclical component of saving through
growth and stock         income effects and increases in profitability, although the latter variable is not
market returns…          statistically significant.

…and reduced by          Commodity price gains lead to lower cyclical saving, suggesting feedback from higher
short term               income from commodities to increases in consumption. The estimated effects of
commodity price          commodity price changes on the cyclical and on the structural component of saving
gains                    go in opposite directions. It is possible that if agents face liquidity constraints, then
                         even if they perceive that the revenues originating in a commodity price boom will be

The structural           The reduction in the current account balance, particularly since 2011, reflects a
component of the         deterioration of both cyclical and structural factors, suggesting a structural current

points of GDP                commodity price gains, and a slowdown in saving since 2009. Further, the strong
                             cyclical expansion of investment and the recent slowdown in saving contributed
                             significantly to the worsening of the cyclical component of the current account.

Credit expansion             Credit expansions lead to both a decrease in the cyclical component of saving and an
decreased                    increase in the cyclical component of investment, thus leading to a higher current
(increased) cyclical         account deficit in the short-run. This result is consistent with the findings on current
savings (investment)         account determinants reported in Section 2.

The effect of                The effects of commodity prices on the current account balance are more complex.
commodity prices             Commodity price increases lead directly to increases in the trade balance and thus on
gains differs in the         the current account balance. Their effects on investment and saving differ when we
long and the short           focus on the short run (cyclical components) or long run (structural component). In
run                          the short run, commodity price gains lead to both a decrease in the cyclical
                             component of saving and an increase in the cyclical component of investment, thus
                             leading to a short run increase in the current account deficit. Over the long run,
                             commodity price increases induce an increase in saving that predominates over the
                             induced positive effect on investment, leading to an overall positive impact on the
                             current account.

crowds in domestic           in further domestic investment, thus increasing the foreign financing needs of the

 E. How far can the Current Account and the Net
    International Investment Position (NIIP)
    deviate from their path?
                          This section uses the estimates described above to simulate the deviations of the
                          current account and NIIP from a baseline projection 41, which can be thought of as
                          no major change, under three alternative scenarios: a “benign” world, an “adverse”
                          world, and the case in which the government embarks in a large infrastructure
                          investment program.

Box 7: Simulating Indonesia’s current account balance and its net international investment position
 The current account balance and NIIP are simulated over the medium term using projections of the determinants of
 the current account from the IMF”s World Economic Outlook (WEO), and the World Bank Indonesia country office,
 together with assumptions on rates of return and relative valuation effects of foreign assets and liabilities.
 This simulation is akin to a static “what if” analysis rather than a forecast and it should not be read as such. First,
 estimated parameters from the model are kept constant over a relatively long horizon, while a more sophisticated,
 general equilibrium analysis might allow these to change. Second, the underlying model is descriptive in nature, hence
 built to provide an accurate representation of the determinants of the current account balance, rather than to minimize
 forecast errors. Third, projections of some key determinants, such as GDP and commodity prices, have continued to
 shift since the time that this report was prepared (in late 2014).
 The methodology applied does not impose steady-state assumptions on the economy as these do not typically hold for
 emerging countries (Cusolito and Nedeljkovic (2013)), but rather focuses on the reasoning that the current account
 deficit may be sustained as long as international investors are willing to finance it. This depends, ultimately, on the
 accumulated level of the NIIP.
 The methodology consists of following steps:
 1. Simulations of the current account balance are generated from 2014 onwards using the coefficients from the current
    account determinants equation and the projected values of determinants.
 2. The NIIP stock is calculated using the current account projections described above, the stock of foreign assets and
    liabilities in the previous year, projections of capital flows and calibrated rates of return on foreign equity assets and
    liabilities.
 3. The steps above are repeated recursively to generate the paths of the current account and the NIIP until 2019, and
    the analysis is repeated for different scenarios.

 Figure 36 shows the pattern of the simulated NIIP under alternative assumptions on the rates of returns on assets and
 liabilities. Assuming an equal rate of return on assets and liabilities, leads to a more negative NIIP by at most 0.7
 percent of GDP per year. Finally, The NIIP dynamics are mechanically sensitive to the assumed rate of return on the
 equity liabilities, increasing the annual rate of return by 100 basis points worsens the NIIP position by a cumulative 4
 percentage points of GDP by 2019.
 The growth rate of FDI prices is calibrated following Tille (2008), assuming a nominal interest rate of 7.5 percent on
 liabilities and 5 percent on assets; and the ratio of reinvested to distributed earnings on FDI to be equal to 0.5, in line
 with the average yield on long-run government bonds and the observed income outflows, respectively.
 The nominal GDP growth for the 2014-2019 is consistent with the World Bank Indonesia country office Medium
 Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) allowing for (realistic) possibility that the economy has not reached the steady-state
 and hence a constant nominal GDP growth rate. All additional projections and sources are reported in Table 6 below.

a “benign” scenario              decline, gaining 15 percent. Indonesia’s terms of trade thus improve consistently and
                                 the global risk indicator (VxO) falls by 15 percent relative to the baseline, indicating
                                 favorable global risk appetite and financing conditions.
…an “adverse”                    The adverse world scenario is designed as the opposite of the benign scenario
scenario…                        described above. In this world, oil prices recover faster than anticipated, non-oil
                                 commodity prices decline faster than anticipated, Indonesia’s terms of trade
                                 deteriorate and the global risk indicator spikes by 15 percent relative to baseline, along
                                 the lines of the increase in international market volatility experienced during the mid-

push” scenario                   and simulates the impact of a large increase in infrastructure investment from the
                                 government. Under this scenario, infrastructure investment increases, generating a 0.5
                                 percentage point increase in GDP growth. Increased domestic demand spurs credit
                                 growth, which increases by 1 percentage point relative to baseline. Increased
                                 investment (and an improved capital stock) attracts additional FDI, which increases
                                 by 0.7 percentage points, corresponding to an additional USD 2 billion per quarter;
                                 the import content of FDI increases trade openness by a total of 0.4 percent of GDP.

Under the baseline,             In the baseline scenario, detailed underlying projections for which are provided in
the current account             Box 7, the current account deficit is expected to narrow over the medium run and, in
balance is expected             the absence of additional policy actions, to stabilize around -2.5 percent of GDP. This
to remain mildly                is well within the confidence interval of the structural estimate presented in the
negative                        previous section. While consistent with other projections of the structural current
                                account 42, it must be stressed that these are “raw” model estimates from a descriptive
                                model that is not updated or optimized for forward projections. What is most
                                informative is deviations that different scenarios generate from the projected baseline,
                                to which we now turn.

In a benign scenario            Under the benign scenario, the current account balance could increase quickly by

increase vs. the                current account deficit than projected in the baseline). A higher current account
baseline                        balance than in the baseline would mechanically lead to a lower stock of net foreign
                                liabilities by approximately 2.2 percent of GDP relative to baseline by 2019.

In an adverse                   Under the adverse scenario, the current account balance could decrease slowly relative
scenario, conversely,           to the baseline, settling 0.4 percent of GDP below the baseline (i.e. a larger current
they could decrease             account deficit than projected in the baseline). A lower current account balance than
to still sustainable            in the baseline would lead to a larger stock of foreign liabilities, by approximately 1.7
levels…                         percent of GDP by 2019. Despite the relatively significant deterioration in the
                                external conditions envisaged by this scenario, the pattern of the current account and
                                NIIP is not radically different.

Under the “policy               Under the “policy push” scenario, in which the government, embarks successfully on

recover slowly, but             be higher by 2.9 percent relative to baseline, but possibly reduce in the future on the
increased potential             back of a continued increase in the current account balance. In this scenario, investor

 Box 8: Is the level and the composition of Indonesia’s net foreign liabilities problematic?
  Net foreign liabilities (or analogously, the net international       Figure 43: Links between current account deficits,
  investment position [NIIP]) of a country link today’s                credit ratings and net foreign liabilities
  current account deficit to the deficit that future
  generations will face. A present current account deficit
  builds into the stock of net foreign liabilities, generating a
  stream of debt servicing and amortization payments that
  will fall on future generations.

  The accumulation of a large and negative NIIP can pose a
  risk to the sustainability of a large and persistent current
  account deficit. Accumulated foreign liabilities lead
  directly to a worsening in future current account balances
  through larger income outflows while increasing the
  perception of country risk, reducing the attractiveness to
  foreign investors. In a recent cross-country study of
  external crises over the period 1970-2011, Catao and                Note: Bar chart labels refer to export volumes in million tons
  Milesi-Ferretti (2013) show that the risk of a balance of           (MT)

  payments crisis is related to the stock of net foreign              World Bank staff calculations
  liabilities, and particularly so when these exceed 50 percent
  of GDP or their historical average by more than 20 percent.

  Equity liabilities have historically been less crisis-prone. Liabilities can take the form of debt or equity, and the
  prevalence of one type of liability affects the probability of a balance of payments crisis. Debt liabilities have tended to
  introduce currency mismatches (in cases where most debt is foreign currency-denominated) or maturity mismatches
  (in cases where a large part of the debt is short term). Equity liabilities, being national-currency-denominated residual
  claims are less likely to introduce such risks (Fernandez Arias and Hausmann (2001)). Increasing

  Within equity, FDI is commonly seen as the most desirable form of foreign liability. FDI is widely acknowledged to
  be related to technological and knowledge transfers, increased competition, and job creation and upgrading. In

                                                                        THE WORLD BANK | BANK DUN IA

addition, FDI is a less-outflow-prone source of foreign financing compared to portfolio investment. This is because
FDI involves a long-term commitment. 43 FDI is also less subject to capital reversals and contagion that affect other
flows, since the presence of large, fixed, illiquid assets makes rapid disinvestments more difficult than the sale of stock
holdings (Fernandez Arias and Hausmann (2001)). Empirical tests find supporting evidence that the composition of
external liabilities affects the risk of external crises for developing countries; in particular, non-FDI liabilities are more
crisis prone then FDI. In a recent study, Catao and Milesi Ferretti (2013) find that the composition of the NIIP
matters for vulnerability. Increased debt liabilities are associated with higher risks of external crises, the results for
non-FDI equity liabilities are weaker, and when foreign liabilities take the form of FDI, increases in these liabilities are
not associated with increases in the risk of external crises.

Indonesia’s net foreign liabilities increased from 41.15 percent of GDP in 2012 to 42.67 percent of GDP in 2013. This
increase is the result of a current account deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, and of valuation gains of net foreign assets
relative to GDP, and will imply increases in the associated debt servicing, interest payments and profit repatriation in
years to come. Comparatively, and as a share of GDP, Indonesia’s net foreign liabilities are the second highest, after
Turkey, among the group of the “fragile five” (Figure 44).

                              43   This “bolted down” hypothesis has been disputed. Hausmann and Fernandez Arias (2000) argue that FDI is not a
                                   physical asset of a firm, but only one of its liabilities. The firm has other liabilities and assets, and some assets may
                                   be “bolted down”, but “financial claims backed by “bolted down” physical capital can easily fly away” (page 36).
                                   Foreign investors could hedge their earnings and protect the value of their assets, or speculate, by borrowing in
                                   domestic currency and pledging physical capital as collateral. Put differently, outflows may be generated under an
                                   account other than FDI. The volatility of FDI thus provides limited information on the overall volatility of the
                                   financial account.

APPENDIX I

 Conceptual framework and methodology for the estimation of current account
 determinants

 By focusing on the underlying determinants of saving and investments, the specification used in this report
 is partially related to the inter-temporal approach to the current account (Sachs, 1981, Obstfeld and Rogoff,
 1996). 44 Our specification below, however, constitutes an augmented version of these models. This is
 because its aim is to capture as many potential influences on the current account as possible, to disentangle
 the drivers of the deficit, rather than discriminating between the competing intertemporal models by

 These two models are also estimated on the trade balance, instead of on the current account balance. Results
 are reported in Table 8.


                        44   The inter-temporal models treat current account balances as an outcome of consumption and investment decisions
                             made over a long-term horizon under forward looking expectations. More concretely, with an infinitively lived
                             representative agent who smoothens consumption by lending or borrowing abroad, the standard inter-temporal
                             model implies that the movements in the current account should reflect factors that affect country’s underlying
                             saving and investment positions. Assuming free capital movements, the current account will absorb any temporary
                             shocks to the net national cash flow thus allowing domestic agents to smooth their consumption over time.
                             Although theoretically rigorous, inter-temporal models tend to exhibit a poor empirical fit – while the model-
                             predicted and the actual series were usually positively correlated, the latter series were substantially more volatile
                             (see, inter alia, Sheffrin and Woo (1990), Otto (1992) for early applications and Campa and Gavlan, 2011 for other
                             references). In addition, with the focus on the long-run, the models are of limited applicability for assessing the
                             current account sustainability, at least from the short to medium run perspective.

The reduced-form specification is related to a large empirical literature, which uses various econometric
techniques to identify the relationships between the current account and a set of macro and socio-economic
variables (see Debelle and Faruqee, 1996, Calderon, et al., 2002, Chinn and Prasad, 2003, for early
applications in this expanding literature). The aim behind the specification (2) is to capture as many potential
influences on the current account as possible using a large number of variables in the empirical analysis. 45

Since annual data are used, estimation of the single-country determinants puts relatively strong limits on
the number of variables to be included in standard OLS regression, even in the first step of general-to-
specific exercise. Along the lines of Haddad and Nedeljkovic (2012), a preferable solution for confronting
parametric model uncertainty and limited number of observations is model averaging. Model averaging in
the present context means that the different combinations of the potential current account determinants
(not all at once) are used as particular models and each combination is estimated by OLS. The final estimate
is obtained by averaging across all the estimated regressions using a suitable criterion to select individual
model’s weights. We use the recently proposed Jackknife Model Averaging (JMA) estimator for non-nested
and heteroscedastic models (Hansen and Racine, 2012) where the weights are chosen by minimizing a leave-
one-out cross-validation criterion (see Appendix for a detailed description). In this way, a large number of
variables can be included, whilst, at the same time, only single country estimation is performed (thus
eliminating a heterogeneity-induced bias in the resulting parameter estimates of panel studies, Robertson
and Symons, 1992, Pesaran and Smith, 1995).

Methodology for the estimation of dynamics and determinants of saving and investment

Quarterly data over 1992Q1-2014Q2 period are collected from various sources. The sample size and the
choice of variables above reflect the data availability.

Yt = Yts +Ytc + αDt + εt

Further, in order to identify the individual components of the flows we use additional information
embedded in the structural and cyclical determinants of the saving and investment and specify the following
law of motion for the components:

           −1 + β X t + ε t
Yt C = θYt C         C           C


Yt S = ϕYt −1 + δX t + ε t
           S        S            S



            
where  , ɛ are structural and cyclical shocks which are assumed to be zero mean, normally distributed,
                                                                
serially and cross-equation uncorrelated.          and   , denote variables which affect the structural and the
cyclical component of the variable Y, respectively. The components of the flows and the parameters are
estimated jointly in the extended state space specification. Kalman filter with diffuse initialization is used
for estimation of the state space. Application of the Kalman filter requires further assumptions on some

                           45   By focusing on the underlying determinants of saving and investments the specification is partially related to the
                                intertemporal approach to the current account (Sachs, 1981, Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1996). The intertemporal model
                                treats current account as an outcome of consumption and investment decisions made over a long-term horizon
                                under forward looking expectations. More concretely, with an infinitely lived representative agent who smooths
                                consumption by lending or borrowing abroad, the standard intertemporal model implies that the movements in the
                                current account reflect factors that affect country’s underlying saving and investment positions. Assuming free
                                capital movements, the current account will absorb any temporary shocks to the net national cash flow thus allowing
                                domestic agents to smooth their consumption over time. Although theoretically rigorous, intertemporal models
                                tend to exhibit a poor empirical fit – while the model-predicted and the actual series were usually positively
                                correlated, the latter series were substantially more volatile (see, inter alia, Sheffrin and Woo (1990), Otto (1992)
                                for early applications and Campa and Gavlan, 2011 for other references). In addition, with the focus on the long-
                                run, the models are of limited applicability for assessing the current account sustainability, at least from the short
                                to medium run perspective. Moreover, rather than choosing a limited number of variables in the reduced form that
                                correspond to a particular model, in the empirical exercise the focus is on a broad set of potential determinants.

parameters of the model. Following the literature on estimation of the natural rate of unemployment, we
assume two “signal to noise ratio” – ratio of the variance of the structural component to the variance of
irregular component – of 0.15 and ratio of the variance of the temporary or cyclical component to the
variance of irregular component – of 0.4. 46 Alternative specifications of the ratio do not change the results.
Due to a relatively small length of the sample and a large number of potential determinants different
specifications were estimated and the final specification is the one which minimizes the AIC and BIC
criterion.

Methodology for the external sustainability analysis

Here we ask, given the identified influences of macro-variables on the current account and the current stock
(end-2013) of foreign assets and liabilities of the country, what will be the future paths of NIIP under
different scenarios? This methodology does not impose any steady-state assumption on the evolution of
the economy—which might not hold for an emerging country; it represents the other side of the
sustainability coin—the current account may be sustainable as long as the foreigners are willing to finance
it, which is ultimately connected to the accumulated level of NIIP. Moreover, given the experience from
the recent crises, market perceptions of what constitutes a sustainable level of NIIP (often proxied by
external debt) may change in the short-run, which signals the importance of focusing on the front part of
the horizon.

The procedure consists of four steps. First, we use the estimated coefficients from the current account
determinants analysis and the projected values of determinants to generate projections of the current
account balance at the end of 2014. Given: (i) the current account projection from step 1, (ii) the stock of
foreign assets and liabilities in 2013, (iii) projections of the relative movements in capital inflows and
outflows and calibrated rates of return on foreign equity assets and liabilities for 2014; generate the stock
of the NIIP at the end of 2014. Then, using the calculated stock of NIIP at the end of 2014, steps 1-2 are
recursively repeated generating the paths of the current account and the NIIP until 2018. Different
projections of the selected variables are alternated to obtain the range of potential scenarios and assess the
risk implications.

The composition of the net foreign position of Indonesia matters for this analysis and it is explicitly taken
into account by introducing the valuation gains associated with that composition, which involves
introducing the rates of return on foreign equity assets and liabilities in each year (Tille, 2008). Incorporating
valuation effects is key. The case of the USA provides a concrete example. The USA has a big external
balance-sheet, with its foreign liabilities exceeding its overseas assets. Although this may seem worrisome,
this statement conceals the fact that while USA”s foreign assets are unusually lucrative; its liabilities are
liquid, safe and low-yielding. 47 Over time, these return differentials will contribute to a self-correction of
the net foreign liabilities of the USA. A simple, abstract example illustrates the importance of net foreign
liabilities” composition and valuation effects. Consider a country with the balanced trade and constant
GDP. Suppose the country holds equity assets amounting to 100 percent of GDP, has bond liabilities of
the equal relative amount and let both types of assets earn the same annual return of 5 percent of GDP.
The current account deficit of 5 percent of GDP then does not deteriorate the NIIP position of the country.
The key idea here is the difference in recording and valuation of returns on different types of assets. While
the returns on bonds take the form of the interest payments, which enter the current account, the gains on
equity do not enter the current account, but offset the interest outflows in the NIIP. Similarly, a country
that is in the growing phase may see its external position deteriorating more than what the accumulated
current account deficits show due to equity price inflation relative to its debtors. In Indonesia, at the end
of 2013 FDI equities constitute a sizable portion of total liabilities in its net international investment

                        46 The ratio allows imposing a constraint on the smoothness of the component. Lower values of the ratio imply
                           smaller volatility of the components.

position (while the rest is accounted by debt). This fact highlights the importance of taking into account
the composition of the net foreign position and differences in returns in evaluation of the external position.

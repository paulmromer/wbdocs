THE RESILIENT CITIES PROGRAM was launched by the World
Bank Group in December 2013 to help cities strengthen their
                                                                    Enhancing Urban Resilience
ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, and
to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions related
to climate change, natural disasters, and other shocks and
stresses. The Program serves as an umbrella for delivering the
analysis, rationale, and support local governments need to make
resilience part of their urban management agendas.

THE CITYSTRENGTH DIAGNOSTIC was developed as a means
of engaging with cities on the complex issue of resilience
by using a holistic approach to identifying priority actions
and investments to strengthen urban systems. Designed to
be implemented by sectoral specialists, the rapid diagnostic
process draws upon ideas and data from a multitude of                        July 2015
existing tools. A longer-term goal of CityStrength is to promote
alignment in approaches to urban resilience to improve
awareness of resilience considerations among local leaders
and development partners. Financial and technical support for
the development of the Diagnostic was provided by the Global
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

Letter from the Mayor


Ethiopia is engaged in rapid and comprehensive development activities to transition
from poverty to sustainable and reliable growth and prosperity. Our cities are projected
to play an increasing role in the economic transition of the country. Strengthening urban
resilience to multiple shocks and stresses will therefore prove crucial to the success of
this transition and to ensure improved living conditions for residents and at the same
time increase attractiveness for investments and job creation.

As part of the resilience agenda, Ethiopia plays a prominent role in the struggle
to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as shown by the active engagement of
the government and its collaboration with multiple actors to reduce the country’s
vulnerabilities. Climate change impacts in Ethiopia, such as the increase in average
temperature and changes in rainfall distribution, exacerbates current vulnerabilities
that are highly interlinked with other shocks and stresses such as rapid urbanization. To
support our cities in their pursuit of sustainable development it is a necessity as well as
an opportunity for our country to embark on a resilient development path.

Addis Ababa is the country’s capital and home to 25% of the country’s urban population.
With the current pace of urbanization, the city’s population is expected to double in
the coming 10 to 15 years. This presents a number of challenges but also opportunities
for the city that need to be better understood. For this reason, we welcomed the World
Bank initiative—the CityStrength Diagnostic. Through this process, the Addis Ababa
City Government engaged in open dialogue with World Bank specialists and key urban
stakeholders about risks in our city, urban growth, delivery of basic services, and
vulnerable groups.

It was our wish that this engagement would lead to the identification of specific
actionable projects that we can implement with support of the World Bank or other
development partners. This document describes the process we undertook and presents
the recommended actions and investments to enhance resilience in Addis Ababa.

                                                                                                             the official population growth rate of 3.8% per annum from the CSA underestimated reality; World Bank

                                                                                                             City departments are generally aware of potential flood and landslide hazards, but detailed information

                                                                                                             Improved and formalized coordination with FEPRA and national agencies developing risk assessments

      Coordinated
      The implementation of the Integrated Development Plan will require a degree of coordination across
      bureaus in Addis Ababa that currently does not exist. Each sectoral bureau currently develops and
      implements its infrastructure investments somewhat in isolation from one another. Moreover, enhanced
      coordination with sub-city and woreda administrations—who are responsible for municipal services,
      neighborhood improvement, and building code enforcement—is needed to prepare and implement
      detailed local development plans.

                                                                                                                                Women have been playing an increasingly important role in the economy and politics. For example, Enat Bank
                                                                                                                                was established in 2012 with a special focus on reaching women. At the national level, there is female leadership
                                                                                                                                in the highest ranks of government. At the family level, the legal system has been supporting women’s rights as
                                                                                                                                well. For example, in 2005, a law was passed that provides for the division of assets in cases of divorce. In informal
                                                                                                                                circles, it is usually women who lead initiatives and who volunteer. However, this does not always hold true in formal
                                                                                                                                circles. Moreover, because the majority of urban women lack attributes that are required by the formal economy
                                                                                                                                (i.e. education, skills, experience), they benefit less from the growth of the formal economy compared to their male
                                                                                                                                counterparts. For example, while the construction sector is booming, women benefit less as they assume the labor
                                                                                                                                intensive roles while men often take management positions.

                                                                                                                                efforts. The city needs to leverage informal initiatives and strengthen formal ones in order to have more efficient
                                                                                                                                engagements. This includes capacity building for city officials and community members alike as well as stronger
                                                                                                                                coordination efforts since there are many fragmented initiatives. Additionally, the government should ensure that
                                                                                                                                there is accountability and transparency. The latter is part of existing objectives but it is particularly problematic
                                                                                                                                when there are political interests involved. Addis Ababa will thus need to consider establishing a citizen engagement
                                                                                                                                platform in a more systematic manner to allow citizens to participate in the elaboration of policies and programs that
                                                                                                                                are aimed at providing services and opportunities for them as well as play a role in monitoring their implementation.

Qualities of Resilience
CONTINUED




       Reflective
       Poverty data, while updated every two years by the Central Statistical Agency, may not adequately reflect the
       conditions and presence of informal settlements across the city. As Addis Ababa rapidly develops and transitions,
       AACG recognizes that it is important to ensure that neighborhoods contain a mix of socio-economic groups. For
       example, when it was recognized that some areas of the city were developing in a way which appeared to isolate
       higher-income groups, housing for lower income groups (i.e. condominiums) were planned for development in those
       areas to ensure a level of integration and cohesion among various groups. AACG appears to be taking lessons learned
       from other countries in attempts to avoid “ghettoization” in the city. An extensive study of the most vulnerable
       groups should be carried out to help inform urban development decision as well as to ensure that social service
       programs are well targeted and efficient.




       Robust
       BOLSA targets several vulnerable groups, including: (i) the elderly; (ii) the disabled; (iii) street people/ beggars; (iv)
       the poor; and (v) commercial sex workers. There is a special focus on the disabled and the elderly, recognized as
       the most vulnerable groups. It was also noted that BOLSA targets homeless children, but they are not their own
       category. Clearly, there are efforts to better serve the vulnerable but there is need to make the current strategy
       effective. Additionally, it is unclear how the current registration and identification system is affecting the provision of
       social services. With a growing population, the city is challenged to provide adequate services to meet the demand
       of the residents.
       The disabled are a big target group in terms of social and community protection. Most of the disabled are people who
       experienced an accident in the workplace (construction sites, factories, etc.) therefore, stricter safety regulations
       in workplaces would benefit the city by reducing the number of accidents resulting in disabilities. This is a serious
       problem because of the vast number of people working in jobs with high accident rates, especially construction. This
       was noted during site visits and consultative group discussions.
       According to a recent public expenditure review, Ethiopia spends approximately 3 percent of GDP on social protection
       programs. This includes general subsidies, safety nets, social insurance, and labor market interventions. At the
       national level, social safety nets and subsidies are the largest social protection programs. Safety nets are primarily
       financed by donors but the government would like to eventually be the main contributor to social programs. Safety
       nets and subsidies do not currently target Addis Ababa, therefore, the Urban Productive Safety Net Program will be
       essential to support the GoE in providing access to effective safety nets and livelihood services to the poor in selected
       urban areas, including Addis Ababa.

       Robust
       The projected rapid growth in population, urbanization, and GDP growth create a progressive stress and
       conspicuous increase in demand. In particular, the AADMP forecasts an increase in electricity demand
       in the city (covering the current 10 sub-cities) from 614 MW in 2015 to 1747 in 2034. 22 This will stress
       the current system and require a reinforcement of transmission corridors from the Western and North
       Western regions to Addis and the upgrading and expansion of substations. Loss reduction measures
       should be considered during the planning phase. The cost of the recommended short term rehabilitation
       and expansion of the distribution network is estimated at $285 million between 2015 and 2017.

       To avoid major disruption to the system at the household level as well as prevent urban fire, AACG should
       ensure that the residential electric wiring systems meet minimum safety standards. A certification
       mechanism should be designed and enforced. Periodic household inspections are needed to make sure
       that there are no risky situations created by unsecure modifications of the system. Wooden distribution
       poles in the network are planned to be progressively replaced by concrete to address the fire risk. An
       awareness campaign could be promoted to inform households about avoiding electric hazards and how
       illegal connections can provoke major accidents.




       22	      The AADMP include in its analysis twelve surrounding Oromia woredas supplied by the Addis Ababa network. Aggregate
       demand forecast will then grow from 759 MW to 2978 MW.

     TRANSPORTATION
     In a resilient city, the transport system offers multiple modes of transport to its users   The expansion of Addis Ababa along the five radial roads has posed many challenges for
     to ensure the continuity of mobility in the event of disruptions, and to ensure access      the city, especially in terms of increased transportation costs, congestion, and delivery
     to transportation for all population groups. It takes a flexible approach and proactive     of public infrastructure services. Additionally, there is a lack of coordination between
     coordination with other agencies to be able to divert user traffic to different modes       transport investments and urban development. Indeed, housing and land-use decisions

     investments in the transport sector are based on an assessment of past shocks and           transport impacts, thereby missing the opportunity to integrate public transport modes in
     stresses and are closely aligned with other departmental plans and overall key priorities   terms of coverage, routes, fares, schedules and facilities. Low coverage of streets and a lack

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Mexico perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mexico regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mexico;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Mexico;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge and convening services, and communication and information sharing
              in Mexico;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Mexico.
    Use data to help inform Mexico country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In May-June 2014, 400 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Mexico were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President; the office of a Minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; project management
units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 191 stakeholders participated in the
survey (48% response rate).
Respondents received a link to an online version of the questionnaire and completed the survey
on the Qualtrics platform. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Mexico; their
overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge
and convening services; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Mexico; the WBG’s
communication and information sharing in Mexico; and development organizations in the region.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 273 respondents (45% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY ’08. Comparing responses across country surveys reflect changes in attitudes over
time, but also changes in respondent samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. The
differences in stakeholder identification in the FY’08 and FY’14 Country Surveys make
weighting difficult. The unweighted mean/percentage comparisons are presented in Appendix D
to show overall attitudinal changes from FY’08 to FY’14. Yet interpretation of these trends
should be based on the understanding of the differences in the samples in the two years.
A. General Issues Facing Mexico: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Mexico is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
   effectiveness the WBG in Mexico, how effectively different parts of the WBG collaborate,
   WBG staff preparedness, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s
   work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents
   were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest weaknesses, in which sectoral areas the WBG
   should focus most of its resources, which groups the Bank Group should collaborate with
   more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Mexico, the extent to which the
   World Bank and IFC meet Mexico’s needs for financial instruments respectively, the extent
   to which the WBG meets Mexico’s needs for knowledge and convening services, and the
   WBG’s effectiveness in eleven development areas serving four thematic objectives in
   Mexico’s 2014-2019 Development Strategy. Respondents were also asked to rate the extent
   to which Mexico received value for money from the WBG’s reimbursable advisory services.
D. The World Bank Group’s knowledge and convening services: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge and convening services and to rate
   the effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge and convening services, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the LAC Flagship Report (Latin American
   Entrepreneurs: Many Firms but Little Innovation), including if it raised substantive new
   information, and whether it provided them with useful information in terms of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Mexico: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Mexico, and which services the
   Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has moved to the
   right direction, how significant the roles of the WBG, IFC, and international development
   cooperation are in Mexico’s development respectively in the near future.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Development Organization in the Region: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   familiarity with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and its effectiveness.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Mexico, which WBG agencies they work with, whether IFC and the Bank work
   well together, and their geographic location.

Greatest Weakness
       In this year’s Country Survey, “not enough public disclosure of its work? and “the
        WBG’s processes being too slow and complex? are perceived as the greatest weaknesses
        of the institution by respondents across stakeholder groups and geographic locations.

        likely to consider “the WBG’s processes being too slow and complex? as the WBG’s
        greatest weakness than respondents who do not professionally collaborate/work with the

Attributing Slow or Failed Reform Efforts
       Overall, “political pressures and obstacles? and “government working inefficiently? are
        perceived as the greatest causes, when the WBG assisted reform efforts fail or are slow to
        take place.
       While overall more than a quarter of respondents consider “government working
        inefficiently? as the second greatest cause of failed/slow reforms, respondents from the
        private sector/financial sector/private banks and academia/research institutes/think tanks
        were significantly more likely to think so than respondents from other stakeholder
        groups. In the meantime, respondents were do not professionally collaborate/work with
        the WBG are significantly more likely to indicate so compared to respondents who do
        professionally collaborate/work with the WBG.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Mexico, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the eleven specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mexico. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at enhancing service delivery through better public
              sector management;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at developing labor markets that allow for inclusive
              growth;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at fostering innovation for productivity and
              competitiveness;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at creating a more competitive business environment

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mexico, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at developing labor markets that allow for inclusive
              growth;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at fostering innovation for productivity and
              competitiveness;

Appendix D: Responses to Questions across Country Surveys1
Comparing responses across country surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in
respondent samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. The differences in stakeholder
identification in the FY’08 and FY’14 Country Surveys make weighting difficult. The unweighted
means/percentages are presented below to show overall attitudinal changes from FY’08 to FY’14. Yet
interpretation of these trends should be based on the understanding of the differences in the samples
of the two years.

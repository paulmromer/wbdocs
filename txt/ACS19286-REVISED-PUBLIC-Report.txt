           Somali High Frequency Survey Wave 1
                   Preliminary Summary
Overview

The historical civil war and political insecurity in Somalia has resulted in a lack of
socioeconomic, perception and other key data in Somalia. The Somalia Socioeconomic
Survey 2002 was the last Somalia-wide representative survey. This lack of data makes it
difficult for the government and its development partners to plan and implement appropriate
policies and programs that are needed to support economic growth and stability. Especially
the lack of poverty numbers undermined the development of an interim poverty reduction
strategy paper, which is required to apply for HIPC debt relief.

The Somali High Frequency Survey closes this crucial data gap. The first wave of the
Somali High Frequency Survey was conducted as part of the Somalia Poverty TA program in
February 2016. This summary document describes the methodology and presents a few
preliminary findings of the first wave. A more comprehensive compilation of preliminary
findings is available in the accompanying presentation. An in-depth analysis has not yet been
conducted but will be proposed in the last section of this document.

Methodology
Data collection in Somalia is challenging due to insecurity in some areas. Traditional
sampling methodologies require a full listing of enumeration areas, which is impossible in
insecure areas. Also face-to-face time is limited to about 60 minutes while a full consumption
questionnaire takes 90 to 120 minutes. Finally, limited field access makes monitoring of data
quality difficult.

The poverty team developed solutions to overcome these challenges and allow
household consumption data collection in Somalia. The new solutions were tested in a
pilot survey in Mogadishu. The first challenge related to sampling was resolved by employing
a segmentation approach instead of requiring a full listing in insecure areas. The second
challenge of limited face-to-face time was overcome by a newly developed methodology to
collect consumption data in 60 minutes. An ex-post simulation using data from Hargeisa
showed that the methodology is able to provide accurate poverty estimates. The third
challenge of monitoring limitations was tackled by the design of a remote real-time data
monitoring system. Implementing these innovations in the Somali High Frequency Survey
ensured high data quality despite limitations for field monitoring.

The sample design had to be adopted due to missing enumeration area maps. The
survey was originally planned to rely on the sample framework provided by PESS. However,
maps for a large number of rural enumeration areas were not available. Therefore, the sample
design was altered for areas without existing maps. For those areas, settlement data from
PESS as well as from UNDP (2005) were used to create a sample frame. The draft sample

frame was cleaned by merging duplicate enumeration areas and by splitting larger
settlements into multiple enumeration areas. Boundaries of the enumeration areas were
constructed as circles and then transformed into non-overlapping Theissen polygons. 1

The survey covered Somalis living in Mogadishu, in urban and rural areas in Puntland
and Somaliland as well as in Internally Displaces Persons (IDPs) settlements. The
survey did not include the nomadic population, which presents about one quarter of the
Somali population (according to PESS). This ad hoc approach to create the missing sample
frame aimed to ensure representativeness of the covered population but has technical
limitations, which should be kept in mind when interpreting results.

The questionnaire of the survey is focused on consumption. Consumption is measured
using the Rapid Consumption Methodology. The approach partitions consumption items into
core and optional modules. Only the core and one optional module is administered to each
household. The missing consumption information is imputed within the survey using
multiple imputation techniques. The questionnaire also covered livestock and perception
data. In more secure areas, a long-form of the questionnaire was administered including
modules for income / remittances, household enterprises and shocks.

Poverty is estimated using the international 1.90 USD 2011 PPP poverty line. As the
poverty line is defined in USD 2011 PPP, it must be converted to the currency used to measure
consumption in the survey. First, USD 2011 PPP are converted into Somali Shilling in 2011
using the regression-based PPP estimate for Somalia. Second, the change in purchasing

power per Somali Shilling is considered by estimating inflation from 2011 to 2016. In the
absence of a CPI, the consumption shares of the survey are used together with prices collected
from 2011 to 2016 by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) Somalia led by
FAO. Third, the poverty line is converted back to USD using the current exchange rate. The
resulting poverty line is 1.58 USD (2016) per day per person. The consumption estimates
from the household are accordingly converted into USD using the region-specific exchange
rates collected by the market price surveys. Food consumption is also spatially deflated using
a Laspeyres deflator to ensure comparability.

Preliminary Findings
Poverty ranges from 35 to 71 percent in Somalia, across different parts of the
population. The poverty rate in Mogadishu is similar to other urban areas while rural areas
are poorer. Most people in IDP settlements are poor. Household receiving remittances are
better off than household that do not receive remittances (Figure 1).

One in four working-age persons participate in the labor market. One in third of those is
unemployed (Figure 2). Women are often not participating in the labor market because they
engage in household work and/or are not allowed by their husbands to seek work. More than
half of the youth pursues education.

More than half of the population is literate. Literacy are higher in urban compared to rural
areas (Figure 3). Women are slightly less often literate. Wealthier households have higher
literacy rates than poorer households.

Somalis are optimistic about the future. Asked about their outlook on living standards and
employment opportunities, 4 in 10 people are optimistic while only 2 in 10 people are
pessimistic (Figure 4). People living in IDP settlements are generally more pessimistic.
Wealthier and female-headed households are more optimistic.

Next Steps
The survey data offer the opportunity for an in-depth analysis of poverty and related
socio-economic indicators to improve our understanding of poverty in Somalia. This
work is planned for FY17 contributing to the preparation of the Systematic Country
Diagnostic while also feeding into the Country Economic Memorandum.

Additional waves of the High Frequency Survey will help to understand poverty
dynamics and can increase coverage, e.g. by including nomads. The first wave of the
survey only gave a snapshot of poverty for the represented part of the population. Additional
waves are planned including previously insecure areas as well as the nomadic population.
The additional waves will be funded by the Somalia Multi-Partner Knowledge Fund.

The incomplete sampling frame for Somalia will negatively affect representativeness
of any surveys in Somalia. Therefore, it is urgent to update the sampling frame for Somalia.
Based on the experience gained in complementing the existing sample frame for the first
wave of the Survey, it is proposed to support the Government of Somalia with technical
assistance to construct a complete sample frame. Due to security constraints to conduct
required field work for updating the sampling frame, an approach based on satellite images
with selected verification will be considered. Given the reach beyond the High Frequency
Survey and the strong capacity building component in this undertaking, the TFSCB could be
the appropriate vehicle for this.

Full vs. Micro-listing
Traditionally, all households in an enumeration area are listed before households
are selected randomly for interviews. A full listing can raise suspicion in some
areas. Thus, we opted for a micro-listing approach.
                                  

                                                 The micro-listing approach splits an enumeration
                                                 area into multiple segments. Each segment is further
                                                 split into blocks. Within a selected block, the
                                                 enumerator records all housing structures. The tablet
                                                 selects randomly one structure of which the
                                                 enumerator records all households. The tablet
                                                 selected randomly the household to be interviewed.

                                                 This methodology provides unbiased estimates but
                                                 reduces precision due to design effects introduced by
                                                 the additional layers of hierarchy.

  Notes
  1.   Wave I of the SHFS covered the following pre-war regions: Awdal, Banadir, Bari, Mudug, Nugaal, Sanaag, Sool, Togdheer,
       and Woqooyi Galbeed. Not included were Bakool, Bay, Galgaduud, Gedo, Hiraan, Lower Juba, Lower Shabelle, Middle
       Juba, and Middle Shabelle.
  2.   ‘Covered’ population includes extrapolation to inaccessible areas within covered pre-war regions. It is assumed that
       inaccessible areas are similar to the bottom 25 percent of enumeration areas in the same analytical strata. IDP settlements
       are scaled to all regions.
  3.   Percentage of Population Covered is based on PESS population estimates.

Rapid Consumption Methodology
In traditional household surveys, consumption is measured using a long list of >300
items. This takes multiple hours or days.

   Only recording consumption from ‘core’ items will result in severe under-
   estimation of consumption and, thus, over-estimation of poverty.

Poverty Measurement from the SHFS

1. Consumption Aggregate
      •   For food and non-food items
      •   For assets by estimating consumption flow
      •   Impute ‘missing’ consumption values

2. Deflator
      •   Laspeyres: calculate spatial price indices using a common food basket and spatial prices
      •   Apply to food and nonfood consumption aggregate

3. Define a Poverty Line based on 1.90 USD PPP 2011
  •   Converting 1.90 USD PPP to SSh in 2011
  •   Estimate inflation of SSh from 2011 to 2016 by a CPI-like index based on estimated consumption
      shares and FSNAU price data (food and non-food)
  •   Convert poverty line back to current USD using current exchange rate from SSh to USD
  •   Resulting poverty line: 1.58 USD (2016)

Labor Market Statistics: Key Concepts (I/II)
•       The working-age population (15 to 64 years) is made up of people who are either inside
        (‘active’) or outside of the labor force (‘inactive’). The working-age youth are those aged
        between 15 and 24 years.

•       The labor force is made up of employed and unemployed people.

•       Employed people are those who are of working-age (15 to 64 years) and engaged in
        activities producing goods or providing services for at least one hour during the last 7
        days. This includes workers who contributed within the family establishment.

•       Unemployed people are those who are not employed but are looking for work and are
        available to work.
    •     Long-term unemployed are those who have been unemployed for at least 12 months.
    •     First-time job-searchers are those who are currently unemployed looking for work, and have never
          worked before.

•       Those outside of the labor force are called ‘inactive’; these are people who are not
        employed, not looking for work, and/or not available to work.

Technical Appendix: Wave 1 Somali HFS
This technical appendix describes sample design, cleaning and construction of consumption aggregates for the Wave 1 Somali High
Frequency Survey data.

Introduction
Estimating monetary poverty rates requires a sound, reproducible methodology. The methodology starts with the sample design,
continues with questionnaire design and the construction of food and non-food consumption aggregates, selection of spatial price
deflators and how to determine the consumption value derived from assets, and what process to use to construct the poverty lines.
This appendix describes the methodology used to estimate poverty for the Wave 1 Somali High Frequency Survey.

The chosen methodology balances a trade-off between feasibility and accuracy. Somalia is a fragile country with severe security
constraints for field work and wide spread displacement. The sampling methodology was adapted to the context by excluding several
inaccessible areas. The questionnaire design utilized the Rapid Consumption methodology that can be easily and quickly
implemented. The choice of deflators and the poverty line were driven by data quality.

A household is defined as poor if the per-capita household consumption does not exceed a given threshold

    (1)                                                                      ≤ 

where yi is the nominal per-capita household expenditure and z is the poverty line at the nominal level. In the following, we discuss
the selection of households i as part of the sample design and present the construction of the consumption aggregate yi before
discussing the choice of the poverty line z and standard poverty measures.

Sample
The Population Estimation Survey of Somalia (PESS) was used as sample frame alongside a list of settlements from three different
sources (UNDP 1997, UNDP 2006 and FSAU 2003) to complement missing rural and semi-urban settlements. The combined
sample frame was cleaned and preprocessed before the number of enumeration areas per strata was calculated and enumeration
areas selected proportional to size. Depending on the strata, different multi-stage clustering approaches were used to select
households.

Sample Frame
Due to the combination of the different data sources, the resulting sample frame included enumeration areas as well as settlements.
While enumeration areas are defined as geographical areas with about 50 to 200 households, settlements often are larger areas with
a larger population. In fact, all rural and a large fraction of semi-urban enumeration areas and settlements did not have boundaries
available but were only defined by a GPS position.

Since PESS is also partially based on the same data sources (especially UNDP 1997 and UNDP 2006) and since some PESS
enumeration areas had the same GPS location, several GPS positions were very close of each other and, thus, considered duplicates
(Figure 1). Technically, duplicates are defined where the distance between the GPS position is below 75m. In groups with multiple
duplicates, the additional criteria was introduced that all GPS positions must have pair-wise distances below 200m to prevent large
sequential areas of GPS positions. Duplicates were merged into one ‘hypothetical’ enumeration area with a tag of the number of
duplicates. Those duplicate counts were used to position manually midpoints for new enumeration areas around the main duplicate
GPS position to ensure that larger settlements have the appropriate number of surrounding enumeration areas. 1

In a second step, boundaries of enumeration areas without corresponding shape files were drawn automatically. First, the GPS
positions were used as midpoints of circles with a radius of 200m. Overlapping circles were transformed to Thiessen polygons
where the line connecting the overlapping points becomes the new boundary. The algorithm was tested for areas where PESS
shapefiles were available (Figure 2).




1   Note that this was only done for selected duplicate enumeration areas to reduce manual processing.

Sample Stratification and Size
The sample is designed based on predicted statistical precision of consumption as well as cost considerations. Without political
implications, the survey stratifies the sample into four zones, A including Mogadishu, B including Garowe, C including Hergeiza
and D for Sanaag, Sool and Togdheer. The sample is stratified for each zone into economic/political centers, urban centers, other
urban settlements, rural settlements and – if existent – IDP camps. The result are 16 strata (star marks areas where a micro-listing
approach was utilized; see below):

    •    A: Mogadishu*; IDPs*
    •    B: Garowe; Urban Centers; Other Urban; Rural; IDPs*
    •    C: Hergeiza; Urban Centers; Other Urban; Rural; IDPs*
    •    D: Sanaag Urban; Sanaag Rural; Sool Urban; Sool Rural; Togdheer Urban; Togdheer Rural




                                                                          2
                                      Technical Appendix: Wave 1 Somali High Frequency Survey (HFS), Revised: 30th August 2016



The sample employs a clustered design with the Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) being the enumeration area. Within each
enumeration area, 12 households will be selected for interviews. A larger number of households per enumeration area would only
marginally benefit the statistical estimation of indicators. A smaller number of households would result in less than 3 observations
for each of the four optional modules capturing consumption data.

A total sample of about 3,800 households is sufficient to obtain consumption estimators with a relative standard error below 1
percent. After rounding the number of enumeration areas ensuring that 12 households per enumeration area, 324 enumeration areas
were initially selected. The 324 enumeration areas are first distributed into the 16 strata. The number of enumeration areas per strata
is determined by (i) the population of the strata, (ii) the variability of consumption within the strata, and (iii) the requirement of at
least two enumeration areas per strata. Strata with larger population and larger variability will need a larger sample to retrieve the
same relative standard error as a strata with smaller population and consumption variability (Table 12). Variability is estimated based
on previous surveys and a pilot in Mogadishu. The strata for Mogadishu was later amended by an additional 20 enumeration areas
to correct against a faulty optional module assignment in the first days of data collection.

Household Selection
Depending on the strata, different clustering approaches were used. In strata with more volatile security as well as for IDP camps,
a multi-stage cluster design was employed called micro-listing. Each selected enumeration area was divided into multiple segments
and each segment was further divided into blocks. A block is defined as a geographical area where an enumerator can see (and list)
all households from one location in the center of the block. Within each enumeration area, one segment was randomly selected and
within the segment 12 blocks were chosen. In each block, all structures were listed before selecting randomly one structure. Within
the selected structure, all households were listed and one household randomly selected for interview. This multi-stage clustering
approach reduces the time in the field substantially and contributes to a lower profile of enumerators, which is paramount in fragile
areas. In strata less volatile, the complete enumeration area was listed before 12 households were randomly selected for interviews
(called full-listing).

Data Collection and Replacements
The survey was implemented using tablets as survey devices (CAPI). The data collection system consisted of Samsung Smartphones
equipped with SIM cards, mobile data plans, microSD cards (16 GB capacity), and external battery packs. The phones were secured
with Android’s native encryption and protected by a password. GPS tracker helped to track all devices using a web interface
(www.gps-server.net), Barcode Scanner allowed to use barcodes for the identification of enumerators and a parental control
application provided a safe contained working environment for enumerators. Interviews were conducted using SurveyCTO Collect
on the tablet with data transmitted to a secure SurveyCTO server in a cloud computing environment.

EAs were replaced if security rendered field work unfeasible (Table 12). Replacements were approved by the project manager.
Replacement of households were approved by the supervisor after a total of three unsuccessful visits of the household.

Incoming data is processed to create a raw consistent data set. Interviews with wrongly entered EAs were manually corrected.
Interviews conducted outside sampled EAs were discarded. For duplicate submissions, only one record is kept. 2 Sampling weights
are added to the final dataset and subsequently anonymized at the strata level. Missing values are recoded into four different types
of missing values: (i) genuinely missing values coded as “.”; (ii) respondent indicated “don’t know” coded as “.a”; (iii) respondent
refused to respond to the question coded as “.b”; and (iv) missing values due to the questionnaire skipping pattern because the
question does not apply to the respondent coded as “.z”.

Cleaning Process of Submissions
The total number of interviews submitted through SurveyCTO was 4,590, and the breakdown by zone the following:

                 -     A: 1,06
                 -     B: 1,035
                 -     C: 2,366




2Two types of duplicate households are identified. Technical duplicates are defined as duplicate submission of the same interview. They are identified as
households with identical GPS data (latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates). Manual duplicates are defined as two interviews conducted with the same
household. They are identified by almost identical household rosters. The interview with more information is kept based on manual inspection.



                                                                                 3

              -   D: 120

The first step corresponds to a cleaning process identifying general issues and inconsistencies with submissions.

    -    B: 1 empty household record dropped
    -    C
               3 household records deleted as they were submitted through the web and they were part of a test to monitor
                 scripts before fieldwork
               1 submission dropped as it corresponds to a test that a team leader made to check if the GPS of one of his
                 enumerator's phone was working
               1 additional household record dropped as it corresponds to an interview completed by the enumerator to check
                 he had the latest version of the questionnaire

Therefore, after making the described adjustment, the number of correct submissions became 4,584, with the following breakdown
by region:

              -   A: 1,069
              -   B: 1,034
              -   C: 2,361
              -   D: 120

The second step excludes submissions from EAs and blocks that were not included in the final sample.

    -    A: 3 submissions were dropped as they belong to a block that was not included in the final sample
    -    B: 12 submissions dropped, as they correspond to an EA that was not included in the final sample, since it was a
         replacement EA that was never executed
    -    C: 3 interviews dropped because the enumerators selected a wrong EA that had been replaced

Therefore, after making the described adjustment, the number of correct submissions became 4,566, with the following breakdown
by region:

              -   A: 1,066
              -   B: 1,022
              -   C: 2,358
              -   D: 120:

The next step was to validate the acceptance of submissions, for which six criteria were defined and interviews were dropped that
failed to meet at least one of them:

    -    The duration of the interview had to exceed a threshold of 30 minutes
               26 submissions were excluded because they were completed in 30 minutes or less
    -    Random sound bites check, including respondent and enumerator voices. This criterion will be assumed to hold if a
         specific interview was not checked on this criterion.
               No interview was removed for this reason
    -    The interview has GPS coordinates and it was conducted within a buffer area of the correspondent EA
               5 interviews did not have GPS coordinates; and
               5 were also excluded as the GPS coordinates indicate the interview did not took place within the boundaries of
                   the EA
    -    If the interview was not completed in the first visit, then the household record for the first visit must be valid using the
         previous criterions (except for the duration), and both household records must contain a matching GPS positions, with a
         margin of +/- 10 meters
               34 interviews were dropped as they corresponded to a second visit, and the record from the previous visit did
                   not exist or was not valid
               26 additional submissions were not considered, as the GPS coordinates of the first visit did not match with those
                   of the subsequent visit


                                                                          4
                                  Technical Appendix: Wave 1 Somali High Frequency Survey (HFS), Revised: 30th August 2016



    -    If the interview corresponds to a replacement household, the record of the original household must be valid, except for
         the duration of the interview: 67 submissions were not considered as the interview corresponded to a replacement
         household with an inexistent or invalid record for the original household
    -    Finally, unsuccessful interviews were discarded; the ones where no one answered the door, there was not a knowledgeable
         adult present or the respondent did not give permission to continue: 282 submissions were not successful and thus were
         also excluded

Therefore, at this point, the dataset had a total number of 4,121 submissions, with the following breakdown by region:

              -      A: 1,031
              -      B: 929
              -      C: 2,045
              -      D: 116

The final step excludes interviews that were incomplete, and thus have several sections without any single response. 4 households
did not have any record in the sections corresponding to food consumption, assets and livestock, and thus they were excluded.
Therefore, the final dataset includes a total number of 4,117 complete, valid and successful submissions from valid EA and blocks,
with the following breakdown by region:

              -      A: 1,031
              -      B: 929
              -      C: 2,041
              -      D: 116

Sampling weights
This section describes calculation of sample weights for households in the dataset. The sample design was different for some strata
due to security volatility. Thus, the methods differ between micro-listing and full-listing. After the sample weights were calculated
as described below, they were scaled to the number of households accessible with GPS from the sample frame.

    -    Full listing: The sample was drawn in a two-stage process for strata 201-204, 301-304 and 1103-1304. Therefore, the
         weights were calculated based on the sampling probabilities for each sampling stage and for each cluster in the following
         way:
                                                                                             
                                                           ℎ = 1 2 =
                                                                                                  
         such that

                     ℎ : Probability of selecting household h in EA i of strata j
                     P1: Probability of selecting the EA in stage 1
                     P2: Probability of selecting the household in stage 2
                      : Number of EAs selected in strata j
                      : Number of households estimated in the sample frame for EA i
                      : Number of households estimated in the sample frame in strata j
                      : Number of households selected in EA i
                      : Number of households listed in EA i


         Therefore, the sample weight for each household corresponds to

                                                                                    = 1/ℎ




                                                                                    5

     -     Micro-listing: In strata 101, 105, 205 and 305, the sample was segmented in blocks within EAs, in addition to the two-
           stage, stratified cluster sampling, design. 3 Therefore, the weights were calculated based on the sampling probabilities for
           each sampling stage and for each cluster in the following way:
                                                                                                      
                                                             ℎ = 1 2 3 =
                                                                                                                    
           such that

                       ℎ : Probability of selecting household h in EA i of strata j
                       1 : Probability of selecting the EA
                       2 : Probability of selecting the Block
                       3 : Probability of selecting the household
                        : Number of EAs selected in strata j
                        : Number of households estimated in the sample frame for EA i
                        : Number of households estimated in the sample frame in strata j
                        : Number of blocks selected in EA i
                        : Number of blocks in EA i
                        : Number of households selected in EA i
                        : Number of households in EA i


           Therefore, the sample weight for each household corresponds to

                                                                                              = 1/ℎ

Finally, three types of sampling weights were estimated:

1)   Unadjusted weights: Considers all submissions (4,117) and scales the weights so that the sum of the sampling weights by
     analytical strata matches the total number of accessible households with GPS according to sample frame.

2)   Adjusted weights: Considers all submissions (4,117) and scales the weights uniformly so that the sum of the weights by analytical
     strata matches the total number of households according to the PESS (Table 3). 4

3)   Adjusted weights for consumption and poverty variables: Considers only submissions with consumption data (excludes 53
     submissions with missing values in the consumption of food, non-food and durables) and adjusts the weights of the remaining
     4,064 submissions according to the following scenarios:

          If the number of accessible households with GPS (i.e. the sum of weights) is larger than the total number of households
           according to PESS by analytical strata, then the weights were scaled downwards uniformly to match the total number of
           households from PESS, which already reflects the re-allocation of the weights from the 53 submissions excluded

          If the number of accessible households with GPS (i.e. the sum of weights) is smaller than the total number of households
           according to PESS, then the weights were scaled upwards in two steps: i) re-allocating uniformly the weights from the 53
           households excluded across the 4,064 submissions; and then ii) assigning the additional weights needed to match the
           figures from PESS only to those households or submissions in the bottom 25 percent of the total consumption distribution
           for the respective analytical strata. The bottom 25 percent were taking up the weight of the additional households to reflect
           the fact that excluded enumeration areas were not randomly chosen but differed from other enumeration areas by




3The segmentation step cancels out as exactly one segment is chosen.
4Usually, the household number from the sample frame should reflect the number of households from the last Census. However, the incomplete sample frame
necessitated using different (overlapping) data sources for the sample frame. While the probabilities for selection for duplicates are adjusted for already in the EA
selection step, the total number of households did not automatically sum up to the number of households from PESS.



                                                                                              6

             inaccessibility due to security and/or infrastructure. As those enumeration areas are expected to be more deprived than
             the average enumeration area, they were assumed to be similar to the bottom 25 percent.

Consumption Aggregate
The nominal household consumption aggregate is the sum of three components, namely 1) expenditures on food items, 2)
expenditures on non-food items, and 3) the value of the consumption flow from durable goods:
                                                                                    
 (2)                                                                =  +  + 

This section describes in detail the cleaning of the recorded data for each of three components. Subsequently, the construction of
the consumption aggregate using the Rapid Consumption Methodology is explained as well as the estimation of the consumption
flow for durables and the details on the deflator used to calculate spatial price indices.

Moreover, 53 households were assigned a missing value in consumption since 52 of them reported not consuming any food items,
and 1 household only reported consuming a non-core food item.

Cleaning
Food
Food expenditure data is cleaned in a four-step process. First, units for reported quantities of consumption and purchase are
corrected. Typical mistakes include recorded consumption of 100 kg of a product (like salt) where the correct quantity is grams.
These mistakes are corrected using generic rules (Table 5). Then, we introduce a conversion factor to kg for some specific items
and units. For example, we recognize that a small piece of bread must have a different weight than a small piece of garlic (Table 6:
). The third step consists of correcting issues with the exchange rate selected (Table 7). Finally, outliers are detected using the six
cleaning rules below to correct quantities and prices.

       -     Rule 1

                  o    Consumption quantities with missing values for items reported as consumed were replaced with item-specific
                       median consumption quantities.

                  o    Missing purchase quantities and missing prices for items consumed were replaced with item-specific median
                       purchase quantity and item-specific median purchase price.

       -     Rule 2: Records where the respondent did not know or refused to respond if the household had consumed the item, were
             replaced with the mean value, including non-consumed records.

       -     Rule 3: Records with the same value for quantity consumed or quantity purchased and price are assumed to have a data
             entry error in the price or quantity and are replaced with the item-specific medians.

       -     Rule 4: Records that have the same value in quantity consumed and quantity purchased but different units are assumed to
             have a wrong unit either for consumption or purchase. For both quantities, the item-specific distribution of quantities in




                                                                                           7
                                 Technical Appendix: Wave 1 Somali High Frequency Survey (HFS), Revised: 30th August 2016



           kg is calculated to determine the deviation of the entered figure from the median of the distribution. The unit of the
           quantity that is further away from the median is corrected with the unit of the quantity closer to the median.

    -      Rule 5:

               o     Missing and zero prices are replaced with item-specific medians

               o     Outliers for unit prices were identified and replaced with the item-specific median. This includes unit prices in
                     the top 10 percent of the overall cumulative distribution (considering all items), and unit prices below 0.07 USD.

    -      Rule 6: the consumption value in USD was truncated to the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation of the cumulative
           distribution for each item, if the record exceeded this threshold.

All medians are estimated at the EA level if a minimum of 5 observations are available excluding previously tagged records. If the
minimum number of observations is not met, medians are estimated at the strata-level before proceeding to the survey level. In
addition, medians greater than 20 kg and smaller than 0.02 kg were not considered for quantities, while medians greater than 20
USD and smaller than 0.005 USD were also excluded for unit prices.



Non-Food
The non-food dataset only contains values without quantities and units. First, we apply the same cleaning rules for currencies (Table
7), and then the following cleaning rules:

    -      Rule 1: Zero, missing prices and missing currency for purchased items are replaced with item-specific medians.

    -      Rule 2: Records where the respondent did not know or refused to respond if the household had purchased the item, were
           replaced with the mean value, including non-consumed records.

    -      Rule 3: Prices that are beyond a specific threshold for each recall period (Table 8) are replaced with item-specific medians.

    -      Rule 4: Prices below the 1 percent and above the 95 percent of the cumulative distribution for each item are replaced with
           item-specific medians

    -      Rule 5: the purchase value in USD was truncated to the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation of the cumulative
           distribution for each item, if the record exceeded this threshold.

The item-specific medians were applied at the EA, strata and survey level as described above.



Durables
For durables, we also apply the same cleaning rules for currencies (Table 7), and then the following cleaning rules:

    -      Rule 1: Vintages with missing values and greater than 10 years are replaced with item-specific medians.

    -      Rule 2: Current and purchase prices equal to zero are replaced with item-specific medians.

    -      Rule 3: Records that have the same figure in current value and purchase price are incorrect. For both, the item-vintage-
           specific distribution is calculated to determine the deviation of the entered figure from the median. The one that is further
           away from that median is corrected with the item-year-specific median value.

    -      Rule 4: Depreciation rates are replaced by the item-specific medians in the following cases:

               o     Negative records

               o     Depreciation rates in the top 10 percent and vintage of one year

               o     Depreciation rates in the bottom 10 percent and a vintage greater or equal to 3 years



                                                                            8

     -     Rule 5: Records with 100 items or more, and those that reported to own a durable good but did not report the number
           were replaced with the item-specific medians of consumption in USD

     -     Rule 6: Consumption in the top and bottom 1 percent of the overall distribution were replaced with item-specific medians

     -     Rule 7: Records where the respondent did not know or refused to respond if the household owned the asset, were replaced
           with the mean consumption value, including non-consumed records.

     -     Rule 8: the consumption value in USD was truncated to the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation of the cumulative
           distribution for each item, if the record exceeded this threshold.

All medians are estimated at the EA level if a minimum of 3 observations are available excluding previously tagged records. If the
minimum number of observations is not met, medians are estimated at the strata-level before proceeding to the survey level. Table
9 contains a general overview of consumption of durables, while Table 10 presents the details by item. Table 11 shows the median
depreciation rate by durable good.

Rapid Consumption Methodology: Food and Non-Food Aggregates
The survey used the new Rapid Consumption methodology to estimate consumption. A detailed description including an ex post
assessment of the methodology is available in a separate document. 5 The rapid survey consumption methodology consists of five
main steps. First, core items are selected based on their importance for consumption. Second, the remaining items are partitioned
into optional modules. Third, optional modules are assigned to groups of households. After data collection, fourth, consumption
of optional modules is imputed for all households. Fifth, the resulting consumption aggregate is used to estimate poverty indicators.

First, core consumption items are selected. Consumption in a country bears some variability but usually a small number of a few
dozen items captures the majority of consumption. These items are assigned to the core module, which will be administered to all
households. Important items can be identified by its average food share per household or across households. Previous consumption
surveys in the same country or consumption shares of neighboring / similar countries can be used to estimate food shares. 6 In the
worst case, a random assignment results in a larger standard error but does not introduce a bias.

Second, non-core items are partitioned into optional modules. Different methods can be used for the partitioning into optional
modules. In the simplest case, the remaining items are ordered according to their food share and assigned one-by-one while iterating
over the optional module in each step. A more sophisticated method takes into account correlation between items and partitions
them into orthogonal sets per module. This leads to high correlation between modules supporting the total consumption estimation.
Conceptual division into core and optional items is not reflected in the layout of the questionnaire. Rather, all items per household
will be grouped into categories of consumption items (like cereals) and different recall periods. Using CAPI, it is straight-forward
to hide the modular structure from the enumerator.

Third, optional modules will be assigned to groups of households. Assignment of optional modules will be performed randomly
stratified by enumeration areas to ensure appropriate representation of optional modules in each enumeration area. This step is
followed by the actual data collection.

Fourth, household consumption will be estimated by imputation. The average consumption of each optional module can be
estimated based on the sub-sample of households assigned to the optional module. In the simplest case, a simple average can be
estimated. More sophisticated techniques can employ a welfare model based on household characteristics and consumption of the
core items. The results presented in this note uses a multiple imputation technique based on a multi-variate normal approximation.

Next, the methodology is formalized and assessed using an ex post simulation based on the consumption data from Hergeiza using
the Somaliland 2012 household survey (SHS12). Food and non-food consumption for household i are estimated by the sum of
expenditures for a set of items

6As shown later, the assignment of items to modules is very robust and, thus, even rough estimates of consumption shares are sufficient to inform the assignment
without requiring a baseline survey.

The item assignment to the modules are based on the SHS12 survey with manual modifications especially to treat ‘other’ items
correctly. 7 The core module was designed to maximize its consumption share resulting in 91 percent and 76 percent of food
respectively non-food consumption captures in the core modules (based on SHS12 consumption; Table 2). Optional modules are
constructed using an algorithm to assign items iteratively to optional modules so that items are orthogonal within modules and
correlated between modules. In each step, an unassigned item with highest consumption share is selected. For each module, total
per capita consumption is regressed on household size, the consumption of all assigned items to this module as well as the new
unassigned item. The item will be assigned to the module with the highest increase in the R2 relative to the regression excluding the
new unassigned item. The sequenced assignment of items based on their consumption share can lead to considerable differences in
the captured consumption share across optional modules. Therefore, a parameter is introduced ensuring that in each step of the
assignment procedure the difference in the number of assigned items per module does not exceed d. Using d=1 assigns items to
modules (almost) maximizing equal consumption share across modules. 8 Increasing d puts increasing weight on orthogonality within
and correlation between modules. The parameter was set to d=3 balancing the two objectives.

In each enumeration area, 12 households were interviewed with an ideal partition of three items per optional module. 9 The
assignment of optional modules must ensure that a sufficient number of households are assigned to each optional module.
Household consumption was then estimated using the core module, the assigned module and estimates for the remaining optional
modules

where  ∗ ∶= {1, … ,  ∗ − 1,  ∗ + 1, … , } denotes the set of non-assigned optional modules. Consumption of non-assigned
optional modules is estimated using multiple imputation techniques taking into account the variation absorbed in the residual term.

Multiple imputation was implemented using multi-variate normal regression based on an EM-like algorithm to iteratively estimate
model parameters and missing data. This technique is guaranteed to converge in distribution to the optimal values. An EM algorithm
draws missing data from a prior (often non-informative) distribution and runs an OLS to estimate the coefficients. Iteratively, the
coefficients are updated based on re-estimation using imputed values for missing data drawn from the posterior distribution of the
model. The implemented technique employs a Data-Augmentation (DA) algorithm, which is similar to an EM algorithm but updates
parameters in a non-deterministic fashion unlike the EM algorithm. Thus, coefficients are drawn from the parameter posterior
distribution rather than chosen by likelihood maximization. Hence, the iterative process is a Monte-Carlo Markov –Chain (MCMC)
in the parameter space with convergence to the stationary distribution that averages over the missing data. The distribution for the




7 Items ‘other’ are often found to capture remaining items for a food category. Using the Rapid Consumption Methodology, this creates problems as ‘other’ will

include different items depending on which optional module is administered. This can lead to double-counting after the imputation. Therefore, ‘other’ items are
re-formulated and carefully assigned so that double counting cannot occur.
8 Even with d=1, equal consumption share across modules is not maximized because among the modules with the same number of assigned items, the new item

will be assigned to the module it’s most orthogonal to; rather than to the module with lowest consumption share.

enumeration areas are not completely balanced.

The performance of the estimation technique was assessed based on an ex post simulation using the Hergeiza data from SHS12 and
mimicking the Rapid Consumption methodology by masking consumption of items that were not administered to households. The
results of the simulation were compared with the estimates using the full consumption from SHS12 as reference. The simulation
results distinguish between different levels of aggregation to estimate consumption. 10 The methodology generally does not perform
well at the household level (HH) but improves considerably already at the enumeration area level (EA) where the average of 12
households is estimated. At the national aggregation level, the Rapid Consumption methodology slightly over-estimates
consumption by 0.3 percent. Assessing the standard poverty measures including poverty headcount (FGT0), poverty depth (FGT1)
and poverty severity (FGT2), the simulation results show that the Rapid Consumption methodology retrieves estimates within 1.5
percent of the reference measure (Figure 3). Generally, the estimates are robust as suggested by the low standard errors (Figure 4).

Durable consumption flow
The consumption aggregate includes the consumption flow of durables calculated based on the user-cost approach. The
consumption flow distributes the consumption value of the durable over multiple years. The user-cost principle defines the
consumption flow of an item as the difference of selling the asset at the beginning and the end of the year as this is the opportunity




10 The performance of the estimation techniques is presented using the relative bias (mean of the error distribution) and the relative standard error. The relative
error is defined as the percentage difference of the estimated consumption and the reference consumption (based on the full consumption module, averaged over
all imputations). The relative bias is the average of the relative error. The relative standard error is the standard deviation of the relative error. The simulation is
run over different household-module assignments while ensuring that each optional module is assigned equally often to a household per enumeration. The relative
bias and the relative standard error are reported across all simulations.

cost of the household for keeping the item. The opportunity cost is composed of the difference in the sales price and the forgone
earnings on interest if the asset is sold at the beginning of the year.

If the durable item is sold at the beginning of the year, the household would receive the market price pt for the item and the interest
on the revenue for one year. With it denoting the interest rate, the value of the item thus is  (1 +  ). If the item is sold at the end
of the year, the household will receive the depreciated value of the item while considering inflation. With  being the inflation rate
during the year t, the household would obtain  (1 +  )(1 −  ) with the annual physical or technological depreciation rate
denoted as  assumed constant over time. 11 The difference between these two values is the cost that the household is willing to pay
for using the durable good for one year. Hence, the consumption flow is:

     (3)                                                     y  =  (1 +  ) −  (1 +  )(1 −  )

By assuming that  ×  ≅ 0, the equation simplifies to

     (4)                                                            y  =  ( −  +  ) =  ( +  )
where  is the real market interest rate in period t. Therefore, the consumption flow of an item can be estimated by the current
market value  , the current real interest rate  , and the depreciation rate  . Assuming an average annual inflation rate , the
depreciation rates  can be estimated utilizing its relationship to the market price 12:

     (5)                                                                    = − (1 + ) (1 −  )
The equation can be solved for  obtaining:
                                                                                                                 1

Based on this equation, item-specific median depreciation rates are estimated assuming an inflation rate of 0.5 percent, a nominal
interest rate of 2.0 percent and, thus, a real interest rate of 1.5 percent (Table 11).

For all households owning a durable but did not report the current value of the durable, the item-specific median consumption flow
is used. For households that own more than one of the durable, the consumption flow of the newest item is added to the item-
specific median of the consumption flow times the number of those items without counting the newest item. 13

Deflator
Prices fluctuate considerably between regions, thus we calculated spatial price indices using a common food basket and spatial prices
to make consumption comparable across regions. The Laspeyres index is chosen as a deflator due to its moderate data requirements.
The deflator is calculated by analytical strata areas based on the price data collected by the HFS.

The Laspeyres index reflects the item-weighted relative price differences across products. Item weights are estimated as household-
weighted average consumption share across all households before imputation. Based on the democratic approach, consumption
shares are calculated at the household level. Core items use total household core consumption as reference while items from optional
modules use the total assigned optional module household consumption as reference. The shares are aggregated at the national level
(using household weights) and then calibrated by average consumption per module to arrive at item-weights summing to 1. The
item-weights are applied to the relative differences of median item prices for each analytical strata. Missing prices are replaced by
the item-specific median over all households. A large Laspeyres indicates a high price level deflating consumption stronger than a

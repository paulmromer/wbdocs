Executive Summary

Government strategy for improving piped water supply services – partnering with the private sector

With the exception of Myanmar, Cambodia has the lowest access to piped water supply in the South East Asia
region, which was estimated to be 21% in 2015. Less than one in ten rural households (7%) have access to piped
water services on their premises, while for urban households, three out of four households enjoy these services
(75%) (WHO and UNICEF, 2015). Against this backdrop, the Government of Cambodia in its National Strategic
Development Plan 2014-2018 (Royal Government of Cambodia, 2013) prioritizes the acceleration of access to
piped water services, in partnership with the domestic private sector. Private water operators are licensed and
regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH). Scarce public domestic financial resources are solely
channeled to state-owned utilities and enforcement of regulations is generally weak. With the exception of the
French Development Agency (AFD), most development partners focus their grant and lending support on public
utility investments.

In 2012 the private sector is already estimated to provide 1.4 million Cambodians with piped water services, with
the immediate potential for expansion of existing schemes covering another 2 million and further new schemes
that could viably be developed for another 3 million Cambodians (Sy, Warner, & Jamieson, 2014) and ( (DFAT,
2014). Around 300 private sector utilities, around half of which are licensed by the Ministry of Industry and
Handicraft (MIH), have a market share of almost 50% of those with access to piped services, mostly situated in
rural towns and agglomerations of settlements, with 750 to over 3000 household connections. Driven by demand
for higher services, the private sector in Cambodia will be an important driver for increasing access to piped water
supply, especially in the rapidly urbanizing rural growth centers of Cambodia.

It is evident that the climate within which domestic private water providers operate needs to offer favorable public
support and incentives to expand services, especially to the poor. Given the internal and external challenges that
water operators face, and in order to optimize service delivery from the presence of such a thriving private sector,
three critical bottlenecks need to be addressed:
      i)       Professionalizing water operations,
      ii)      Enabling access to finance, and
      iii)     Strengthening regulatory oversight and dialogue with the private sector.

This synthesis report documents the implementation process, results, and lessons learned under a three-year
                                    1
Technical Assistance (TA) program , and presents recommendations going forward. For comprehensiveness,
annexes are attached that include all supporting documentation and resources developed under this TA.

What was the Technical Assistance trying to achieve?

A decade ago, the private water sector was characterized by fragmented non-organized operators, often not
recording any data or adhering to standard operation and maintenance procedures. Reforms on sector legislation
and regulation, laid down in a draft Water Law (2005) were not moving ahead and there was dialogue between
private and public sector. Building up capacities of water operators and the local institutions that could provide
such support seemed to be a first necessary step and led to WSP’s earlier engagement with nine water operators
(Chan, 2010). This TA aimed to scale up capacity building services and address a wider range of barriers for private
sector growth. The development objective of the TA was to strengthen the capacity of domestic private water
providers to deliver piped water supply services outside the service area of public water utilities in Cambodia .



1
    Execution from January 2013 till 30 January 2016; overall budget was USD 1.6 million for including variable and fixed costs


                                                                                                                                  7
The TA focused on strengthening institutions, so that industry-wide replication and policy change could be
facilitated. Hence, both the MIH as regulator and policy maker, and the Cambodia Water Supply Association
(CWA), a membership organization of licensed private water providers founded in 2012, were the primary
audiences. Close synergies were sought with the Access-to-Finance program financed by AFD/EU, to optimize
results.

The TA tried to achieve the following:
    i)        Improving performance of private water operators by accessing Business Development Services
              (BDS)
    ii)       Mobilizing investments from local commercial banks through Access-to-Finance services (A2F)
    iii)      Strengthening the regulatory framework and sector monitoring of domestic private water operators
    iv)       Enhancing industry organization, dialogue and knowledge about private sector provision


What did the Technical Assistance cover and what was achieved?

The TA interventions covered a range of activities in support of CWA, as well as to MIH, summarized in Table 1.

     Nationally representative study to quantify poor-inclusiveness of licensed private water operators,
     sensitivities of poor households to tariffs and fees, and characteristic of water expenses and consumption

The following key outcomes were achieved over the course of this TA:

1.       Results from the BDS program:

All 47 participating operators, or a third of all licensed schemes in Cambodia, paid fees to CWA for participating in
the BDS program, i.e. USD 612 for beginners to USD 1,289 for advanced, stimulating market-based delivery of such
services in the future. The packages consisted of 8-9 group training, 2-4 coaching visits and other remote support.
Key results are:

        Connections growth of 21%, with 12,135 new connection installed reaching a total of 69,300 connections
         or 345,000 people, who benefit from better services; operators invested USD 1.4 million during the
         program
        Service coverage on average across all licensed areas increased from 31% to 36%
        Water quality improvements stagnated at 57% pass rate; only 15% of operators improved water quality
        Half of operators improved net income per connection, two-thirds were able to increase revenue per
         connection, and half decreased their operating expense per connection

                                                                                                                      8
        Non-Revenue Water decreased from 15% to 9%; water pressure in network increased from 9 to 12 mH2O
        Almost all (93%) now use software tools for billing, up from only 57% at the start of the program;
         expenses registration and technical monitoring have also improved




CWA has taken an increasing role in the delivery of the training and coaching and is expected to continue to deliver
BDS services to their members, in collaboration with local consultants. The aim is to gradually bring cost and
revenues in equilibrium and using third party agreements with local firms (e.g. for software license and support).
The objective is to phase out subsidies for sophisticated operators in the medium term and increase charges
towards cost-covering fees, while targeting remaining subsidies for capacity development to less advanced
operators, who have lower ability to pay.

2.       Results from A2F program:

Demand for services was high, with fees structured in two stages: 250 USD for the initial pre-financing study, and
USD 1,000-2,000, depending on loan size, for the detailed investment study. In total 29 operators were selected
and developed a pre-financing proposal. Nine operators did not continue to the investment planning stage due to
low debt service coverage ratios, insufficient collateral, or due to the urgency to make investments and preference
to borrow smaller amounts for which no project financing proposal was required. For twenty operators detailed
investment plans and financial models were prepared and loan negotiations were facilitated. This is expected to
lead to 20 loans signed with a total value of USD 5.5 million, leveraging USD 0.5 million in equity. As of December
2015, 9 loans equaling USD 3.75 million have already been formally approved, USD 1.5 million has been disbursed,
5 operators have started construction and 1 operator has completed construction. All other 15 applications are
expected to be approved in the first quarter of 2016. Investments are mostly geared to expansions in the
distribution network (58%), but also a high share goes to water treatment plant improvements (20%) and 12%
towards proper detailed design and construction supervision.

These 20 investment projects are expected to:
     By 2020 connect 169,000 additional people, while a total of 324,000 people will benefit from the
        improvements in water quantity, reliability and quality in these schemes.
     On a national scale, these 20 investments alone will represents improved services for around 10% of the
        population, and an increase in national access of over 5% by 2020 (up from 21% in 2015).

All 20 operators will have signed loan agreements with Foreign Trade Bank (FTB), a local bank which enjoys AFD
support through a concessional credit line as well as a partial risk guarantee and is thus able to offer favorable
                    2
terms to operators . Close and continuous dialogue with AFD and its technical assistance partners has resulted in
the development of a streamlined protocol for screening, due diligence and delivery of a tailored loan-product for
the water sector, which is no longer based on hard- collateral. Newly introduced collateral assessments allow for: i)
100% of land/buildings, including soft titles, ii) 50% of water infrastructure assets, and iii) 50% of the NPV of cash
flows generated by existing water schemes based on 10 year projection at a 15% discount rate. Unlike previous
water operator investments, investment plans are based on sound technical assessments and financial models,
and qualified supervision during construction is a condition of lending for FTB. A guidance note to lenders
reflecting the lessons from this experience will be disseminated to encourage local banks to step up their
engagement in the water sector and alter their loan product and practices. Out of the nine operators that did not
proceed to a detailed investment plan, seven were able to access finance from commercial or informal lenders and
invested a total of USD 0.8 million (of which USD 0.5 million debt from commercial banks, and USD 0.3 million
equity, including loans from relatives).

  These terms are 7.26% interest rate per annum (may change in future), 4-10 years term, 12 month grace period and 100% of
loan required in collateral


                                                                                                                             9
Organizational capacities of CWA have markedly improved since its registration in August 2012, now covering 70%
of all licensed schemes. CWA’s strategic plan 2014-2019 articulates priority areas as identified in Table 2,
summarizing the key achievements thus far.




4.       Strengthening regulatory environment and monitoring capacities of MIH:

While recognizing that the overall legal framework remains incomplete, the TA aimed to make gradual
improvements to introduce more transparency and predictability in the licensing and tariff setting process. The TA
has helped to prepare a new licensing prakas (ministerial decree), issued in May 2014, which:
     Clarifies procedures for the issuance, revision, suspension and revocation of licenses
     Allows both direct granting of licenses, as well as competitive tendering of licenses by MIH
     Defines requirements for applications, which include System and Built-out plans and feasibility studies
     Extends the license period from 3 to 20 years, with a 5-year renewal of licensee’s operating certificate


Table 2 Achievements CWA organizational development as per strategic plan

Strategic priority        Achievement thus far

                               Since 2014 member of International Water Association (IWA)

There remain challenges in the implementation of the new licensing prakas due to limited capacity and staffing
the Department of Potable Water Supply (DPWS).

Table 3 illustrates the status of the licensing application thus far. To account for the overwhelming demand, MIH
has automatically extended expired licenses with a three year-period. As of January 2016, five 20-year licenses
have been issued, although the number is expected to jump over the coming months.




Table 3 Overview of status of implementation of licensing regulation

License type     Progress
                 3 licenses for 20 year have been issued replacing old license following due process (Nov 2014,
Replacement      Jun 2015, and Nov 2015)
(20 years)       1 license for 20 year has been issued for Phnom Penh Economic Zone to existing (unlicensed)
                 supplier of water to factories
                 1 competitive license has been granted (with GRET support)
Direct           103 applications for feasibility study submitted, of which 101 approved
(20 years)       54 applicants submitted the feasibility study and built out plan, of which 39 have been
                 approved by MIH committee and passed public hearing
                 3 have been send back with comments; and 12 have not yet been reviewed
                 Out of 39 approved studies, only 1 20-year license has been issued on Jan 2016; others are
                 expected to be issued soon
Renewal          80 existing three-year licenses have been approved for automatic extension with 3 years
(3 years)

The TA helped to formulate a framework for economic regulation, drafted a prakas on Tariff Determination and
Review and has facilitated consultation. The decree is slated for issuance in February 2016, and:
     Clarifies procedures for setting and subsequent five-year revision of tariffs, including public consultation,
        and allows for interim reviews in case of hyperinflation or other shocks that would warrant such review
     Is based on principle of full cost recovery, encouraging efficiencies, allowing reasonable costs
     Caps profit through setting a reasonable return on investment based on an Cambodia-based industry-
        wide weighted average cost of capital that includes an inflation component, with the discretion for
        scheme-based adjustments (e.g. in case capital consists partly of grants/donations, or for public providers)
     Uses different tariff methodologies, but based on the same principles, for two categories of operators,
        using less data-intensive annuity method for small operators, and more sophisticated method for larger
        utilities (> 2000 connections), namely cash flow method
     Stipulates pro-poor tariff provisions informed by evidence
MIH-DPWS staff has been trained in the use of the different tariff models, however application has not yet
happened as the decree is not yet issued. Tariff models (in template spreadsheet models) and user guide have
been made available to MIH-DPWS.


                                                                                                                  11
Finally, achievements with respect to the establishment and capacity building of the Water Services Monitoring are
the following, although follow-up assistance is required for consolidation:
      Based on agreed monitoring framework for water providers, software package has successfully been
          developed and pilot-tested, with positive feedback from users (public and private)
      MIH commitment and ownership illustrated as hosting and maintenance requirements for the system are
          financed MIH have assigned staff roles (although still limited)
      Training has been delivered across 24 provinces to all departmental staff and two third of private licensed
          water operators has been reached
      System has been formally launched in January 2016 (http://wsms.mih.gov.kh/)

What have we learnt?

A number of lessons have been learnt from this TA which will be important to inform future support to the
Cambodian government. Most of these lessons have also global relevance, especially for countries with a
fragmented water industry, characterized by hundreds of domestic private providers that form the backbone of
service delivery outside public utility-served cities. Detailed lessons for each of the components of the TA are listed
in Box 8, Box 9 and Box 10, and some are summarized below:




Moving from firm to industry-wide capacities
    Strengthening industry-wide capacities requires working towards a market-based approach for business
        development services using national platforms, such as industry association
    Introducing fees for services gradually shift operators willingness-to-pay for services, opening
        opportunities for local BDS-providers
    A harmonized approach by development partners is critical for delivery of market-based BDS, preventing
        dampening of future demand and spoiling of a nascent market
    Content and price of BDS package needs to match ability-to-pay of different operator segments and
        willingness-to-pay for different services
    Replication of business development services is not yet financially sustainable, and needs to develop a
        long-term phase-out strategy towards higher levels of cost recovery through:
                 i)       Adjustment of package content and conditions to reduce costs, including outsourcing
                          services with high willingness-to-pay (e.g. software support) to local firms/consultants,
                 ii)      Differentiate BDS services with full cost recovery for sophisticated, larger operators, and
                          allocate remaining subsidies to less advanced operators and less valued/in-demand
                          services

Facilitating Access to Finance
      Bank technical assistance and credit enhancement instruments are needed to introduce new collateral
          assessment practices: practices in FTB changed significantly to include water infrastructure assets and the
          NPV of future cash flows of existing schemes towards collateral, the latter being capped at half the
          collateral requirement.
      Assumptions in the investment study, financial model and technical assessment need to be acceptable
          and closely aligned with the bank’s internal guidelines and procedures to ensure a smooth approval
          process;
      Bank engagement activities and lender forums can stimulate interest in the sector and have led to a
          better understanding of water sector lending characteristics; however, additional instruments are needed
          for banks to shift from purely collateral-backed lending to project financing approaches, that would
          further expand loan tenures and grace period
      Partnership with AFD’s program optimized the use of scarce technical assistance funds, and leveraged
          USD 5.5 million debt and USD 0.4 million equity investments



                                                                                                                    12
Enhancing public support for private sector provision
     Improvements in the legal regulatory environment need to be accompanied with adequate consultation
        and dialogue with the private sector, but equally with medium term assistance to execute regulations and
        gain credibility
     To comply with new license regulation, assistance is needed to help operators prepare applications and
        feasibility studies, and to the regulator (MIH-DPWS) in managing the license execution process in a
        transparent and speedy matter;
     The consultation on the new tariff regulation has created heightened awareness among operators on i)
        service obligations – including to the poor - that come with a monopoly right, and ii) the necessity to
        substantiate submissions with proper data;
     Building a sustainable sector monitoring system requires top-level support, alignment with human and
        financial resources and capacities of host and users; assistance post-handover is necessary to ensure
        sustainable usage and help with sector analytics
     Strengthening CWA in executing its strategic priorities lead to growth and maturation, which in turn
        helped to prevent the association from being “captured? by other interests
     Industry associations tend to be subject to mission creep in the quest to attract financial resources
        through partnership arrangements; focus is to be maintained by CWA on strategic priorities, while
        ensuring that sufficient income is secured through membership fees




Conclusion, recommendations and way forward

This technical assistance has illustrated that incentives for private water operators to use business development
services vary, e.g. i) pressures for compliance with regulation, ii) opportunities to access finance by better business
plans, or ii) impacting the bottom line through more efficient business and operational practices and smarter
investment decisions. Institutionalizing market-based BDS-programs within CWA as industry association can be a
sustainable, scalable and effective alternative to “one-off? project-based capacity building to professionalize small
water operators. Building a local market and demand for business development services requires the introduction
of a transactional relationships between water operator and local BDS provider(s) gradually striving for cost
recovery of fees. A long-term phase-out strategy for subsidies is needed, in which a differentiated approach would
be used to allocate subsidies only to less advanced operators and for specific services that remain undervalued.
CWA has played an effective role as matchmaker to pool demand and promote efficient delivery of business
development services. This resulted in positive changes in technical, business and financial performance, as well as
changed skills, attitudes and operator practices, and as well as appreciation of the added value of BDS. National
platforms, such as CWA, can also play an important role in the further professionalization of a fragmented water
industry characterized by weak capacities, through i) stimulating professional and pro-poor business practices, ii)
raising awareness and dialogue on sector developments, iii) offering support services to help operators comply
with new regulations and iv) strengthening network with value chain actors, v) facilitating A2F programs of local
banks in collaboration with development partners.
Close alignment with AFD/EU Access-to-Finance program allowed WSP’s modest technical assistance program to
                                                                                            3
leverage commercial financing from local banks, estimated to be a total of USD 6.0 million , as well as USD 0.7
       4
million in additional equity. This is projected to lead to a 5% increase in access to piped water by 2020, while
another group of 20 operators will be supported in the next 2-3 years to access finance with an expected volume
of USD 5 million, using a similar processes.



3
  USD 5.5 million from AFD concessional credit line (of which USD 3.4 million approved by Dec 2015); and USD 0.5 million
through other commercial banks;
4
  USD 0.4 million equity from the 20 proposals that got financed through FTB, and USD 0.3 million from the 9 proposals that got
financed through other commercial banks.


                                                                                                                            13
Both professionalization and acceleration of services provision require complementary measures to address the
regularity and enabling environment for operators. While the technical assistance has made important gains in this
area, further reform and capacity building of MIH to execute the new regulations is paramount. Only with effective
implementation of licensing and tariff decrees and related monitoring requirements, will BDS and A2F programs be
fully effective. Other than capacity building, this may also require internal reforms within MIH, such as raising the
Department of Potable Water Supply to the level of a General Directorate, including the necessary human and
financial resources, followed by the establishment of an independent regulatory body in the medium to long term
(requires a Water Law to be passed, slated for 2017).
Sector transition to inject public finance
The most attractive and viable investment sites are expected to be served over the next few years through equity
                                                                             5
and debt financing. However, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals , Cambodia will need to transition to
a new era where subsidies are allocated to leverage private sector investments (equity and debt) in less viable new
sites, e.g. through grants, concessional loans or domestic public transfers. This transition to serve poorer, more
“rural? areas with piped services may also require that debt financing arrangements reflect longer tenures and
grace period to reflect the longer recovery times and liquidity constraints in early years of operation from less
dense urban sites. Such subsidies could be best allocated through a competitive licensing process, based on a
longer-term master plan that would identify and prioritize investment sites, using commercial viability gap
financing (VGF) and potentially subsidy payments to cover cash deficits in early years of scheme operation. Such
process would require strong involvement of the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft and would contribute to
higher transparency and better value for money for rural customers.
In the longer term, different business models for private sector involvement may need to be considered through
bundling of sites, as well as through other PPP modalities than the existing full privatization under license.
In addition to green field investments and expansions into non-viable areas, “densification? is required, as
                                                                                                          6
connection rates in areas under network are 50% for the non-poor and only 20% for poor household . Private
water operators may require incentives such as output-based subsidies to close this equity gap, e.g. through a
national “Water for all Facility? under stewardship of MIH, as foreseen in the National Strateg ic Development Plan
2014-2018.
The above sector transition will require a closer harmonization of development partners supporting the sector to
arrive at a consistent and transparent policy and procedures for granting such subsidies. Preferably, this would
lead in the long-term to harmonized arrangements and potentially a facility that would be able to leverage public
funds from multiple sources. It would also require scaled-up access to local commercial finance. The ongoing
AFD/EU Access-to-Finance program, which includes local commercial finance and limited amount of grants, as well
as the investment project of DFAT, hosted with the Cambodian Development Council, provide opportunities for
the government to achieve such transition. Moreover, leveraging grant financing in the medium-term from the
World Bank’s Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), will allow the government to pilot the Viability
Gap Financing approach and gain valuable experience that can be replicated at scale through a potential future
sector wide approach towards private sector provision.
Recommendations are for medium and long-term are summarized below.
Recommendations for Ministry of Industry and Handicraft

Short to Medium-term:
     Build capacity and expand assigned staff and resources of MIH-DPWS to execute its regulatory and
         monitoring mandate, transforming the Department into a General Directorate for Potable Water Supply;
     Continue support to provincial DIHs for monitoring and encourage self-reporting by water operators for
         compliance; recognize DIHs for timely and complete data entry and develop field verification protocols for
         gradual improvement of data quality in the Water Services Monitoring System (WSMS)

5
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set a higher bar for service delivery than the MDGs (using “improved water
source?). The SDGs require 100% access to safely managed drinking water by 2030, which includes regulated water services at
the premise, of reliable and sufficient quantity, and quality.
6 In Cambodia poor households are identified through a poor-identification system, which is based on a combination of asset
screening and community assessments. The poor (also called ID-poor 1 and ID-poor 2) are given identification cards and
herewith can access a number of services for free or at reduced cost.


                                                                                                                        14
       Analyze and publicize data through WMWS-MIH website through an annual benchmarking exercise,
        covering increasingly more water operators
       Expand the Water Services Monitoring System to include work flow monitoring of licensing and tariff
        review process, leading to timely execution and increased transparency (and less rent seeking behavior)
       Mobilize resources for better water quality testing and act on non-compliance of water providers;
       Implement competitive tendering for new license applications and potentially look at clustering of sites to
        increase economies of scale and viability;
       Leverage available grants (e.g. GPOBA, DFAT 3i) for new investment sites to pilot commercial viability gap
        financing under competitive licensing; develop harmonized policy and procedures for the use of such
        grants
       Implement pro-poor connection policies (pro-poor tariffs, capped connection fees) and set-up a “Water
        for All? connection facility, as incentives to private operators to connect poor households
       Continue dialogue with CWA and foster linkages with well performing public utilities to support BDS
        provision;

Medium to Long-term:
    Develop joint accreditation scheme with CWA for consultants to help operators prepare license
       applications and tariff submissions.
    Gradually transition from a full equity approach to introducing public funding (from various sources,
       including grants, concessional finance, domestic resources) into private water sector provision to reach
       less-viable and poorer rural areas;
    Develop a longer-term master plan for investment sites for private sector, through a market
       identification, screening and prioritization process; and work pro-actively with development partners to
       allocate funding
    Develop a facility/financing structure to attract pooled financing from various sources/development
       partners to allocate public finance to new rural potable water schemes
    Develop a guarantee-scheme for several local banks, or work with development partners to do so, in
       order to expand Access-to-Finance on more suitable terms (longer tenure, grace period, collateral)
    Develop clear coordination and implementation mechanisms with the Ministry of Rural Development for
       piped water schemes that may receive finance through MRD
    Improve legal and institutional environment through Water Law and prepare comprehensive legal
       framework for PPPs in water sector, articulating role of decentralized government


Recommendations to Cambodia Water Association
Short to Medium term
       Carry out a mid-term review in 2016 to refocus role, key-functions, priorities of the associations, and
        review its current business model, including a strategy to reduce dependencies on large financiers
       Continue to market and deliver break-even BDS-services, including software licensing and support
        services (ERMS), and potentially group trainings; differentiate and unbundle BDS package to attract more
        operators
       Develop a network of external consultants for specialized services (taxation, legal services, and technical
        assessments) and market those on a cost recovery basis.
       Continue to monitor member performance, gather and provide market information to stakeholders and
        business partners, and represent members’ interest in regular dialogue with MIH
       Continue diversified partnerships with development partners in line with strategic plan.


Medium to Long-term
    Develop a phase-out strategy for subsidies through further differentiation of services and operator;
       strategically allocate reduced subsidies to less advanced operators for services that are undervalued
    Develop new accredited services for members in collaboration with MIH through accreditation of
       consultants that can support, e.g. license application development and tariff submission preparation




                                                                                                                15
        Develop long-term relationships with local vocational training centers, local universities and MIH, to
         develop a skill-based training program for different job-positions within water utilities, as well as for utility
         management positions


Opportunities for further World Bank Group engagement
Opportunities to support the government in the implementation of the above recommendations exist now that
the World Bank Group’s Country Engagement Note is being prepared. While detailed scoping will be required, the
following ideas offer a way forward for increased World Bank Group engagement:
        Collaborate with the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and other interested
         development partners to intensify upstream support and capacity building for MIH in the following areas
         i) Master planning for potential new licensing sites, based on a mapping, screening and prioritization
              process; and support to developing clear procedures for allocation of grants financing
         ii) Advisory services on tender preparation and project structuring, including investment studies for new
              sites (possibly combining multiple sites)
         iii) Capacity building to MIH-DPWS in executing licensing and application of tariff methodology, and
              enforcement of water quality standards
         iv) Capacity building for consolidation and use of WSMS system, including expansion to allow for license
              management and support to sector analytics/benchmarking
        Collaborate with the Global Partnership for Output-based Aid (GPOBA) and other development partners
         to leverage grant financing for:
         i)        Commercial Viability Gap financing to support competitive tendering of new licenses and help to
                   establish procedures and structure for future scale-up
                                                                                                   7
         ii)       Output-based aid financing to connect poor households under existing schemes .
        Collaborate with other development partners (such as AFD, IFC) to explore replication of Access to
         Finance through other local banks and seek opportunities to bring in IFC PPP transaction advisory services
        Strategic technical assistance to CWA, especially in areas of:
         i)        Institutional and organizational capacity development; review strategic operational plan and
                   business model
         ii)       Help define phase-out strategy and further differentiate the approach for BDS so as to better
                   target remaining subsidies to least advanced operators
         iii)      Support accreditation of local consultants – together with MIH – for BDS to comply with license
                   and tariff regulation

Longer-term engagement under the Country Partnership Framework is expected to build on the next two-year
experience and lessons. Based on an assumed successful demonstration on how to best allocate more public
funding into the private water sector, a potential IDA engagement may be foreseen.

1. Introduction and Global Context

This report synthesizes the Technical Assistance (TA) ‘Strengthening Sustainable Water Supply Services through
Domestic Private Sector Providers in Cambodia’ (P132172)’ carried out by the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation
Program (WSP) from Jan 2013 to January 2016. It documents the implementation process, results and lessons
learned. It makes recommendations to government, specifically the Ministry of Industry (MIH), as well as to the
Cambodian Water Supply Association (CWA) on how sustainable access to piped services can be increased by
professionalizing and optimizing the role of domestic private water providers. This synthesis is based on various
products delivered throughout the implementation period, based on an intensive consultation and collaboration
process with the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, the Cambodian Water Supply Association, as well as other
development partners and NGOs supporting the sector, specifically the French Development Agency (AFD).

The TA falls under the area “Sustainable Services through Domestic Private Sector Providers? of WSP’s global
business plan FY11-16 (Water and Sanitation Program, 2015). Governments are increasingly interested in engaging
the private sector to increase access of the poor to water supply and sanitation services. Effective scale-up of
access through the domestic private sector requires an understanding of the market potential, the state and
capabilities of entrepreneurs' operations, and factors and policies that shape their business environment and
investment decisions (Sy, Warner, & Jamieson, 2014). The interventions under this TA are built on a well-
developed theory of change that has guided the implementation of the business area, as depicted in Figure 1.

                Figure 1: Theory of Change for achieving scale through Domestic Private Sector Provision




The theory of change suggests seven potential impediments for market provision and assumes a gradual
adaptation of a private sector approach. While addressing these critical barriers, the market would be able to scale
the services with increasing efficiencies. This TA aimed to address three barriers deemed the most critical for the
Cambodia piped water supply market, namely:
    i)       Moving from firm-level to industry-level capacity,
    ii)      Facilitating access to finance, and
    iii)     Enhancing public support for private piped water provision.
Though the lessons learned during this TA are specific for Cambodia, they add to the global body of “knowledge in
implementation? on how services through domestic private sector providers can be scaled effectively and
sustainably. They have relevance, especially for countries with an existing, but fragmented water industry,
characterized by numerous small domestic private water operators.

2. Cambodia Country Context and Rationale

2.1.      Government strategy on piped water services
With the exception of Myanmar, Cambodia has the lowest access to piped water supply in the South East Asia
region, which was estimated to be 21% by 2015 (see Figure 2). Out of Cambodia’s estimated population of 15.6
million, access to piped services was only 7% for rural areas, where four-fifth of the population is living, and much
higher at 75% for Cambodia’s urban areas (WHO and UNICEF, 2015).

Supported by development partner grants and loans, urban access has seen remarkable progress in recent decades
through the successful transformation of Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA), as well as service
expansion in secondary cities and towns through Siem Reap Water Supply Authority and other public water
utilities. Equally, the private sector has contributed to these access gains in areas that are typically not served
through public utilities, such as smaller towns and rural growth centers. Based on a World Bank study (Sy, Warner,
& Jamieson, 2014) it is estimated that as of 2012, the private sector was serving over 1.4 million people, with a
large market remaining untapped. The immediate potential for expansion of existing schemes would cover another
2 million and further new schemes that could viably be developed could reach another 3 million Cambodians (Sy,
Warner, & Jamieson, 2014) and ( (DFAT, 2014). Around 300 private sector utilities, around half of which are
licensed by the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH), have a market share of almost 50% of those with access
to piped services, mostly situated in rural towns and agglomerations of settlements, with 750 to over 3000
household connections. Driven by demand for higher services, the private sector in Cambodia will be an important
driver for increasing access to piped water supply, especially in the rapidly urbanizing rural growth centers of
Cambodia.

When understanding the equity aspects of piped service provision, Figure 3 illustrates Cambodia’s existing
challenges in connecting consumption poor households to piped water services, especially in rural areas,
regardless of whether these services are delivered through private or public utilities (NIS, 2004) (NIS, 2012/2013).
The gap between the richest and poorest households is more pronounced in rural areas as compared to urban
areas. The overall gap in service provision has widened, with the richest households being ten times as likely to
have access to piped water services as compared to the poorest households. In section 5.4, more evidence is
presented, carried out under this TA, to understand the extent to which the private sector is contributing to poor-
inclusive service delivery and section 6.2 discuss what measures could be adopted to further improve this
situation.

Against this backdrop, the Royal Government of Cambodia in its National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2014-
2018 (Royal Government of Cambodia, 2013) prioritizes the acceleration of access to piped water services,
although no specific targets for piped services for urban and rural areas are included. In addition to strengthening


                                                                                                                   18
service delivery through Cambodia’s public water utilities, acceleration of piped access can be realized through
expansion and improvement of services delivered through private water operators licensed by the Ministry of
Industry and Handicraft. The government’s national policy on water and sanitation (Royal Government of
Cambodia, 2003) encourages such partnerships with the private sector for service provision and the NSDP 2014-
2018 sets out reform directions for piped water service delivery, including actions needed to accelerate private
water service provision (see Table 4).

2.2.     Facts about private water service provision in Cambodia
Numerous studies have been conducted on private sector provision in Cambodia, including a representative
country assessment (Frenoux, 2013) as part of a global World Bank/IFC study on domestic private service provision
(Sy, Warner, & Jamieson, 2014). Box 1 summarizes the findings which were shared widely with sector stakeholders

 Recommendations to overcome challenges:
 1. Gradually address gaps in the legal framework to overcome opaque licensing and tariff setting
 2. License term expansion to attract more operators into the formalized sector
 3. Professional business development services at scale to address weaknesses of operators
 4. Facilitate access to finance and move towards longer-term project financing
 5. Government incentives for expansion of access to electricity from the grid

2.3.     Engagement of Partners and Rationale
Scarce domestic resources are currently channeled only to public utilities and development partner financing from
donors as JICA, AFD, and ADB remains largely focused on the public sector. However, in 2013, at the start of this
TA, AFD stated the design of a program to expand private sector service provision through extending a
concessional credit line and guarantees to local banks in Cambodia. As a result of close coordination, this TA was
designed to support synergies with AFD’s program and to optimize results, especially in the domain of Access to
Finance (A2F). In May 2014 AFD launched the program with the signing of a concessional loan of USD 15 million to
                          8
Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) , of which USD 5 million earmarked for the water sector, a partial (50%) risk guarantee
for loans above USD 400,000, and an accompanying Technical Assistance grant through EU support, including
investments grant of around USD 1 million for water providers. The program formally started a year later in May
2015 (see also section 4.2).

In 2013, the Australian Department for Foreign Aid and Trade (DFAT) initiated the design of an Investment Facility,
coordinated through the Cambodia Development Council (CDC), to support expansion of services, using grants to
                                                                                           9
leverage private investments from both water operators as well as social impact investors . This program started
its inception in September 2015. Cambodia’s market potential for private water supply provision is illustrated by
the increasing interest of development partners in stimulating private sector provision.

Given the low piped water access in Cambodia (21% national), the market potential to connect up to 5 million
additional people through private operators within the next decade (bringing this to around 65%), and the fact that
private operators already provide half of all piped services, provides a solid basis for focused assistance to the
sector. For this acceleration to happen, it is evident that the climate within which domestic private water providers
operate need to offer favorable public support and incentives to expand services, especially to the poor. Given the
internal and external challenges that water operators face, and in order to optimize service delivery from the
presence of such a thriving private sector, the TA focused on three main elements:
     iv)      Professionalizing water operations,
     v)       Enabling access to finance, and
     vi)      Strengthening regulatory oversight and dialogue with the private sector

As such as the clients of this TA have been two-fold: on the private sector side, the Cambodia Water Supply
Association (CWA), a membership industry association, and on the public side, the Ministry of Industry and
Handicraft, notably the Department of Potable Water Supply (MIH-DPWS) as the regulator and policy maker for
private and public piped water suppliers in Cambodia.

Although the TA initially engaged with several local banks in the access-to-finance work, a targeted support
package for one local bank (FTB) as part of the AFD/EU program started in the final year of this TA. To maximize
results through close cooperation with the AFD program, this TA harmonized with the support program to FTB.


3. Technical Assistance Objectives and Summary Results

The project development objective of this technical assistance was to “strengthen the capacity of domestic private
water providers to deliver piped water supply services outside the service area of public water utilities in
Cambodia?. The focus of the TA was on agglomerations of small towns and rural growth centers. The TA has been
provided over a three year period from period January 2013 till January 2016. Table 5 shows the intermediate
                                                                     10
outcome and target indicators, including a summary of achievements .

  AFD considered supporting various local banks, and finally reached agreement with one candidate as a result. The program
also includes rural electricity providers
9
  This program is called 3i: Investing In Infrastructure and not only focusses on the water sector, but also on electricity, solid
waste and potentially agriculture.
10
   It should be noted that due to additional client demand, notably from the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, and
encouraging results in implementation, the technical assistance budget and timeframe was expanded (overall budget USD 1.6
including variable and fixed costs).

                                                                                           11
on strengthening the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft in response to their request . The expanding scope
included:
     i)      Expanding Business Development Services from 30 to a target of 50 operators,
                                                                                  12
     ii)     Access-to-Finance support from 20 to a new target of 26 operators ,
     iii)    Increased assistance to MIH in terms of drafting tariff regulation framework and the establishment of
             a monitoring system for piped water utilities to strengthen regulatory oversight
                                                                                                          13
The TA was implemented in close coordination with the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft , under overall
leadership of the Senior Minister Cham Prasidh, strategic guidance of Secretary of State Ek Sonn Chan, and in day-
to-day consultation with staff of the Department of Potable Water Supply, under leadership of its Director(s). The
arrangements for collaborating with CWA have been articulated in a letter of exchange. These included quarterly
meetings and frequent interactions with CWA’s executive team to stimulate organizational learning, while keeping
an arm’s length from decisions being made by CWA’s Board and director.

The TA engaged experienced local and international consultants (firms and individuals). A consortium, consisting of
GRET and EMC, was recruited to deliver the business development services, as well as the access-to-finance
services. The consortium that implemented the support to MIH for the monitoring system was EMC, with Nokor as
its local software developer.

The following sections provides further description of the implementation process of all aspects of the TA.

4.1.     Professionalizing water operators through Business Development Services

In close coordination with CWA, a program was developed and implemented by EMC/GRET and CWA staff and was
delivered in two phases

    Phase A from June 2013 to August 2014: aimed at designing adapted BDS packages and effectively delivering
     these to 30 water operators ; this included diagnostic of operators and design of pricing
    Phase B from September 2014 to November 2015 : aimed at improving the delivery of the BDS packages
     through a better training agenda and extended coaching visits for 20 additional operators. This phase
     intended to consolidate and strengthen CWA’s role and responsibilities in the delivery process. The final
     report of the implementation of the BDS program, including tools, results and individual operator profiles is
     available upon request ( Annex 2)

Implementation followed distinct steps, as illustrated in Figure 4.




11
   The Technical Assistance has been extended from June 2015 to December 2015 to accommodate these requests and scale-up
results during implementation as additional budget was made available for this initiative
12
   Targets for approved loan applications were raised from 10 to 18.
13
   In September 2013, the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy was split into two: Ministry of Industry and Handicraft and
Ministry of Energy and Mines, The water division was then hosted with MIH. While this opened new opportunities for the TA, it
also naturally led to a period of instability and delay, which has resulted in some delays in implementation.

Design of BDS packages
In close consultation with CWA so as to respond as much as possible to operator needs, the final BDS packages
contained the following:
 Booklets and tools: booklets and training tools were compiled with both technical and business lessons in
     three new booklets corresponding to three themes: “Upgrade your water supply business?, “Run your water
     supply business? and “Plan your water supply business?. Depth and breadth of the training was than adopted
     for beginners and advanced (see also Figure 5, Box 2 and booklets form part of resources in Annex 2)
 Utility management (ERMS) software: This modular software was offered and participants were provided
                                  14

     with set-up and training for using it (beginner operators were trained to use the billing and customer
     management module, while advanced trainees also received training on accounting module).
 Group training: 8 to 9 days of group training were included, both on technical and business/finance skills
                               15
     (including software usage) . Training was delivered through three consecutive sessions, each two to three
     days.
 Coaching: 2 coaching days were included at the site of the operator, with one day on technical aspects and
     another day to follow-up on business aspects. In phase B, coaching was expanded to 4 days.
 Hotline: a hotline service was available 5/7, from Monday to Friday, between 9 AM to 3 PM.
 Monthly monitoring calls: every month, each operator was called in order to assess his performance, record
                                              16
     key data and provide advice when needed .
 Training videos: accessible from CWA website (now under upgrading) from February 2016




14
   Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS) is a modular software package developed under the previous technical
assistance of WSP in 2012. During the course of this TA, substantial improvements and recoding of this software took place in
close collaboration with CWA and a local IT software developer (Biz Tools). The new system will be introduced under license by
CWA to all interested members in December 2015.
15
   The costs for transportation, hotel and meals were covered by the BDS packages for one trainee per operator. In case of
additional trainees per operator, these costs needed to be self-financed.
16
   A web-based platform called EMAS (Enterprise Monitoring and Advisory System) was designed and financed by GRET to
record monthly monitoring data. This system is owned and used as an advisory instrument by ISEA (Innovative Services
Engineering Advisory). ISEA, a spin-off of GRET, was established end of 2014 as a local business development service provider.
ISEA specializes on the water market, providing tailored services to operators and collaborates with CWA on benchmarking
member performance.

Marketing and enrollment
The marketing strategy was developed in partnership with CWA, using various channels and methods, such as
regional workshops, flyers, a radio spot and direct calling. The BDS fees were set transparently based on
                  17
willingness to pay , as well as ability to pay, allowing for payment in two tranches, to be completed in advance of
the group training:
             USD 618 USD for the beginner BDS package;
             USD 1,298 for the advanced BDS package.

While the BDS package in phase B was expanded with additional coaching, the pricing was not changed for reasons
of perceived fairness. Special promotions were provided to encourage operators to apply, such as 15% discounts
for (new) CWA members, and 5% early bird discounts. Almost 190 participants were present in the marketing
events, including 158 operator-staff and government officials. In total 79 initial applications were received (50%)
and screened for eligibility and ranking. Entry criteria were that operators needed to: i) have a license (or in the
process of an application), and ii) state commitment to invest in computer, printer, head meter and low-cost
chemical dosing set (around USD 600). Further selection was done prioritizing operators that did not receive
previous support from development partners/NGOs and those with good “social? performanc e (reasonable
connection fees and tariffs). Also, selection aimed to ensure a geographical spread (not just operators close to
Phnom Penh).

This resulted in 15 advanced and 15 beginner operators being selected in phase A. However, in phase B selection
criteria were sharpened, as entry level skills of advanced operator staff was insufficient to follow the curriculum.
An accounting test was introduced during the selection process, which resulted in less qualifying advanced
operators than planned in phase B (5 versus 10), and more beginners than foreseen (12 versus 10).


Delivery of training, coaching and hotline support
Table 6 provides key data of the training and coaching delivered during phase A and B of the program. Training
was delivered in three to four sessions of group training covering 8 to 9 days. A total of 47 water operators, with a
total 77 operator staff (average of 1.6 staff per operator) were reached during the sessions. A total of 32 group
training days was delivered, equivalent to 500 person training days. To address special needs of beginner
operators, CWA organized four smaller group sessions on using the billing module of the ERMS software in phase
B.


17
  Willingness-to-pay was derived from earlier study (Barbian, 2013) and from consultation with CWA Board and executive
team.


                                                                                                                   27
During on-site coaching, over 160 operator staff were reached (average 3.4 staff/operator), delivering a total of
120 coaching days. Technical and business coaching was tailored to the specific needs of each operator, based on
a jointly developed coaching plan with the operator.

Box 2 Business Development Services content for Advanced and Beginner operators

Beginner operators are family businesses with weak technical and business capacities and non-specialized staff.
The technical aspects focused on improving their basic knowledge and skills, e.g. regular reading of head water
meters, how to operate and maintain each component of the system, ability to test raw water to improve
treatment. On the business side, the aim was to start building data records, improve revenue management and
computerize their billing. The curriculum thus focused on basic utility and revenue management, emphasizing
billing and customer management.

Advanced operators are often semi-professional operators, with good business skills. Most already have
specialized staff to manage technical and business functions of their water schemes, and they usually have IT skills.
The objective was to further professionalize their water business, improve technical, management and planning
capacity and their ability to generate reliable accounting data to banks which would facilitate borrowing. The
curriculum also included lessons on how to discuss with consulting firms and on how to design extension and plan
investment projects.

Figure 6 illustrates the coaching process on-site with operators. Figure 7 shows the satisfaction of trainees with
the BDS program. While overall satisfaction was high across all trainings, beginner operators tended to evaluate
the training more positively than advanced operators. This could be explained by different levels of expectation
between beginners and advanced group, and by a high variability of individual skills and knowledge among
advanced trainees. Unsurprisingly, modules 6 to 8, corresponding to new investment planning and infrastructure
expansion, were reported to be the least understood by operators. They present new and rather complex content
and were not tested earlier with operator. Operator perceptions on added value of BDS packages is discussed in
section 5.1.

The hotline was implemented since September 2014 and was used fairly well with an average of 15 calls per
month, totaling 170 calls by August 2015. Around 60% of the advanced operators and 78% of the beginners called
the hotline support at least once. Seven out of the 47 operators (15%) represented around half of the calls. Main
issues raised were ERMS use (billing) of which 40% needed support on maintenance or debugging of ERMS errors.
The renewed version of the ERMS is available through CWA and will come with an annual maintenance and
support service against a reasonable fee. This will also include a hotline service for operators and remote system
support. The software licensing arrangement was signed in January 2016.

Performance monitoring
Performance was measured through a baseline and endline, as well as through monthly monitoring calls,
motivating operators to share data on their performance throughout July 2015 (see Table 7). Data was provided
voluntarily and on a strictly confidential basis. Challenges were encountered as not all operators were willing or
interested to share their data and data collection rate was around 75%. (56% for advanced and 78% for
          18
beginner) . Data collection focused on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to the six objectives of the BDS
program:
     i)       Increase water consumption and number of water connection;
     ii)      Improve water quality;
     iii)     Increase bill recovery and billing monitoring;
     iv)      Optimize production and distribution;
     v)       Reduce expenses and production costs;
     vi)      Improve planning and investment project management.

18
  Data collection was less successful during Mar-Jul 2015 and 70% of operators no longer submit data after Jul 2015. While 2
advanced and 1 beginner operator scheme are still under construction, in total 33 operators submitted data (33 out of 44
=75%), of which 10 advanced (10 out of 18=56%) and 23 beginner (23 out of 26=78%). Out of 33, only 30 operators submitted
data on a regular basis.



                                                                                                                          29

It should be noted that the BDS program is one of several factors to influence observed changes in KPIs. Although
the program focused on quick wins, especially for beginner operators, the time lag between the BDS intervention
and KPI result needs to be taken into account. The lengthy transformation process of individual knowledge,
attitudes and skills into organizational practices, and then into improved operator performance needs to be
appreciated (especially for phase B operators, for which the monitoring period was 4 months only). Section 5.1
discusses the key results achieved under the BDS program.


4.2.      Facilitating access to finance

In close coordination with AFD and with support of CWA, a consortium of EMC and GRET implemented the Access-
to-Finance program aiming to facilitate lending to private water operators on improved terms from local banks.
The Final Report of the Access to Finance program, including all resources and tools used under the program, such
as a sample investment study, financial model, and a working paper and lenders guidance for local banks, are
available upon request as supplementary documentation (Annex 3).

The program initially aimed to reach 16 operators, however, was gradually expanded and reached 29 operators.
The target was to prepare loan applications and detailed investment studies for 20 out of those 26 operators,
aiming for a total of 18 loans to be approved. The overall implementation process is depicted in Figure 8.
Originally, the program intended to facilitate finance with any local bank that would best match the situation of
that particular operator (in terms of collateral, proposed terms, and existing relationships). However, during
program implementation, it became apparent that the concessional rates and collateral requirements offered
through FTB were the most attractive in the market for operators. Hence, support narrowed to facilitating the
loan approval process FTB, recipient of the sub-sovereign loan of AFD, and the ARIZ risk guarantee (see section
2.3).

Design and Market Access-to-Finance packages
Essentially this phase (Jan 2014 to Jun 2014) included two key activities: a) market analysis and bank engagement,
and b) fee setting, marketing and enrollment of operators.

Market analysis and bank engagement
An analysis of financing resources and terms available on the market was carried and a staged filtering process was
                                                                                                        19
applied in order to arrive at a list of 20 lenders, with whom one-on-one meetings were carried out . Out of these,
only 12 showed initial interest in water sector financing, including ten banks, one Micro Finance Institution (MFI)
and one social fund. A field trip was conducted in January 2014 to two sites of water operators, which was
attended by senior officers from lending institutions (8 banks, 2 MFIs and 1 social fund). This was followed by a
forum in February 2014, with the aim of presenting the A2F program, and facilitating networking between
operators and lenders. Lending conditions available in the sector early 2014 can be summarized as follows
            High collateral requirements of around 150-200% of loan (accepting land, building and term deposit)
            Most banks only accept hard land titles, and some local banks were accepting soft titles; independent
             real estate valuations mostly required;
            Physical assets that are part of the water business are not accepted as collateral;
            Future cash flows generated by the investments would not be considered collateral
            Interest rates in the order of 10-14% (depending on tenure, collateral and whether the clients is
             known), tenures offered up to 5 years, occasionally longer and typically no or 6-months grace period
             only; regional banks, due to their capital structure, were able to offer slightly better interest rates.

In June 2014, another workshop with commercial lenders (10) and operators was organized to present the working
paper ‘Private piped water suppliers in Cambodia – a market opportunity for banks’, which provided insights into
the challenges and opportunities of the sector. A follow-up forum was held in October 2014 to update lenders on
project preparation progress and discuss the content of the business plan and pre-financing studies. Based on the
interest of lenders in quantitative financial analysis of water operators, it was agreed that the working paper would
be transformed into a guidance note for lenders, analyzing and sharing the experiences of the A2F program. The
lenders guidebook will be disseminated in a final roundtable with banks will be held together with AFD and IFC in
September 2016 once more schemes are completed and disbursement has advanced.

The program originally sought to facilitate the best match between operator and local bank and would not be
                                  20
limited to working just with FTB . However, once the FTB program came online, the terms and conditions were
very attractive to most of the operators. Hence, the consortium’s focus consequently narrowed to FTB and a close
working relationship was established with FTB’s loan officers and the technical assistance firm, financed by the EU
                                                                            21
to assist FTB to carry out the due diligence for the water loan applications .

Fee setting, marketing and selection of water operators
Marketing to operators began in mid-January 2014 through direct calling by CWA and the consortium. In addition,
the consortium used relevant CWA and MIH events to distribute marketing leaflets and application forms,
indicating the conditions of the program and the expectations of operators. In total 41 applicants applied for the
program. Out of those that applied, 39 were eligible while the other two applicants did not meet the criteria or
dropped out. Out of the 39, a scoring process was used to rank and enroll the best qualifying operators in the

   The analysis soon revealed that MFIs were on the whole not as competitive for private water sector financing as commercial
lenders. Further institutions needed to have a portfolio of at least USD1 million (using National Bank of Cambodia data),
minimum loan size of USD 50,000, minimum loan term of 5 years, interest rate below 15%, flexible in terms of geographic
coverage (no requirement to be situated in the capital or along national roads), allow non-equity based arrangements
(applicable to social investors).
20
   This was purposively done as at the time of the start of the TA there was no certainty if and when the AFD supported credit
line would become operational. Also, lending was already happening to water operators by other players in the local market,
and the prerogative of the TA was the support operators in making decisions.
21
   The technical assistance firm supporting FTB in the lender due diligence was Enclude; on the technical assessment side, GRET
was required to provide due diligence.


                                                                                                                            31

program . Criteria are summarized in Table 8 and were shaped to attract talented, motivated entrepreneurs in a
transparent process. As the program aimed to improve loan terms and lending practices, operators were selected
that would have the highest chance of securing debt financing, herewith building confidence of lenders in the
Cambodian water sector. Initially, a cohort of 16 operators were enrolled, followed by another group of 10
operators and finally 3 more were enrolled, leading to a total of 29 operators.

While detailed information from operators was gathered and bank requirements were becoming more explicit, the
initial attrition of operators was fairly high. Two out of the 29 operators decided not to complete the first phase -
the pre-financing study - and only received partial assessments. Out of the 27 remaining operators, for various
reasons 7 operators did not move forward to phase 2 - the detailed investment plan. Hence, the total attrition was
9 operators. Section 5.2 discuss the reasons for attrition in detail.

                                                          Operating ratio
                                             In addition operators were also assessed whether they had a banking
                                             history, registration with the General Department of Taxation and/or
                                             whether they had performed any feasibility studies in the past

The Access-to-Finance service package was designed to follow a phased approach per operator (see Figure 8). The
first phase being the development of an overall business plan based on preliminary estimate of investment
required, followed by a second phase with a more detailed investment plan, once local banks indicated a positive
response based on the initial business plan.

Similar as to the BDS program, agreements were signed among CWA, operators and the consortium, and the
following fee structure was applied:
             Phase 1: USD 250 non-refundable before the development of the business plan / pre-financing study
             Phase 2: USD 1,000 for loans amounts < USD 150,000 and USD 2,000 for loan amounts > USD
              150,000; this was an upfront payment before detailed technical field assessment would be
              undertaken; however, a 50% refund clause was included to reduce the risk for operators, in case a
                                                                 23
              loan could not be obtained from FTB or another bank .

As bank engagement proceeded, it became apparent that the lender assessment process differed by each
institution: the workflow was substantially different for FTB under the AFD supported program, as compared to
other commercial banks, using the traditional lending procedures. FTB required substantial documentation,

  The selection committee consisted of different stakeholders: CWA, EMC/GRET, and WSP
23
  Obviously the full costs of carrying out the business plan, investment plan and feasibility study is much higher, and estimated
to be on average USD 17,000 (based on allocated contract amount), hence the average user contribution represents around
10% of the full cost.


                                                                                                                              32
including a business plan, detailed investment study, financial projection and other information from operators
such as current loans and licensing documentation, before commencing their due diligence and site visits. Other
commercial banks, that used hard collateral and historical financial performance, did not necessarily need such
detailed plans and financial projections to issue a loan. Figure 9 below illustrates the workflow process
requirement for FTB and other commercial banks, and includes the additional eligibility criteria for FTB loans and
the terms offered.

Deliver Access-to-Finance services
During implementation, the product of phase 1 was altered from a comprehensive business plan, based on
extensive data collection and financial analysis, to a much shorter debt financing proposal that highlighted key
metrics of interest to lenders. Key metrics in the pre-financing study included:
             Revenue growth: connection growth and future tariff
             Expenses: metrics on power, raw material costs and staff to connection ratios
             Debt service coverage ratio: extremely important and initial analysis needed to show at least 1.5
             Collateral level: most important metric to all lenders, including FTB, although FTB developed different
              method to establish collateral (as explained in section 5.2).

By simplifying phase 1, an earlier indication of lender concerns and appetite could be gauged prior to proceeding
to phase 2, which focused on the detailed investment study. This changes helped to manage attrition of operators.


                                                                                                                      33
In phase 2, especially once attractive FTB terms were announced, the detailed investment study was developed
through an iterative approach seeking input from the lender prior to submitting the final loan application package.
These iterations also included necessary support and revisions during the due diligence stage. Figure 10
summarizes the services provided to operators during the detailed investment study phase.

The Technical and Market Assessment Report was divided into three main parts:
    (i)     Current situation analysis
            -    status, functionality of infrastructure, water demand and capacity, and water quality test
            -    assessment of technical performance against benchmarks
            -    valuation of fixed assets (based on age, quality of design, equipment and material and quality of
                 construction or installation)
    (ii)    Future situation analysis (expansion):
            -    Market analysis confirming demand characteristics (socio-economic, willingness to pay, etc.)
            -    Infrastructure development plans (electricity grid and/or road development)
    (iii)   Investment project preparation:
            -    Definition of key components of investment project (production and/or distribution)
            -    Determining initial investment project costing and the loan requirements

The Financial Model was developed with the objective to provide banks with a long term financial overview of the
operator to assess their repayment capacity. In addition, it also provides key data to derive net present value (NPV)
as one of the loan requirements for FTB, thus far the only bank has introduced cash-flow based financing for the
water sector. Using as much historical data as available, financial projections were done for 10 to 15 years and
included estimated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. Sensitivity analysis was also done
to assess the financial robustness of the business. Assumptions were clearly articulated and discussed with the
lender to ensure the financial model was fully understood and accepted. During implementation, it became
apparent that the valuation of existing water infrastructure assets posed a specific challenge. Almost all operators
had poorly constructed water treatment plants and in a considerable number of cases poor materials and pipe
installation was found (e.g. very shallow). Hence a straightforward application of depreciation schedule as used by
tax authorities (and MIH for public utilities) could not be applied. Therefore, a methodology was developed which,
different from using the straightforward net book value of assets, also took into account the functionality and
quality of construction and installation works. In several cases, this lead to drastic downward adjustments of asset
value, which in turn impacted the amount of debt financing that could be taken on.

Comprehensive Business Plans were developed incorporating: bank feedback post the debt financing proposal,
technical and market assessment report, financial model outputs, and feedback from operator after discussion
with the lender. Business plans were revised post lender due diligence, which focused on verification of operator


                                                                                                                  34
statements, collateral determination, review of loans and cash flow forecasts, and reviewing market and technical
assessment. The due diligence often led to revisiting the proposed investment project and loan amount, prior to
issuing the final loan term sheet to the operators.

As of January 2016, 29 operators have been enrolled, 29 pre-financing studies have been completed, 20 detailed
investment studies have been finalized, 20 loan applications have been submitted to FTB and 9 loans have been
issued. While the loan approval process will be executed over the next months, section 5.2 reports detailed results
thus far. Figure 11 illustrates the catalytic role of the WSP A2F-program in bringing the first 20 loan applications to
closure. Operators will then smoothly transition to the detailed design and construction stage, where ISEA/GRET
will quality assure future supervision of construction and support training and monitoring over the next 2 years
(financed by the EU grant).

Evaluate and disseminate results
In addition to monitoring the loan application process for 20 operators and their key lending metrics, a survey
among the 9 operators that did not proceed with FTB lending was carried out in November 2015. The purpose was
to understand whether or not they have been able to raise financing from other banks and/or have managed to
carry out (a part of) the planned investment with other financial resources, such as equity or family loans (see
section 5.2). Interviews with banks have been carried out in December 2015 to capture changes in their attitudes
and practices towards water sector lending. Some banks have shown increasing interest in the sector and have
relaxed collateral requirements (for example excepting soft land titles). Based on the earlier working paper for
banks, a lender guidance note, based on the portfolio analysis of the first 20 loans, will be disseminated once
schemes have completed construction. A round table event scheduled in September 2016 with AFD, FTB and other
banks is scheduled for this purpose.

4.3.     Improving regulatory environment and monitoring

The need for a comprehensive legal and institutional reform in the water sector has long been underscored in
various sector documents (ADB, 2012) (World Bank, 2013) (Water and Sanitation Program, 2015) and is also
articulated in the government’s own NSDP 2014-2018. After an unsuccessful attempt to formulate a
comprehensive Water Law in 2005, MIH has recently restarted this long-term initiative with support of JICA.
Based on discussions with MIH, the TA aimed to achieve gradual improvements that could be introduced under the
mandate of MIH. Earlier identified bottlenecks for private sector service provision in Cambodia were prioritized
and focused on three key issues:
   (i)       Support to drafting a ministerial decree on licensing
  (ii)       Support to developing a framework for economic regulation, including drafting decree on tariff
 (iii)       Support to the establishment of and capacity building for a monitoring system for piped water
             services


Ministerial decree on licensing

This first engagement of WSP started in early 2013 and built on previous efforts of the USAID Small and Medium
Enterprise project to improve the licensing regime for water operators. Common frustrations expressed by private
water operators related to the fact that:
      licenses are only valid for 3 years, not aligned with the lumpy nature of water investments
      issuance of licenses is complex with the need for multiple approvals at commune, district, provincial and
          ministerial level
      lack of clarity and competition encourages non-transparent informal fees (or licenses being “bought? for
          speculative purposes, without investments being carried out)
      lack of regulations stipulating the conditions for renewal, revocation or suspension of licenses

On the other hand, the existing licensing regime allowed operators a lot of discretion, such as mostly determining
their own tariff and connection fees (a sort of market negotiated rate with local communes). The license included
minimum information on the service obligations of the operator, and de-facto remained largely unregulated. This
resulted in operators not expanding their services to villages beyond the denser urban areas, little effort to
connect poor households and low compliance with service standards in terms of pressure, water quality, etc.
(Frenoux, 2013) (see section 5.4).

A senior legal international consultant was mobilized to help draft a new licensing ministerial decree (from Mar-
Jun 2013). A consultative workshop was organized under auspices of the then Ministry of Industry, Mines and
Energy (MIME), inviting operators, public utilities and development partners to provide comments in the
development process. A draft prakas was submitted to the Director of the Department of Potable Water Supply of
MIME in July 2013. A new Senior Minister took office end of September 2013, and the Department of Potable
                                                                                 24
Water Supply was placed under the General Directorate of Industry under MIH . To ensure consistencies with the
Cambodian legal framework, in April 2014, assistance was provided for a legal review of the draft decree, which
was then further modified and finalized by MIH. On 29 of May 2014, the Minister of Industry and Handicraft issued
the following decrees, of which an unofficially translated versions can be found in

        Prakas on Procedures for Issuing, Revising, Suspending, and Revoking of Permits?, accompanied with,
        Prakas on “Standard Conditions of the Permit?

In August 2014, MIH organized a dissemination workshop on the new decree (or prakas), attended by over 100
private water operators. A summary of the key elements in the prakas in included in Box 3 . Results of the
implementation of the prakas are discussed in section 5.3.




24
  Delays occurred due to the July 2013 elections and its aftermath, in which MIME was split up into two ministries and a new
Ministry of Industry and Handicraft was created.


                                                                                                                         36
Box 3 New elements of the licensing ministerial decree, issued May 2014


 Licensing decree key elements:
          It covers all natural persons or legal entities that may be a public enterprise, public-private partnership
           and a purely private enterprise engaged in the provision of water service, but excludes 18 water service
           providers with special contracts (such as Design-Build-Lease and Design-Build-Operate schemes)
          It sets the term of permits at 20 years for purely private enterprises and unlimited for public enterprises
           and public-private partnerships.
          It contains procedures for the issuance and replacement of water permits and the issuance of the
           necessary operating certificates (5 years) allowing licensees to continue operations in case of compliance
           with the permit conditions
          In addition to a direct granting process, it contains provision for a competitive granting, where feasibility
           studies are made available to shortlisted bidders and permit is granted to bidder with lowest tariff
          It stipulates the necessity to submit a feasibility study with the application, including a systems-and build-
           out-plan indicating how the area will be served within a five year period
          It provides for procedures for public consultation and hearing on license area and tariff issues
          It includes procedures for requesting expansion licenses covering adjacent communes/service areas
          A sample permit is included which - among other things – stipulates the obligations to provide customers
           with basic services and maintain records and reports in format of MIH.
          It provides for Tariff and Fees in the permit and stipulates that MIH shall study the tariff every 5 years for
           adjustment based on real circumstances
          It contains procedures for suspension, revocation of licenses including mechanisms to issue warnings in
           case of non-compliance with the obligations under the license


Economic regulation framework and tariff setting mechanisms

With regard to tariff setting, there was a significant absence of a formal set of rules to determine the appropriate
tariff for different water service providers. Evidently, the licensing decree was issued to provide parameters for
regulation: it tackles service regulation by specifying the obligation of licensees to comply with basic services and
provides for submission of reports. However, it does not provide for rules and regulations on how the tariff shall be
regulated, despite the provision that gives MIH the authority to set tariff every five years. In addition to the
absence of tariff regulation rules, other gaps identified were: i) the need to update the water quality standards,
and ii) the need to specify further technical minimum standards. MIH is working in close partnership with WHO
and GRET on these technical standards, and WHO has successfully supported MIH in the preparation of a new
water quality decree, September 2015.

Tariffs of public water service providers are usually approved by the head of the municipality or the provincial
governor, and by MIH. However, because of the usual political economy aspects, tariffs are often outdated and are
at risk of being set too low to sustain operations. For example, the last tariff review of Phnom Penh Water Supply
Authority took place in 2001 and was approved by the Prime Minister, while for example Kampong Cham public
water utility saw its last tariff review in 2006. On the other hand, tariff-setting for private water service providers is
usually done by the service providers themselves. In some cases, negotiations take place at commune level, while
in a few recent cases, MIH has taken part in the tariff negotiations (e.g. Kratie). Thus, with regard to private water
service providers, there is a risk that tariffs are too high or not commensurate with quality and level of service, and
for public utilities that tariffs may be too low.

Upon request of MIH, technical assistance was mobilized and the following objectives were agreed
   i)       Develop an appropriate tariff regulation method for the Cambodian water sector, providing for
            categorization and tariff methodology and the development of relevant tariff models;
   ii)      Apply tariff methodology to test cases and carry out necessary training on tariff models with the
            Department of Potable Water Supply (Regulation Office and other assigned staff)
   iii)     Draft ministerial decree (prakas) setting out tariff regulation process, procedures and instruments,
            and facilitate consultation process upon MIH request.



                                                                                                                       37
An international regulation expert and local financial expert were recruited and worked closely with MIH-DPWS,
selected utilities, WSP team as well as partners such as GRET and JICA on the above tasks. The work process
consisted of several distinct steps that are illustrated in Figure 12.

The process was conducted in a consultative way, through various workshops and meetings, and after the final
round of modifications by MIH, the draft decree is currently under consultation. The regulation is slated to be
issued early 2016. Full report on economic regulation, including the principles of the regulation framework, tariff
methodology, draft decree, user manual and tariff model (including test case models for two public utilities,
Kampong Cham and Svey Rieng) is available upon request as supplementary documentation under Annex 5 .
Section 5.3 summarizes the key elements of the framework, procedures tariff models and the training provided.

Establishment and capacity building for a national M&E system for piped water service provision

Responding to MIH request for assistance to improve sector monitoring, a local firm was engaged (EMC), in
partnership with a local software developer (Nokor). The objective was to strengthen MIH’s capacity for
monitoring of licensed water operators through the establishment of a monitoring system, including database,
geographic interface and publication through MIH website.

It is important to appreciate that in 2014, the monitoring system of the Department of Potable Water Supply
consisted of a rudimentary, incomplete excel datasheet for licensed operators, filled with sparse data, such as
production capacity, connections and tariff information. Even basic information, related to when licenses were
issues, up-to-date contact information of licensed operators and their licensed areas, was not available in a
consolidated database but spread over various paper files. Performance data was collected ad-hoc and mostly
through paper based communications, at times involving the provincial Departments of Industry and Handicraft
(DIH). Information about unlicensed operators (estimated to be over 150) was not available. Hence the benefits of
computerized Water Services Monitoring System (WSMS), as indicated in




Figure 13, were well recognized by MIH.




                                                                                                                 38
Figure 13 Benefits of Water Services Monitoring System (WSMS)


The project was carried out in a number of distinct phases, as summarized in Figure 12 and with the intention that
future TA will support the consolidation phase after June 2016. Implementation was steered through regular
meetings by the core project team, which included assigned MIH staff. Moreover, high level Steering Committee
meetings were convened at regular decision points, under leadership of the Secretary of State. Furthermore, a
series of briefings with the Senior Minister were conducted, which led to high-level support and the allocation of
scarce MIH budget resources towards the procurement of hardware and a maintenance and hosting arrangements
with Nokor, starting from January 2016 onwards.

The monitoring system encourages data entry by operators themselves, a good practice as it can reduce errors,
stimulates IT use by operators, and reduces an increasing workload on MIH and DIHs. It was important to clearly
design and articulate the work flow processes for quality review (verification) and approval, before the data is
made public. MIH staff were reassigned along the development process, and staffing still remains scarcely
allocated with only one system administrator, and only three staff assigned for data-input, verification and
approval.

Annex 6 includes the final report on the Monitoring system development. It including the agreed monitoring
framework, the business requirements, the system documentation and user manuals, the training results and a
draft template for data analysis to be used for the first annual sector report, once sufficient data has been
generated. Section 5.3 summarizes the main functionalities of the system, indicators, user roles, and results from
the pilot and the training phase.


4.4.     Enhancing industry organization, dialogue and knowledge on private sector
         provision

A number of activities were undertaken to strengthen the dialogue between the public and private sector and to
strengthen the evidence base of service delivery by private water operators. It included activities for i)


                                                                                                                39
organizational development support to CWA, and ii) enhancing dialogue and knowledge on private water service
delivery.

Organizational support to CWA

Since its formal launch in August 2012, CWA has developed and grown rapidly, with a current membership base (as
of 31 December 2015) of 106 members (34 associate and 72 active members with 100 licensed schemes). As part
of the strategy to deliver industry-wide Business Development Services and Access-to-Finance services, CWA was
able to expand its activities. Operator contributions were used as a seed fund to help CWA establish a core team of
staff and improve its internal operations.

    • draft template developed for analysis of sector data


 Phase 5 Jan 2016 onwards: consolidation of usage and support to analytics



A range of institutional and capacity building activities for CWA Board and executive team were provided, while
ensuring to stay at arm’s length from operational and strategic decisions of by the association. A senior
institutional development expert was mobilized in April-May 2014 to facilitate the development of CWA’s strategic
plan for 2014-2019 (available upon request from CWA and supplementary documentation as Annex 7). WSP
facilitated the development of the operational plan and budgets for 2014-2015, as well as its first internal audit


                                                                                                                 40
process for 2014. This will be followed by an external audit conducted for year 2015. Regular quarterly meetings
between WSP and CWA executive team were conducted to provide advice and reflect on the achievements and/or
proposed future activities, especially regarding the dialogue with MIH. On the job learning of CWA executive team
took place during the BDS and A2F programs. The TA supported CWA in developing a promotion video to attract
more members and partners, launched during the first CWA-organized National Water Conference in November
2015 (downloadable: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_bgI7gPZNE).

Another important intervention was the improvement of the Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS), a
software package for operators that includes billing, customer management, inventory and accounting modules. A
partnership with a local software developer (Biz Tools) started, so that the firm would co-invest in the system
development and would then exclusively issue software licenses through CWA. Important user feedback collected
during the BDS program was captured to improve ERMS to : i) change to windows-based desktop application, ii)
allow multiple schemes/sites and consolidate reports, iii) enhance user friendliness, iv) allow flexible tariff
structures to accommodate customer groups and block tariffs. The revised ERMS will be launched in December,
with the following contractual arrangements between CWA and the software developer:
     50 free licenses (for operators that followed the BDS program and wish to shift to the new version)
     One/off licensing fee of USD 210 (one desktop, with additional USD20 per additional computer)
     Annual maintenance and support fee of USD 100, including upgrades, yearly training and hotline support
Section 5.4 will discuss other results achieved in terms of building CWA institutional capacity.

Enhancing dialogue and knowledge

A number of activities were implemented to strengthen the dialogue between different actors in the sector,
namely Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, private water operators, and local banks. In addition to the lender
forums that were organized under the A2F program, and the regular invitation to MIH staff during the BDS
program, a knowledge exchange with the Philippines was executed in March 2014. This included 13 delegates,
including Director of MIH-DPWS, senior officials MIH-DPWS, CWA Executive Director and two Board members, as
well as representatives from local banks (including FTB). The objectives of the exchange was to increase
understanding and awareness on:

         i)       Regulations and procedures for tariff-setting for water operators,
         ii)      Monitoring of operators in a fragmented service delivery context,
         iii)     Ways to customize financing to water operators, and
         iv)      Roles of utility association.

Delegates reflected on the weak and strong points of the current situation in Cambodia and their learning from
the visit. Table 9summarizes actions that were put forward. The exchange helped to articulate demand from MIH
to improve regulation and monitoring, encouraged CWA to diversify its membership base, services and activities,
and brought banks, government and operators closer together. The presence of the Senior Minister and diverse
stakeholders during the November 2015 National Water Conference is a testimony of an improved sector network
and dialogue.

Research on private operator service delivery and constraints on poor households
                                                       25
In the period Aug 2014 – Mar 2015 field research was conducted to understand to what extent private water
operators are serving the population within their licensed areas, specifically the poor. The research consisted of
                                                                                                       26
two phases, with the first phase focused on mapping the connection rates of poor versus non-poor households
across a representative sample of 39 private water operators. This also included operator interviews to understand
                                                                                  27
their customer policies. The second phase – in collaboration with Water.Org – focused on digging deeper in
understanding characteristics of different household segments (poor connected, poor non-connected and non-
poor connected), such as water consumption, water expenditure, service satisfaction and tariff and fee
perceptions. It also looked at opportunities for bringing in microfinance to help accelerate connection rates among
the poor. Results of the research have been integrated in presentations during various forum and events, such as
CWA General Assembly (December 2014), Ministerial briefing on private sector service provision (January 2015),
National Water Conference (November 2015), and were used during economic regulation workshops. A Research
Brief and article for publication are currently under development and will be finalized in March 2016. Section 5.4
elaborates the key results of the research and how it has contributed to the policy dialogue.

5.1.       Results from the Business Development Services program

Characteristics of participating operators

The 47 participating operators represent a third of licensed schemes covering around 69,300 active connections
(or 345,000 people). On average, each operator has around 1,500 connections, of which 96% are active
connections. The average coverage rate inside the network area reaches 50%. On average operators are in the
water business since a little under 10 years, have invested around USD 300,000 and employ around 5 staff/1000
connections. The majority of operators uses electricity (84%) while the remainder relies on diesel (16%). The water
source profile is heterogeneous, with the largest share using the Mekong as the main source of water, followed by
other surface water sources, a quarter of operators rely on pond-systems, and a small minority uses groundwater.
Tariff and connection fees are included in Table 10 and an overview of operator profiles is reflected in Figure 15.

Self-assessment of operators on performance improvements

Improvements of knowledge, skills and practices can first be measured from the perspectives of the operators
themselves.

Figure 16 illustrates how operators are rating their own improvements as compared to the objectives set at the
onset of the program, including a mark on a scale from 0-4. A notable strong point is the improved bill recovery
and monitoring (92% assessed objective reached), while a weak area is the improvement of water quality (72%
assessed objective reached).

Observed changes in Key Performance Indicators

Objective 1: Commercial growth and water consumption
Between baseline and endline data the number of active connections increased (see
Figure 17) and total connections grew from 57,140 connections to 69,275 connections, meaning 12,135 new
                                                                                                           28
connections were installed. This represents an overall 21% growth in total connections across all operators . This
growth is coming both from beginner (39% of total growth) but more from advanced operators (61% of total
growth). Median growth has been 163 connection per operator, while median network extension has been 2.5 km.
Over a third of operators (36%) achieved growth by extending their network area and 55% densified their network.
The connection growth impacted positively on the overall service coverage rate within the licensed areas, usually
larger than the area under network, with an average increase from 31% to 36%. As several operators expanded
their network reach considerably, and despite the densification of others, on average across all operators the
                                                            29
coverage rate within the network area remained around 50% .

The average water consumption is approximately 15 m per month per connection, corresponding to an average
consumption of around 90 l per capita per day. At endline, 6 operators, located in Pailin province and along the

   This represents a short period of 6 months for phase B operators, and a longer period of 12-14 months for phase A operators.
Previous experiences show a natural growth of 5-10% annually for operators, hence the operators in the BDS program were
better able to expand networks
29
   The densification gains across several schemes are offset by the expansion of networks across other schemes.


                                                                                                                            45
Thai border were selling more than 50% of water sales to industries. Excluding these large industrial operators, all
other 41 operators have seen increases in overall water sales due to connection growth and increases in per capita
                                                                3
consumption (average increase of 40%, from 8,768 to 12,110 m /month per operator). To account for seasonality
in water consumption, per capita water consumption is compared for Phase A operators between March-May
2014 and the same period in 2015. An increase of 9% for advanced operators (95 to 108 lpcpd) and 3% for
beginners (82 to 85 lpcpd) was found.

Objective 2: Water quality improvements
Water quality tests were carried out by the consortium during baseline and endline and did not show the expected
water quality improvement, as illustrated in Figure 18.

Figure 18 Changes in water quality observed through external testing across operators

                                                         30
Only 15% of operators improved their water quality and on average for each operator, only 53% of the sampled
                                                                         31
tests were passed during the baseline, and 57% passed during endline . While these test mostly passed for pH and
turbidity, the problematic area is residual chlorine, which typically is injected with too low or infrequent dosage.
Nevertheless, water quality concerns seem to be of growing importance to operators, as 50% of operators are
carrying out more tests per month at the endline compared with baseline. Practices have improved in terms of
using testing kits. At baseline the use of chlorine and pH test kits was as low as 43%, and 38% respectively, while at
endline, 79% of operators use a good quality chlorine test kit and 81% use one for pH testing. For water quality
concerns to become a top priority, better regulatory enforcement would be needed, as well as communications
                          32
campaigns to customers so they better understand the quality of the water they are drinking, as well as the need
for chlorination which may impact the taste.

Objective 3: Increase bill recovery and financial performance
Good financial performance largely depends on the capacity of the operator to decrease or optimize expenses and
increase revenues. This in turn depends on technical, management and investment choices of operators, location-
specific factors, and external factors beyond the control of operators. To better understand trends, an analysis of




30
   Meaning an increase of the number of tests done by operators and tests done by GRET were passed.
31
   In total out of the 174 tests done, 60% passed during the endline survey and the same ratio passed during the baseline (98
out of 162 tests). Self-reported test results by operators were largely unreliable as they showed pass rates of 94-99%.
32
    Households tend to complain to operators about chlorine taste, because of their strong preference for rainwater for
drinking/cooking.

Note: this data is based on total of 45 operators (18 advanced, 27 beginner), as two schemes were under construction
Figure 19 illustrates an average slight declining trend in expenses per connection. Trends for revenues seem to
indicate an overall decrease, especially for phase B, which may have been influenced by seasonality of water
                                                                     34
demand as the endline took place in the rainy season. Net income per connection as a result showed a slight
decline on average from 6.1 to 5.6 USD/conn/month across all operators. However, looking at individual operators,
it can be observed that:
                More than two thirds of operators increased their monthly revenues per connection (with 35% on average),
                 other operators observed a decline or showed little change
                Almost half of operators have seen their expenses per connection decrease, mostly explained by decreases in
                                      3
                 energy cost per m (-39%) for example due to efficiencies in pumping, as well as other input costs (-18%).
                 Other operators saw increases in expenses, mostly explained by higher energy costs and increase of other
                 inputs costs (e.g. staff). Expense increases are not necessarily a “bad thing?, as they may reflect better service,
                 such as increased pressure in the network.
                Almost half of operators have seen their net income per connection increase, with some of them doubling
                 their net income per connection.

To understand variability among operators, individual performance profiles are required, which have been
developed for each operators.

On the level of skill development and operational practices, solid gains have been made in the program. Despite
challenges related to the suboptimal functionality of the utility software package (ERMS), especially in phase A, the
use of computerized billing and expense recording tools has improved tremendously, as illustrated in Figure 20 and
Figure 21. It can be observed that:


33
   There is a substantial amount of “noise? is baseline and endline data, due to the seasonality of water demand and thus
revenues (high demand in dry season from Nov-Jun), as well as fluctuations of expenses, such as the purchase of inputs over
the year.

     At baseline a quarter of operators did not keep records of their expenses, at endline this is reduced to only
      7%;
     At endline, almost all (93%) of operators use software for billing (Excel, Access, ERMS), increased from 57% at
      the beginning of the program;
     While 7% used ERMS at baseline, this has now increased to 64% for the billing module; for expense
      registration the most popular tool remains Excel (31%), as the uptake of professionalized accounting remains a
      challenge;

Note: based on data from 45 operators

The introduction of ERMS had a more pronounced impact on beginner operators, notably on the time to prepare
invoices (decrease from 5.4 to 4.4 days, with more accuracy); almost half of advanced operators already used
software applications, and thus were less inclined to shift to a new software tool.


                                                                                                                   48
Objective 4: Optimize performance on production and distribution
Similar as for financial performance, technical performance is best understood at the level of individual operators
due to the multitude of factors at play. Nevertheless, positive changes in average key performance indicators can
be observed:
    Average number of hours of delivery per day is close to 22 hours and no major changes were observed (from
    21.4 to 21.9 hr/day). Three quarters of operators are serving 24hr/day at endline.
 Water pressure at the end of the water network has increased considerably from 8 to 12 meter on average, as
    illustrated in Figure 22; also the number of operators that do not measure pressure has decreased from 7 to 5
    (out of 45) and 40% of operators have reached the standard of 10 mH2O.
 Hours of pumping increased on average from 10.3 to 12.8 hr/day.

endline.




Figure 23 illustrates the trends for phase A operators, declining from 15% to 9% over the monitoring period, with
                                                                                                          36

Objective 5: Reduce production cost and increase operational efficiency

                                                                                                               50
The analysis of production costs, including staff costs, energy costs, chemical and others, is presented in Figure 25
and the following changes can be observed:
             While on average across all operators, staff per 1,000 connections increased from 5.8 to 6.9 staff, a third of
              operators decreased their stafing ratio, and around a quarter of operators saw an increase (remaining
              operators no change).
             Staff ratio increases can be explained by the recruitment of specialized staff, especially by beginner operators.
              This actually is a positive change, and a future decline of the staffing ratio is expected as operators grow their
              customer base. The increase in staffing may also be driving the significant increase of unit production costs for
              phase A operators.

                                                                                                                       3
              On average unit production cost declined with 6% from baseline to endline (from 0.25 to 0.23 USD/m ), mostly
              driven by decrease in energy costs, while chemical and other costs increased on average across the operators.
             Almost two-thirds (64%) of operators decreased their unit production costs, 56% saw a decrease in energy
              costs and half saw their chemical input cost decrease.

Objective 6: Investments planning
The final objective of the program was to increase the ability to plan and manage investment projects, with more
emphasis for advanced operators. While investment advisory services are better delivered through a focused
Access-to-Finance program, some changes can be seen:
 Operators with bank accounts increased from 55% to 60% after the program,
 New investment from operators throughout the program period of USD 1.4 million, of which 57% was realized
    by advanced operators,
 Overall investment amount per active connection increased from USD 316 to USD 338.

For sustainability reasons, the next generation of services is recommended to gradually phase out subsidies for
sophisticated operators in the medium term through charging cost-covering fees, while targeting remaining
subsidies to the less advanced operators for services that remain undervalued and/or beyond their affordability.

Table 11 illustrates a proposal for the delivery of a basic BDS package that may be delivered close to cost recovery
levels through CWA, in collaboration with local consultants/coaches. Operators that are yet to invest in computers,
head meters, etc. (category beginner operator), may be less likely to pay the fee at cost recovery and hence
subsidies may need be allocated, in a similar way as subsidies are used to build capacities of public utilities.

5.2.     Results of the Access to Finance program

Overall progress to date (December 2015)
Table 12 presents the results achieved thus far, recognizing that all of the operators that moved to the detailed
investment stage prefer to submit their applications to FTB, although the consortium has also supported some of
the operators in their applications to other banks.

Operator attrition and resulting non-FTB financed investments

Operator attrition rate was initially higher than expected, as out of the original 26 operators recruited, nine
dropped out and three new operators were recruited to achieve the target of 20 loan applications. Box 4
summarizes the key reasons why operators left the program, and decided to not pursue the second phase of the
detailed investment study, for which a considerable self-contribution was required. In many cases, operators were
nevertheless able to use the pre-financing study to develop new investments, acquiring finance from other banks,
sale of land, or loans from family. As explained in section 4.2 those commercial banks did not necessarily need the
investment studies and were comfortable to issue loans based on collateral, previous financial performance and/or
an existing relationship with the operator.

Table 13 provides interesting insights on the sort of financing that could be obtained by these operators, which
totals USD 855,000, of which USD 505,000 from commercial banks. Since early 2015, an estimated number of
1,600 new piped connections have been installed. This number is expected to grow as a result of densification over
time, as well as due to continuation of network expansion.




  A wide variety of reasons was found why operators did not continue in the program, such as:
       Not meeting collateral requirements of FTB; reluctance to pay higher interest rate of other banks
       Not meeting age requirements of FTB-lending, and complications to transfer business to son
       Preference to use equity (sales of land) or family loans on better terms than commercial banks
       Slow process in 2015 to get FTB loans approved and urgency to invest before rainy season (Jun 2015)
       Infrastructure belonged to local government, and could not be pledged as collateral unless contract
          was altered; not sufficient personal collateral to secure loan

  Two operators were discontinued from moving to the next stage of the program due to:
      Unwillingness to invest in improvement of water treatment to ensure proper water quality standard
      Lack of timely cooperation to deliver data at well announced deadlines; opportunity given to others

                                                                                                                 53

Results from FTB-financed investments

Table 14 illustrates the overall results for the 20 operators that applied for FTB financing and the expected new
connections and people served that will result from these investments. As can be seen a total of USD 5.5 million in
commercial financing is expected to be leveraged (if all remaining loan applications pass), leveraging around USD
0.4 million in equity investments by operators. Moreover, operators may have chosen to refinance part of their
existing debt, although precise data are not yet available. Figure 27 illustrates how these investments are shared
over the different components of the investment projects. Obviously, situation per operator varies starkly, with
some of them mostly investing in network expansion, while others focusing on upgrading their production,
treatment and storage capacity to improve water quantity, reliability and quality. By 2020, these projects are
expected to have served an over 169,000 additional people, while a total of 324,000 people will benefit from the
improvements in water quantity, reliability and quality in these schemes. On a national scale, this represents an
increase of around 5% in access and 10% enjoying improved service quality (in 2015 around 3.1 million people
enjoyed piped water connections). At the aggregate level projected changes in service coverage are illustrated in
Figure 28 and total connection growth in

FTB approvals and collateral assessment

An initial lack of clear guidance on documentation requirements at FTB, combined with the full mobilization of the
technical assistance Firm to FTB in June 2015 caused some teething problems and challenges in managing
                                         37
timelines and expectations of operators . While initially an ad-hoc and varying process was implemented for the

37
  A number of issues had to be agreed upon and arranged such as: i) stamping of soft land titles at district and commune
administration , ii) further administrative and legal requirements at AFD/ARIZ HQ in France, and iii) clarity on collateral
assessment and calculation.


                                                                                                                                                 56
first loan approvals (January -October 2015), the process is now streamlined. However, it did lead to significant
time periods between application submissions and assessments, resulting in turn in revisions due to changes in the
approval process as well as the situation of operators. For example, one of the 20 operators sourced a loan to
implement expansions in the short term and as a result has taken on too much debt for FTB to approve the
                         38
application immediately . This application is temporarily on hold till outstanding debt is paid through bridge
financing, after which approval of the application by FTB is likely (and hence results have been included in the
aggregate data).
 The collateral requirements under the FTB program are described in Box 5, and present a significant departure
from their previous practices, much alike those of other commercial lenders.
An analysis of collateral assessment revealed that all 20 submissions relied on land/building as collateral, 16
partially relied on water infrastructure fixed assets, and 12 draw on NPV as collateral. The valuated collateral/loan
                                                                   39
ratio was 156% on average for 19 (instead of 20 operators) . The total collateral valuation (as per Box 5)
determined by FTB for 19 loan applications equaled USD 8.4 million, of which 36% included land/buildings, 22% in
water infrastructure, and 42% expressed in NPV. Across the portfolio, in addition to collateral from land/buildings
used on a preferential basis, only 63% of total collateral was based on infrastructure and only 32% of collateral was
based on NPV. FTB also required that a debt reserve was to be built up at an account that would cover 3 months of
principal and interest payments.



     FTB will calculate potential loan size based on the following collateral:
        (i)    land and buildings are accepted for both hard and soft titles, estimated by two approved
               independent Cambodian real estate valuators up to a maximum value of 100%
       (ii)    Valuation of water infrastructure fixed assets by approved valuator (ISEA/GRET) up to a maximum
               of 50%
      (iii)    Up to 50% of the Net Present Value of future cash flows over 10 years at a 15% discount rate.
               Timeframe is aligned with the loan term and discount rate with FTB’s internal evaluation guidelines

     At minimum the loan needed to be covered 100% by collateral.

     Other commercial lenders typically are reliant on land value (preferably hard titles), either requiring an
     independent valuation or willing to accept the estimate of their loan officers.

Other analytics of assets, investment costs and financial ratios

Further analysis of the 20 investment studies is described below. Figure 30 illustrates that the appraised book
value per existing connection is on average USD 112, spread over different elements of the water system, with
most of the existing assets tied up in the piped distribution network. Larger operators tended to have a lower
appraised book value of existing assets per connection compared to the smaller ones. This could be explained by
economies of scale as well as years in operation (more assets already recovered).




38
   This operator loan application of USD 190,000 was initially rejected mid November 2015 as he already accessed a loan from
ACLEDA bank to execute smaller-scale expansions. However, a new arrangement has been found in which bridge financing is
offered to pay of outstanding debt, after which the loan application with FTB is expected to be approved later in 2016.
39
   Most collateral/loan ratios were between 102% to 200%, and a few outliners with much high ratios due to small loans
requested.

Analyzing the investment projects proposed the average is USD 172 per new connection (by 2020), of which 12
USD is allocated for design and supervision of construction. Half of new investments is on average allocated to the
distribution system, and a higher share goes to treatment (20%), reflecting the need to improve existing facilities
(see Figure 31).

Source: Financial models used in 20 investment studies.
a
  Existing indicators are based on 12 out of 20 operators data as no reliable ratios could be calculated for 8 operators due to lack
of consistent and accurate data.

Table 15 provides key metrics on operating and financial ratios for the 20 loan applications. There are scale
benefits in operating expenses and cost efficiencies realised as operators grow over time, with expected growth in
average consumption levels offsetting a potential decline in tariffs. Across all operators, financial models
                                                          3                                 40
conservatively assumed that tariffs above USD 0.60/m would be expected to decrease . All operators have a high
debt service coverage ratio, and loan amounts often were adjusted downward in the iterative process to allow for
sufficient levels of cash generation. Profit margins see a temporary dip in the first five years after investment, but
restore over time to existing levels of around 40%. Further analysis of profit and loss statements as well as net cash
flows across the portfolio illustrates predictable growth and restoration of net cash flow levels after five years,
equivalent to before the investment, while servicing loan principal repayments and interest. As most schemes are
expansions, and only 2 new green field investments are included (with operators that already have existing water
businesses), there are no liquidity issues in the first years to pay off debt. Thus far, operators have not made use of
the optional grace period, in order to reduce interest payment.

Licensing regime
While the licensing regime was formalized through a new ministerial decree in May 2014 (see Box 3), a transition
period for existing licenses to be replaced with new 20-year licenses was included. This was done because of the
additional requirements for operators (feasibility study, systems and built-out plan) and the limited capacity of
MIH-DPWS to review new applications. As a result of CWA dialogue with MIH, in May 2015, through a ministerial
letter, all existing licenses were automatically renewed with another three year term to provide sufficient time for
                                                  41
operators to prepare an acceptable application . Thus far, 80 three year extensions of existing licenses have been
granted.

Within few months after its issuance, CWA successfully advocated that the new licensing regulation included too
many layers of approval, including district and provincial administrations, besides commune and DIH approvals.



40
    As tariff setting has been a matter of operator negotiation with the communes, a downward pressure on tariffs is expected.
The newly introduced tariff methodology will also help to set tariffs that are based on full cost recovery principles, efficient and
                                                                                              3
allow a fair return on investment. Hence in specific localities, tariffs as high as 0.75 USD/m may still be defendable.
41
   Conditions in this waver were that operators were no longer allowed to collect a minimum charge (e.g. the equivalent of 10
   3
m /month for any connection regardless of consumption), but were asked to charge based on actual consumption of
households. Moreover, operators were asked to lower the tariff. Those unable to lower tariffs were asked to provide a clear
justification.


                                                                                                                                 59
This was corrected through a ministerial letter in September 2014, waving the requirements of operators to get
                                              42
district and province administration approvals .

Table 16 illustrates the status of the licensing application thus far. To account for the overwhelming demand, MIH
has automatically extended expired licenses with a three year-period. As of January 2016, five 20-year licenses
have been issued, although the number is expected to jump over the coming months.

Table 16 Overview of status of implementation of licensing regulation

License type      Progress
                  3 licenses for 20 year have been issued replacing old license following due process (Nov 2014,
Replacement       Jun 2015, and Nov 2015)
(20 years)        1 license for 20 year has been issued for Phnom Penh Economic Zone to existing (unlicensed)
                  supplier of water to factories; 1 competitively granted license
Direct            103 applications for feasibility study submitted, of which 101 approved
(20 years)        54 applicants submitted the feasibility study and built out plan, of which 39 have been
                  approved by MIH committee and passed public hearing
                  3 have been send back with comments; and 12 have not yet been reviewed
                  Out of 39 approved studies, only 1 20-year license has been issued on Jan 2016; others are
                  expected to be issued soon
Renewal           80 existing three-year licenses have been approved for automatic extension with 3 years
(3 years)

While recognizing this large workload for the MIH-DPWS, it is clear that further assistance and staff increases
would be required to manage the licensing process. Clearly, capacities on the side of operators to prepare
feasibility studies remain limited, as well as their willingness and ability to access the necessary support services to
prepare the requested documents. Another complicating matter is that at the time of the license issuance, no
formal tariff setting rules were approved, leaving an important vacuum. In a response, CWA has provided
                                                                                               43
assistance to several operators to prepare tariff submissions as part of license applications .

MIH-DPWS has revoked nine existing licenses in 2015, as the licensee did not start construction within the required
period in the area. Requests to carry out feasibility studies for these nine sites have already been submitted to
MIH.

Requests for further TA have been put forward to receive internal staff capacity building to better manage the
                                                            44
licensing process and deal with the back-log of applications .

Finally, an important new arrangement under the licensing decree is the competitive granting of new licenses (for
new investment sites). With project preparation financed and executed by GRET, as well as an investment grant of
USD 150,000, the first license has been successfully tendered in a transparent manner. MIH-DPWS intends to carry
out more competitive granting of licenses. Technical assistance may be required to carry out a master planning of
sites, screen and prioritize investments sites, prepare the feasibility studies, structure the transactions and risk
allocation, prepare tender documents and carry out the procurement process in a transparent way. A more
transparent and competitive process can help to reduce rent-seeking behavior and in turn have lowering effect on
tariffs. Similarly, if additional grant financing can be allocated for less viable sites, tariffs can be brought down
accordingly.




42
   The TA advised to include only commune level approvals, followed directly by approvals of the license granting authority
(MIH). However, this arrangements was not adopted in the ministerial decree, which required addition approval by district
administration and provincial departments of Industry and Handicraft.
43
   CWA has helped operators calculate tariffs as part of license applications, using a simple profit margin model, rather than a
return on investment model.
44
   Direct granting of licenses is known to solicit informal fees for operators (from various levels). The new licensing term of 20
years is said to have pushed up informal fees, which may be a hampering factor to expedite the issuance.


                                                                                                                               60
Economic regulation framework and tariff setting method
Following various consultation workshops, a draft decree was prepared by the international regulation expert,
which subsequently was reviewed and modified by MIH and presented in a national consultation workshop in
October 2015. Over 200 people attended the event, representing private sector operators, CWA, public utilities,
                                                            45
DIHs, as well as other ministries and development partners . It is expected that after inclusion of comments, the
ministerial decree will be issued in first quarter of 2016.

Box 6 summarizes the objectives, scope and principles of the tariff draft decree, as presented for consultation.
Figure 32 presents the categorization which is proposed to tailor regulation to the capabilities of different groups
of utilities. This categorization determines in turn the tariff setting methodology (cash flow methodology versus
annuity method) and the extent of the review process, while underlying principles are the same for all. The draft
regulation (available as supplementary documentation under Annex 5) includes provisions on the following
aspects:
            Process during subsequent review (e.g. tariff submission as condition for renewal of operating
               certificate, period for public consultation/comments, final tariff publication)
            Data requirements for the different methodologies (e.g. household connection projections as per
               built-out plan, investment plan with CAPEX and OPEX projections, financial statements)
            Definition of methodologies (and adjustment mechanism of prior review period)
            Description of tariff regulation activities (such as establishment of service coverage and NRW targets ,
                                                                          46
               extent of review, and regulatory discretion upon review)
            Provisions for interim tariff adjustments and extra-ordinary events, such as in the case of
               hyperinflation or other price shocks

The methodology, in line with the licensing decree, requires adjustments every five years, as annual indexation of
tariffs is not the norm in Cambodia. The five year review period includes and adjustment process for prior period
that accounts for inflationary pressures, beyond the inflation index as included in the calculation of the rate of
return. These provisions are deemed sufficient to mitigate the inflationary risk for operators. Inflation, foreign-
exchange and market risks are all born by the operator within the five year period, and can be adjusted for during
the review process in the next five year.

  Service Coverage targets have not been set, but most likely will be 90% of the potential households to be connected as per
the five year Systems and Built-Out Plan (in some cases, the licensed area may be much larger than feasible can be covered
within a five year period and regulatory discretion may be used to deviate from the generic target). Non-Revenue Water targets
will likely be set at 15%.


                                                                                                                           61
Initially, a further sub-categorization of private versus public utilities was proposed, based on a higher assessment
of regulatory risks for private operators versus public utilities. However, to reduce complexity, MIH found capacity
to be the most defining feature for categorization. Even small public utilities were reported to have similar
inadequacies as private operators. The cut-off point of 2000 connections was informed through available studies
                  47
(Frenoux, 2013) and decided upon by MIH.

A total of 11 staff assigned by MIH participated in a two day training on the tariff methodology in November 2015,
explaining both theoretical underpinnings of concepts, hands-on training of the models, and using case studies to
                                                      48
practice application of the different methodologies . Trainees were staff from Regulation Office, and the Planning
and Administration office, mostly with engineering bachelor degrees and some having bachelor in business
administration or finance. The evaluation of the training revealed that most were satisfied with the quality and
materials in the training, although more practice was requested in the future. While the annuity model was largely
understood by all trainees, comprehension of the cash flow model as well as the block tariff calculation was
                        49
reported to be lower . A third of trainees reported they are confident to apply the tariff methodology in their
work situation, another third reported somewhat confident and the last third stated they needed more practice
and assistance. It should be noted that, given the large volume of pending license applications, the existing
capacity of five staff in the regulatory office will need further augmentation and capacity development to handle
the expected workload. The TA also provided training to CWA staff as well as the JICA team who will be assisting
Kampong Cham (and other utilities) in the future business and investment planning, and related tariff calculations.

It is important to note that as part of the series of consultation workshops in 2015 the necessity of independent
regulation has continuously been stressed. However, within the timeframe of the TA, and due to the ongoing
drafting of a comprehensive Water Law with JICA support, wider institutional issues have not been addressed. The
focus has been on providing practical legal instruments (ministerial decree) that could later be reflected as a by-
law or sub-decree, once a comprehensive institutional and legal reform has been enacted. The imminent priority
going forward for MIH-DPWS is to start applying the new methodology as part of the process to issue replacement
and new licenses. In this process, MIH-DPWS will gradually start to develop more granular benchmarks for its
perusal during the review process of tariff submissions of operators.

   For example, the level of computerization and record keeping, as well as the use of and to external expertise was generally
higher for the larger private operators. Moreover, smaller private operators tended to face more completion from self-supply
and rainwater usage, hence reducing risks for monopolistic behaviors.
48
   On day 2 of the training, only 7 trainees were present.
49
   Evaluation is based on feedback forms of 6 out of the 7 trainees that attended both training days. The computation for the
WACC was least understood by trainees, however, this can simply be used as an input variable, with higher level officials setting
the ROI level for specific tariff reviews.

    Objectives:
         Approval of tariffs to be imposed by water service providers upon the grant of their water permits
         Review and adjustment of tariffs of water service providers after every 5 years
    With the objective to balance interest of:
           (i)   Consumers: lowest possible cost for quality service
          (ii)   Investors: recover investments and get a fair return
         (iii)   Government: achieve development goals for piped water provision

    Scope:
         all public enterprises, public-private partnerships and private enterprises that have licenses
         water service providers regulated by contract that voluntarily agreed, through amendment of
           contract, to comply with the provisions of the Licensing prakas, and wish to expand Service Area

    Principle of rate of Return on Investment (ROI) and treatment of grant and donations
         The ROI to be set shall follow:
            (i)      the general principles of the market
           (ii)      the geographical conditions peculiar to specific water service providers
         ROI is equal to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and is a general rate applied across
                operators, based on
            (i)      weighted average of cost of debt and cost of equity
           (ii)      based on prevailing market rates
          (iii)      based on the optimal debt ratio for an efficient water service provider
          (iv)       with nominal WACC adjusted for inflation factor to arrive at the real WACC
         Lower ROI shall be set for water service providers that are able to take advantage of grants and
                          a
                donations .
         Lower ROI may be set for water service providers operated by government or by government-owned
                entities.

    Principle of Full Cost Recovery
         Water service providers are allowed to recover only “reasonable costs? which are operating
                expenditures and capital expenditures that are prudent, necessary, and efficient.
            (i)     incurred in a discrete and practical manner and do not deviate substantially from benchmarks
           (ii)     relevant in the provision of piped water services in the service area
          (iii)     capable of achieving the desired results with the minimum use of resources, time, and effort
                                 c
    Principle of Pro-Poor Tariff
         Poor family needs at least 6m /month of piped water; water expenditure < 2% of monthly income
                                          3

         Operator can structure blocks and use different consumer categories, as long as tariff for first 6 m
                                                                                                               3

             shall not exceed 2% of poor monthly income

Box 6 Summary of objective, scope and principles in the proposed tariff regulation decree
a
  Cost of capital expenditures financed through grants and donations forms part of tariff computation. Assets financed by grants
are to be fully recovered, however, without making a return on those grants for CAPEX (“equity with zero cost?).
b
  Using the official average national poverty line stated by the Ministry of Planning in current prices, the pro-poor tariff is
calculated as KHR 2400/m3 (USD 0.60) in 2015 prices. Pro poor tariff should at least be applied to all households with ID-poor
identification (http://www.mop.gov.kh/projects/idpoor/tabid/154/default.aspx). The decree does not govern the setting of
connection fee, which is issued at the time of license granting. MIH will apply a cap of USD 75 for connection fees, while
encouraging operators to offer installment payments to their poor customer.

For the computation of the WACC to arrive at the approved rate of return, Table 17 provides exemplary details,
while the final rate to be applied will be set by the Minister of Industry and Handicraft as the regulatory authority.

Water Services Monitoring System
Table 18 summarizes the categories and number of indicators and data that are included in the Water Services
Monitoring System (WSMS), with full details on the system and its functionalities reported on in Annex 6. Given
the experience of the system pilot in two provinces, and the difficulty for operators to generate all data, especially
water quality data, a rationalized set of indicators has been agreed upon as “compulsory? for initial reporting
under the national roll-out. This has been announced with the understanding that in the near future this limited
set would be expanded to ensure all obligatory reporting requirements under the licensing regulation are met.

  Profile data are data that only change with longer time intervals (e.g. such as five yearly) and can mostly be acquired form the
license application (and subsequent renewals)



The system - in order to enhance the chances of its sustainable usage - allows for a gradual transition from a
previous, often incomplete, paper-based reporting system, to a system where both electronic submission and
paper-based submission are possible (see Figure 33). It defines the following roles, which have been agreed upon




                                                                                                                                64
and assigned to specific MIH and DIH staff (and user accounts have been provided): i) data input user, ii) data
verifier, iii) data approver, and iv) system administrator.

Figure 33 Overview of data processing flows in the Water Services Monitoring System




Note: operators and DIH staff can input data in the system (DIH staff using hardcopy report of operators without computer
ability); MIH has ability to input data, such as profile data, and revisions after verification; MIH is not expected to enter regular
quarterly data, as this is the responsibility of DIH staff

Given the limited reporting activity going on in the past, results of the pilot in Kandal and Kampong Cham were
mixed. Around 50% of operators in Kandal and 30% in Kampong Cham have computer literacy. Staff from DIH in
Kandal entered data themselves, reaching around 75% completion of submissions (although incomplete) for Q2
and Q3 of 2015, while Kampong Cham let operators enter data themselves, this resulted in low/no data without
active follow-up. The verification and approval process within MIH worked fairly smoothly and only limited system
errors were found, indicating the robustness of the system and the readiness for national roll out and training.

In November 2015, a series of one-day regional training events was organized. Table 19presents the results of the
national roll-out process, in which a total of 192 persons have been reached, including staff from MIH, CWA, DIH,
as well as 9 public utilities, 93 licensed operators and 14 unlicensed operators. Overall turn out has been good and
                                                                            50
two-third of licensed operators were reached in this first training round . While hand-holding support has been
provided up to end of 2015, further technical assistance to support the consolidation phase is needed to ensure
usage (including DIH and operators) and help MIH in basic data analysis.

  Most likely operators who would have limited computer ability may not have responded to the training announcement and
may continue to submit paper-based reports. However, additional outreach by MIH/DIH staff to absent operators would be
needed to carry out follow-up rounds of training.

MIH has signed a maintenance and hosting arrangement from January 2016 with a local software provider and the
system is now accessible to all users, including the public at http://wsms.mih.gov.kh/. Data availability is limited
to profile data and limited recent data due to the slow verification and approval process of MIH thus far.


5.4.     Results on dialogue and knowledge

Organizational development CWA

In its strategic plan 2014-2019 (see Annex 7), CWA articulated the following priority areas, and has made
substantial progress on all of those:
     i)       increasing and diversifying members,
     ii)      provision of value-adding services to operators,
     iii)     fund mobilization through partnerships,
     iv)      representing private operators interest in policy dialogue, and
     v)       improve CWA institutional and staff capacity

Led by a small group of champion water operators, from its registration in August 2012, CWA has grown rapidly as
illustrated in Figure 35, although membership of licensed operators has reached a plateau at 72 since December
2014. These 72 “active? members, meaning licensed opera tors, nevertheless represent 101 licensed water
schemes, which is around 70% of all licenses in country - serving an estimated number of 800,000 people. CWA
conducted an overhaul in its membership policies and fees and encourages “associate members? to join, such as
suppliers, professionals, students, as well as unlicensed operators (now 19 unlicensed members). CWA, since 2014
an IWA member, is headed by a 9-member Board of Directors and has elected a new Board of Directors in the
January 2016 General Assembly, including 2 Board members from the associate categories, reflecting the
diversification of the membership base.

CWA has expanded its executive team to 8 local staff, responsible for a growing annual budget, from USD 56,000 in
2014 to USD 113,000 in 2015, with projection of USD 116,000 for 2016. It has put in place staff policies on
performance appraisal and benefits approved by the Board. In addition to membership fees, CWA is generating
income from its own training and events, project management fees and – as seed funds – was able to retain
                                           51
operator fees for the BDS and A2F program . CWA, with support of AFD/EU, and in partnership with GRET, will
continue to host a further expansion of these programs on harmonized principles for an additional 20 water
operators for the next three years. As compared to 2014, CWA has started to diversify its income through
membership retreats and conferences and is expanding its partnership arrangements.

Finally, CWA has contributed to influencing new regulations, such as the 2014 licensing regulation. It helped to
support its dissemination and in bringing implementation issues to the forefront of policy makers, as well as
through individual case support.




Dialogue and knowledge on private sector provision

The knowledge exchange to the Philippines has laid an important foundation for closer coordination and
information sharing between private and public sector. The Senior Minister has expressed his support for CWA and
the importance for operators to join the platform. Since June 2015, regular quarterly dialogues have been agreed
and take place between MIH senior level and CWA to advance sector development. One recent agreements is for
MIH and CWA to organize a training for CWA staff and/or consultants/experts on the requirements for licensing
applications, and minimum standards of feasibility studies.

Key results of the pro-poor study, implemented in 2013/14, that looked at connections and barriers faced by ID-
                 52
poor households , were disseminated during CWA’s General Assembly, as well as during ministerial workshops
and in discussions with development partners. Box 7 shares the key findings (see also Figure 37 and Figure 38)
and a WSP research brief will be published in the first quarter of 2016.




     Private operators serve areas with high poor incidence rate but do not expand to all villages
          On average, only 70% of villages under license area was served;
          ID-Poor household incidence rate was 29% in areas outside of the network, as compared to 23% inside the
              network, while overall national ID-poor incidence rate is 27%

     Similar as for most public utilities, private operator services - when available - are not equally accessed by ID-poor
          Overall connection rates in served villages was modest with average of 45%
          ID-Poor household connection rate was only 20%, while non- ID-poor connection rate more than twice as
              high at 50%

     Tariffs, connection fees and operator practices determine ID-poor household connection rates:
           Average water tariff of 0.56 USD/m (range 0.5-0.6 USD/m3); an increase of USD 0.10/m is leading to a 7%
                                                   3             3                                        3

               decrease in poor household connection rate; this relationship was not found for the non-poor
           Average fee of USD 60 (range USD 20-100); this is 80% of poor household monthly income; a USD 10
               increase leads to a 2% decrease in poor connection rate; this relationship is not found for the non-poor
           Connection costs are much lower as fees charged on (average USD 32; range from USD20-100)
           Only poor-specific operator practices lead to higher poor connection rates
           Additional years in business only leads to non-poor customer growth, not to poor customer growth

  The study used ID-poor identification system of the Ministry of Planning to define “poor? (ID-poor category 1 and ID-poor
category 2). This identification system is based on a combined asset wealth ranking and community assessment. See also

During phase 2 of the study, a further comparison of characteristics of water use and expenditure was made
                 53
between “ID poor ? and different “consumption poor? segments, i.e. the bottom 40%, and households (the
poorest 17%) who consume less than the national poverty line. This was done through including predictors of
consumption poverty in the survey questionnaire. The key results are summarized in Table 20.

                                                                                                                        69
The consumption model based on the 34 districts where the survey took place showed a fairly poor match
between consumption poor (under poverty line) and ID-poor: only 25% of ID-poor are consumption poor, and 5%
of the non-ID-poor are consumption poor. This finding is consistent with earlier evaluations done by the Poverty
Practice. The ID-Poor program does a better job at capturing households that are perceived as poor by other
villagers than capturing poverty status based on consumption. However, this remains in line with the program’s
objective of evaluating several dimensions of poverty as perceived by local communities.

The research revealed that for both access (phase 1), but also for water consumption and expenditure, the ID-poor
categorization seems to be good way to understand barriers that marginalized household face. The fact that ID-
                                                                                                            3
poor households on average spend around USD 3.15 per month for piped water and consume around 5.8 m , has
                                                                                                  3
helped to inform the recommendations on the pro-poor tariff (see Box 6), which is proposed at 6 m for maximum
of USD 3.6 per month.

Given that only 28% of operators use pro-poor connection procedures, it is not surprising to see that poor
households cited connection fees as the primary reason for not being able to connect. Interestingly, no household
reported tariffs being the primary reason, but this was cited as the second most common response when multiple
reasons were asked (see Figure 39).



Figure 39 Reasons for poor households not connecting to piped water supply (n=468)




The household survey also included questions around ability of ID-poor households to access finance. The vast
majority of unconnected poor households (91%) stated that they do not have any access to financial sources, such
as MFI loans or family loans, to pay the connection fee. An overwhelming 98% of those stated they would not use a
loan for a water connection, if such offer was available. This is possible a reflection of the lack of familiarity with
MFI-loans and the perceived high interest rates. These findings suggest that any future MFI-water connection
financing may need adequate marketing and may also require partial subsidies, specifically targeted at the ID-poor.
The above results have led to intensified discussion on connections fees, which often are charged well above costs
by operators. MIH is now requesting operators to report connections to ID-poor households and will apply a cap of
maximum USD 75 for a connection fee. They encouraging operators to offer installment payments to the extent
feasible. Moreover, the NSDP articulates the importance of developing a “Water for All? facility, through whic h
connections for poor households can be partly subsidized (following the example of PPWSA, where such social
connection policy is already included). Investment grants delivered through the AFD/EU program will also be used
(partly) to help connect ID-poor households within schemes that accessing loans (with an ID-poor subsidy of
around USD 40).

5.5.        Results on gender aspects

A body of evidence suggests that programs to improve water quality only are unlikely to have a significant health
impact, but rather that much greater health impact could be achieved by improving hygiene. One of the most
simple and obvious ways to do so is to make more water use more convenient and easy to access, such as through
piped water supply in the yard. Being able to access piped water on the premises offers various other non-health
benefits. It can often result in time savings – time that could instead be invested in education or work
productivity. Secondly having a tap at home can potentially mitigate the security risks and vulnerability women
                                                                  and children often face when collecting

                                                                  water .

                                                                  According to the model documented by
                                                                  (Cairncross and Feacem, 1993), once water is
                                                                  piped into the house or yard, the convenience
                                                                  of access results in consumption rising
                                                                  dramatically. Hence, this will help their hygiene
                                                                  to improve – and they will therefore be more
                                                                  likely to show a health benefit. In Cambodia,
                                                                  with plenty of unsafe surface water resources,
                                                                  ponds and shallow wells available close to
                                                                  home, it is only the installation of house
                                                                  connections that is likely to yield increases in
                                                                  consumption and therefore a health benefit.
                                                                  This is evidenced by the results of the pro-poor
study (section 5.4) where water consumption – whether connected to piped water or not – stem from multiple
sources (including rainwater, wells), however overall consumption levels are greater for piped supply. Water
                                                           3
consumption for piped supply is on average 6 to 11 m /household per month, depending on whether the
household is poor or not, while poor household not connected to piped water on average only use around half
that amount. There was a clear trend that piped water tended to substitute for well water, surface water, and
trucked water in a household’s mix of sources, but the majority of piped water users continued to use rainwater.
Obviously, this increased water use will disproportionally accrue to women and girls, in terms of time-savings,
productivity, health and safety as well menstrual hygiene.

The research interestingly found a link between female empowerment and being connected to piped water
although causation could run in either direction. Female incomes in connected poor households are much greater
on average than female incomes in unconnected poor households (USD 30 vs. USD 18 per month). This difference
                                            55
is statistically significant at the 5% level . The association between female income and a piped water connection is
consistent with previous anecdotal findings in Cambodia. The TA has helped to connect over 324,000 people with
piped water supply, of which 50% are expected to be women beneficiaries.

In addition to the impact on the daily lives of women and girls, the TA has empowered female entrepreneurs as
owner water operators. Out of the 29 operators in the A2F program, 5 had female ownership, of which 4 were able
to successfully secure finance. Out of the 47 participants in the BDS program, 21 involved female water operators,
often as part of family businesses, of which 15 advanced and 6 beginners. Training and coaching participants for
the business and financial/administrative subjects included up to 35% female participants (although participation
in technical training was limited).

6. Lessons Learned, Challenges and Recommendations

6.1.     Lessons learned and challenges

Moving from firm-level to industry wide capacities
Box 8 summarizes the challenges encountered and lesson learned with respect to the BDS program.

Box 8 Lessons in moving from firm level to industry level capacity

Lessons on the relevance, design, and marketing of an at-scale BDS program
    Informed by an earlier needs assessment the BDS content was developed in close coordination with CWA and
     operators, and as a result content was relevant and tailored to the needs of operators
    CWA has established as an industry association and is a good mechanism to pool demand from operators ;
     future marketing can be less intense, (piggy-back on existing events, direct calling and social media outreach
    Different methods and tools were appreciated by operators, however unbundling of the BDS package may be
     needed to attract more operators
Lessons on pricing strategy and packaging of Business Development Services
    Pricing strategy was about right (ca. USD 600-1250), as three quarter of operators stated at the end of the
     program that the fee was affordable, and all but two would pay again a similar amount in the future. However,
     smaller operators may need less costly entry packages (“try-outs?) to get accustomed to BDS concept.
    Unbundling packages into group training, individual coaching, (pooled) advisory services, and exposure visits
     may help to further tailor price versus ability-to-pay of different operator segments, as well as willingness-to-
     pay for different type of services
Lessons on delivery of BDS packages
    Phasing and planning of training matters; working around busy periods in the business cycle of operators is a
     necessity to avoid drop-outs
    Individual target setting for “doable? improvements could have been included to achieve greater focus of
     coaching plans
    High variability in skills of operator staff, such as within advanced operators, is difficult to avoid and poses
     challenges in group training contexts; stricter entry criteria and training designed for specific job-profiles can
     help to mitigate this
Lessons on monitoring and sustainability
    Monitoring data generate valuable insights for benchmarking, and can gradually change operator attitudes
     towards performance monitoring; monitoring tools need to be as real-time as possible to deliver direct
                                                               56
     feedback loops and be valuable to individual operators .
    CWA has was able to independently deliver coaching to beginners on business/finance ; technical training and
     coaching may require use of consultants; a pool of “CWA associates? may need to be developed in the future
    Replication of business development services is not yet financially sustainable, but needs to strive to higher
     levels of cost recovery through: i) adjustment of package content and conditions to reduce costs, ii)
     outsourcing services with high willingness-to-pay (e.g. software support) to local service firms, iii) maintain fee
     levels or gradual increases and iv) allocate subsidies to complex (e.g. license and tariff submissions) and/or less
     in-demand/valued services (e.g. water quality and monitoring support services).
    A harmonized approach by development partners is critical for delivery of market-based BDS, preventing
     dampening of future demand and spoiling a nascent market

  ISEA is planning to collaborate with CWA in the further development of the web-based monitoring platform (EMAS –
Enterprise Monitoring and Advisory System), as an instrument for individual operator consulting, as well as a tool for member-
benchmarking. Operator benchmarks, derived from the BDS program were presented during the National Water Conference
hosted by CWA in November 2015.


                                                                                                                           72
Facilitating Access to Finance

While the Access-to-Finance program is in its last stages of implementation, and not all feedback and results have
been compiled, the following preliminary lessons are presented in Box 9.

Box 9 Lessons in accelerating access-to-finance

Lessons on relevance, marketing and selection of operators for the Access-to-Finance program
    An overwhelming interest of operators in using A2F services has confirmed the relevance of the program;
     while 50% of operators plans to invest, 75% of operators indicated access to finance as a key obstacle
     (Frenoux, 2013).
    Marketing for A2F services through CWA worked well, but for reasons of transparency and fairness, enrolment
     could have been phased in two rounds (or yearly).
    Selection criteria and ranking system for operators could be simplified and better aligned with minimum bank
     criteria, e.g. reflecting trivial factors that led to operator attrition such as age, contractual arrangement
     (ownership of assets under lease)
Lessons on pricing strategy, phasing and implementation process of Access-to-Finance program
    Advance contribution fees, USD 250 for the pre-financing study (phase 1) and USD 1000-2000 for the
     investment study (phase 2) were generally affordable to operators; the amount itself did not lead to attrition,
     indicating that prices were set right and may even move upward.
    To mitigate the operator risk of loan applications being rejected a 50% refund for fees was introduced;
     alternatively the 100% advance payment may be split in 50% advance and 50% after loan signing
    The pre-financing phase can be rationalized to focus on key metrics of interest to local banks , rather than an
     extensive business plan; this could led to faster decisions to either proceed to the investment study for
     potential FTB clients, or to engage with other commercial lenders for a “regular? collateral-backed loan.
    The investment study and steps in the loan application preparation needed to be carefully matched and
     interwoven with the work flow and requirements of the lending institution of choice (FTB);
    Timely support and clarity on new lending terms and procedures is essential to keep operators interested in
     the program; initial lack of clarity on FTB arrangements resulted in iterations and delays, causing operator
     attrition; operators used equity, family loans, or mobilized smaller loans on less favourable terms through
     other commercial banks to make timely investments
Lessons on bank engagement, collateral assessment and replication
    Especially when new lending terms are required and new banking practices are introduced, technical
     assistance, a partial risk guarantee and preferably a source of concessional credit is a needed to initiate such
                57
     changes . This led to a much more attractive terms than currently available in the market (ca. 8% interest
     p.a., 10-year term, 12 month grace period, and reduction to 100% collateral requirement)
    Collateral assessment by FTB was changed significantly to include i) 100% of land/buildings accepting soft
     titles, ii) 50% of the appraised value of water infrastructure assets, and iii) 50% of the NPV of future cash
     flows; introducing cash-flow based financing for the water sector was a new concept and reliance on “soft?
     NPV was capped at not more than half collateral requirement.
    Assumptions in the investment study, financial model and technical assessment need to be acceptable and
     closely aligned with the relevant bank’s internal guidelines and procedures to ensure a smooth approval
     process;
    Bank engagement activities and lender forums can stimulate interest in the sector and have led to a better
     understanding of water sector lending characteristics; however, credit enhancements instruments are needed

  Since the resources under this TA could not be directed to assist one local bank over another, but rather were meant to
benefit the sector at large, the TA focused its attention on supporting the operator side. It then built synergies with the AFD/EU
program that provided dedicated support and technical assistance to one local bank.


                                                                                                                               73

Box 10 Lessons on enhancing public sector support

Lessons on licensing, tariff regulation and pro-poor service delivery
    Rather than starting with a comprehensive overhaul of legal and institutional arrangements through a Water
     Law, a gradual pragmatic approach towards improving the regulatory environment has been instrumental in
     creating a better enabling environment for private sector water service provision;
    Working with multiple stakeholders has allowed the MIH to see the breadth of tools and partners it has to
     implement regulation; it created understanding of the benefits of formalization among operators; this reflects
     a growing social contract between the state and private sector
    As evidenced by the large amount of new licensing applications, the issuance of the new licensing decree has
     provided impetus for an increased level of formalization and for attracting future investments, especially by
     extending the license term to 20 years and allowing a competitive granting process
    To comply with new regulations, assistance is needed to help operators prepare adequate license applications
     and feasibility studies, and to the regulator (MIH-DPWS) in managing the license execution process in a
     transparent and speedy matter;
    Lack of transparency in the execution of the license regulation remains an issue, leaving room for rent-seeking
     behaviour; scaling-up the competitive granting of licenses, as already successfully piloted in 2015 with support
     of GRET, may help to mitigate these risks
    Although not yet passed, the consultation process around the new tariff regulation has created heightened
     awareness among operators on i) service obligations – including to the poor - that come with a monopoly
     right, and ii) the necessity to substantiate tariff submissions with proper data;
    Evidence on private sector service delivery to the poor has allowed the inclusion of for pro-poor policies in the
     tariff regulation, while protecting the business interest of the private sector;
    Evidence indicates that using microfinance for water connection could potentially help increase access rate,
     but ID-poor households may need partial subsidies to pay connection fees or qualify for such microfinance
          58
     loan
Lesson on creating better sector oversight and monitoring
    Although challenging, the development process of the monitoring system has successfully engaged high-level
     and professional staff in all important decisions related to the system; this resulted in ownership and resource-
     allocation for operational cost
    Monitoring framework, functionality, processes and system design have been aligned with available financial
     and human resources within MIH, DIH as well as the capacities of various users, including water operators;
    Involvement of a local software firm from the start of the project has led to sustainable maintenance
     arrangements after the software is handed over and “goes live? in January 2016.
    Building a sustainable sector monitoring system requires top-level support and clear instructions to all levels
     of users; external assistance post-handover is necessary to ensure sustainable usage and help with sector
     analytics
Lessons on strengthening a platform for sector dialogue


58
  Water.org has carried out additional market research among operators and households which confirmed the potential
market for water connection financing (under publication); results were presented at the national Cambodian Water
Conference in November 2015.


                                                                                                                   74
    Strengthening the nascent industry association in executing its various strategic priorities, including its
     advocacy role, has helped to institutionalize a public-private dialogue between CWA and MIH; the growth and
     maturation of CWA has helped to prevent the association from being “captured? by other interests
    While CWA has seen a positive diversification of its income sources, the association tends to show mission
     creep in its quest to attract financial resources from partners; focus should be maintained on its evolving
     strategic priorities, while ensuring that an adequate percentage of its budgets is secured through membership
     fees (currently only 20%)

6.2.     Recommendations going forward

This technical assistance has illustrated that incentives for private water operators to use business development
services vary, e.g. i) pressures for compliance with regulation, ii) opportunities to access finance by better business
plans, or ii) impacting the bottom line through more efficient business and operational practices and smarter
investment decisions. Institutionalizing market-based BDS-programs within CWA as industry association can be a
sustainable, scalable and effective alternative to “one-off? project-based capacity building to professionalize small
water operators. Building a local market and demand for business development services requires the introduction
of a transactional relationships between water operator and local BDS provider(s) gradually striving for cost
recovery of fees. A long-term phase-out strategy for subsidies is needed, in which a differentiated approach would
be used to allocate subsidies only to less advanced operators and for specific services that remain undervalued.
CWA has played an effective role as matchmaker to pool demand and promote efficient delivery of business
development services. This resulted in positive changes in technical, business and financial performance, as well as
changed skills, attitudes and operator practices, and as well as appreciation of the added value of BDS. National
platforms, such as CWA, can also play an important role in the further professionalization of a fragmented water
industry characterized by weak capacities, through i) stimulating professional and pro-poor business practices, ii)
raising awareness and dialogue on sector developments, iii) offering support services to help operators comply
with new regulations and iv) strengthening network with value chain actors, v) facilitating A2F programs of local
banks in collaboration with development partners.
Close alignment with AFD/EU Access-to-Finance program allowed WSP’s modest technical assistance program to
                                                                                    59                          60
leverage commercial financing from local banks, equaling a total of USD 6.0 million , as well as USD 0.7 million in
additional equity. This is projected to lead to a 5% increase in access to piped water by 2020, while another group
of 20 operators will be supported in the next 2-3 years to access finance with an expected volume of USD 5 million,
using a similar processes.
Both professionalization and acceleration of services provision require complementary measures to address the
regularity and enabling environment for operators. While the technical assistance has made important gains in this
area, further reform and capacity building of MIH to execute the new regulations is paramount. Only with effective
implementation of licensing and tariff decrees and related monitoring requirements, will BDS and A2F programs be
fully effective. Other than capacity building, this may also require internal reforms within MIH, such as raising the
Department of Potable Water Supply to the level of a General Directorate, including the necessary human and
financial resources, followed by the establishment of an independent regulatory body in the medium to long term
(requires a Water Law to be passed).
Sector transition to inject public finance
The most attractive and viable investment sites are expected to be served over the next few years through equity
                                                                             61
and debt financing. However, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals , Cambodia will need to transition to
a new era where subsidies are allocated to leverage private sector investments (equity and debt) in less viable new
sites, e.g. through grants, concessional loans or domestic public transfers. This transition to serve poorer, more
“rural? areas with piped services may also require that debt financing arrangeme nts reflect longer tenures and
grace period to reflect the longer recovery times and liquidity constraints in early years of operation from less

59
   USD 5.5 million from AFD concessional credit line; and USD 0.5 million through other commercial banks;
60
   USD 0.4 million equity from the 20 proposals that will get financed through FTB, and USD 0.3 million from the 9 proposals
that got financed through other commercial banks.
61
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set a higher bar for service delivery than the MDGs (using “improved water
source?). The SDGs require 100% access to safely managed drinking water by 2030, which includes regulated water services at
the premise, of reliable and sufficient quantity, and quality.


                                                                                                                         75
dense urban sites. Such subsidies could be best allocated through a competitive licensing process, based on a
longer-term master plan that would identify and prioritize investment sites, using commercial viability gap
financing (VGF) and potentially subsidy payments to cover cash deficits in early years of scheme operation. Such
process would require strong involvement of the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft and would contribute to
higher transparency and better value for money for rural customers.
In the longer term, different business models for private sector involvement may need to be considered through
bundling of sites, as well as through other PPP modalities than the existing full privatization under license.
In addition to green field investments and expansions into non-viable areas, “densification? is required, as
                                                                                                          62
connection rates in areas under network are 50% for the non-poor and only 20% for poor household . Private
water operators may require incentives such as output-based subsidies to close this equity gap, e.g. through a
national “Water for all Facility? under stewardship of MIH, as foreseen in th e National Strategic Development Plan
2014-2018.
The above sector transition will require a closer harmonization of development partners supporting the sector to
arrive at a consistent and transparent policy and procedures for granting such subsidies. Preferably, this would
lead in the long-term to harmonized arrangements and potentially a facility that would be able to leverage public
funds from multiple sources. It would also require scaled-up access to local commercial finance. The ongoing
AFD/EU Access-to-Finance program, which includes local commercial finance and limited amount of grants, as well
as the investment project of DFAT, hosted with the Cambodian Development Council, provide opportunities for
the government to achieve such transition. Moreover, leveraging grant financing in the medium-term from the
World Bank’s Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), will allow the government to pilot the Viability
Gap Financing approach and gain valuable experience that can be replicated at scale through a potential future
sector wide approach towards private sector provision.
Recommendations are for medium and long-term are summarized below so as to help improve access to piped
                                                              63
water service provision in partnership with the private sector .
Recommendations for Ministry of Industry and Handicraft

Short to Medium-term:
     Build capacity and expand assigned staff and resources of MIH-DPWS to execute its regulatory and
         monitoring mandate, transforming the Department into a General Directorate for Potable Water Supply;
     Continue support to provincial DIHs for monitoring and encourage self-reporting by water operators for
         compliance; recognize DIHs for timely and complete data entry and develop field verification protocols for
         gradual improvement of data quality in the Water Services Monitoring System (WSMS)
     Analyze and publicize data through WMWS-MIH website through an annual benchmarking exercise,
         covering increasingly more water operators
     Expand the Water Services Monitoring System to include work flow monitoring of licensing and tariff
         review process, leading to timely execution and increased transparency (and less rent seeking behavior)
     Mobilize resources for better water quality testing and act on non-compliance of water providers;
     Implement competitive tendering for new license applications and potentially look at clustering of sites to
         increase economies of scale and viability;
     Leverage available grants (e.g. GPOBA, DFAT 3i) for new investment sites to pilot commercial viability gap
         financing under competitive licensing; develop harmonized policy and procedures for the use of such
         grants
     Implement pro-poor connection policies (pro-poor tariffs, capped connection fees) and set-up a “Water
         for All? connection facility, as incentives to private operators to connect poor households
     Continue dialogue with CWA and foster linkages with well performing public utilities to support BDS
         provision;



62
   In Cambodia poor households are identified through a poor-identification system, which is based on a combination of asset
screening and community assessments. The poor (also called ID-poor 1 and ID-poor 2) are given identification cards and
herewith can access a number of services for free / at reduced cost.
63
   Wider sector recommendations for MIH, have recently been laid out in the Service Delivery Assessment for Water Supply and
Sanitation (see WSP (2015)). The above recommendations relate specifically to this TA on private sector involvement


                                                                                                                         76
Medium to Long-term:
    Develop joint accreditation scheme with CWA for consultants to help operators prepare license
       applications and tariff submissions.
    Gradually transition from a full equity approach to introducing public funding (from various sources,
       including grants, concessional finance, domestic resources) into private water sector provision to reach
       less-viable and poorer rural areas;
    Develop a longer-term master plan for investment sites for private sector, through a market
       identification, screening and prioritization process; and work pro-actively with development partners to
       allocate funding
    Develop a facility/financing structure to attract pooled financing from various sources/development
       partners to allocate public finance to new rural potable water schemes
    Develop a guarantee-scheme for several local banks, or work with development partners to do so, in
       order to expand Access-to-Finance on more suitable terms (longer tenure, grace period, collateral)
    Develop clear coordination and implementation mechanisms with the Ministry of Rural Development for
       piped water schemes that may receive finance through MRD
    Improve legal and institutional environment through Water Law and prepare comprehensive legal
       framework for PPPs in water sector, articulating role of decentralized government


Recommendations to Cambodia Water Association
Short to Medium term
        Carry out a mid-term review in 2016 to refocus role, key-functions, priorities of the associations, and
         review its current business model, including a strategy to reduce dependencies on large financiers
        Continue to market and deliver break-even BDS-services, including software licensing and support
         services (ERMS), and potentially group trainings; differentiate and unbundle BDS package to attract more
         operators
        Develop a network of external consultants for specialized services (taxation, legal services, and technical
         assessments) and market those on a cost recovery basis.
        Continue to monitor member performance, gather and provide market information to stakeholders and
         business partners, and represent members’ interest in regular dialogue with MIH
        Continue diversified partnerships with development partners in line with strategic plan.

Medium to Long-term
    Develop a phase-out strategy for subsidies through further differentiation of services and operator;
       strategically allocate reduced subsidies to less advanced operators for services that are undervalued
    Develop new accredited services for members in collaboration with MIH through accreditation of
       consultants that can support, e.g. license application development and tariff submission preparation
    Develop long-term relationships with local vocational training centers, local universities and MIH, to
       develop a skill-based training program for different job-positions within water utilities, as well as for utility
       management positions

Opportunities for further World Bank Group engagement
Opportunities to support the government in the implementation of the above recommendations exist now that
the World Bank Group’s Country Engagement Note is being prepared. While detailed scoping will be required, the
following ideas offer a way forward for increased World Bank Group engagement:
        Collaborate with the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and other interested
         development partners to intensify upstream support and capacity building for MIH in the following areas
         v) Master planning for potential new licensing sites, based on a mapping, screening and prioritization
              process; and support to developing clear procedures for allocation of grants financing
         vi) Advisory services on tender preparation and project structuring, including investment studies for new
              sites (possibly combining multiple sites)
         vii) Capacity building to MIH-DPWS in executing licensing and application of tariff methodology, and
              enforcement of water quality standards



                                                                                                                      77
            viii) Capacity building for consolidation and use of WSMS system, including expansion to allow for license
                  management and support to sector analytics/benchmarking
           Collaborate with the Global Partnership for Output-based Aid (GPOBA) and other development partners
            to leverage grant financing for:
            iii)      Commercial Viability Gap financing to support competitive tendering of new licenses and help to
                      establish procedures and structure for future scale-up
                                                                                                     64
            iv)       Output-based aid financing to connect poor households under existing schemes .
           Collaborate with other development partners (such as AFD, IFC) to explore replication of Access to
            Finance through other local banks and seek opportunities to bring in IFC PPP transaction advisory services
           Strategic technical assistance to CWA, especially in areas of:
            iv)       Institutional and organizational capacity development; review strategic operational plan and
                      business model
            v)        Help define phase-out strategy and further differentiate the approach for BDS so as to better
                      target remaining subsidies to least advanced operators
            vi)       Support accreditation of local consultants – together with MIH – for BDS to comply with license
                      and tariff regulation

Longer-term engagement under the Country Partnership Framework is expected to build on the next two-year
experience and lessons. Based on an assumed successful demonstration on how to best allocate more public
funding into the private water sector, a potential IDA engagement may be foreseen.




64
     Use this for demonstration purposes so as to influence other development partner initiatives or future government lending.

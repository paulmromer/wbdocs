     Introduction

Iraq was plunged into two simultaneous crises in the second half of 2014, one driven by a sharp decline
in oil prices, the other, by Islamic State militants. Since June 2014, crude oil prices per barrel have fallen
from around 112 USD to 97 USD in September and 62 USD by December (Figure 1). Given Iraq’s heavy
dependence on oil as a share of GDP and exports, and a source of government revenues, this decline in
prices alone would have hit Iraq’s fragile economy hard.

In addition, since June 2014, Islamic State (IS) or Da’ash militants extended their influence from Syria
into Iraq’s northern and western provinces of Anbar, Nineveh, Salahadin, and to a lesser extent, Kirkuk
and Diyala. A total of 354,000 families were internally displaced between June and December of 2014
which represents about 2.1 million individuals2; and those left behind have been cut off from the rest of
the country. The internally displaced persons (IDPs) have sought refuge across Iraq and about half of
those who have crossed governorates boundaries were settled in Iraqi Kurdistan3.

Civilian casualties in Iraq have increased to close to 2007 levels (Iraq Body Count) as a result of the
ongoing violence (Figure 2). The prevailing insecurity has disrupted oil exports from the north,

  Kurdistan region comprises of the three governorates of Erbil, Sulaimaniya and Duhouk. Based on official
governorate boundaries, approximately 800,000 IDPs have moved to KR-I. If districts under de facto KR-I
administration are included (in particular the IDP camps in Nineveh administered by the Duhouk governorate),
the number increases to 1 million. This influx represents a significant addition to Kurdistan’s 5 million people.

of goods and services across the country, leading to a sharp contraction in oil and non-oil GDP (World
Bank, Iraq Macro-Poverty Outlook (Internal Use Only), Spring 2015). Moreover, the sharp physical
fragmentation of the country has impeded normal mechanisms of adjustment and likely magnified
impacts.

The twin crises are likely to have impacted households across Iraq through different transmission
channels. Even for households directly affected by the Islamic State militancy, the welfare of those
displaced, their hosting communities, and those left behind will all be affected differently.

On one hand, the consumption of IDPs could have been reduced by a decrease in the quality or flow of
services received from housing as well as the loss of immobile durable goods and assets. Additionally,
among the displaced, those previously employed in the private sector will have almost certainly lost
their jobs and livelihoods. In contrast, IDPs who held public sector jobs have in general continued to
receive their salaries and pensions.

For families left behind and still living in the IS- affected governorates of Anbar, Nineveh, and
Salahadin, it is likely that their access to services, PDS and other public transfers has been cut off, and
that distorted markets have led to a local increase in prices. Moreover, their labor income might have
also been reduced because of the economic disruptions, the security situation, and because of ‘taxation’
by Islamic State.4 All of these households including the IDPs could also have suffered from a reduction
in their private transfers (through domestic and international remittances) as a consequence of losing
connection and communication with relatives and their larger social network.

 Anecdotal evidence of taxation of salaries has been widely cited:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4
On the other hand, among communities hosting significant IDP populations, it may be reasonable to
assume greater competition for resources, within the labor market, and for goods, services and
housing. These in turn may adversely affect the welfare of the hosting population.

While the IS crisis has impacted some regions more than others, the sharp decline in oil prices is
expected to influence the whole economy: across economic sectors and regions. Oil is the main source
of economic and fiscal resources in Iraq and it represents more than two-fifth of total GDP.5 Even
though it directly accounts for only 1 percent of employment, oil revenues had enabled a significant
expansion in public sector jobs between 2007 and 2012.6 The reduction in oil prices directly affects oil
revenues and jeopardizes the sustainability of public jobs and public transfers across the country. As oil
prices remain at low levels and economic growth slows down, household welfare would be impacted
through different channels –the labor market through increases in unemployment, reduction in
earnings or a combination of both; and through non-labor income components such as the decrease in
public transfers such as pensions, rations received from the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Social
Safety Net transfers.

Given the severity of these crises, and the recurrent nature of such crises in Iraq (and increasingly in the
Middle East and North Africa region), quantifying and understanding their welfare impact is critical for
government and development partners. This paper employs an innovative extension of the micro-
simulation methodology to provide an ex-ante estimate and analysis of the complex and dynamic
poverty and distributional impact of the twin crises. In doing so, it examines how the population has
been affected across the (income or consumption) distribution, assesses spatially differentiated
impacts, estimates the effect of the crises through macro level shocks (operating through the macro
economy) and the micro level shocks (primarily large scale internal displacement), predicts the poverty
impact on the existing poor and those who have fallen into poverty (including internally displaced
peoples (IDPs), and compares the characteristics of these groups. The findings of this paper represent
ex-ante estimates based on available data and assumptions made after discussions and agreements
with counterparts from the Government of Iraq and Kurdistan region, and as such do not constitute
official estimates and may be updated when more recent and relevant data becomes available.

The paper is structured as follows: first, it presents the methodological approach which differs from
traditional ones –i.e. elasticity of poverty to output or GDP – and also from microsimulation methods
used in the past. Section 2 describes the macroeconomic inputs and assumptions behind each
simulated scenario. Section 3 discusses the welfare and distributional impacts of the twin crisis in Iraq.
Section 4 concludes the study summarizing key findings and discussing a few implications of the results
for the country.

      I.    Methodological approach

The main challenge in fulfilling the objectives stated above is to find a way of translating these
economic and demographic shocks into the consumption distribution. The traditional solution is to
extrapolate poverty measures by estimating an “elasticity” of poverty to output or GDP. The elasticity
approach uses historical trends of output and poverty to determine the responsiveness of poverty rates
to growth in output (and consumption), which is then combined with macroeconomic projections to
estimate the impact of future growth on poverty. Although this method is easy to implement, it is
limited in its predictive capability since it yields only aggregate poverty impacts, with no indication of
the broader distributional effects. It may also prove deficient in predicting poverty impacts during a
macroeconomic event that affects output growth in a way that is not entirely consistent with the recent
growth experience in Iraq. In addition, measured poverty has in recent times been very inelastic with
respect to increases in GDP growth (as measured), so that elasticity approaches would imply little
poverty impact of such a massive economic shock.7

The estimates and analysis presented in this paper uses a microsimulation model to evaluate the
welfare and distributional impacts of the IDPs and macro (Oil price and non-IDP IS-related) crisis in Iraq
during 2014. The micro-simulation model superimposes macroeconomic projections on behavioral
models built on last available household survey (Iraq Household and Socio- Economic Survey, or IHSES
2012). The model is loosely based on previous approaches to micro-simulation described in
Bourguignon, Bussolo and Pereira da Silva (2008) and Ferreira, et al. (2008) – with an important
simplification of omitting the computable general equilibrium (CGE) component, which is difficult to
employ in most developing countries. Instead the approach described here links the behavioral model
to sectoral and aggregate macroeconomic data for Iraq, and extrapolates the microeconomic snapshot
of a future scenario from this projection.8 This approach has been extended to explicitly take into
account large scale population movements, which in the case of Iraq, is the internal forced
displacement of people from the IS-affected provinces (or governorates).

This microsimulation model accounts for multiple transmission mechanisms and captures impacts at
the micro level across the income and consumption distribution. In particular, the model can take into
account large changes in population over time and space; labor market adjustments in employment
and earnings or a combination of both; non-labor incomes including public and private transfers; and
price changes (including variations in food and non-food prices). These changes can be positive or
negative depending on the trends outlined by the macroeconomic inputs.

In the following subsections, we present a brief discussion about the micro-simulation model and each
step in which this method is based on -i.e. baseline, simulation and assessment- and we end the section
with a discussion about limitations and assumptions of this methodological approach.

 This approach was conceptualized, refined and tested in a diverse mix of countries not only during the
financial crisis (such as Bangladesh, The Philippines, Mexico, Poland, and Mongolia) but also after the crisis
(such as Costa Rica, Panama, Uruguay, Serbia, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Poland, Romania,
and Ukraine).

The microsimulation model setup9

The microsimulation is divided into three steps: the baseline, simulation and assessment and it is
illustrated in Figure 3. It is based on Olivieri S, et al. (2014) with a major difference of accounting for
internal migration or population displacement.

The first step is the process by which individual and household level information is used to estimate
behavioral models of employment status (whether an individual is employed or not, and the sector of
employment) and earnings for individuals, as a function of their individual and household
characteristics. The model behind the micro-simulation is the household income generation model
developed by Bourguignon and Ferreira (2005). This model allows accounting for multiple transmission
channels and working at the individual/household level. The first step uses the household data for the
latest available baseline year.

The second step consists of replicating macroeconomic simulated changes (i.e., sector of employment,
total output or public and private transfers) between the baseline of 2012 and each projected scenario
for 2014 of changes in different components of the household income generation model (i.e., labor and
non-labor income). This process is divided into three sub-steps ordered in the following sequence:
population growth, labor market status and income, and non-labor income.

                                                                                                         7
In the simulation process we impose several population constraints which result from different growth
rates by gender age group and governorate brackets. The internally displaced population movement is
taken into account after the adjustment in weights has made. The input for this step is an out-in flow
matrix from the International Organization of Migration (IOM) which estimates the total number of
families who had crossed governorate borders between June and December 2014. The lack of
information about the characteristics of this population implied the following procedure: first randomly
selecting families from governorates of origin like Anbar, Nineveh or Salahadin, and then allocating
them to host governorates for instance, Dohuk, Erbil or Baghdad. It is relevant to note in this case that
families and households are considered equivalent and all members of households classified as IDP are
moved.

The rest of this simulation process follows Olivieri, S, et al. (2014).10 Briefly, it uses predictions of
behavioral models estimated on the baseline household data (as in step 1 above), and generates
household and individual-level predictions for employment, earnings and public and private transfers
for 2014. Since an individual’s labor income depends on his/her employment status and labor earnings,
how the output change in a particular sector is apportioned between employment change, earnings
change and adjustments across sectors depends on how responsive (elastic) employment in that sector
is to output change. It also implies that at the household level, the extent of the impact depends on the
size of the aggregate change at the sector level and the demographics and characteristics of household
members, which influence the labor force status and earnings of household members after the change.

To simulate changes in non-labor income, projections of changes in public transfers are assumed to
grow at different rates accordingly to the simulated scenario, while private transfers are assumed to
grow at the rate of aggregate GDP for the relevant period.

The final step is the process by which the information on individual employment status and labor
income, as well as on non-labor income at the household level, is used to generate income or
consumption distributions and calculate various poverty and distributional measures that can then be
used to compare different scenarios. There are two additional steps needed to obtain the final
simulated distribution: the first step consists in using price projections to adjust the poverty line to
reflect the difference in food and non-food inflation rates between baseline and projected year. Since
the poverty line is typically anchored to a food basket that ensures a minimum calorie intake, in case
where food inflation is expected to be significantly different from general inflation between baseline
and projected year, the baseline poverty line would not be enough for a household to meet the basic
food requirements in the projected year.

In the case of Iraq poverty is defined in terms of consumption so the last step consists in transforming
household incomes into predicted consumption levels by using the consumption income ratio for each
household from the baseline year.

Limitations and assumptions

There are several limitations and assumptions to apply this method which are important to mention.
Firstly, the quality of model projections depends on the nature and accuracy of the data underpinning
the exercise. The results would depend not only on the validity of the micro-models but also on the
macro projections. In addition, the use of the last available household data (IHSES 2012) as a
comparator is tricky because the comparison could potentially attribute certain outcomes to that
particular projection when they are a result of other factors that occurred over the period. The
assumptions employed here do not take into account two factors that could potentially affect the
estimates: (i) The cost of food and other basic essentials in the IS- affected governorates of Anbar,
Nineveh and Salahadin have increased sharply according to anecdotal evidence;11 and (ii) Kurdistan
region has been facing intermittent delays and non-payment of salaries of government officials.

Secondly, the simulation relies on behavioral models built on past data that reflect the pre-existing
structure of the labor market, household incomes and their relationships with demographics as they
stood before the expected change. Consequently, the simulation assumes these structural relationships
remain constant over the period for which projections are made. The more distant in the past the
baseline year is, the more questionable this assumption is likely to be.

The model is limited in its ability to account for shifts in relative prices between different sectors of the
economy as a result of the shock. While the poverty impact of shifts in the price of food relative to other
prices is taken into account, other potential sources of price impacts are ignored – for example, the
general equilibrium effect of a change in the terms of trade between agriculture and other sectors. In
the absence of a CGE model, it is nearly impossible to explicitly model for changes in terms of trade
between sectors.

The model works in the income space to account for different transmission channels through which
households are affected. But to provide poverty projections for Iraq household incomes must be
converted into consumption, using the assumption that the household’s ratio between consumption
and income is constant over time. This questionable assumption has at least the advantage of being
simple and transparent. It is important to note that this assumption is partially relaxed for the case of
IDP families as well as those living in governorates affected by the IS.

The model does not allow for geographic mobility of factors (labor or capital) across time. Thus, all
individuals are assumed to remain in their 2012 place of origin, even as they experience a change in
labor force status or sector of employment. While this assumption is an abstraction from truth, it is
likely to matter only when the results are disaggregated spatially or across rural and urban areas. This
assumption is relaxed in the case of families who were forced to migrate to a different governorate as a
consequence of the Islamic State militancy.

Finally, there is the concern related to validation of the hypothesis, which applies to all ex-ante
approaches including this. The only validation or test for this model is to combine ex-ante and ex-post

        II.    Scenarios and Macroeconomic inputs

The impact of the twin crises on poverty indices as well as any other distributional measure such as
average consumption or income will be estimated in a “with-without” comparison framework. That is,
the difference between “with-shock” and “without-shock” scenarios for the same projected year. In the
Iraq case, this will correspond to the year 2014. The without-shock scenario is called business as usual
(BaU). This is the scenario in which both population and economy behave as in their usual trend. In
other words, economic agents will behave accordingly to what has happened in the past, which in this
case is the trend between 2012 and 2013. On the other hand, the “with-shock” scenario is when both
events: internal displacement and collapse of oil prices and the IS-related macro shocks, hit the
economy during the second half of 2014. Thus, the impact is defined as the gap between these two
scenarios for 2014.

The macroeconomic variables used as inputs into the micro-simulation are intended to capture most of
the transmission channels discussed above. These variables are: i) changes in aggregate GDP and by
economic sector; ii) changes in labor force participation rates and total and sectoral employment levels,
iii) changes in public and private transfers; iv) population growth; and v) changes in price of food
relative to non-food. All these macroeconomic inputs are generated in 2014 for both scenarios:
business as usual (BaU) and crisis. Additionally, we include in the crisis scenario a series of assumptions
for IDP and IS-affected areas related to assets, services from dwelling as well as employment and labor
and non-labor income.

Changes in aggregate and economic sectors GDP 12

The aggregate macro-economic and sector-specific growth rates for Iraq are shown in Table 1. The BaU
estimates assume the same pattern and trend of sectoral and overall growth in the 2013 to 2014 period
as was measured in the 2012 to 2013 period. The estimates for the 2014 crisis year are from the official
estimates produced by the Iraqi Central Statistics Organization. The latter estimates imply a negative 6
percent growth rate of GDP for Iraq for 2014, which incorporates the macroeconomic shocks related to
both the IS-militancy and the oil price decline. Relative to a BaU scenario, where GDP would have
grown at a positive rate of 9 percent, the magnitude of the macro shocks on GDP imply a 15 percentage
point reduction in total economic activity.

The biggest sectoral contraction is in manufacturing and construction, primarily due to a fall in the
construction which employs almost 14% of all Iraqis workers and where most of the poor are employed.
In 2014, under the crisis scenario, this combined sector would have experienced a reduction in growth

The spillover effect from the decline in manufacturing and construction is likely to have an impact on
other sectors as well, especially services which employs more than 65% of all Iraqi workers. Output
growth in the services sector is projected to decline due to the crises by around 22 percentage points,
from an increase of 11% in BaU to a 11% reduction.

Smaller impacts are expected in the other two sectors -mining and quarrying and agriculture- as well
due to the spillover effect from other sectors and reduced oil prices. While mining and quarrying output
is expected to reduce by more than 2 percentage points in 2014 due to crisis, the agricultural sector
would be affected by a contraction of almost 1.5 percentage points in its growth rate. It is important to
note that these sectors are expected to register a minor positive growth. The “loss” in growth is in
comparison to the scenario of business as usual rather than indicating an absolute fall in output.

Changes in public and private transfers

Non-labor income components are grouped into two categories: public and private transfers. The first
component includes transfers received by households from ration (i.e. Public Distribution System),
pensions, social protection and other public transfers in cash and in kind. These are expected to
increase at almost 14% in business as usual scenario (Table 1). This growth rate is identical as the real
growth rate of the total amount of Pensions and PDS during 2013. In the crisis scenario, it is assumed
there is zero growth for these types of transfers, reflected in a significant decline relative to the BaU
scenario.

Private transfers include all other non-labor income components such as domestic and international
remittances, capital and other private transfers in kind and cash. It is assumed that the growth rate of
these components of the total household income will be the same as the annual growth rate as the

total economy. Table 1 shows that these will grow at almost 9 percent in BaU and they will decrease at
6.4 percent in crisis scenario.

Translating changes in GDP into changes in employment

In order to assess how households adjust and adapt to macroeconomic changes in the labor market, the
output growth estimates have to be translated into employment changes at the aggregate and sectoral
level. In absence of a CGE or macroeconomic model which predict these labor market structures, we
assume that changes in labor market conditions are proportional to changes in outputs, based on the
estimated past relationship between output and employment. In other words, this requires estimating
sectoral and total output-employment elasticities, which can then be applied to the output growth
projections to generate changes in employment by sector and aggregate for both scenarios in 2014.

This implicitly assumes stable relationships between output, demand for labor, and labor earnings,
which may not hold due to existing distortions in the labor market (such as segmentation and
downward stickiness of nominal wages) and are likely to affect adjustments over time.

We estimate one set of elasticities for 2014 using information on sectoral GDP and employment
changes between 2007 and 2012 (Table 2). Over the last 5 years, these parameters show a weak or
inelastic response of employment to changes in output. For instance, manufacturing and construction
grew at a high annual growth rate of 13 percent between 2007 and 2012, however, employment grew
by only 4 percent annually. In the case of services, which employ more than 65% of total Iraqi workers,
employment has been increasing annually at 2.4% in 2007-12; less than half of the rate of growth of
output in the services sector in the same period.

Population growth

The simulation takes into account population growth and is particularly relevant in the Iraq case. The
total population is projected to grow by 2.6% annually between 2012 and 2014, with the size of the
working age population (from 15 -64 years old) growing by around 3.1% annually. We use official

                                                                                                             12
population projections by gender age groups and governorates provided by CSO. This adjustment is
necessary to fully account for demographic changes that would affect the size and composition of the
labor force and ultimately impact our estimates of the welfare measure (i.e. consumption or income per
capita).

Changes in prices: inflation

All household and individual incomes from labor and non-labor sources are expressed in real terms of
the baseline year (constant in 2012 prices). Macroeconomic changes replicated on the micro data are
also in real terms. This implies that in order to obtain projected poverty measures for 2014, the
simulated household consumption will need to be compared against the poverty line of 2012.

In principle, there would be no need to adjust for prices given that all micro and macro components of
the simulation are expressed in real terms. However, if food prices were to rise at a significantly
different rate from the non-food prices, the food basket to which the poverty line is anchored would
become unattainable at an income equal to the poverty line.13 Table 3 shows food CPI in Iraq is
expected to increase at a higher rate than non-food and general CPI between business as usual and
crisis scenario. Thus, it is relevant to assess the sensitivity of simulation results once the impact of
higher relative food prices on poverty line is taken into account.

To do this we correct for differential inflation of food and non-food items, by deflating the 2012 poverty
line by the projected food and non-food CPI, using the food and non-food shares of the poverty line as
weights. This method yields new poverty lines, which are then normalized to 2012 prices using the
appropriate general CPI. For instance, the poverty line for 2012 after this adjustment is less than 1%
higher than the poverty line in 2012 (Table 4). In the Iraq case these adjustments are almost negligible
but these are implemented for consistency. Note that CPI in crisis scenario is actual data, ie, official
estimates from the CSO.




13
  To see how this can happen, note that the weight of food in the CPI is different from that in the poverty line.
This implies that adjusting the poverty line by CPI would result in the same food basket (or calorie level) not
being affordable if food price inflation were higher than that of general inflation, and conversely if food
inflation were lower.

The adjusted poverty line for each scenario reflects the income levels required for an individual to be
able to afford the same food basket despite the disproportionate rise in food prices. The simulated
household consumption for the projected year are then compared to the new poverty line to compute
poverty measures that take into account the impact of higher relative price of food.

IDP and IS-affected populations

As mentioned previously, the twin crises are likely to have impacted households across Iraq through
different transmission channels. For instance, households directly affected by the Islamic State
militancy – which include the displaced, and those still living in the IS-affected governorates – will be
affected differently, as will households belonging to communities hosting IDPs. In order to include the
effect of these shocks in the simulation, additional assumptions are needed in the crisis scenario for
2014.

We first identify two types of populations of interest: a) Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and b) Left-
behind. The first group is based on information from the IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (IOM DTM)
of families crossing governorate boundaries by origin and source governorate. This is summarized in
(Table 5). In the microsimulation exercise, we focus on internal displacement from 3 governorates,
which accounts for 90 percent of the total cross-governorate displacement. Based on the population
flows measured in the IOM DTM, a subset of families is randomly selected from three governorates of
origin (IS-affected governorates) - Anbar, Nineveh, and Kirkuk - and allocated in different host
governorates in proportion to the movements measured in the IOM DTM. The second group consists of
those who continue to live in the three governorates directly affected by IS – Anbar, Nineveh, and
Kirkuk.

First, we describe the assumptions made about the income and consumption flows of the IDPs. The
consumption of IDPs could have been reduced by a decrease in the quality or flow of services received
from housing as well as the loss of immobile durable goods and assets. After discussions and
agreement with counterparts from the Government of Iraq, we assume a 50% decrease in services
received from the new shelter/dwelling and we eliminate all consumption from non-mobile assets like
fridge, cooler, electric generator, etc. Both adjustments are household specific.

From the income viewpoint, additional assumptions are made. First, those previously employed in the
private sector are assumed unemployed and consequently without any labor income. In contrast, IDPs
who held public sector jobs have in general continued to receive their salaries and benefits. Secondly,
private transfers are eliminated based on disruption of connection and communications between IDP
and relatives as well as larger social networks. On the other hand, public transfers are untouched based
on the assumption that IDP families can pick up their rations in new locations as well as still receive their
pensions. Given that most IDP are now living in rented dwellings or camps, the flow of services from
owned dwellings service is eliminated from the total household income for those who were owners in
their governorate of origin.

For families left behind and still living in the IS- affected governorates of Anbar, Nineveh, and
Salahadin, additional assumptions were made. In the income space, it is assumed that employment

                                                                                                                           15
rates remain the same but earnings are reduced by 60 percent as consequence of “taxation” by Islamic
State and a contraction in economic activity. Private and public transfers from PDS and social
protection are eliminated based on lack of connection and communication with the rest of Iraq.
However, left behind families are assumed to keep their pensions as well as their services received from
dwellings when owners.

In the consumption space, it is reasonable to assume that there is negligible consumption on PDS food
items as supplies have been cut off or are erratically available. The response in consumption of these
items is very inelastic to changes in prices and people might consume them even in distorted markets
(Krishnan, et al (2014)). However, these items are normal goods, which implies that consumption
positively reacts to income changes. Given the combined effect of the likely increase in local prices as
consequence of distorted markets and the reduction in total household income; the assumption of
cutting off the consumption of food rations appears reasonable.

It is relevant to add that some of these adjustments are individual specific and others are household
specific. While on the flow of services from durable goods and assets as well as public and private
transfer adjustments act at the household level, labor status and labor income adjustments work at the
individual level. All these adjustments are implemented in the simulation sequence after total
population growth has been factored in. The implication of this sequencing is that all labor and non-
labor adjustments will take into account the implications of population displacement. For instance, the
labor market in the Kurdistan region of Iraq will be affected by the addition of the IDP population.
Finally, sensitivity analysis has been implemented with some of these assumptions and results were not
affected significantly by them.


        III.    Results

This section presents the results of the first stage or prospective study of the economy based on the
micro-simulation methodology described in Section 1. It is divided into three subsections: the first one
shows aggregate results on employment, income, poverty and inequality impacts of the twin crises for
total country and its component regions. The second part focuses on the distribution of such impacts
across welfare groups. The third part presents results for the internal displaced population.

For this analysis, the 18 governorates of Iraq have been grouped into 6 regions. These are the following:
Kurdistan (i.e. Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaimaniya); Baghdad; IS-affected (i.e. Nineveh, Anbar and
Salahadin); Rest of North (i.e Diyala and Kirkuk); Centre (i.e. Babylon, Wasit, Najaf and Karbala); and
South (i.e. Basrah, Thi Qar, Qadisiya, Muthanna and Missan).14

Labor market outputs and welfare levels

Table 6 presents information on projected changes in employment status: employed and non-
employed. The latter is a combination of being inactive or being unemployed. The size of the labor
force is predicted to grow as consequence of population growth in both scenarios. The additional 1.2
million potential workers would increase pressure into a non-dynamic labor market, particularly, in the
crisis scenario where the economy would have diverged significantly from its natural path. This would
represent an extra 800,000 non-employed Iraqi workers relative to BaU levels.

Employment shares by main economic sectors change between the two scenarios. There is a shift from
the manufacturing and construction sector to agriculture and services sectors. This would represent a
change from more productive/higher earnings jobs to less productive/lower earnings. However, these
changes most likely cover fluctuations in the composition of sectoral employment not captured by the
model such as changes in shares of formal and informal employment within a sector. 15

The household income projections from the micro-simulation exercise are presented in Table 7. On
average, labor income per capita represents more than 65% of total income per capita in the baseline
2012. Total household income per capita decreases almost 14% in crisis relative to business as usual as a
consequence of a reduction in labor income of 20%, a much smaller fall in non-labor income and
services from dwelling, almost 5 and 2 percentage points respectively. The reduction in non-labor
income between scenarios would be the result from a reduction in both types of transfers: public and
private (3 and 5 percentage respectively) for the country as a whole (Figure 4).16


15
   This is one of the limitations of this approach and it is based on the difficulty to obtain macroeconomic
projections for formal and informal employment changes by economic sector. We are considering an extension
to the model in future work given the importance of the issue from a distributional angle.
16
   Public transfers include: PDS, pensions, social protection network compensation and other public transfers in
cash and in kind. Private transfers include domestic and international remittances, capital and other private
transfers in cash and in kind. The latter are assumed to move at the same growth rate as the total economy.

Similar patterns are observed across regions. However, the magnitude of these impacts are higher in
IS-affected and Kurdistan regions than in other regions. For instance, total income would have cut
almost by half in IS-affected areas and by 17% in Kurdistan both as a result of labor and non-labor
income (Table 7). In the case of other regions (i.e. Baghdad, Rest of North, Centre and South) would
have suffered a much less reduction in both labor and non-labor incomes (Figure 4).

The increase in unemployment rates combined with the reduction in labor as well as non-labor income
are reflected in lower levels of per capita consumption. The simulation results show a 10% reduction in
average consumption per capita for Iraq as a whole. This is 4 percentage points lower than the decrease
estimated in total income (–14%) which seems reasonable given that households might smooth
consumption during difficult events and over time.

These results are not homogeneous across regions. Consumption per capita in IS-affected areas would
have been reduced by 20% which is double the average national level impact. This region was followed
by Kurdistan with a 14% decline, South (-11%), Centre (-9%), Rest of North (-9%) and Baghdad (-8%)
(Table 7).

Poverty and inequality

Table 8 shows projected poverty measures for 2014 in both scenarios –i.e. business as usual and crisis-
for the whole country and the regions. Poverty headcount rates are expected to increase by 7.5
percentage points between business as usual and crisis scenario. This represents roughly an additional 3
million individuals who are estimated to fall into poverty as consequence of the twin crises. The
magnitude of the impact is likely to have pushed Iraq back to poverty levels similar to those of 2007.

These twin crises have not only affected the welfare levels of the population in general but also of those
who would have been poor in the business as usual scenario. This is measured by an increase of almost
3 percentage points in the poverty gap as well as the 1.3 percentage point growth in severity for the
country as a whole (Table 8).

Even though the negative impacts of these crises have affected all regions, the intensity was not the
same across the country. While Kurdistan and IS-affected regions are estimated to have quadrupled
and doubled their poverty incidence levels respectively, the Centre would have increased its poverty

incidence by almost 6 percentage points followed by Rest of the North, South and Baghdad. The
welfare levels of the poor have also deteriorated across all regions and similar patterns are observed for
the gap and severity indices with the most severe effects in the IS-affected and Kurdistan regions.
Interestingly, the poverty gap and severity would have increased more in the South than in Centre, Rest
of North and Baghdad, likely reflecting the larger share of population living close to the poverty line
there prior to 2014 (World Bank 2015). The adverse welfare impacts in Kurdistan and the IS-affected
governorates are likely underestimates because they do not take into the likely increase in the prices of
basic needs in the IS-affected governorates or the lack of payment of public sector salaries in Kurdistan
during some months of 2014.

Aggregate inequality is expected to remain stable relative to the business as usual scenario for the
whole population – with the Gini and Theil index increasing slightly almost 1 point between scenarios
(Table 9). However, the average nation-wide impact hides differences across space. Three regions -i.e.
Kurdistan, Baghdad and IS-affected- would have suffered an increase in their inequality levels as a
consequence of the crises. Most of these movements are projected to be partially compensated by
other regions producing a relatively stable inequality for the country.

Distributional effects

One of the advantages of using the microsimulation approach is the possibility of fully taking into
account the heterogeneity of individuals observed in the household survey. This allows us to identify
with some precision who are likely to be the winners or losers of the shocks modeled. Indeed, as the
results show, there were no winners in Iraq. Particularly for Iraq, it allows us to examine the type of
households that are likely to suffer from the twin crises, the primary channels of impact and their
relative importance, and the distribution of the benefits or losses across different income groups.



                                                                                                         20
We first examine the characteristics of the group we will call “new poor”, which refers to households
who would have become poor in 2014 as consequence of the crises, and compare them with respect to
the “always poor”, i.e., those who would remain poor in business as usual and crises scenario, and the
non-poor or those who would not be poor in either scenario. Second, we use Impact Incidence Curves
(IIC) to see how changes in consumption are distributed across consumption groups and regions. Third,
we construct transition matrices to examine movements of households along the income distribution
between scenarios –i.e. business as usual and crises.

A profile of the “new poor”

Of Iraq’s estimated 8 million poor in the 2014 crisis scenario, 36% or 2.8 million are “new poor”. These
are households who would not be poor in the BaU scenario, but suffered a welfare loss large enough to
fall below the poverty line in the 2014 crisis scenario.

The impact on the “new poor” is 4 times deeper than that observed in the rest of the population in
terms of both consumption and income per capita losses. Households identified as “new poor” are
estimated to have suffered a more than 40% decrease in consumption per capita and almost 51% drop
in per capita income as consequence of the crises. Higher changes in per capita income than in per
capita consumption seem reasonable given that households might smooth consumption over time.
These results are shown across regions with much higher impacts in those households living in
governorates affected by IS and the Kurdistan region.

Almost all losses in per capita income of the “new poor” come from labor income. These households
experience a roughly 60% fall in their per capita labor income (which represents 65% of total per capita
income). However, per capita non-labor income also declines by 35% between business as usual and
crises scenarios. These effects are more severe in the Kurdistan and IS-affected regions. While in KR-I,
labor and rent contribute most to reduction in total income, in IS-affected governorates it is labor and
non-labor incomes (as a consequence of reduction of private and public transfers) that drive the overall
decrease in total incomes.

A few characteristics of the newly poor households appear to distinguish them from the always poor as
well as the non-poor. The new poor are more likely to be in smaller households and with lower
dependency rates than those always poor households. In terms of other characteristics as well, this
group falls “in-between” the other two groups. New poor households heads are more likely to be low-
skilled and below the age 46 than heads of non-poor households. On the other hand, they have “better”
characteristics on average than the always poor – such as higher skills, along with smaller household
size and lower dependency ratios, characteristics that would likely pull them out of poverty gradually
when the economy recovers. These patterns are similar across regions.

Distribution of income losses

Next we examine how per capita household consumption losses are distributed across households. For
this purpose we use the Impact Incidence Curves (IIC),which first order households according to their


                                                                                                      21
per capita consumption levels (from lowest to highest), group them into consumption percentiles for
the business as usual and crises scenarios; and plot the annual growth rate of per capita household
consumption by percentile between scenarios. We perform this exercise for all households, as well as
for specific groups. Each IIC allows us to compare percentage consumption gains or losses across
households within the group. Comparisons across groups (e.g. households in KR-I and South regions)
are not straight forward. For instance, given that on average consumption levels are higher in KR-I than
in the South, a household in the 40th percentile of the KR-I consumption distribution is quite likely to
significantly be better off than the 40th percentile household in the consumption distribution of the
South.

The projected economic decline between business as usual and crises scenarios is expected to translate
into lower consumption across the entire distribution and in all regions. This is shown by Figure 5 where
Impact Incidence Curves are all below zero. In other words, across the distribution, and in each region,
households are estimated to have experienced a negative welfare impact – there were no winners, as
the entire distribution suffered welfare losses. However, the reduction would not has been
proportionally distributed across deciles and this affects inequality as mentioned before. Per capita
household consumption losses are largest among those households at the bottom of the distribution
(10th to 40th percentile), with an average loss of almost 16% between business as usual and crises.
Households at the very bottom -1st to 10th percentiles- have been less fortunate than the rest by
suffering a 21.5% reduction in welfare.

Consumption losses are estimated to be higher in IS-affected governorates and KR-I than other regions
across the entire distribution. For instance, the average impact on a household living in an IS-affected
governorate would have been more than double that of the total country (-27 % vs. -13%) and in KR-I
this would have been 5 percentage points higher -i.e. -18%.

Incidence of losses and income mobility

The IICs provide information about consumption gains or losses incurred by the average household
within each percentile of the consumption distribution, and are thus useful in identifying which
consumption groups experience relatively larger or smaller changes. However, they can hide a
significant amount of heterogeneity in the absolute size of impacts, even among households with very
similar baseline or initial per capita household consumption levels.

An alternative is to examine the size of the income change experienced by the households in each
consumption group. We do this using matrices constructed by deciles of per capita consumption,
keeping the upper and lower limits of each decile fixed at the business as usual consumption levels. In
other words, we examine how many households within relative narrowly-defined groups (i.e. business
as usual per capita household consumption deciles) experience a consumption gain or loss between
business as usual and crises scenario in 2014 large enough to push them up or down by one
consumption decile or more, where consumption deciles are defined on the basis of the business as
usual distribution.

We perform the exercise separately for total and regional per capita household consumption. Figure 6
shows the share of households in each decile who: (i) suffer an income loss large enough to shift them
to a lower consumption decile; (ii) experience a relatively small consumption movement and therefore
their position remains unchanged; and (iii) experience a positive change and therefore are better off in
crises.

Approximately 40% of all households remain in the same consumption decile for total Iraq. Given that
the deciles are fixed at baseline consumption levels, most of the remaining households experience a
movement down and are mostly concentrated in the lower-middle of the distribution, namely in 3rd-7th
deciles.17




17
 A higher concentration of population in the center of the welfare/consumption distribution produces narrow
consumption intervals for each decile. The narrower the decile consumption interval, the higher the likelihood
of household to jump into a different decile position. Given the small positive impacts of non-labor income
mentioned above, very few households in these deciles suffered income gains as a consequence of the crises
that are large enough to push them to a higher decile. However, these movements are negligible relative to
the other options.

Impacts on IDP

Since June 2014, Islamic State militants extended their influence from Syria into Iraq’s northern and
western provinces of Anbar, Nineveh, Salahadin, and to a lesser extent, Kirkuk and Diyala. As
mentioned above, an estimated 354,000 families were internally displaced between June and
December of 2014 which represents about 2.1 million individuals.18

The bulk of the forced displacement of people took place in the five IS-affected governorates, with
Anbar, Salahadin and Nineveh alone accounting for 90 percent of the displaced families (Figure 7).
These internally displaced persons (IDPs) have sought refuge across Iraq – 63 percent of IDPs have
crossed into other governorates, about half of them into the three governorates of Iraqi Kurdistan.19
This analysis focuses on the 1.3 million IDPs who crossed governorate boundaries, and can be
incorporated into the microsimulation exercise.

 Kurdistan region comprises of the three governorates of Erbil, Sulaimaniya and Duhouk. Based on official
governorate boundaries, approximately 800,000 IDPs have moved to KR-I. If districts under de facto KR-I
administration are included (in particular the IDP camps in Nineveh administered by the Duhouk governorate),
the number increases to 1 million. This influx represents a significant addition to Kurdistan’s 5 million people.

As expected, the welfare levels of this group –i.e. consumption per capita – has shrunk by more than
double that for the population on average. Household consumption per capita would have decreased
by almost 22% between scenarios. The impacts on total income per capita would have been more
severe (i.e. -61.6%) under the assumption of smoothing consumption over difficult times. These were
mainly driven by a massive reduction in labor income (i.e. -62.5%) as a consequence of job loss.
Unemployment rate rises up to 27% among this population which is almost 3 times higher than the
increase suffered by the whole population.

The lack of employment with the massive reduction in labor income reinforced by the loss of assets and
services of a proper dwelling implies a significant increase in the incidence of poverty among the IDPs.
Simulation results show that the headcount rate would have grown by 15 percentage points from 23%
up to 38% which is twice the impact for the population as whole (Figure 8). In other words, 4 out of 10
internal displaced individuals would have become poor as consequence of the crises. Additionally, the
poverty gap and severity would also increase by 5 and 3 percentage points for this population.

Overall, IDPs alone account for half a million of the additional 2.8 million poor people as a consequence
of the twin crises (Figure 9). These “new poor” represent almost 20% of the increase in the total
estimated number of poor (i.e. 8 million poor) in 2014. However, the IDP poverty incidence crisis varies
significantly across regions. While in Kurdistan IDP would have been contributed to 62% of the growth
in the number of poor, in the South this population only would contribute 2%.

Having said this, not all IDP would have become poor as consequence of the twin crises. Poor IDPs only
comprise 6% of the total number of 8 million poor people in the crisis scenario and only a third of them
would have experienced a worsening of their welfare status large enough to have fallen into poverty as
consequence of the crises.

Concluding remarks

Even in 2012, before the current crisis, one fifth of the Iraqi population lived below the national poverty
line; and many more lived close to the line, vulnerable precisely to the sorts of welfare shocks they are
facing today. The 2014 crisis has eroded the welfare gains of the past, with poverty falling back to 2007
levels and a 20% increase in the number of the poor. While the incidence of poverty is higher among
IDPs than the rest of the population everywhere except in the IS-affected governorates, IDPs make up
only a small proportion of Iraq’s 8 million poor in 2014. The rest comprise of households who already
lived below the poverty line, or those who have fallen below the poverty line in the face of the massive
economic disruptions the country is facing. Finally, the welfare impact of the crises varies widely across
space, with the largest increases in headcount rates in KR-I and the IS-affected governorates. Yet, the
poorest regions in the 2014 crisis scenario are the same as in 2012 – the currently IS-affected, and the
South, with poverty rates of 40 % and 30% respectively.

The simulation methodology

The microsimulation is divided into three steps: the baseline, simulation and assessment. It is based on
Olivieri S, et al. (2014) with a major difference of accounting for internal migration or population
displacement.

Baseline

The first step is the process by which individual and household level information is used to estimate a
set of parameters and unobserved characteristics for various equations of the household income
generation model. The model behind the micro-simulation is the household income generation model
developed by Bourguignon and Ferreira (2005). This model allows accounting for multiple transmission
channels and working at the individual/household level. The first component of the model is an identity
that defines the per capita income in a household ℎ as the ratio between the total household income
and the total number of members (ℎ ) in that household:

                                                 ℎ   Λ    
                                            1             
                                   ℎ   =     [∑ ∑ ∑ ℎ ℎ + 0ℎ ]                                      (1)
                                           ℎ
                                                 =1 =1 =0


      where              = household member
                         = level of education
                Λ          = maximum level of education
                         = labor status
                         = economic sector
                   
                ℎ      is an indicator function of labor status j of individual  with level of education 
                    
                ℎ      = earnings of individual  with level of education  in economic sector 
                0ℎ       = total non-labor income received by household ℎ

The total household income—the expression in brackets in equation (1)—results from adding two main
sources of family income: labor and non-labor income. At the same time, the total family labor income
is the aggregation of earnings in different economic sectors across members20. So, we see not only
whether an individual participates (or doesn’t participate) in the sector, but also whether that individual
receives (or doesn’t receive) wages for that job. The labor participation model relies on the utility
                                                                                          
maximization approach developed by McFadden21. Assume that the utility (ℎ ), for individual  of
household h, associated with labor status j=0,…,J, and level of education L, can be expressed as a linear
                                                                 
function of observed individual and household characteristics (ℎ ) and unobserved utility determinants

20
   Notice that although we could estimate specific models for salaried and non-salaried workers based on the
microdata from the household survey, we would not be able to use these models because this information,
generally, is not available from the macro side. Macro-economic projections are calculated mainly for
aggregate economic sectors such as agriculture, industry and services instead of wage or self-employed,
formal and informal sectors.

ℎ = 1) if economic sector j provides the highest level of utility22:

Each individual must choose from six alternatives: being inactive, unemployed, or being in an economic
sector (i.e., agriculture, mining, manufacture and construction and services). The criterion value
associated with being inactive is arbitrarily set to zero. The unobserved utility determinants of each
occupation status are assumed to be identically and independently distributed across individuals,
occupations and skill levels. In this case skill levels are defined as mutually exclusive categories: low
skilled individuals are defined as those individuals with less than higher secondary education while high
skilled individuals are defined as individuals with complete higher secondary or more.

The observed heterogeneity in earnings in each economic sector j can be modeled by a log-linear

The second component of the total household income, total family non-labor income, is the sum of

components. Ideally, we would model international remittances, but migration-related information in
most surveys is poor or insufficient. Therefore, we rely on a simple non-parametric assignment rule that
is consistent with the existing evidence.

Equations (1) to (5) complete the model. Total household income is a nonlinear function of the
observed characteristics of the household and its members, and unobserved characteristics of
household members. This function depends on a set of parameters: those of the occupational choice


22
  Bourguignon and Ferreira (2005) say that this interpretation is not fully justified because occupational choices
may actually be constrained by the demand side of the market, as in the case of selective rationing, rather than
individual preferences.

model for each skill level and the parameters in the earning functions for each economic sector and skill
level. We assume that there is no variation in the composition of the household. In other words, the
number, age and gender of members of a household remain constant over time. The demographic
change is incorporated via calibration of the survey weights. For further details on estimation strategy
of parameters see Olivieri, S. et al (2014).

Simulation

The second step consists of replicating macroeconomic simulated changes (i.e., sector of employment,
total output or public and private transfers) between the baseline of 2012 and each projected scenario
for 2014 of changes in different components of the household income generation model (i.e., labor and
non-labor income). This process is divided into three sub-steps ordered in the following sequence:
population growth, labor market status and income, and non-labor income.

The population growth adjustment is particularly important in countries with high fertility rates,
important immigration flows, or when the last available household survey is relatively far from the
projection year. In the first case, the number of labor market entrants rises faster than overall
population. In practical terms, this allows us to explicitly take into account changes in the size of the
working age population, and hence to distinguish between employment growth driven (or rather
absorbed) by demographic trends and net (or additional) employment growth.

In the case of Iraq, we divide this adjustment into two steps: natural population growth between
baseline (2012) and projected year (2014); and then internal displacement of 2014 population. The first
step is done by re-weighting households in the baseline data (i.e. IHSES 2012) to replicate demographic
changes predicted by gender, age groups and governorates. In most household surveys, the household
is the unit that is sampled, thus the probability of including an individual conditional on the household
being selected is 1.24 In other words, the survey weights attached to every individual within the
household should be equal. In this sense we can write the initial or prior weights as:

                                                   ∑ ∑ ℎ =                                      (6)
                                                   ℎ      
                                      where N is the initial total population
                                    ℎ = ℎ = ℎ          ≠  ∧ ,  ∈ ℎ

where ℎ is the weight of individual i within household h, equal to the common weight ℎ . So, we can
rewrite (6) as:

                                     ∑ ℎ ℎℎ  = ∑  ∗
                                                                            ℎ
                                                                              =                     (7)

       ̂ is the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint E(X), and Ω is the normalizing factor to scale the

new population to the target size. In the simulation process we impose several population constraints
which result from different growth rates by gender age group and governorate brackets.

The internally displaced population movement is taken into account after the above mentioned
adjustment in weights has made. The input for this step is an out-in flow matrix from the International
Organization of Migration (IOM) which estimates the total number of families who had crossed
governorate borders between June and December 2014. The lack of information about the
characteristics of this population implied the following procedure: first randomly selecting families
from governorates of origin like Anbar, Nineveh or Salahadin, and then allocating them to host
governorates for instance, Dohuk, Erbil or Baghdad. It is relevant to note in this case that families and
households are considered equivalent and all members of households classified as IDP are moved.

The rest of this simulation process follows Olivieri, S, et al. (2014).25 Briefly, it uses predictions of
behavioral models estimated on the baseline household data (as in step 1 above), and generates
household and individual-level predictions for employment, earnings and public and private transfers
for 2014. Since an individual’s labor income depends on his/her employment status and labor earnings,
how the output change in a particular sector is apportioned between employment change, earnings
change and adjustments across sectors depends on how responsive (elastic) employment in that sector
is to output change. It also implies that at the household level, the extent of the impact depends on the
size of the aggregate change at the sector level and the demographics and characteristics of household
members, which influence the labor force status and earnings of household members after the change.

To simulate changes in non-labor income, projections of changes in public transfers are assumed to
grow at different rates accordingly to the simulated scenario, while private transfers are assumed to
grow at the rate of aggregate GDP for the relevant period.

  For further details about how the labor and non-labor income components has been simulated see Olivieri, S,
et al. (2014).

                                                                                                          34
Assessment of the impact

The final step is the process by which the information on individual employment status and labor
income, as well as on non-labor income at the household level, is used to generate income or
consumption distributions and calculate various poverty and distributional measures that can then be
used to compare different scenarios. There are two steps needed to obtain the final simulated
distribution.

The first step consists in using price projections to adjust the poverty line to reflect the difference in
food and non-food inflation rates between baseline and projected year. Since the poverty line is
typically anchored to a food basket that ensures a minimum calorie intake, in case where food inflation
is expected to be significantly different from general inflation between baseline and projected year, the
baseline poverty line would not be enough for a household to meet the basic food requirements in the
projected year.

In the case of Iraq poverty is defined in terms of consumption so the last step consists in transforming
household incomes into predicted consumption levels by using the consumption income ratio for each
household from the baseline year.

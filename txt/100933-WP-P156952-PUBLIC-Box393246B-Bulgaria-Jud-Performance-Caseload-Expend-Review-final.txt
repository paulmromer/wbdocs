                                                  Executive Summary

         The World Bank published a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of the Bulgarian
justice sector entitled “Resourcing the Judiciary for Performance and Accountability: A Judici al Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review” in 2008. The objective of the present study is to conduct an
assessment of the spending and institutional changes in Bulgaria’s judiciary from 2008 onwards. The
current report examines the principal trends in resourcing Bulgaria’s judiciary since 2008, while comparing
the expenditure and judicial performance with those of other European countries. The report provides a
set of conclusion and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Bulgaria’s
judiciary and the judicial budget1 process.

         As per the latest published report on "European judicial systems – Edition 2014 (2012 data):
efficiency and quality of justice”, Bulgaria’s annual budget per inhabitant for the entire judicial system was
29.5 euros, which was less than the average of 60.6 euros for the CoE states. However, when compared
with the per capita GDP, Bulgaria’s annual budget for its judicial system was 0.54 % of the per capita GDP,
which was higher than the average of 0.33 % for the CoE states. Despite high judicial expenditure as a
percentage of per capita GDP, Bulgaria’s judiciary has been under-funded in relation to its budget requests
and the statutory required minimum salaries for judges. Current expenditures account for 98 % of
Bulgaria’s judicial budget, the majority of which is for salaries and other remuneration. However, current
budget levels are insufficient to pay the minimum salary for magistrates prescribed under law. The capital
budget is also not adequate to meet judicial needs as only about 10-15 % of the judiciary’s capital budget
requests are approved by the Parliament. There is scope for the judiciary to increase its own revenues by
reforming and raising court filing fees. The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has prepared a proposed revision
of the tariff and submitted it to the Council of Ministers.

         The performance of judiciary in terms of case disposition has been quite satisfactory. The clearance
rate in Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7 years and the disposition time has been
less than 75 days for all years except 2008, both of which can be considered good performance in
comparison to other European countries.

         At the same time, the report reveals that there is scope for Bulgaria’s judiciary to reorganize itself
to improve its efficiency and effectiveness based on an assessment of judicial workloads. There are 2,225
approved judge positions, against which, 1,811 judges are working. The average actual caseload per judge
per month at the national level is about 30. There are several courts with caseloads well below this national
average. As a result, there is scope to redeploy surplus or underworked judges to other courts with high
caseloads. At the national level, as an initial step in a broader judicial restructuring, the SJC could consider
reducing the number of approved judge positions to the number of currently filled positions. The ratio of
judicial staff to inhabitants in Bulgaria is 2.7, which is one of the highest in Eastern European countries.
The SJC could consider reducing this ratio at the national level (thereby contributing to cost-savings) and
uniformly distributing the revised national ratio across courts (thereby improving efficiency).

        There are presently 13 district courts where the caseload per judge is less than 10 cases per month
and 6 regional courts where the caseload is 20 or fewer cases per judge per month, both of which, are well
below the average for each type of case. It is likely that the number of judges in these courts can be

    Throughout this paper the term “judicial budget” will be used to refer to the budget of the Bulgarian judicial system.

                                                             6
reduced with some judges freed to be redeployed to other courts where there are higher caseloads.
Similarly, there are 147 judges working in 6 appellate courts, which have an average caseload of only 8
cases per month. The SJC could consider consolidating the 6 appellate courts into 2 or 3 appellate courts
and redeploy surplus judges elsewhere. In 4 military courts, there are 19 judges working with an average
caseload of only 2 cases per judge per month. The SJC could consider consolidating 4 military courts into a
single military court to handle the existing caseload and redeploy the surplus judges. Among the
investigation magistrates, the average annual caseload at the National Investigative Service was estimated
to be 12 cases in 2013, of which only 6 cases were completed and just 0.6 cases led to court indictments.
The Supreme Judicial Council should carefully examine the potential workload for these magistrates and
decide how many are required to do the job at hand. The surplus judges could be redeployed elsewhere.

         It is possible that the SJC may not be able to identify suitable places for the redeployment of the
all the judges identified in a court restructuring plan. However, under Bulgarian law, judges cannot be
removed from service except by way of attrition. Hence, the government may want to consider the option
of allowing these judges to retire or be deployed elsewhere in the government as an alternative exit route
to changing the law. Retirement or deployment out of the judiciary would be expected to reduce annual
recurrent expenditure on salaries, other remuneration and related office expenses in the budget. Given
the overall costs, it is recommended that a proportion of any savings from restructuring of the sector be
used to finance increases in salaries and higher capital expenditure.

         At present, there are about 114 judges seconded to other courts through agreements between
court presidents. There may be an appearance of favoritism when some judges are seconded to higher
courts with associated increases in wages. To address this issue, the SJC should consider terminating the
secondment program as it is currently administered (by agreement between court presidents) and assume
direct responsibility for deciding the placement of seconded judges based on an assessment of the most
efficient and effective handling of the court caseloads.

        The judiciary has raised concerns that any economies realized in a judicial restructuring program,
through reduced costs or increased income, could result in the reduction of the government’s subsidy to
the judicial budget leaving overall expenditures at their present insufficient level. The latest State Budget
Act has, for the first time, provided that if the judiciary fails to reach the budgeted levels of its own income,
the state budget subsidy would not be raised to compensate any shortfall. (However, this provision was
recently overturned by the Constitutional Court.) The SJC would like greater predictability in the resources
they receive from the government budget so that they can undertake necessary reorganization and
restructuring of the courts and judiciary with confidence that they will have access to necessary resources.

         In light of the opportunities for restructuring the judicial system identified in this paper, it is
recommended that the SJC, MOJ and MOF reach an agreement on a medium term funding strategy for the
judiciary. Such an agreement could be based on a judicial restructuring plan that leads to a more efficient
court system with a more equitable distribution of workload (by redeploying judges, consolidating courts,
and shrinking judicial and staff positions as necessary) that can be fully funded (both current and capital
expenditures) without resort to annual debates and uncertainty over supplemental budget requests.

        Apart from the appropriate funding level for the judiciary, there is an issue of over centralized
decision making at the SJC level. Under existing law, courts must receive prior authorization from the SJC
for every expenditure that they make from the budget. Court presidents cannot retain any funds or take
any expenditure decisions on their own. The SJC could consider proposing legal changes that will allow it


                                                       7
to decentralize some of its authority by allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees
that their courts collect. The SJC could frame specific rules defining the object and method by which court
presidents could use those funds and hold court presidents accountable for the use of these retained funds
and for prior agreed results.

                                Summary of Recommendations


1. Revision of court tariffs: A revision of tariff is overdue and it is recommended that the SJC’s
    proposed revised tariffs be evaluated based on its economic impact and its effects on access to
    the courts.
2. Reducing the number of approved judges: SJC could consider reducing the number of approved
    judge positions to the currently filled positions as an initial step in a broader judicial restructuring.
3. Reducing number of support staff: The ratio of staff to inhabitants 2.7, which is one of the highest
    among European countries. The SJC could consider reducing this ratio at the national level and
    uniformly distributing the revised national ratio across courts.
4. Redeployment of judges in District and Regional Courts: Bulgaria could reduce the number of
    judges from 13 district courts with caseload less than 10 cases per judge per month and from 6
    regional courts with caseloads of 20 or fewer cases per judge per month. These judges could be
    redeployed in courts with high caseloads.
5. Consolidation of Appellate Courts: The SJC could consider consolidating 6 appellate courts into 2
    or 3 appellate courts and redeploy the surplus judges elsewhere.
6. Consolidation of Military Courts: The SJC could consider consolidating 4 military courts into a
    single military court to handle the existing caseload.
7. Reducing the number of Investigation Magistrates: The number of investigation magistrates
    working at the National Investigation Service (NIS) could be reduced from the present number of
    approximately 80 based on the current workload.
8. Consider options for judges who are not redeployed: The government may consider offering a
    program to allow those judges who cannot be redeployed elsewhere in the judicial system,
    following the implementation of a judicial restructuring program, to retire from the bench or
    deploy elsewhere in the government.
9. Re-appropriation of savings: It is recommended that a portion of nay savings generated by a
    judicial restructuring plan be used for financing salary increases and higher capital expenditures.
10. Medium-term funding strategy: It is recommended that SJC, MOJ and MOF reach an agreement
    on a medium term funding strategy for the judiciary based upon a judicial restructuring plan, tied
    to the achievement of goals under the Judicial Reform Strategy that can be fully funded without
    resort to supplementary budgets.
11. Decentralization of expenditure: The SJC could consider decentralizing its budget authority by
    allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees that their courts collect for the
    maintenance and development of their respective courts, and frame accountability rules defining
    the object and method by which court presidents could use those funds.
12. Reorganization of secondment program of judges: The SJC could consider terminating the
    secondment program as it is currently administered by court presidents and assume responsibility
    itself for deciding the placement of judges in order to improve the efficiency of the court systems.

The World Bank published a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of the Bulgarian justice
sector entitled “Resourcing the Judiciary for Performance and Accountability: A Judicial Public Expenditure
and Institutional Review” in 2008. The paper included a review of selected judicial budget, human
resources, incentives and infrastructure issues; suggested a process to strengthen management of judicial
resources; and, proposed benchmarks to track progress on performance and efficiency. The paper analyzed
the spending of the justice sector over time, including the total spending level and its distribution by
individual courts and main spending categories and analyzed the various spending drivers, including
staffing numbers and salary increases. The review also compared spending with indicators such as average
caseloads and rates of case dispositions to get an idea of the development in productivity. Finally, the
review looked at a number of institutional factors underpinning the budget process.

The objective of the present Judicial Performance, Caseload and Expenditure Review is to update the Bank’s
2008 Report and conduct an assessment of the spending and institutional changes in Bulgaria’s judiciary
from 2008 onwards. A World Bank mission2 travelled to Sofia in June 2015. The mission team reviewed the
procedures and process for developing and allocating the judicial budget, reviewed the institutional
framework for developing and implementing this budget, and analyzed the data on judicial expenditures;
courts’ own revenues; and, performance of the Bulgarian courts. This report and our recommendations
are focused exclusively on Bulgaria’s judiciary and do not address the issue of the budget or caseload of
the prosecutors.

The team met with senior officials in the key stakeholder government agencies, which included, inter alia:
Ms. Nadejda Yordanova, Head of Cabinet, and Mr. Petko Petkov, Deputy Minister, in the Ministry of Justice;
Mr. Kiril Ananiev, Deputy Minister and Mr. Dobrin Pindjurov, Director Budget in the Ministry of Finance;
Mr. Kalin Kalpakchiev, Ms. Elka Atanasova, Mr. Mihail Kozharev and Kamen Ivanov, Members of Supreme
Judicial Council; Ms. Christina Todorova, Director of International Relations in Supreme Judicial Council;
Ms. Gorista Grancharova-Kozhareva, Vice-President of the National Audit Office; Ms. Anelia Shtereva,
Deputy Chief of Regional Court in Sofia; Head of Accounts in the Regional Court in Sofia; Mr. Vesselin
Hadjiev, Chief of Court in the Plovdiv District Court; and, Mr. Kalin Monov, Chief Accountant, Plovdiv district
Court. The mission team collected publicly available data from these institutions and gathered insights
into the functioning of judiciary from the key stakeholders.

 The current report examines the principal trends in resourcing Bulgaria’s judiciary since 2008, while
comparing the expenditure and performance with those of other European countries. The report makes
recommendations for improving the resourcing of Bulgaria’s judiciary in light of the recently updated
Judicial Sector Reforms Strategy in Bulgaria. The report provides a set of conclusion and recommendations
for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Bulgaria’s judiciary and the judicial budget process. More
comprehensive research on the conclusions and recommendations identified in this report and more
rigorous exploration of reform paths may be necessary once planned amendments to Bulgaria’s
Constitution and Judicial System Act become reality.

                             I.       Legal Framework for Administration of Justice

1.       Bulgaria’s Constitution and Judicial Systems Act constitute the core legal framework for the
administration of justice. The Constitution provides that the judiciary shall protect the rights and legitimate
interests of all citizens, legal entities and the State; it shall be independent in the manner and performance
of its functions; all judges, jurors, prosecutors and investigating magistrates shall be subservient only to
the law; and it shall have an independent budget. The administration of justice in Bulgaria is based on three
instances. The courts are state bodies that administer justice in civil, criminal and administrative cases. The
organization and activities of the Bulgarian courts are governed by the Judicial System Act, which lays down
the structure and operating principles of the judicial bodies and governs their interaction with each other
and with the legislative and executive bodies. The territorial jurisdictions of the regional, district,
administrative, military and appeal courts coincide with the administrative division of the country. The
organization of courts in Bulgaria is presented in Box 1 below.

                                          Box 1: Organization of Courts in Bulgaria

Regional courts – The regional courts are the main courts for examining cases in the first instance. Their decisions are
subject to appeal before the relevant district court. There are 113 regional courts of which 27 are in the district
centers.

District courts – The district courts act as courts of first and second instance. As courts of first instance, they examine
a precisely defined category of cases involving significant sums or substantial societal interest. When acting as a
second (appellate) instance, they re-examine decisions taken by the regional courts. There are 28 district courts,
including Sofia City Court.

Administrative courts - The administrative courts have jurisdiction over all actions seeking the issue, amendment,
repeal or annulment of administrative acts. They act as second (appellate) instance to the regional courts in some
categories of administrative cases. There are 28 Administrative courts.

Appellate Courts – These courts consider appeals and objections against first-instance rulings by district courts within
their territorial jurisdictions. There are 5 Appellate courts.

The Supreme Court of Cassation – The Supreme Court of Cassation is the supreme judicial instance in criminal and
civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers the entire territory of the Republic of Bulgaria. It exercises supreme judicial review
over the proper and uniform application of laws by all courts. It has its seat in Sofia.

The Supreme Administrative Court - This court exercises supreme judicial review over the proper and uniform
application of laws by administrative courts. It deals with complaints and objections against acts by the Council of
Ministers, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, ministers, heads of other institutions directly subordinate to the
Council of Ministers, acts of the Supreme Judicial Council, acts of the Bulgarian National Bank, acts of district
governors and other acts established by statute.

SPECIALIZED COURTS

Military courts - examine, as courts of first instance, criminal cases concerning offences allegedly committed in the
performance of their duties, or in connection therewith, by generals, officers, non-commissioned officers and rank-

2.       All judicial power is exercised in the name of the people and justice shall be administered by the
Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court, courts of appeal, regional courts, courts-
martial and district courts. Specialized courts can be set up by virtue of law. The Supreme Court of Cassation
exercises supreme judicial oversight as to the precise and equal application of the law by all courts. The
Supreme Administrative Court exercises supreme judicial oversight as to the precise and equal application
of the law in administrative justice.

3.       The governance of the judiciary is entrusted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), which is
responsible for recruitment, promotion, reassignment and discipline (including dismissal) of the judicial
branch officials including judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates. It also has the responsibility of
preparing and executing the budget for the judiciary. Under the Judicial System Act, published in State
Gazette No 64/2007, the SJC is the highest administrative authority and is responsible for managing the
judiciary and ensuring its independence. It determines the composition and organization of the judiciary
and manages its affairs without interfering with the independence of the bodies concerned. It determines
the number of judicial districts and the seats of the regional, district, administrative and appeal courts on
the basis of a proposal by the Minister of Justice and – as regards military courts – in coordination with the
Minister of Defense.

5.      The structure of the prosecution office corresponds to that of the courts and the Prosecutor
General oversees the legality and provides methodological guidance to all other prosecutors. The
prosecution office has to ensure that legality is observed by leading and supervising investigations. It may
also conduct investigations.

6.      The Chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Chairman of the Supreme Administrative
Court and the Prosecutor General are appointed and removed by the President of the Republic upon a
proposal from the SJC for a period of seven years. The Judicial Systems Act sets forth the structure and
operational principles of judicial system bodies, the interaction among them, as well as that among judicial
system bodies and the legislature and executive ones.

7.     Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria were approved at first reading on
September 23, 2015. The Constitutional amendment provides for a division of the Supreme Judicial Council
into two Chambers - a judicial chamber and a prosecutors' chamber - each responsible for the
administration of the respective professions.

8.       Draft amendments to the JSA, prepared but not submitted to the National Assembly, contain the
following provisions: division of the SJC into two Chambers - judicial and prosecutorial; direct election of
SJC members by General Assemblies of judges and of prosecutors and investigators; increase in the self-
governance of courts through increasing the functions of the general assemblies of judges; changes to the
disciplinary proceedings in order to guarantee impartiality and independence; improvements to the
attestation of magistrates in order to ensure just and transparent career growth; providing a procedure for
SJC approval in order to indict a magistrate; development of the professional qualification of magistrates;
clear and predictable rules on secondment of magistrates - decisions should be made by the general
assemblies of courts and not - as the practice currently stands - by court chairs; increasing the
independence of individual prosecutors; improving the work of SJC's Inspectorate; and introducing E-

                                                                                      13
justice. This package of amendments would allow Bulgaria to meet the goals of its Updated Justice Sector
Reform Strategy, discussed below, and responds to European Commission assessments and
recommendations for strengthening Bulgaria’s justice system, particularly by separating the administration
of judges and prosecutors within the SJC.


                                          II.       Justice Sector Reform Strategy

9.       The Council of Ministers adopted an Updated Strategy to continue judicial sector reforms by a
resolution dated December 17, 2014, which was subsequently approved by the National Assembly on
January 21, 2015. The overall objective of this Strategy is to build on the efforts to modernize the judiciary
and to complete its reform within the next seven years. In doing so, Bulgaria will rely upon the resources
and opportunities arising from its membership of the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well
as upon the maturing of civil society and the professional community. The Strategy aims to: achieve
effective independence of the courts and the judiciary; ensure good governance of the judicial authorities
and their highly effective functioning; unfold the potential of human resources in the judiciary and
guarantee the high motivation, competence and social responsibility of judges, prosecutors and
investigating magistrates; implement a modern and effective criminal policy through the necessary
institutional and regulatory reforms; ensure a full-fledged right to a fair trial for each citizen and effective
protection of human rights. Once fully implemented, the Updated Strategy will ensure European standards
of justice to natural and legal persons and turn the judiciary into an effective guarantor of the Rule of Law
and the strengthening of State governance and institutions in the country.

11.      Table 1 demonstrates good performance in terms of “clearance rate percentage”4 and “calculated
disposition time”5, both of which are internationally recognized indicators of courts’ efficiency. A Clearance
Rate close to 100 % indicates the ability of the court or of a judicial system to resolve more or less as many
cases as the number of incoming cases within the given time period. A Clearance Rate above 100 %
indicates the ability of the system to resolve more cases than received, thus reducing any potential backlog.
Conversely, a Clearance Rate below 100 % indicates that the number of incoming cases is higher than the
number of resolved cases, thus increasing any potential backlog of cases.

12.     The Disposition Time indicator provides further insight into how a judicial system manages its flow
of cases. Generally, a case turnover ratio and Disposition Time compares the number of resolved cases

  The assessment team was unable to clarify whether the three-month period referred to in the official court statistics is uniformly measured
across courts from the date of filing of the case or from the date of the last court hearing. However, these are official statistics published in
government websites.

during the observed period and the number of unresolved cases at the end of the observed period. The
ratios measure how quickly a judicial system (or a court) turns over the received cases – that is, how long
it takes for a type of case to be resolved.

13.          The Clearance Rate and Disposition Time in Bulgarian courts in the last 7 years has been as follows:

(Source: Summarized Statistical Tables on the Activity of Courts in 2014)


14.     The Clearance Rate for all cases in all Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7
years and the Disposition Time has been less than or just above 75 days for all the years except 2008. In
2014, the Clearance Rate was 102% and the estimated Disposition Time was 72.69 days, both of which will
be considered very good performance in comparison to other European countries.

15.      In comparison with other member states of the Council of Europe (CoE),6 Bulgaria comes out quite
well when looking at the parameters of Clearance Rate and Disposition Time based on the latest publication
of judicial statistics from CEPEJ7 (using 2012 data):

16.    Table 3 shows that with respect to non-criminal cases, Bulgaria’s Clearance Rate was fairly close to
the average of CoE states. However, in terms of Disposition Time, Bulgaria was much better than the
average and median for the EU states.

17.      Similar results are found when looking at Bulgaria’s Clearance Rate and Disposition Time statistics
in the criminal cases.

 Georgia had 0 cases at the start of the year, and had 18,437 incoming cases in 2012. It resolved 18,425 cases, leaving
only 12 pending cases at the end of the year. This makes disposition time very close to zero days as per the definition
of the term.

19.     Thus, on the whole, taking all kinds of cases into consideration – whether criminal or non-criminal
- Bulgaria’s performance in terms of efficiency of courts is on par with CoE states in respect of clearance
rate and much better in respect of disposition time.

         (Source: Summarized Statistical Tables on the Activity of Courts in 2014).


21.     Table 5 shows that there are 180 courts broken into 6 different levels or categories with 2,225
approved judge positions, against which 1,811 judges are actually working. The average number of
approved judge positions per court is 12 and actual average number of judges working per court is 10. The
maximum number of judges working per court is 25 in Appellate Courts, which is followed by 21 in District
Courts, and 18 in Regional Courts in District Centers. The lowest number of judges working per court is 4
found in the Regional Courts located outside of district centers.




9
    The actual number of total working judges increased to 2,030 by the end of year, i.e. December 31, 2014.

                                                                        21
22.      Whether this wide difference is justified or not will have to be examined from the perspective of
average caseload per working judge. The workload of a judge is based on the number and types of cases
s/he hears. The number of resolved cases per judge is a parameter of his/her efficiency. Column (9) shows
the caseload based on number of cases heard per working judge. According to the above information, the
overall caseload per working judge is 30.2 cases per month. However this varies from the lowest 2.4 cases
per month in Military Courts to 59.2 cases per month in the Regional Courts in District Centers, including
the Sofia Regional Court, the largest court in Bulgaria. Apart from the Military Courts, the caseload appears
to be relatively low in Appellate Courts (8.5 cases per judge per month) and District Courts (15.5 per judge
per month). Bulgaria’s overall average caseload compares well with the average caseload per judge per
month in the neighboring countries such as Romania (39.3), France (38.1), Greece (23.0), Serbia (30.2), and
Ukraine (27.3).

23.     From the above analysis, the following conclusions emerge:

        1) Appellate Courts: There are 147 judges working in 6 Appellate Courts. On average, there are
           25 judges per court and they are hearing only 8.4 cases and resolving 7.1 cases per month. It
           is not clear how such a large number of Appellate Court judges can be justified in view of the
           number of cases being heard and resolved per judge. One explanation for the high number of
           judges in Appellate Courts is that lower-level judges may need to be promoted after some
           years of service and therefore, they move up to higher courts such as the Appellate Courts.
           However, the caseload in Appellate Courts does not appear to justify the present number of
           judges or the growth in these judges through promotions based on seniority alone.

        2) Military Courts: There are 19 judges working in 4 Military Courts. The caseload per judge is
           only 2.4 cases per month. This does not justify the number of judges in the 4 courts. It seems
           likely that 1 Military Court with 2 judges could manage the existing caseload10.

        3) District Courts: There are 623 judges working in 29 District Courts with an average of 21 judges
           per court. Their caseload is only 15.5 cases per month. This is low compared to the national
           average and even if half of these judges were redeployed to other courts, the caseload would
           not exceed the national average of 30 cases per month per judge. Considering District Courts
           have been established as per the administrative jurisdictions of the respective districts, it is
           likely more difficult to reduce their number. However, there is potential for redeploying at
           least 300 judges working in these courts to courts with higher caseloads. With regard to district
           courts, Sofia City Court deserves special attention. Even though it has 152 approved judicial
           positions (including judges and junior judges), only 119 judges were actually working at the
           court as of December 31, 2014. The caseload of these judges in 2014 was 46.6 cases per
           months, which is three times higher than the national average for district courts. It would be
           advisable to redeploy judges from other district courts to Sofia City Court to fill the available

  The MOJ informed the Bank team that it believes that Bulgaria does not need a separate military court system
because this is a remnant from a time when the country had a huge professional army. MOJ believes that general
courts could easily handle crimes committed by military personnel.



                                                     22
            approved positions, in order to reduce caseload to levels commensurate with other courts of
            the same category.

        4) Regional Courts in District Centers (including Sofia Regional Court): There are 484 judges
           working in 27 Regional Courts located in District Centers with an average of 18 judges per court.
           However, these courts have the highest caseload of 59.2 cases per judge per month. If a
           number of judges working in District Courts were redeployed to these Regional Courts, the
           average caseload per judge could be reduced to a more manageable level. This redeployment
           would not necessarily lead to a dislocation of judges as District Court judges could continue to
           work in the same district. Again, the biggest court in this category, Sofia Regional Court, is an
           outlier. Of the 171 approved positions for magistrates in Sofia Regional Court, 13 positions
           have not been filled yet and another 20 magistrates have been seconded to other courts. The
           actual caseload of judges in this court in 2014 was 124.4 cases per month, which is
           approximately twice the workload of judges in regional courts in district towns and almost four
           times the workload of other regional courts. In order to reduce this caseload, the Sofia Regional
           Court should be fully staffed and judges from this court should not be seconded elsewhere.

        5) Regional Courts: There are 314 judges working in 86 Regional Courts at an average of 4 Judges
           per court. However, the caseload in these courts is 33.37 cases per judge per month, which is
           not substantially high. However, there may be scope for redeploying judges to these courts to
           reduce the caseload further.

        6) Administrative Courts: There are 226 Judges working in 28 Administrative Courts at an average
           of 8 judges per court and the caseload is 20.26 cases per judge per month. Both the number
           of judges and their average caseload are moderate in comparison to other types of courts in
           Bulgaria. These courts do not require intervention in terms of redeployment.

24.     It may be noted, however, that all the analysis above is based on the simple number of cases and
that we do not have data on the types or complexity of cases that each level of Bulgarian courts may hear.
The SJC is currently conducting an exercise to classify each case-group by the “complexity" involved in
resolving them. Conclusions regarding the appropriate number of judges and manageable levels of
caseload for each type of Bulgarian court could be revised after considering the outcome of the SJC’s
complexity exercise. A detailed description of the last seven years of judicial workloads by category of court
is presented in ANNEX 2: Court-Wise Actual Workload between 2008 and 2014.

25.     It will be pertinent to note that among the District Courts, the following ones in particular have
sustained low caseloads since 2010:

           (Source: Summarized Statistical Tables on the Activity of Courts).


26.      Table 6 shows 13 out of total 28 District Courts where the average case load has been consistently
low since 2010. These courts have an average caseload of less than 10 cases per working judge per month,
and the caseloads have further declined in the last 3 years. The average case load of these 13 courts is
about half the average of all District Courts. These courts have, on an average, approximately 21 judges
per court. Some of those judges could be redeployed to Regional Courts located in the same district towns
or to District Courts with significantly heavier judicial caseloads such as Sofia City or other Regional Courts
with high judicial caseload like Sofia City, Varna, Pernik, and Plovdiv. Any redeployment of judges will not
be easy and may be complicated by the fact that some Districts Courts likely have judges who are senior to
those in the regional courts and therefore less willing to move “down” to a Regional Court. Nevertheless,
in the interest of overall efficiency of judicial system, the SJC may need to identify a solution to the existing
unbalanced distribution of workload across the District Courts. One possible solution could be to protect
the salary and rank of District Court judges while redeploying them to Regional Courts.

        Regional Courts
       (Source: Summarized Statistical Tables on the Activity of Courts)


28.     Table 7 above shows 6 Regional Courts which have a consistently low caseload of less than 20 cases
per judge per month. This amounts to less than one case per day for each judge. This is a low average in
comparison to other Regional Courts. The average of these 6 courts is less than half of average of all
Regional Courts in the same years. Based on this assessment (which does not account for variations in the
complexity of the cases that are heard in each court), the current number of judges working in these 6
courts may not be justified. Surplus judges could be transferred to other courts, or if the number of judges
in the concerned courts is low, these courts could be consolidated with other Regional Courts based on
geographical proximity.

30.      Table 8 shows that the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Bulgaria was 23.7
in 2006, which was close to the average of 20.3 for the CoE states. However, after 2006, there has been a
consistent increase in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Bulgaria and it reached
30.7 in 2012, whereas the average for CoE states increased minimally and remained at a level of 21 judges
per 100,000 inhabitants. The evolution in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in
Bulgaria between 2006 and 2012 has been 29.6 % which is substantially higher than the average growth of
4.2 % for the COE states.

31.     Bulgaria is experiencing a demographic crisis, with negative population growth since the 1990's
and an economic stagnation that has promoted significant emigration. Bulgaria's population is now
shrinking at an alarming rate, losing 582,000 in ten years, and 1.5 million since 1985. Bulgaria has an
estimated population of 7.11 million in 2015, which is down from the official population of 7.36 million at
the 2011 census. (There are also significant “pull” factors that also have influenced this recent emigration.)
However, the number of professional judges increased from 2,147 to 2,225 between 2011 and 2015. The
number of professional judges per 100,000 population in 2015 is 31.3. The evolution between 2006 and
2012 has been 32.1 %. The contrast of a shrinking overall population with the increase of almost 32% in
number of judges per 100,000 inhabitants is striking.

  The changes in number of judges in UK-Northern Ireland appears to be an outlier. Data for UK-Northern Ireland
needs to be qualified by the fact that data reported for 2006 and 2008 includes the number of lay judges (243) and
seems to be presented in terms of “persons” rather than “full time equivalents” as reported by other COE states.

32.     Table 9 shows that there was an increase in the number of incoming cases from 2008 to 2010. But
there has been a continuous decline in the number of incoming cases since 2011. If these caseload figures
are compared to the increase in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants to 31.3 in 2015
we see that the number of judges in Bulgaria grew despite a reduction in population and a reduction in the
number of incoming cases. (Though it should be noted that the absolute number of incoming cases in 2012
and even in 2014 was still greater than in 2008 for all of Bulgaria’s courts except the Military Courts.) This
analysis can be used to support the case for establishing a freeze on the number of approved judges’
positions and redeploying existing working judges based on the distribution of caseload.

33.     Digging deeper into the judicial statistics we can assess the evolution in the number of judicial
positions from 2008 to 2014 to see in which category of courts it has increased the most:

34.      Table 10 shows that the maximum proportionate increase in the number of judicial positions has
been in the Appellate Courts. This is followed by Regional Courts in District Centers. This is as expected,
since, as the judges get promoted, they likely move “up” the court hierarchy and ultimately are posted in
Appellate Courts. In Regional Courts in district centers, there is the maximum caseload and it is expected
that the number of judges would be increased to match the increasing caseload. The increase in District
Courts has been 4.44 %, but in relation to the caseload in these courts, this may be considered high. As
suggested earlier, this growth could have been to provide promotional avenues to judges in the Regional
Courts. A reduction of 7.44 % in the number of judges in Regional Courts, is, however, not justified because
these are first instance courts with caseloads that are greater than the average. A reduction of 19.35 % in
Military Courts is to be expected due to reducing caseload.

36.     In many European countries, planned or current reforms to the judicial map tend to reduce the
number of courts with the aim of cutting budgets or increasing efficiency by grouping courts together or
making them more specialized. This applies to Croatia and Serbia in the above list of countries. Similar
types of reduction or consolidation of courts could be justified in Bulgaria based on the declining
population, downward trend in incoming cases, growth in the number of judges and uneven distribution
of caseload among different court levels.

37.      The caseload analysis in the sections above was conducted based on the actual number cases filed
and resolved in courts as per statistics published by the SJC. However, (as noted above in paragraph 24)
these statistics do not distinguish between the complexities of different types of cases. All cases are not
equally complex. Some cases raise a number of difficult issues, involve multiple parties or address novel
legal issues and therefore require greater effort from a judge to understand and resolve. Other cases, such
as the issuance of enforcement orders and writs of execution, can be resolved in minutes. In order to
incorporate this additional characteristic in its statistics, the SJC has developed a methodology for
measuring the complexity of cases.

38.      Under this methodology, administrative cases have been divided into 50 groups and criminal and
civil cases have been divided into 100 groups. Judges have been asked to fill out questionnaires specifying
how many hours they typically need to devote to a case from each group. Once the information from all
these questionnaires is processed, SJC will determine a “Complexity Quotient” for each case group, which
will form the basis of the case weighing methodology. A survey of judges across Bulgaria was started in July
2014 and concluded in March 2015. Questionnaires were completed by judges and uploaded electronically
to the central server. Processing of survey results is ongoing. The entire set of results is expected by end of
August 2015. The questionnaire cards were entered on a retrospective basis, but in the future can be
entered on real time basis. Time Control Sheets will have to be entered by judges in the electronic system.
The electronic system will enable the monitoring of complexity of cases on a real time basis. The SJC should
have the ability to track the “complexity quotient” by court/case type and arrange the cases in ascending
or descending order of complexity. This exercise will help in assessing the caseload in different courts more



                                                              29
accurately by more effectively incorporating complexity into the assessment. If adopted by the SJC in 2015,
the results will be available for use in preparing budget estimates for the courts starting in 2017.

39.     There is a risk that the judges (and possibly the SJC) will identify more time needed to handle a
particular type of case than it actually takes them to resolve the case. Thus the SJC’s Complexity Quotient
could have an upward bias to it. This has been observed in another sector in Bulgaria where an assessment
of complexity tended to move in the direction of more rather than less complexity when measured by the
participants. At the same time the SJC’s efforts could provide a useful benchmark against which court
workloads can be measured going forward. Such measurements could help the SJC reallocate caseload
among different courts in a more refined manner based on complexity and could be used to develop a
more fair evaluation of judges.


                                        VI.      Investigation Magistrates

40.      Investigation magistrates also form part of the judiciary. More than 1,000 investigation magistrates
were appointed during 1999-2005, of which about 500 have either retired or become prosecutors. There
are still approximately 500 investigation magistrates, approximately 80 of which work at the National
Investigative Service (NIS). Many of them do not have sufficient workload, especially the ones working at
NIS. Thus, the average caseload per investigation magistrate at the National Investigative Service in 2013
was estimated to be 11.89 cases, of which 5.79 cases have been completed and just 0.56 have ended with
an opinion for bringing an indictment to court12. Unfortunately current data on investigation magistrates’
workload was not publicly available. Anecdotal evidence suggests that workload may have dropped further
since 2013. As per Constitutional provisions, these magistrates can exit only through retirement; they
cannot be removed from service unless there is a disciplinary ground. Based on available information, the
government may consider conducting a detailed examination of the potential and actual workloads for
these magistrates in order to make a decision on the optimal number needed to handle the expected
caseload.


                                          VII.     Secondment Program

41.     Court presidents have the authority to temporarily transfer judicial assistance between the courts.
The assistance is based on an assessment of the workload in the receiving court. Both the sending and
receiving court presidents must agree on the transfer of judicial assistance. The funds to pay for the salaries
of the temporary judge are reallocated through the SJC. If the judge is temporarily assigned to a higher
level court, the salary of the judge is increased to the level of the higher level judge position. Only salary
funds are transferred to the receiving court. No provision is made for the additional travel or other
incidental costs. Once the assignment is complete, the seconded judge returns to the resident court and
the salary is reduced to the level of the original, lower resident court.

43.      Based on Tables 12 and 13 it appears that backlogs continued to fall even in those courts that
experienced a net loss of judges due to secondments. The one exception were the District Courts which
experienced both a net loss in judges and an increase in backlog. While we cannot draw specific
conclusions from this data (for example would the backlog in the Regional Courts have fallen more if these
courts did not have a net loss in seconded judges?), we can conclude that the secondment program will
result in an increased caseload burden for the judges remaining in courts that experience a net loss of
seconded judges. For example, the Regional Court in Sofia seconded 21 judges to other courts and received
7 seconded judges, resulting in a net reduction of 14 judges which contributes to the high caseload carried
by the judges remaining in the Sofia Regional Court. The length of secondment service has been as follows:

                                   Table 14: Length of Secondment Service

                  Over 36 Months       Over 24 months            Over 12 Month      Under 12 Months

                          21                    17                     24                  52

44.     The above table indicates that some of the secondments have become de-facto permanent re-
assignments. In the category of secondments with a duration of more than 36 months, some judges have
been on assignment for more than 60 months and in one case, for more than 80 months. Based on this
data, the SJC may consider reviewing the list of seconded judges to determine those that should be placed
permanently in vacant positions in the receiving courts.

45.       The secondment program can be used by the SJC as a valuable tool to address the workload of
judges in overburdened courts. However, the SJC should consider restructuring the secondment program
as it is currently administered – through agreement of the sending and receiving Court Presidents – for it
to make more effective use of this tool. Under a revised secondment procedure the SJC could assume
responsibility for deciding the placement of seconded judges based on a work load analysis conducted by
the SJC.

46.     The above arrangement would eliminate both the perception of favoritism in the assignment of
some judges to higher courts (with an accompanying increase in wages) and the possibility of Court
Presidents influencing the decisions of seconded judges who would like to remain in their seconded
positions.


                                        VIII.    Support Staff in Judiciary

47.     The SJC is developing a court reorganization strategy by studying court closure alternatives and the
impact those closures would have on access to justice. Following that study, the SJC plans to estimate the
number of support staff needed in relation to the workload. The present ratio of support staff to judges is
as follows:

                                   Table 15: Ratio of Support Staff to Judges

                                        2007         2008    2009      2010      2011   2012     2013   2014

       Total Working Judges             1734         1757    1780      1798      1779   1785     1775   1861



                                                            32
       Total Working Court Clerks             4164       4270      4466      4538         4594     4700         4650   4684

       Ratio of Clerks to Judges               2.4        2.4         2.5     2.5         2.6       2.6         2.6    2.5



48.      The current ratio of support staff to Magistrates is 2.52. However, this ratio is not uniform across
courts. It will be useful to ensure that this ratio is equitably applied within each court. There are several
courts that do not have an adequate number of support staff, which can affect the court’s efficiency. It
may be possible to have a redeployment of support staff from courts with higher ratios to courts with lower
ones. It would also be helpful for the SJC to analyze if a ratio of 2.52 clerks to each judge is necessary for
the efficient delivery of judicial services. If not, and if the ratio can be reduced to 2 while maintaining the
same level of outputs and judicial services, then the number of clerks could be reduced to around 950
which could result in an annual savings of approximately 17.5 million BGN.

49.      As can be seen, the ratio of staff to judges falls into three groups. There are three countries with
ratios of 3.7 or more, four countries with ratios between 3 and 3.2 and four countries with ratios of 2.6 or
2.7 and one country with a ratio of 2.1. Bulgaria falls in the middle with a ratio of staff to judges of 2.6.

50.     The ratio of staff to inhabitants is the highest in the highly developed EU countries; Germany and
Sweden all have over 50 staff per 100,000 inhabitants. Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia and Slovenia (all
former Yugoslav republics, not listed) also each have well over 30 staff and judges per 100,000 inhabitants.
The rest of the Eastern European countries have ratios of staff and judges to 100,000 inhabitants ranging
from a high of 29 in Bulgaria to a low of 11.7 in Albania. The ratio of both staff and judges in all of the
Eastern European countries are very similar. The three other EU members, Italy, Netherlands and France,
have substantially less staff per 100,000 inhabitants ranging from 2.6 to 3.7


                         IX.      Expenditure Framework for the Judiciary Sector

51.     The Public Finance Act, 2014 assigns the responsibility for the budget formulation process and
timetable to the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The SJC follows the Budget Instructions issued by the MOF
that are applicable to all Primary Budget Holders. The SJC is the Primary Budget Holder for the judiciary.
The courts are considered Secondary Budget Holders. The instructions and budget schedules to be
completed by the courts are issued by January 31 of each year. The budget call circular requests the
Primary Budget Holders to estimate their budget requirements for two years into the future. All budget
proposals including from the Judiciary and the Parliament are approved by the Council of Ministers.

52.      The SJC sends budget instructions to the courts requiring the courts to prepare their budget
proposals using the standard budget classification for all government bodies. The standard classification
is by economic object class of expenditures (Salaries, Social Security, Travel, Maintenance, etc.). The courts
submit their budget proposals to the SJC as email attachments. The analysts in the SJC’s Directorate of
the Budget and Finance Sector consolidate all 185 budget proposals by court type and submit the budgets
to the Budget and Finance Committee of the SJC for review.

53.     There are two sources of funding for the judiciary budget – Own Revenue and State Subsidy. The
courts estimate the level of court fees to be collected during the fiscal year based on the expected number
of incoming cases and their types. An estimate is also made in regard to the amount to be collected through
penalties based on cases under consideration and past trends. The estimated level of fees to be collected
during a year is linked to the tariff-rates approved by the Council of Ministers. Once the SJC approves the
Judiciary budget including estimated expenditure, Own Revenue, and State Subsidy, it is sent to the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for presentation to the Council of Ministers.

54.      Article 117 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria makes the following provision in respect
of the judiciary:

         “(1) The judiciary shall protect the rights and legitimate interests of all citizens, legal entities and
         the State.

         (2) The judiciary shall be independent. In the performance of their functions, all judges, court

55.     The Judiciary is guaranteed an independent budget to ensure its independence from the executive.
The Budget for the judiciary is, therefore, not amended by MOJ or the Council of Ministers. The Council of
Ministers consolidates budgets of all ministries, departments and agencies and forwards them to the
Parliament for approval. Table 17 below illustrates the significant reduction to the judicial budget request
as proposed by the MOF and adopted by the Parliament for inclusion in the State Budget Act.

56.     Traditionally the MOF submits an alternate budget for the judiciary to Parliament. The alternate
budget is always lower than the budget proposal from the SJC. This is typically due to the fact that the
MOF considers broader resource constraints and tries to allocate the budget rationally and equitably based
on these broader constraints. Since the parties running the executive branch are also in control of the
Parliament, the Parliament usually approves MOF’s alternate budget proposal for the judiciary. As a result,
the annual State Budget Act has included the MOF’s alternative budget rather than the budget proposed
by SJC.

57.     After the State Budget Act is approved, the SJC distributes an annual allocation of funds to courts
by economic classification along with an approved employment ceiling. The court presidents have the
authority to reprogram funds among the various classes of expenditures with approval of the SJC.

58.     The courts manage their budget within the approved funding level. All court expenditures are
transmitted to the SJC electronically for prior approval. Courts cannot incur any expense without prior
authorization from the SJC. This practice is uniformly followed across all government agencies where
secondary budget holders are required to take prior authorization for all expenditures from the primary
budget holders. Courts maintain their own accounting records and submit monthly accounting reports to
the SJC. The reports are consolidated by the SJC and are subject to certification by the Bulgarian National
Audit Office.

61.     Figure 1 shows that Expenditure has been higher than the originally approved budget in all years
except in 2009, when the investigative function was transferred from courts to the police. The average
budget execution during this period has been 106%, which was largely covered by the supplementary
budgets passed in these years.

62.      When we compare Bulgaria’s budget allocation to different components of the judicial system –
Courts, Public Prosecution and Legal Aid – with the allocation in other COE states the situation emerges as
follows:

             Table 19: Annual Budget allocations to Judicial Systems: Comparison with CoE states

      Source: CEPEJ 2014 (2012 data).


63.      Table 19 shows that the annual budget allocation per inhabitant for Courts is 17.1 Euros in Bulgaria
against the average for CoE states of 34.8 Euros. For the entire Judicial System, comprising of Courts, Public
Prosecution and Legal Aid, the annual budget allocation per inhabitant in Bulgaria is 29.5 Euros, in
comparison to the average for CoE states of 60.6 Euros. Bulgaria thus provides a lower absolute budget
allocation (per inhabitant) for its judicial system in comparison to the average of CoE member states.

64.        In terms of GDP per capita, the Bulgaria’s budget allocation to the judicial sector is as follows:

65.     Table 19b shows that Bulgaria’s annual budget allocation as a percentage of GDP per capita is
higher than a rich country like Norway and lower than a poor country like Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bulgaria’s allocation to its courts and judicial system on a GDP per capita basis is also above the COE
averages. In fact only four COE states spend more on their judicial systems relative to GDP per capita than
Bulgaria (Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and UK-N. Ireland). It is important to note that Bulgaria receives
large scale assistance to strengthen rule of law from EU and other international organizations. As a result,
the annual budget allocation may be higher than what it would have otherwise been.

66.      A benchmarking of Bulgaria’s judicial budget in comparison to other EU member states in relation
to GDP is presented in ANNEX 3: Benchmarking of Per Capita State Budget and % of GDP with COE Member
States. This benchmarking reveals that Bulgaria’s judicial budget allocation as a percentage of GDP is
second at 0.46%; only Slovenia spends more as a percentage of its GDP on the judiciary (0.53%). The
benchmarking also shows that Bulgaria is dedicating almost 26 euros per capita for the operation of the
judiciary compared to an average of over 50 euros per capita for EU Member States. Of the newer EU
Member States, only Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are spending more per capita than Bulgaria.
The rest of the former Eastern European countries are spending similar amounts as Bulgaria on their
judicial system.




                                    XI.          Funding Operations of the Judiciary

67.     The breakdown of funding sources for the judicial operations in Bulgaria is as follows:

              Table 20: Funding Judicial Operations: Own Resources and Government Subsidy
                                                     (Amount in 1000 BGN)

   68.    Table 20 shows that the judiciary is currently funding 27 % of its expenditure from its own sources,
   whereas the Government is funding 73 % through its subsidy. If we compare court fees with respect to
   expenditure on courts, the court fees cover 49 % of court expenditures.

   69.      Currently the judiciary is experiencing a reduction in filings which in turn reduces the collection of
   filing fees. The level of filing fee collection was reduced from a high of 124,009,000 BGN in 2011 and has
   declined almost each year since to its current level of 105,578,000 BGN in 2014. This is a reduction of
   18,431,000 BGN or almost 15% over four years. It is anticipated that the amount of filing fees collected will
   continue to fall in succeeding years (matching the trend of decreasing intake of new court cases).

   70.      The SJC is proposing a restructuring of filing fees that will increase revenue in future years. Under
   this proposal, some fees would be increased to reflect the actual work being performed by the courts. For
   example, some fees for administrative cases and privately filed criminal cases are low based on the level
   of judicial effort and could be increased.13 On the other hand, the 4% proportionate fee charged in civil
   cases based on the amount of monetary interest can become extremely high in high-value cases and may
   deter some claimants from making claims or cause them to file only partial claims. Therefore, the SJC has
   proposed introducing a ceiling to this fee.

   71.      The SJC has submitted the revised court fee plan to the Council of Ministers, through the Deputy
   Minister of Finance, over the past few years for submission to Parliament. (The Council of Ministers is the
   only government body authorized to propose legislation to the Parliament.) The Council of Ministers has
   yet to act on the SJC’s fee proposal. A revision of Bulgaria’s court tariffs is overdue. The SJC’s proposal
   should be reviewed and evaluated based on its impact on access to Bulgaria’s courts as well as its revenue
   raising impact.

     Some judges believe raising the filing fees on some administrative and privately filed criminal cases will have the
   added benefit of leading to a reduction in frivolous filing allowing more time for judges to review other cases.

      This covers the actual budget approved by the Parliament. There were Supplementary Budgets approved
   thereafter, for which the break-down by administrative or economic classification is not available.

   73.      Table 21 shows that there has been a modest 2.8 % per annum rise in the budget funding for the
   judiciary sector between 2008 and 2015. There was a reduction in the budget in 2010 due to the transfer
   of the investigation function to the police department. The judiciary was left with investigations of higher

were transferred to the Prosecution in 2010.

75.      Figure 2 shows that 51 % of the judicial budget is for the courts, 39 % for the prosecution, and 10
% for all other judicial institutions. The Supreme Court of Cassation and Supreme Administrative Court
together have an allocation of 5 % of the judicial budget. The Supreme Judicial Council and the Inspectorate
under it together have an allocation of 4 % of the judicial budget. The National Institute of Justice has an
allocation of 1 % of the judicial budget. The budget expenditure follows the same trend.

22 is as follows:

   The investigators under the District Prosecutors’ offices can investigate any crimes that are assigned to them by the respective district
prosecutors, however, usually the more complex crimes go to them. The investigators at the National Investigative Service investigate, according
to the Judicial System Act, cases with special factual or legal complexity, crimes committed abroad, requests for legal assistance from foreign
countries, as well as other cases specified in law.

 77.      Table 22 shows a budget execution by the Supreme Judicial Council that has been consistently low
 each of the last three years. The SJC has been unable to spend almost 45-50 % of its budget. The SJC should
 carefully assess its capacity to spend as it prepares future budgets. The highest budget execution by
 percentage is that of the National Institute of Justice on a consistent basis. Therefore, the Institute also
 should more accurately assess its needs during its budget preparation. The execution of the judicial budget
 exceeded the amounts in the State Budget Act for all years with the exception of budget year 2009. The
 Council of Ministers ordinances dealing with the judiciary’s budget for the period 2008 – 2014 were
 examined to determine if the judiciary received supplemental funds. There were a number of decrees
 approved for 2013 and 2014 and only one decree approved in the three prior years. The National Audit
 Office confirmed that the additional judicial expenditures were authorized.

 79.     From Table 23, it may be noted that the budget was classified only into current and capital
 expenditures from 2012 onwards; the breakdown of current expenditures into salaries, social security,
 other remuneration and payments and expenses for maintenance was not included in the budget. This
 gave more flexibility to the judiciary to use its current budget allocation based on its specific needs each
 year. The distribution of judicial budget into current and capital expenditures has been as follows:

 80.     The Capital Budget has been significantly low. One of the reasons is that the Capital Budget
 requests submitted by the SJC are not approved in the Budget voted by the Parliament. This is described
 in Table 24.

81.      The table shows that a very small proportion of the capital budget requests of the judiciary are
included in the Budget Act. This leads to lack of resources for the judiciary in regard to modernization. Since
2007 the Ministry of Justice is responsible for the capital assets of the judiciary and these funds form part
of MOJ’s budget. Since 2009 the Judicial System Act specifies that this responsibilit y extends only to
immovable capital goods such as court buildings. The change appears to not have impacted SJC’s ability to
get more funds for movables, i.e. it continuously appears to get insufficient funds. The responsibility over
capital budget was moved to MOJ because the judiciary was not doing a very good job of managing it. The
main negative effect of separating the responsibility over movable and immovable properties has been
that currently the judiciary pays for ordinary repair and MOJ pays for capital repair. Therefore, there have
been arguments over how to characterize individual repair works, which has led to their postponement.

judicial expenditure by economic classification is presented below.

84.    Figure 5 shows that nearly 90% of expenditure is used to support the judiciary’s human resources
(63% for salaries, 18 % for Social Security and 9 % on other remuneration). This leaves only 8 % for
Maintenance and only 2 % for Capital Expenditure. This has been the general trend over several years.

86.     From Table 26, it is clear that budget execution been more than 100 % since 2010 and in six of the
past seven years. The average budget execution during 2008-2014 has been 106 %. The average budget
execution of current expenditure has been 106 % and that of capital expenditure has been 89 %. The
execution percentage for “other remuneration” was exceptionally high during 2010 and 2011. The
breakdown of budget execution for the current budget is not available for 2012-2014 as the budget itself
did not provide this detail.

87.    The execution of the Capital Budget in 2013 was 58 % while in 2014 it was 165 %. Both of these
were exceptional. The high capital budget execution in 2014 was due to the completion of building
construction in Sofia. Expenditure in excess of the originally approved budget is usually done with prior
approval of the Ministry of Finance, in the form of Supplementary Budgets.

88.     The Ministry of Justice has the responsibility for managing the property of the judiciary; the funds
for construction and complete refurbishment of real estate; and for property entailed obligations, i.e.
taxes, fees, rent16. The Table 27 shows the funding approved in the State Budget Act and actual
expenditures for judicial facilities.

     The funds for acquiring, using and managing ‘movables’ is made available under the budget of the judiciary.

89.     The general tendency to under-execute the capital budget demonstrates the complexities involved
in new space acquisition and major renovation projects. Most of the issues, if not all, are outside the control
of the MOJ.

90.      The SJC has a minimal capital budget of its own to be used for minor space maintenance and repair
projects. Some of these minor capital expenditure projects have resulted in disagreements with the MOJ
as to which monies should be used for the project. This is one of the reasons why the MOJ is considering
proposing that the SJC assume responsibility for all space acquisition, major renovation as well as the minor
maintenance and repair projects for which it is already responsible. The proposal for the SJC to manage
the buildings was part of the draft amendments to the Constitution of Republic of Bulgaria approved at
first reading in September 2015.

91.       Considering that salaries are a major component of Bulgaria’s judicial budget, a benchmarking with
other COE member states has been done as shown in ANNEX 4: Benchmarking of Salaries of Judiciary
with other CoE states. It is evident from Annex 4 that both gross wages of a Supreme Court judge and a
first instance judge in Bulgaria are lower than in most other CoE states. The only country paying a lower
wage than Bulgaria is Albania. However, the ratio of gross wages of a judge in comparison to the gross
average wage is one of the highest in Bulgaria, and is second only to Romania.

92.    The following provisions of the Judicial Systems Act provide for a minimum salary for magistrates
and judges:

        “Article 218 (1). The chairpersons of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme
        Administrative Court, the Prosecutor General and the Director of the National Investigation
        Service shall have a basic monthly remuneration equal to 90 percent of the remuneration of the
        chairperson of the Constitutional Court.



                                                       48
        (2) The basic monthly remuneration for the lowest judicial, prosecutorial or investigating
        magisterial position shall be set at the double amount of the average monthly salary of
        budget-funded employees, based on data of the National Institute of Statistics.
        (3) Remunerations for other positions at judicial system bodies shall be set by the Supreme
        Judicial Council.
        Article 219. On top of the basic monthly remuneration, judges, prosecutors and investigating
        magistrates shall be paid additional remuneration for extended work as a judge, prosecutor and
        an investigating magistrate at the amount of 2 percent for each year of service record, not to
        exceed 40 percent”.

93.     The salary of civil servants was enhanced in 2012, but there was no equivalent increase in the salary
of magistrates and judges. Accordingly, about 20 % of judges and magistrates are receiving less than the
salary prescribed under the above provisions of the Judicial Systems Act. This has led to hardships and
resentment among judges.


                                   Conclusions and Recommendations

94.     Performance of the Judiciary: The performance of judiciary in terms of case disposition has been
quite satisfactory. The clearance rate in Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7 years
and the disposition time has been less than 75 days for all years except 2008, both of which can be
considered good performance in comparison to other European countries.

95.      Judicial Staffing and Workloads: There are 2,225 approved judge positions, against which, 1,811
judges are working. The average actual caseload per judge per month at the national level is about 30.
There are several courts with very low caseloads. As a result, there is scope to redeploy surplus judges to
other courts with high caseloads. At the national level, however, there does not appear to be a need to
increase the total number of working Judges. As an initial step in the judicial restructuring process, the SJC
could consider reducing the number of approved judge positions to the number of currently filled positions
(1,811). Further restructuring, including possibly additional reductions in judicial positions, could then be
based on a more refined analysis of workloads and case complexity.

96.     Support Staff Levels: The ratio of staff to inhabitants in Bulgaria is 2.7, which is one of the highest
in Eastern European countries. However, staffing is not uniform across courts. The SJC should consider
reducing the ratio at the national level (thereby contributing to cost-savings) and uniformly distributing the
revised national ratio across courts (thereby improving efficiency).

97.     District and Regional Courts Workloads: There is scope for the judiciary to reorganize itself to
improve its efficiency and effectiveness based on an assessment of judicial workloads.17 There are presently
13 district courts where the caseload per judge is less than 10 cases per month. Similarly, there are 6
regional courts where the caseload is 20 or fewer cases per judge per month. Both of which are well below



17
  For this study the World Bank has only measured the number of cases per court and per judge and has not assessed
the complexity or the types of cases that are handled in different courts in Bulgaria. A deeper analysis of case
complexity could result in different conclusions.

                                                       49
the average for each type of case. It is likely that the number of judges in these courts can be reduced with
some judges freed to be redeployed to other courts where there are higher caseloads. Surplus judges in
district courts could be redeployed within regional courts located in the same district centers to avoid any
discomfort due to re-location18. In addition, regional courts with low caseloads could be consolidated with
other regional courts or they could be retained as territorial units of other, larger regional courts.
Considering that there are only about 4 judges in regional courts on average, redeployment of judges to
other courts may not be appropriate.

98.     Appellate Courts: There are 147 judges working in 6 appellate courts (including 1 Appellate Military
Court). On average, there are 25 judges per court who each hear only 8.4 cases per month and resolve only
7.1 cases per month. It may be difficult to justify this level of appellate court staffing given the existing
caseload. The SJC should consider consolidating the 6 appellate courts into 2 or 3 appellate courts and
redeploy surplus judges elsewhere, so that the average appellate caseload per judge is around 25 cases
per month – closer to the overall average of 30 cases per judge per month for all Bulgaria’s courts.

99.     Military Courts: There are 19 judges working in 4 military courts. The caseload per judge is only
2.4 cases per month. It is likely difficult to justify the existing number of military judges given the caseload.
One court with 2 judges could manage the existing caseload. The SJC should consider consolidating 4
military courts into a single military court to handle the existing caseload. Surplus judges could be
redeployed elsewhere, if needed. Alternatively, the SJC, MOJ and military leadership could consider
moving all military cases into the general courts and closing the military court system as suggested by the
MOJ.

100. Investigation Magistrates: the average caseload per Investigation Magistrate at the National
Investigative Service in 2013 was estimated to be 11.89 cases, of which 5.79 cases have been completed
and just 0.56 have ended with an opinion for bringing an indictment to court. This is very low workload and
even lower indictment rate. According to the Ministry of Justice, this caseload has declined further since
2013. The government should carefully examine the potential workload for these magistrates and decide
how many are required to do the job at hand. The surplus judges could be redeployed elsewhere.

101. Options for Surplus Judges: In view of the analysis and conclusions in this paper, a number of
judges may be determined to be surplus because the SJC may not be able to identify suitable places for
their redeployment. However, under Bulgarian law, judges cannot be removed from service except by way
of attrition. Hence, the government may want to consider options to allow these judges to retire or
redeploy within the government as alternative exit routes to changing the law.

102. Secondment of Judges: At present, there are about 114 judges seconded to other courts through
agreements between the court presidents. There are two major issues regarding the current
administration of the program: the appearance of favoritism in the assignment of judges to higher courts
with associated increase in wages and the possibility of court presidents influencing the decision of those
seconded judges who want to maintain their secondment assignment. To address these issues the SJC
should consider terminating the secondment program as it is currently administered by the court
presidents and assume direct responsibility itself for deciding the placement of seconded judges. The SJC’s



18
 It is acknowledged this could considered as demotion by some judges. Hence, the pay and title must be protected.
On the other hand, it may be possible for example to redeploy judges from other District Courts to Sofia City Court.

                                                        50
decisions should then be based on a careful and detailed analysis of workloads across Bulgaria’s courts and
the circumstances under which full-time vacancies have been generated from the termination of
magistrates on any of the grounds listed in Article 165 of the Judicial Systems Act, i.e., tendering of
resignation, disciplinary termination, etc. In the event of such circumstances, secondment of magistrates
may remain the most expedient manner of swift and effective resolution of workload issues.

103. Under-Funded Judicial Budget Request: Despite high judicial expenditures in relation to its per
capita GDP (based on comparison with EU and neighboring countries), Bulgaria has underfunded its
judiciary in relation to the SJC’s budget request and the statutory required minimum salaries for judges.
Ninety-eight percent of Bulgaria’s judicial budget is for current expenditure, the majority of which is for
salaries and other remuneration. However, current budget levels are insufficient to pay even the minimum
salary for magistrates prescribed under law. The capital budget is also not adequate to meet judicial needs
as only about 10-15 % of the judiciary’s capital budget requests are approved by the Parliament. The low
execution rate for the capital budget had been of a concern until 2013, but in 2014, the execution rate for
the Capital Budget reached 165 %.

104. Judicial Restructuring and Cost Savings: In light of the funding uncertainty faced by the judiciary
and the opportunities for restructuring the judicial system identified in this paper, it may be possible for
the SJC, MOJ and MOF to reach agreement on a medium term funding strategy for the judiciary. Such an
agreement could be based on a judicial restructuring plan that leads to a more efficient court system with
a more equitable distribution of workload (by redeploying judges, consolidating courts, and shrinking
judicial and staff positions as necessary) that can be fully funded (both current and capital expenditures)
without resort to annual debates over supplemental budget requests. Given the overall costs, it is
recommended that a proportion of any savings from judicial restructuring be used to finance increases in
salaries and higher capital expenditure.

105. Court Fee Structure: There is a scope for the judiciary to increase its own revenues by reforming
and raising filing fees. For a number of years, the SJC has submitted proposals to the Council of Ministers
seeking support to submit a revised court fee structure to Parliament for approval. The Council of Ministers
has not acted on the SJC proposal. A revision of the tariff is overdue and the SJC proposal should be
evaluated based on its impact on access to Bulgaria’s courts and on the court systems’ revenue raising
capacity. In the determination of the revised court fee structure, it would be necessary to strike a balance
between the need to boost own revenues in the judiciary budget and the right of access to justice for
citizens and legal entities.

106. Predictability of Government Subsidy: The judiciary has raised concerns that any economies
realized through reduced costs or increased income that it is able to achieve through judicial restructuring
would result in the reduction of the government’s subsidy to the judicial budget leaving overall
expenditures at their present insufficient level. These concerns have been aggravated by the latest State
Budget Act which for the first time provided that if the judiciary fails to reach the budgeted levels of its
own income, the state budget subsidy would not be raised to compensate any shortfall. It is noteworthy,
however, that in its Decision No 4/2015, the Constitutional Court declared this provision of the State
Budget Act to be contrary to the Constitution and would therefore not be implemented. The SJC would like
greater predictability in the resources they receive from the government budget so that they can undertake
necessary reorganization and restructuring of the courts and judiciary with confidence that they will have
access to sufficient resources to manage a restructured judicial system.



                                                    51
107. Preparing Medium-Term Budget as Per Plans of Judiciary: It is recommended that SJC prepare a
medium-term Action Plan based on the Justice Sector Reform Strategy approved by the Council of
Ministers in December 2014 and approved by National Assembly in January 2015. The Action Plan could
then be used to develop the judiciary’s medium term financial requirements. The medium term financing
plan could incorporate the minimum salary for judges and other judicial officials as prescribed under law.
It also is recommended that the judiciary’s full capital budget needs in reference to their modernization
plan are included in the financing plan. The medium term financing plan could account for any funding
expected to be received from the EU or other international organizations for judicial modernization. The
judiciary’s spending should be aligned to the performance of its functions. A realistic medium-term budget
forecast should be based on an analysis of the spending efficiency in the system and tied to plans for the
achievement of the goals defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy. It is also recommended that the Ministry
of Justice and Ministry of Finance review this medium term financing framework and have an open
discussion with the SJC in order to reach consensus on a stable funding plan.

108. One option that a number of Latin American countries have used to increase the predictability in
government funding to the judiciary is linking the government subsidy to the judicial budget to GDP. If all
the parties can agree on a formula for sufficient and consistent government subsidies to the judicial budget,
then this could help to build trust between the judiciary and the Government and motivate the former to
reform. However, this linkage does not appear to have any impact on judicial performance, including the
length of court processes.19 In addition, earmarks make the budget allocation process more rigid. They
undermine allocative efficiency by preventing the government from moving resources to meet changing
needs; they may reduce technical efficiency by undermining managerial incentives; and there is a risk of
such earmarks proliferating.

109. Decentralization of Expenditure Decisions: Presently courts must receive prior authorization from
the SJC for every expenditure that they make from the budget, while every fee that a court receives is
transferred to the SJC. Court presidents cannot retain any funds or take any expenditure decisions on their
own. The SJC could consider allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees that their
courts collect. Considering that some courts collect fees to a significantly lesser extent in comparison to
their maintenance requirements, SJC could use the pool of fees collected to address the needs of resource-
deficient courts. The objective of this recommendation is to empower courts to use a portion of their
collected fees for the maintenance and development of their respective courts. The SJC could match this
decentralization of authority with specific rules defining the object and method by which court presidents
could use those funds and providing procedures for holding court presidents more accountable for the use
of these retained funds. Also, a results agreement could be signed between the SJC and court presidents
at the beginning of the year and the latter made accountable for results.

Bulgaria is dedicating almost 26 euros per capita for the operation of the judiciary compared to over an
average of over 50 euros per capita for all EU Member States. Of the new Member States Hungary, Poland,
Slovakia and Slovenia are spending more per capita than Bulgaria. The rest of the former Eastern European
countries in the EU are spending similar amounts as Bulgaria on their judicial system.

It is evident from Table that both gross wages of a Supreme Court judge and a first instance judge in Bulgaria
are lower than most of other EU member states. The only country paying a lower wage to its judges than
Bulgaria is Albania. However, the ratio of gross wages of a judge in comparison to the gross average wage
is one of the highest in Bulgaria and it is second only to Romania. So relative to local Bulgarian workers,
Bulgarian judges are well paid.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Guinea-Bissau perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Guinea-Bissau;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Guinea-Bissau;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Guinea-Bissau;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Guinea-Bissau.
       Use data to help inform Guinea-Bissau country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In May-June 2014, 279 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Guinea-Bissau were invited to
provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 183 stakeholders participated in the survey (66% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Guinea-Bissau; their overall attitudes toward the World
Bank Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Guinea-Bissau; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing in Guinea-Bissau.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Guinea-Bissau: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Guinea-
   Bissau is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Guinea-Bissau, and how “shared prosperity? would be
   best achieved in Guinea-Bissau.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Guinea-Bissau, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Guinea-Bissau solve its development challenges, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest
   values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Guinea-
   Bissau, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral
   areas the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to
   what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Guinea-Bissau, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Guinea-Bissau’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty-five development areas, such
   as economic growth, private sector development, education, health, agriculture and rural
   development.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Guinea-Bissau: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Guinea-Bissau, which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country, and which development areas would
   benefit most from WBG playing a leading role as compared to other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, and their exposure to
   the WBG in Guinea-Bissau.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 211 respondents (73% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2011. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from the office of a minister were
        combined with respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister; respondents
        from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs
        were combined with employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
        agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those
        from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs, community based
        organizations, private foundations, trade unions, and faith-based groups were combined
        into the “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian,
        local governments, independent government institutions, bilateral and multilateral
        agencies, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other? category.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Guinea-Bissau,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-five
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Guinea-Bissau. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at food security; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Guinea-Bissau, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

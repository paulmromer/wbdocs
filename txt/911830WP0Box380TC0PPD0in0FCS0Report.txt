iv   Public-Private Dialogue in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations: Experiences and Lessons Learned
Introduction


Public-private dialogue (PPD) is highly necessary in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS)1 to fill the gap resulting
from the lack of legitimate institutions, to help create transparency and trust among stakeholders, and to identify the
need for reforms and interventions that can improve the business environment and attract investment. Moreover,
creating a platform for PPD can provide a useful starting point for private sector development in FCS for projects in key
sectors, such as agribusiness and extractives, where PPD can help build links between large-scale investments and the
local economy.

To support PPD projects in FCS, the World Bank Group has conducted a survey of 27 Task Team Leaders and other
program staff members with experiences from 30 FCS countries. The survey was followed by in-depth interviews with
13 key staff members who have experience from selected countries. By conducting in-depth interviews, the Bank Group
aimed to capture important experiences and lessons learned, including a description of challenges, useful tools and
methods, and do’s and don’ts.




	 FCS are countries and economies that (a) have a harmonized average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating of 3.2 or less (or no
1

  CPIA rating) or (b) have had a United Nations or regional peacekeeping or peace-building mission during the past three years or (c) meet both those
  criteria. The 50 countries and economies classified as FCS for at least one year in the period 2005–12 are Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic
  of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Eritrea, The Gambia, Georgia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iraq, Kiribati, Kosovo, the Lao People’s Democratic
  Republic, Liberia, Libya, the Marshall Islands, Mauritania, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria,
  Papua New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, the Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan,
  Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, West Bank and Gaza, Western Sahara, the Republic of Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

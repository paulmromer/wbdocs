                             I	Introduction
                             Over the past two and a half decades,               For example, in the most recent PISA
                             Thailand has made great progress in                 reading assessment (in 2012), one-third

                             economic groups, and putting more                   information or identify the main messages
                             focus on the quality of education.                  in a text –they were “functionally illiterate,”
                             Participation in primary education is nearly        lacking critical skills for skilled jobs
                             universal, and secondary school enrolment           (Figure 1). In contrast, the average score
                             has risen impressively. Inequality between          for students in lower-income Vietnam was
                             socio-economic groups in their ability to           66 points higher than the average score for

                             decentralizing education administration,            Functional illiteracy can be seen across

                             personnel, and laying the foundation for            education. Schools in cities, towns, and
                             more creative student-centered teaching             villages all produce students who are not

                             Building on this progress, it appears that          where 47 percent of their 15-year-old

1	   Using the OBEC definition, a small school is a school with less than 120 students enrolled. However, this standard definition
     could be inappropriate in some contexts. For example, should a school that teaches grades 1 to 4 with 25 students per
     grade (100 students in total) be considered “smaller” than a school that teaches grades 1 to 9 with 15 students per grade
     (135 students in total)? The key is to use a measure that is comparable across schools. In the following section of this

  3	      The PISA is an international survey that aims to evaluate education systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge
          of 15-year-old students. The tests are designed to assess the extent to which students can apply their knowledge to real-life
          situations and be prepared for full participation in society. To date, students from more than 70 countries have participated in
          the assessment, which is conducted every three years (see www.oecd.org/pisa/ for more details).

     influence over personnel management. This issue is discussed further in Chapter 3.

     slowly. As of academic year 2013, 1,730 educational institutions (out of 38,010 public and private schools) were under local

     Figure 2.3, data from Thai Labor Force Surveys was used to estimate the average monthly wages (including overtime
  and bonuses) for basic education teachers as well as for non-teaching professionals who had attained bachelor’s degree
  qualification at the time of the surveys. Estimates of monthly wages were made at seven different levels of work experience
  across three different points in time (1988, 1998, and 2013).
12	Theobservable student characteristics used in the analysis include gender, grade level, and the PISA index of economic,
  social, and cultural status (ESCS). The ESCS index was derived from the following three indices: highest occupational status
  of parents, highest education level of parents, and home possessions. The index of home possessions comprises all items
  on the indices of family wealth, cultural possessions, home educational resources, as well as books in the home.

                          grade (100 students in total) be considered “smaller” than a school that teaches Grades 1 to 9 with 15 students per grade
                          (135 students in total)? The key is to use a measure that is comparable across schools. In the analysis presented in Chapter
                          4, a small school is defined as a school with 20 students or less per grade on average.

                                1999 and 2002. The report card contained school data on test-based performance for 4th and 8th
                                graders and parent opinions about their children’s school. It also included student flow data
                                (promotion, retention, and dropout rates), school characteristics (e.g., average class size, share
                                of teachers with college degrees) from the annual school census, student information (e.g., family
                                socioeconomic status) from questionnaires attached to statewide achievement tests, and
                                principals’ statement about their management style. Whenever possible, comparative municipal
                                and state averages of key indicators were provided so parents and teachers could compare the
                                performance of their school with that of neighboring schools. Schools were also reported to be
                                performing at, below, or above their expected performance, controlling for the socio-economic
                                background of the students.

                                The three-page summary of indicators was disseminated to parents and teachers through various
                                local-level workshops, and results were published in the state education secretariat’s monthly
                                newsletter and widely disseminated through press releases and press conferences. While no

                                school performance and, through school councils, increased their voice in policy debates
                                about education.

     Mexico’s school-based management (SBM) programs grew out of a concern for equity and for                     increase parental
     poor, rural, and heavily indigenous schools, which led to a large-scale compensatory education               participation
     program. That program included a small-scale parental participation program, the Support to
     School Management (or AGE), introduced in 1996. AGE consists of monetary support and training
     to parent associations. The parent associations can spend the money for the purpose of their
     choosing, although spending is limited to small civil works and infrastructure improvements. They
     are not allowed to spend money on wages and salaries for teachers. Despite being a limited
     version of SBM, the AGEs represent a significant advance in the Mexican education system, where
     parent associations have tended to play a minor role in school decision-making. The AGE financial
     support consists of quarterly transfers to APF school accounts, varying from USD 500 to USD 700
     per year according to the size of the school.

     AGE helps generate significantly higher levels of school participation and communication – both
     among parents, and with teachers and school principals – because of the projects that parent
     associations undertake, but more so because of the training they receive and the meetings they
     undertake. The AGE helps articulate expectations and promotes social participation. Many parents
     believe that the AGEs put pressure on school principals and teachers to help their children. AGE
     also motivates parents to follow their children’s progress. Rigorous impact evaluations have shown
     that AGE improves parental participation and improves the school climate (Gertler et al., 2008). It
     has also been shown that AGE leads to improvements in schooling outcomes such as reduced
     grade repetition and failure, and better test scores (Shapiro and Moreno, 2004; Lopez-Calva and
     Espinosa, 2006).

     Mexico’s successful experience with SBM in rural areas led to the creation of an urban, now
     nationwide, more advanced program known as the Quality Schools Program (PEC) in 2001 with the
     goal of expanding autonomy and improving learning in Mexican schools. Participation in PEC
     entails the following: preparation of a plan by staff and parents of a school that outlines steps for
     improvement; five-year grants to schools to implement the activities; parental participation in
     designing and implementing plans; and training of school principals. Several qualitative evaluations
     find positive effects on test scores, with the largest gains in schools that had the poorest students,
     and a positive impact on school climate and processes (Loera 2005). PEC also leads to higher
     accountability and transparency levels (Patrinos and Kagia, 2007). After only a few years of
     implementation, participation in PEC significantly decreases dropout rates, failure rates, and
     repetition rates (Skoufias and Shapiro, 2006).

31	Recallthat the previous chapters utilized OBEC’s definition for a small school, which refers to a school with less than
  120 students enrolled. As mentioned earlier, this standard definition can be problematic in certain contexts as it does not
  allow direct comparisons to be made between schools that offer different numbers of grade levels. This chapter therefore
  uses a measure that is comparable across schools: a small school is defined here as a school with 20 students or less per
  grade on average.

32	Thechallenges faced due to dwindling student numbers in Eastern European countries is well-documented in World Bank
  public expenditure reviews, see for example World Bank (1998): “Romania Public Expenditure Review,” World Bank (2012):
  “Bulgaria: Public Expenditure for Growth and Competitiveness,” and World Bank (2013): “Serbia: Municipal Finance and
  Expenditure Review.”
33	An accompanying study to this report (“Grouping Thailand’s Schools into Four Categories”) was conducted by the Thailand
  Development Research Institute Foundation (TDRI) under the guidance and contract with the World Bank Group. The school
  grouping exercise classified OBEC schools into four distinct categories: 1) isolated small schools, 2) isolated large schools,
  3) non-isolated small schools, and 4) non-isolated large schools. “Small schools” were defined as those with 20 students or
  less per grade.
34	These   numbers exclude 137 schools with no students in 2010.
35	AnnexA4 presents empirical evidence that staffing classrooms in poor schools with adequate numbers of good-quality
  teachers could have a large impact on student learning.
36	Aschool is defined as isolated if there is no school of a similar type (meaning some/all grade levels taught at the schools
  overlap) located within 20 minutes from it or if the sub-district where the school is situated is more than 500 meters above
  sea level.

China’s rural primary
                              During the late 1990s and early 2000s, China embarked on an ambitious primary school merger
school merger program
                              program in an effort to improve the overall quality of education and address rural-urban disparities.
                              Students in small rural village schools were transferred to new and larger centralized schools in
                              towns and county seats, and the number of primary schools in rural China fell by 24 percent from
                              2001 to 2005.

                              Taking advantage of scale economies, these new schools were equipped with better facilities and
                              higher-quality teachers. Unlike in the small rural schools, teachers in these new larger schools were
                              able to focus on a single grade (and in many cases, on a single course). Furthermore, while the
                              curriculum in small rural schools was often restricted to math and Chinese language due to teacher
                              shortages, the new central schools were able to offer a much richer curriculum. The merger
                              program also entailed building boarding facilities since these new schools were often located far
                              from students’ homes. These youngsters were encouraged or sometimes required to leave the
                              comfort of their homes and care of their parents to board at schools during the week.

                              Mo et al. (2012) conducted an impact evaluation in one of the poorest counties in Shanxi province,
                              which is also one of the poorest in China. The study evaluated all 7th graders in all ten junior high
                              schools in the county at the beginning of the 2009 academic year. It found that transferring from
                              small village primary schools to more centralized town and county schools had large positive and
                              statistically significant impacts on standardized math test results.40 However, the study also found
                              significant negative effects when students stayed in boarding schools. Nevertheless, in comparing
                              the transfer effect with the boarding effect, the study found that even if students boarded after
                              transfer, they still benefited academically from transferring to new and better-resourced schools.
                              The study suggests that extra attention be given to attenuating the negative boarding school effect
                              so students might be able to take more advantage of the additional resources made available by
                              the program.41

     Compared to other merger/networking models in Thailand, the Kangjan networking model is                                     of school networking
     relatively well-documented. Tables B4.1 and B4.2 compare school conditions before and after the
     networking in terms of number of students, classes, and teachers in each school; number of
     students who had to travel to other schools after the intervention; and average O-NET scores
     by subject. The networking started in 2011 with four schools in ESA 1 in Loei province. The four
     schools, which are located within 10 kilometers of each other, are (1) Bann Namo, (2) Bann Pak
     Mung Hauy Tab Chang (Pak Mung), (3) Bann Hat Kampee, and (4) Bann Cokwao. Prior to 2011, all
     four schools taught pre-primary 1 to primary 6.

     With the same total number of teachers and students as before, the school networking organized
     classes much more efficiently. Prior to the establishment of the network, each school had three
     teachers (excluding the principal) and taught eight classes, so they were critically short of teachers.
     After the networking intervention, the number of classrooms in each school was reduced to two so
     each class/grade had 1.5 teachers on average. Table B4.1 also shows that 180 out of 247 students
     needed to move to other schools after the networking.

43	“Atleast” because the estimate has not taken into account the required incentives (such as salary increases) needed to
  attract teachers and other education personnel to rural schools.
44	This
      is estimated using an educational cost function-based per-student funding formula (see Box A5.1 in Annex 5) which
  takes into account differences in student performance, school and class sizes, and the school student-body characteristics
  (poor students, students with disability, etc.). For example, students in small remote schools are poorer and less-prepared
  academically, so it will take more resources to bring those schools to Bangkok-level learning standards.
45	Only the salary portion of the per-student subsidy was calculated since the non-salary portion does not vary with teacher
  quality or the intensity of staffing (see Section A5.2 in Technical Appendix to Annex 5 for details of the non-salary items).
46	Aninput-based approach was employed to approximate the increase in the average salary per student amount. Specifically,
  we used the teacher salary regression equation (Table A5.2 in Technical Appendix to Annex 5) to estimate the change in the
  provincial average salary per student if schools in the other provinces were to have the same proportion of teachers with
  higher than bachelor’s degree qualification, teachers with the same average experience, and classrooms staffed with the
  same number of teachers as the average school in Bangkok.

  evidence-based education reform proposals which have potential to scale-up into a national education reform policy in
  the near future. For instance, the National Education Accounts (NEA), the Area-based education reform programs and the
  School-based information system for education decentralisation. As of June 2015, a drafted QLF law is waiting for the
  cabinet consideration to be passed by the National Assembly.

A2.1. Decomposing the Change in the PISA Test Score Over Time
Theoretical Framework

The focus of this part of the study is on analyzing changes in the PISA test score distribution between
two points in time, dated  = 0,1. The method used here is essentially the first stage of the two-stage
decomposition procedure proposed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2007) – FFL 2007 from hereon.
Assume that the test score function1 depends on some observed and unobserved attributes ( ,  ) of
individual student  indexed by  ∈ {1, … }, where  = 0 + 1 is the total number of the combined
observations for both time periods,  ∈  ⊂ ℝ , and  ∈ ℝ. The test score function can thus be
expressed as:

                   =  ( ,  ) for  = 0,1 and  = 1, … ,                                 (1)

        Define the observed test score for student  as  = 1  + 0 (1 −  ), where  = 1 if the
outcome variable  is observed in time period 1, and  = 0 otherwise. If we view  as a treatment
indicator, we can only observe 0 | = 0 for untreated units, and 1 | = 1 for treated units, but

decompose. The “overall change” in  , ∆ , from date 0 to 1 is divided into the “school quality

 ⊥  | =  for all  ∈ . Assumption (ii) is called the “overlapping support” assumption.
Together, these two assumptions are called the “strongly ignorable treatment assignment”

1 In this study, the test score function is viewed as the “Quality” or effectiveness if the Thai education system in
transforming its student characteristics (both observed and unobserved) into learning outcome.
        To divide the overall change in test score over time into the school quality and student
characteristic effects, we employ a reweighting procedure proposed by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux
(1996) – DFL (1996) from hereon. Specifically, the test score distribution functions for each time
period is non-parametrically identified from observed data, and their empirical distribution
counterparts based on a random sample {1 , … ,  } of size  are given by:
                               1
                  ̂
                   ()
                            =  ∑∈ 1( ≤ ), for  = 0,1                                      (3)
                                


where  = {:  = } is the index set for observations at time  and 1(∙) is an indicator function
                                                                                 ()
equal to unity if the expression in the parentheses is true. Note also that         can be written as:

                     ()                          ()
                        = ∫ | (|)                                                   (4)
                                            ()
where  ⊂ ℝ is the support of  and        is the conditional distribution of | = . Assuming
the “strongly ignorable treatment assignment” assumptions discussed above and using equation (4),
the counterfactual distribution function is well-defined and can be constructed as follows:

                     ()          0                1 ()
                        = ∫ | (|)

                                    0                        1 ()
                                                                0 ()
                           = ∫ | (|)         
                                                0 ()      


                                    0                         0 ()
                           = ∫ | (|) ()                                           (5)


where  () is the reweighting function. Applying Bayes’ rule to the function in the same fashion
as DFL (1996), the “inverse probability weighting function” or IPW is expressed as (Theorem 1 in
FFL (2007)):
                                               (=0)
                               Pr(=1|=)Pr⁡                           ()   1−
                  () = Pr(=0|=)Pr⁡(=1) = (1−()) (                        )              (6)
                                                                                     

where () = Pr( = 1| = ) is the propensity score and can be estimated using a flexible logit
                       ( = 1). The empirical IPW is normalized to sum to unity for convenience:
regression, and  = Pr⁡
                                        ̂  ( )
                                        
                 ̂ ( ) = ∑
                                          ̂           ,   for  ∈ 0                                  (7)
                                     ∈  ( )
                                         0


        The empirical counterfactual test score distribution is thus given by:

                  ̂
                   ()
                                      ̂ ( )1( ≤ )
                            = ∑∈0                                                                   (8)

                                                                                               ̂
           Equations (3) and (8) allow us to estimate the sample quantiles of interest;  ( 0           ̂
                                                                                                   ),  ( 1
                                                                                                                 ),
            ̂                                                                  
and  ( ), which can be used to compute the estimated school quality, ∆ , and student effects,
                                                                                   

 
∆ , as per equation (2).
         Notice that the methodology discussed in this section is effectively a generalization of the
classical Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to any marginal quantile of interest. Therefore, if we apply
the empirical IPW technique to estimate the means of the various distributions, then the resulting
decomposition would be equivalent to that obtained using the classical method.

Decomposing the Change in PISA Reading Score from 2003 to 2012

        The estimation results from the (flexible) logit regression model are presented in Table A2.1
at the end of this section. The dependent variable is the indicator function which is equal to unity if a
student is observed in year 2012 and zero otherwise, while the observable student characteristics (the
right hand side variables) used in the analysis include gender, grade level, and the PISA index of
economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS). Using the regression coefficients, we are able to estimate
the propensity scores and compute the normalized empirical IPW for each individual observation as
per equation (7).

        First, we demonstrate the IPW technique by applying it to the mean of the test score
distribution for 15 year-old Thai students. Specifically, the counterfactual mean test score is computed
as follows:

                 ̅  = ∑∈
                                 ̂ ( )
                                   
                              2003


         This equation is analogous to equation (8) and represents the average test score that would
have prevailed under the test score function of year 2003 but with the observed and unobserved
student attributes ( ,  ) jointly distributed as in 2012 (sampling weights are also used in the analysis,
but are omitted here to simplify notation). The mean test score for each time period is simply           ̅  =
1/ ⁡∑∈  , for  = 2003,2012.

       Analogous to equation (2), the overall change in the average PISA reading scores for Thai
students from 2003 to 2012 can be decomposed into the portion attributable to changes in the
background characteristics of the student population and the remaining “unexplained” portion, which
we interpret as representing improvements over time in the “quality” or effectiveness of the Thai
education system in transforming student characteristics into learning outcomes. Specifically,
                 ̅      ̅     ̅    ̅ 1 ̅      ̅  ̅ 0
                ∆        
                  = ∆ + ∆ = ( −  ) + ( −  )                                       (9)

        The decomposition results for Thai students on the whole are shown on the left-most bar in
Figure 2.11 in Chapter 2, which is reproduced here for ease of exposition. It is estimated that
improvements in the observable characteristics of the student population accounted for 6 points of
the 21.8-point increase in the overall PISA reading scores for Thailand from 2003 to 2012. This means
that the remaining 15.8-point increase can be attributed to an apparent improvement in educational
“quality.”

         The decomposition analysis can also be carried out for subgroups of the Thai student
population. Figure 2.11 presents the decomposition results for students attending schools in five
distinct locations of the country: villages, small towns, towns, cities, and large cities (see Table A2.2
for the total number of 15-year-old students attending schools by location as well as their average
reading test scores in each year). The disaggregated analysis is simply done by applying equation (9) to
the student population subgroup of interest.

          Much richer analysis can be done if we look beyond the effects at the means. As mentioned
earlier, the FFL (2007) decomposition framework allows us to generalize the classical Oaxaca-Blinder
decomposition to any marginal quantile of interest. We apply the reweighting procedure to analyze
changes at different quantiles of the test score distribution. The resulting distributions of PISA
Reading Scores in 2003, 2012, and the counterfactual distributions (produced using equations (4) and
(5)) for Thailand and for subgroups of the student population in five different areas are shown in
Figure A2.1. Also drawn on each chart in the Figure is a vertical line at the PISA reading score of 407,
which is defined as the threshold level of functional literacy.

        The decomposition of the overall changes in the test score from 2003 to 2012 into the quality
and the student effects across quantiles of the test score distribution are shown graphically in Figure
2.9 in Chapter 2. Notice that for ease of exposition, we have included only the “Overall effect” and
the “Quality effect” line graphs in these charts. From equation (2), we can easily see that the gaps
between these two line graphs necessarily represent the effects on test scores of changes in the
observed student characteristics over time.

Annex A4: What is the evidence that organizing learning with better teachers will improve
learning?

This annex presents the empirical evidence that staffing classrooms in poor schools with
adequate number of good quality teachers will have a large impact on student learning. Our
empirical analysis in this annex employs the concept of an Educational Production Function where it
is conceptualized that schools employ some production technology to combine various inputs into
producing student learning.2 Using this framework, we estimate the causal relationships between
school-average student achievement3 and key measures of school quality, namely, the proportion of
teachers with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification, the teacher workforce average years of
teaching experience, the “unobserved teacher quality index”,4 and the average number of teachers per
classroom. Due to data limitations, however, we will not be able to evaluate the impacts of material
educational resources and physical infrastructure on student learning.5

Since the focus of this annex is to evaluate potential interventions that are needed to close the
school performance gap, we will be estimating the effects of these school quality variables on
the entire distribution of school-level student performance outcome. An estimation method that
“goes beyond the mean” will have to be employed for this particular purpose. In this study, we use
the “Unconditional Quantile Regression” (UQR) method introduced by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux
(2009) to estimate the causal impacts of the key measures of school quality on student achievement at
different performance quantiles. Issues relating to the estimation of the educational production
function model using the UQR technique is described in Technical Appendix to Annex A4, where
detailed discussions of the results are also provided. The rest of this annex highlights the key findings.

All four measures of school quality show positive and statistically significant effects on
student performance. Our analysis begins with analyzing the effects of measured school quality
variables on average student performance outcome at the school level. In particular, it is found that
1) an increase in the unobserved teacher quality index of one standard deviation is associated with an
increase of 0.9 percent in student performance, 2) a 10 percentage point increase in the share of
teachers with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification is expected to raise student performance by
0.27 percent, 3) an increase of 10 years in the average experience of the teacher workforce is estimated
to improve student performance outcome by 1 percent, and 4) allocating one more teacher for each
classroom is expected to raise performance by as much as 2.6 percent, holding other factors constant.

Gains in student learning from having better quality teachers are found to be much larger for
low-performing schools. The estimated causal effects of the three measured teacher quality variables
show greater impacts on student achievement for schools ranked at the lower end of the performance

2 The empirical study in this chapter uses a 2010 cross-sectional school data collected by the Office of the Basic Education
Commission (OBEC), the Ministry of Education in Thailand (see Annex section A4.3).
3 Student achievement is measured by the Student Performance Index, which is a weighted index of mathematics and

science scores in the 2010 Ordinary National Education Test (O-NET) exams for Grades 6, 9, and 12. The index is
constructed as explained in detail in Section A5.3 in Technical Appendix to Annex A5.
4 As described in the Annex section A4.3, the “unobserved teacher quality index” approximately captures variations arising

from the discretionary wage component (such as performance pay), the average academic ranking of the teacher workforce,
and other school average teacher characteristics unobserved by the researcher.
5 Nevertheless, all is not lost as a rich body of research shows that effective teachers are the most important factor

contributing to student learning (see for example Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005), Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (1998),
and Nye, Konstantopoulos, and Hedges (2004)).
distribution. The three graphs in Figure A4.2 (reproduced from Technical Appendix to Annex A4)
show the estimated marginal effects of the three teacher quality variables on the entire distribution of
schools, ranked in accordance with their student performance outcome. The dotted lines in the graphs
represent the 95 percent confidence band for the estimated effects. Consider low-performing schools
that are ranked at the 10th percentile of the performance distribution. The study finds that 1) an
increase in the unobserved teacher quality index of one standard deviation is expected to raise student
performance by 1.14 percent (Figure A4.2a), 2) a 10 percentage point increase in the share of teachers
with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification is expected to increase student performance by 0.48
percent (Figure A4.2b), and 3) an increase of 10 years in the average experience of the teacher
workforce is estimated to improve student performance outcome by 2.6 percent (Figure A4.2c). The
estimated marginal effects of the teacher quality variables on schools ranked at the 10 th percentile are
therefore much larger than the estimated effects for the average school discussed in the previous
paragraph. The marginal effects on other percentiles can analyzed analogously.

The study also finds the greatest positive impacts on student learning for the lowest-
performing schools from easing severe teacher shortages in their classrooms. Turning now to
our measure of the adequacy of teacher quantity, we can see from Figure A4.3 that allocating one
more teacher to each classroom is expected to raise performance for schools at the 2 nd percentile of
the performance distribution by as much as 15.8 percent. The effects are estimated to fall to within a
range of 4.8-6.5 percent for schools ranked between the 6th and the 20th percentiles before falling off
gradually thereafter. The large and positive effects for schools at the bottom end of the performance
distribution should not come as a surprise, considering the fact that teacher shortages are very critical
for these schools (see Technical Appendix to Annex A4 for more detailed discussion). The results
shown in Figure A4.3 alone are strong evidence that staffing shortages in Thai classrooms are
adversely affecting student learning, especially in small schools that primarily serve socioeconomically
disadvantaged students.

The results from our empirical study in this annex show that eliminating teacher shortages,
both in terms of quality and quantity, would result in significant improvements in student
achievement and the impacts would be greatest for lower-performing schools. The analyses of
the effects of measured teacher quality and the number of teachers per classroom unambiguously
suggest that allocating more and better teachers to small and low-performing schools would result in
significant improvements in student learning. In light of these findings, we conclude that improving
the quality of teachers and addressing the severe teacher shortages, especially for the vast number of
small rural schools, should be at the center of Thailand’s reform initiatives if the country is serious
about tackling the widespread low quality education and the high disparity in educational achievements
across socioeconomic groups.


Technical Appendix to Annex A4
A4.1. Using School Level Educational Production Function to Determine the Effects of
Measured Teacher and School Characteristics on Student Performance
Our empirical analysis in Annex A4 uses school level data (see Annex A4.3) to estimate the educational
production function for schools under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Basic Education
Commission (OBEC). Specifically, we conceptualize schools as employing some production
technology to combine various inputs into producing student learning. This analytical framework is
particularly useful in helping us determine the relationships between measured teacher and school
characteristics with student achievement, as indicated by the Student Performance Index in the 2010
O-NET exams.

         Complications arise in the model estimation stage, however. Due to data limitations, we do
not observe all potentially important family background characteristics of the student body that
capture the quality of early education the students received or the home environments that are
conducive to learning. These background characteristics are crucial in determining a child’s cognitive
ability. Furthermore, it is conceivable that these relevant family factors are related to both student
achievement and the selection of schools and teachers by the parents.6 In other words, the omitted
family background characteristics of the student body are confounding our estimates of the school
and teacher effects on student achievement.

        To mitigate the problem, this study statistically controls for some of this confounding by
including as covariates the available variables that capture the socioeconomic status of the student
body.7 Furthermore, a particularly important covariate to include in the model is student achievement
in the previous school year. We argue that prior student achievement can be seen as summarizing the
effects of the remaining confounding socioeconomic factors. Including the variable as a covariate
therefore permits a comparison of student performance across schools.

        In our empirical investigation of the educational production function, we are especially
interested in the effects of three measures of teacher quality on student achievement. These are; the
proportion of teachers with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification, the teachers’ average years of
teaching experience, and the “unobserved teacher quality index”.8 Furthermore, to assess the school
effect on student performance, we have decided to include as a covariate the average number of
teachers per classroom instead of a more conventional average class size variable. From Table A3.1 in
Annex A3, we can see that most small rural schools in Thailand have very small average class sizes.
However, instead of reflecting provision of high quality education, the small average classes actually
reflects the severity of teacher shortages in small schools. Hence, the number of teachers per
classroom variable is a more appropriate variable to include in our model.

        Finally, recall that the primary focus of this Annex is to evaluate interventions that are needed
to close the performance gap between schools. Since our underlying question of policy interest
concerns the entire distribution of student performance across schools, estimation methods that “g o
beyond the mean” have to be employed. In this study, we use the “Unconditional Quantile
Regression” method introduced by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) to estimate the impact of
changes in the covariates on the unconditional quantiles of the outcome variable (school
performance). The method is briefly described in section A4.2 in this Annex.

What do the empirical evidences tell us?

        Before we go on to analyze the estimation results from the educational production function
model, let us first consider simple relationship between enrolment size and student performance. The
left-hand graph in Figure A4.1 presents a scatter plot of school enrolment size against the percentile
ranking of the school student performance index in 2010. While we can see that many small schools
managed to score highly in terms of student achievement, it cannot be denied that the majority of
low-performing schools are small schools. Furthermore, the right-hand graph in the same figure shows
a scatter plot of the average number of teachers per classroom against enrolment size. Three features
of the graph are particularly intriguing. First, teacher shortage is clearly relatively more severe for

6 For example, highly educated parents are more likely to have prepared their children better since birth to be school ready
and to have chosen neighbourhoods with schools that are well-resourced and have high quality teachers.
7 In fact, from Table A4.3 in this section we can see that we have available to us only two variables that could potentially

capture the socioeconomic status of the school student body. These are: 1) the share of students that are poor and 2) the
distance from the school to the nearest city.
8 As described in the Annex A4.3, the “unobserved teacher quality index” approximately captures variations arising from

the discretionary wage component (such as performance pay), the average academic ranking of the teacher workforce, and
other school average teacher characteristics unobserved by the researcher.
                 smaller schools. Second, many small schools are seen to be staffed with relatively high number of
                 teachers per classroom. Third, a lot of the schools that are not classified as “small” by OBEC
                 definition (having 120 enrolled students or less) also face serious teacher shortage problem. Notice
                 that it is the variations in key variables such as these that enable us to estimate the effects of measured
                 teacher and school characteristics on student performance.

                         The functional form for the educational production function used in this study can be seen
                 from Table A4.2 in this section. Also reported in the Table are the coefficient estimates from the
                 unconditional quantile regression model (UQR) for some selected quantiles of the school performance
                 distribution, as well as the coefficient estimates obtained using conventional ordinary least squares
                 (OLS) regression.

                         Let us first analyze the estimation results from the OLS regression model which is reported in
                 the final column of Table A4.2. All of the coefficients can be seen to have the expected signs and are
                 mostly significant at conventional statistical levels. However, since two of the four variables of interest
                 enter the model in quadratic form, they are not straight forward to interpret. Therefore, to ease
                 exposition, we also report in Table A4.1 the estimated average marginal effects of the four measured
                 teacher and school characteristics on (log) student performance.

                         The final column of Table A4.1 shows that an increase in the unobserved teacher quality index
                 of one standard deviation is associated with an increase of 0.9 percent in the student performance
                 index for an average school, ceteris paribus. Similarly, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of
                 teachers with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification is expected to raise student performance by
                 0.27 percent. An increase of 10 years in the average experience of the teacher workforce is estimated
                 to improve student performance outcome by 1 percent. Lastly, we find that allocating one more
                 teacher for each classroom is expected to raise performance by as much as 2.6 percent, holding other
                 factors constant. Notice that the estimated marginal effects are all statistically significant at the 1
                 percent significance level.

         While OLS can be used to estimate the partial effects of the covariates on the performance
outcome for an average school, the narrow focus on the mean outcome obscures the effects of the
teacher and school characteristics on other important features of the school performance distribution
that are of policy relevance. Much richer analysis can be carried out using UQR as is illustrated in the
first five columns of Table A4.1, where the estimated marginal effects of the key variables on school
performance are presented for schools ranked at the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th performance
percentiles.

         Alternatively, the UQR marginal effects can be presented graphically as shown in Figure A4.2
for the three variables on measured teacher quality, and in Figure A4.3 for the number of teachers per
classroom variable (see Figure A4.4 in this Annex for all the graphs of the UQR coefficient estimates).
Figure A4.2a shows the estimated marginal effects of the unobserved teacher quality index on the
entire distribution of schools, ranked in accordance with their student performance outcome index in
2010. The dotted lines in the graph represent the 95 percent confidence band for the estimated effects.
Immediately apparent are the larger effects of a one standard deviation increase in the unobserved
teacher quality index on student performance for schools ranked towards the lower end of the
performance distribution.

        Similarly, we can see from Figure A4.2b that the effects on student performance from
increasing the share of teachers with higher than bachelor’s degree qualification are largest for schools
that performed below the median in the performance distribution. For schools that are ranked higher
than the 82nd percentile, the effects of increasing the share of highly qualified teachers turn out to be
negative. However, it can be inferred from the width of the 95 percent confidence band that the
estimated effects are not significantly different from zero.

        The final measured teacher characteristic of interest is the average years of experience of the
teacher workforce. Once again, Figure A4.2c shows the estimated effects of allocating more
experienced teachers to lower-performing schools to be very high. For instance, an increase of 10
years in the average teacher experience is estimated to improve student performance outcome for
schools at the 12th percentile by as much as 2.7 percent. This is much greater than the 1 percent impact
estimated for the average school using OLS. Finally, it is not obvious why the marginal effects of
average teacher experience should turn negative and statistically significant for schools which are
ranked above the 82nd percentile.

         Turning now to our measure of the adequacy of teacher quantity, we can see from Figure A4.3
that allocating one more teacher for each classroom is expected to raise performance for schools at
the 2nd percentile of the performance distribution by as much as 15.8 percent (or 0.147 log points),
other factors held constant. The effects drop down to within a range of 4.8-6.5 percent for schools
between the 6th and the 20th percentiles before falling off gradually thereafter. The large and positive
effects for schools at the bottom end of the performance distribution is not surprising considering the
fact that teacher shortages are very severe for these schools.9




9 For schools ranked at or below the 2nd percentile of the performance distribution, the average number of teachers per
classroom is 0.79. For schools ranked between the 2nd and 4th percentiles, the figure improves slightly to 0.93. The figure
improves further to 1.0 for schools ranked between the 4th and 6th percentiles, and to 1.06 for schools ranked between the
6th and 20th percentiles. For those schools that are ranked above the 20 th percentile, the average number of teachers per
classroom rises to 1.18. These figures once again confirm that teacher shortage is a very serious problem constraining Thai
schools.

A4.2. Unconditional Quantile Regression
This section describes the unconditional quantile regression method introduced by Firpo, Fortin, and
Lemieux (2009) – FFL from hereon. The method enables an evaluation of the impact of changing the
distribution of explanatory variables  on the quantiles of the “unconditional” (or marginal)
distribution of the outcome variable  using a familiar regression framework.

       Consider a real-valued statistical functional ( ), where  is an underlying distribution
function for (any) random variable . The influence function (; ,  ) introduced by Hampel
(1968, 1974) is a widely used tool in studies on local robustness properties of functionals, and is
defined as,

                                         (,. )                       ( +( − ))−( )
                 (; ,  ) =                         |          = lim                                          ,⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡0 <  < 1   (1)
                                                                        ↓0                   
                                                                   =0

if this limit is defined for every point  ∈ ℝ, and  denotes the probability measure that puts the
mass 1 at the value . If a statistical functional (von Mises functional due to Mises (1947)) is Gâteaux
differentiable at  , FFL show that the following approximation holds for some distribution function
 close to  ,

                 ( ) = ( ) + ∫ℝ (; ,  )( −  )() +                                                     (2)

where  is a remainder term. Noting that ∫ℝ (; ,  ) () = 0 by definition, we have ( ) =
( ) + ∫ℝ (; ,  ) () + . For a particular case that  = , FFL call this first order
approximation term the “Recentered Influence Function,”

                 (; ,  ) = ( ) + ∫ℝ (; ,  ) ()⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡

                                       = ( ) + (; ,  )                                                                    (3)

        FFL recognise several interesting properties of the (; ,  ), the most important of
which is that it integrates up to the functional of interest ( ); that is, ∫ℝ (; ,  )
                                                                                                             () =
[(; ,  )] = ⁡( ). Applying the law of iterated expectation to this expression yields,

                  [[(; ,  )|)]] =  [ ()] = ( )                                                        (4)

where  [∙] makes explicit that the expectation is taken over the support of , and  () denotes
the RIF regression model with regard to the statistical functional  .

        As mentioned at the outset, this study applies the RIF Regression method to a whole range of
quantiles of the dependent variable , which are generically denoted by  ( ) for any quantile  ∈
(0,1) of interest. The influence function for a quantile is given by:
                                            −(≤ )
                 (;  ,  ) =                                                                                                   (5)
                                               ( )
where (∙) denotes an indicator function, equal to 1 if the expression in the parentheses is true and 0
otherwise.

        Using the definition of RIF given in (3) for the  ℎ quantile of the marginal distribution of ,
the feasible version of the (;  ,  ) can be expressed as:
                                                 ̂  )           (1−)
                    ̂ (; 
                            ̂ ) = (>
                           ̂ ,                      + 
                                                          ̂  −                                     (6)
                                            ̂
                                            ̂   ( )       ̂ ̂
                                                                      ( )


        Note that the estimator of the  ℎ population quantile of the marginal distribution of , 
                                                                                                      ̂ , is
nonparametrically identified from observed sample. Furthermore, the empirical density of  is

A4.3. Data
This study employs a 2010 cross-sectional school data collected by the Office of the Basic Education
Commission (OBEC), the Ministry of Education in Thailand. A rich set of information from 31,330
schools were collected on teacher and personnel salaries, number of students in each education level,
number of poor students (students whose household incomes are below 40,000 Baht per month),
number of classes, number of teachers by their educational qualification, their average years of
teaching experience, etc. Hence, the data are aggregated at the school level by nature.

         Using the raw data, we were able to construct school-level variables needed in estimating the
educational production function. The constructed variables that serve as inputs into the production
function capture the average student body, teacher, and school attributes. Particularly, these are: the
shares of students by broad schooling level (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary, and upper
secondary), the share of students that are poor, the proportion of teachers with higher than bachelor’s
degree qualification, the teachers’ average years of teaching experience, the “unobserved teacher
quality index”, the average number of teachers per classroom, and the distance in kilometers from the
school to the nearest city (Amphur).

        The “unobserved teacher quality index” is constructed from the “composition-adjusted
teacher salary” variable which is computed as explained in Section A5.4. As discussed at length in
section A5.4, the variation in the composition-adjusted teacher salary encompasses variations arising
from teacher “price” differences across geographical areas, the discretionary wage component (such
as performance pay), the average academic ranking of the teacher workforce, and other school average
teacher characteristics unobserved by the researcher. The unobserved teacher quality index is then
computed by normalizing the composition-adjusted teacher salary to have zero mean and unit



                                                                        1           2
10
   The Gaussian kernel is used in this study, where () = √2  − /2
11
   Notice that the sampling weight is normalized to sum to . That is, ∑ =1  = 
variance. Notice that since the index also encompasses teacher’s wage variation arising from teacher
prices, we therefore regard it as an approximate measure of unobserved teacher quality.

        The final key input variable in the educational production function is the school level “student
performance index in 2009”, which is a weighted index of mathematics and science scores in the 2009
Ordinary National Education Test (O-NET) exams for Grades 6, 9, and 12. The index is constructed
as explained in great detail in A5.3.

        The output variable for the educational production function is the (log) student performance
index in 2010.

        The summary statistics for the variables used in estimating the educational production
function model are presented in Table A4.3. Notice that a small percentage of the observations were
dropped due to the presence of missing data on one or more variables. Furthermore, the 137 schools
that had no students were discarded. The final sample size is 30,120 schools.

       Box A5.1. Predicting the Per-Student Cost of Meeting Student Performance Standard

This section applies the cost function model to predicting the per-student cost for a hypothetical
“baseline school” that is adequate for supporting students in attaining some educational performance
outcome standard. The estimated regression coefficients from the cost function model (see column
“Frontier IV” in Table A5.4) are then used to construct cost indices for each school in the estimation
sample. These cost indices reflect differences relative to the baseline school of key student body and
school characteristics that are outside the control of the school or local community in
question. An overall cost index is then computed by multiplying together the various component
indices. This overall index is effectively a measure of relative variation in per-student cost for the
school compared to the baseline school. For example, a cost index of 1.5 indicates that the school in
question will require 50% more spending per student than the baseline school to achieve the same
average student performance outcome. The manner in which the cost indices are estimated is
completely transparent and the indices can be easily applied to predicting the required per-student
spending for any school in the country.

We begin with using the estimated per-student cost function to generate the predicted subsidy required
for each school to reach some average student performance outcome. This is made possible because
the cost function specification directly ties spending to performance, while accounting for differences
in school and student-body characteristics. In this study, we set the required Student Performance
Index12 at 50 (referred to as the performance standard from hereon), or at around the 84th percentile
in the student performance outcome distribution. Then, we estimate the per-student cost of reaching
this performance standard for a hypothetical “baseline school” which has as its characteristics the
mean shares of students by the three broad schooling levels (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary,
and upper-secondary), the mean shares of poor and disabled students, and the national average teacher
salary index (see Annex Section A5.4). Furthermore, we set the enrolment size of the baseline school
at between 500 to 749 students and an average class size at between 20 to 29 students. Finally, we
allow the baseline school to have an average level of cost inefficiency (see equation (12) in Section



12   The computation of the Student Performance Index is explained in Section...
A5.1). Using equations (9), (10), and (11) from Section A5.1; the predicted log per-student cost of the
baseline school can thus be written as:
                                                                                       
                               ̂
                              ln⁡                ̂1 ln() + 
                                           ̂0 + 
                                ( ) =                                          ̂ + 
                                                              ̂2 ln(50) + ∑  ′
                                                                                      =3

inefficiency, and the 

We use equation (14) from Section A5.1 to convert the predicted log per-student cost of the baseline
school into the predicted cost in level term. The per-student cost of this hypothetical baseline school
to meet the required performance standard is predicted to be 33,506 Baht per annum (see Table 5.1).

The adequate per-student cost for each school to meet the performance standard based on the
estimated marginal effects is the predicted cost of the baseline school multiplied by an “overall cost
index” for the school. The overall cost index is in turn a product of different component indices
pertaining to schooling level composition of the student body, enrolment size, average class size,
student poverty, and the share of students who are disabled.

For example, consider estimating the schooling level composition index for school  which is
composed of ℎ_  share of primary-level students, ℎ_  share of lower-secondary
students, and ℎ_  share of upper-secondary students. Notice that the respective shares
for the baseline school are 0.455, 0.276, and 0.135 respectively. The schooling level composition index

          exp{(ℎ_  − 0.455)                                                       ̂ℎ_ +
                                            ̂ℎ_ + (ℎ_  − 0.276)
          (ℎ_  − 0.135)̂ℎ_ }

                        ̂ℎ_ and 
       ̂ℎ_ , 
where                                              ̂ℎ_ are the estimated Frontier IV marginal effects for the
“Share of primary students”, “Share of lower secondary students”, and , “Share of upper secondary
students” variables respectively.

Conducting the preceding exercise for all schools in the data set, it is predicted that the average per
student public expenditure adequate for achieving the stated student performance standard is 36,331
Baht per annum – a 15.4 percent increase from the actual average per-student subsidy of 31,475 Baht
per annum. In order to see the required change in per-student public expenditure at a more
disaggregated level, we average the required per-student subsidies for all provinces in Thailand. The
required change in the average per-student amount by province is plotted against the provincial
average annual per capita consumption and the provincial average student performance index in
Figures BA5.1 and BA5.2 respectively.

The broad patterns of the two figures indicate that poorer provinces with lower educational outcomes
would require larger increases in per-student public expenditures in order to raise their students’
average educational performance to the required performance standard. In other words, public
expenditure would need to be even more progressive than it currently is (recall Figure 3.1 in Chapter
3). Notice also that there will be losers from implementing the funding formula as four provinces
would see their average per student public allocation decline. On the other hand, the network of small
schools in Mae Hong Son (the poorest province in Thailand in terms of per capita consumption
expenditure) would need a massive increase of 64 percent in per student financing.

Distinguishing between factors that are and are not under the control of the school and/or
local community

Recall that the funding formula gives schools funding premiums for factors that are outside the control
of the school or the local community, such as the share of students by level of schooling in the area,
the shares of students who are poor or disabled, and the local price level of educational inputs.
However, as we have seen from the analysis given in Chapter 4, most small schools need not be small
since they are located in close proximity to other schools. Therefore, these non-isolated schools may
not be regarded as small and may not receive the same funding premium that a similarly-sized isolated
school would receive. The importance of the scale effects of enrolment and class sizes is clearly
depicted in the bar charts shown in Figure BA5.3. Consider the left bar chart which shows the
reduction in required per-student subsidy as the schools gets larger. The required per-student subsidy
for a school with an enrolment size between 500 to 749 students is a massive 43 percent lower than
that for a school with less than 50 enrolled students, other things held constant. The scale effect of
average class size can be analyzed analogously.13

For the reasons given in the previous paragraph, it is crucial that a school mapping exercise be
conducted prior to determining the required per-student subsidies. We calculate the amount of
subsidies for all 19,081 schools that would remain after the hypothetical school consolidation reform.
The national average amount of required funding for all schools to achieve a score of 50 on the Student
Performance Index is estimated at 33,863 Baht per student. This amount is 7.6 percent higher than
the actual average per-student subsidy of 31,475 Baht, which is considerably lower than the 36,331
Baht needed prior to the hypothetical school network rationalization reform. However, in order for
Thailand to realize these efficiency gains, more than 12,000 schools will need to be consolidated. The
strategies that Thailand could follow to realize this vision is discussed in Chapter 4.



13   The scale effects are calculated based on the estimated coefficients of the cost function model shown in Table A5.4.
The required change in the average per-student amount by province post-school consolidation reform
is again plotted against the provincial average annual per capita consumption and the provincial
average student performance index in Figures BA5.4 and BA5.5. We can see that the broad patterns
where poorer provinces with lower educational outcomes would require larger increases in per-student
public expenditures remain unchanged. However, there will be more losers as 23 provinces would
now face reductions in the allocation of per-student public subsidies.

                  ( ) = 0 + 1 ln( ) + 2 ln( ) + ∑
                ln⁡                                                        ′
                                                                   =3                   (2)

         However, as pointed out in Duncombe and Yinger (2005) and Duncombe (2007), the
observed data are per-student spending, not cost, which is defined as the minimum expenditure
required to achieve a certain performance outcome given school and student body characteristics. To
estimate the cost of education requires taking into account differences in school efficiency in resource
utilization. A school may have higher per-student spending compared to another school with similar
student performance level, school and student background characteristics, and input prices they face
because of inefficient use of resources. It is becoming increasingly common in recent literature to
attempt to directly control for variables that are related to these inefficiencies in the right hand side of
equation (2). For example; Duncombe and Yinger (2005) and Duncombe (2007) use “efficiency
related measures”, which are broadly categorized as fiscal capacity, competition, and factors affecting
voter involvement in monitoring the government. Imazeki (2008) focuses instead on local competition
by using the Herfindahl Index (HHI) as a proxy for local competition in school districts. As argued in
Costrell, Hanushek, and Loeb (2008), finding a set of observed and measurable factors that determined
efficiency in schools is clearly difficult. As a result, existing “efficiency controls” are rarely convincing
measures of the full range of efficiency and do little to explain variations in education spending.

        This study employs a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) approach introduced by Aigner,
Lovell, and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977) to identify the points at or near
the bottom of the observed spending patterns. This statistical method has been used by a number of
studies to convert an expenditure equation to a cost function (see for example Duncombe, Ruggiero,
and Yinger, 1996; Gronberg, Jansen, Taylor, and Booker, 2004, 2005; Chakraborty and Poggio, 2008).
In particular, consider per-student expenditure,  , incurred by school  . By definition, it must be the
case that

                 ≥ ( ,  ,  ; )                                                  (3)

because ( ,  ,  ; ) is an education cost function. To incorporate the fact that per-student
expenditure may be subject to random shocks outside the control of the school, rewrite equation (3)
as

                                                     { }
                 ≥ ( ,  ,  ; )exp⁡                                              (4)
where exp⁡                                                                                                 { } is
            { } captures the effects of random shocks on each school and ( ,  ,  ; )exp⁡
the stochastic cost frontier. The remaining excess of expenditure over the minimum attainable cost is
attributed to a degree of inefficiency, exp{ }. Specifically,

                                                                 { }
                   = ( ,  ,  ; )exp{ }exp⁡                                               (5)

        An appropriate measure of cost efficiency (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000) in a stochastic
frontier setting is given by:
                             ( , , ;) exp{ }
                   =                  
                                                                   = exp{− }                                 (6)

which is the ratio of minimum cost attainable to observed expenditure. From equations (4) and (5), it
follows that  ≤ 1, with  = 1 if and only if  attains its minimum feasible value.

       Assuming that the cost frontier takes the log-linear Cobb-Douglas functional form given in
equation (2), the stochastic frontier model in equation (5) can now be written as:

                    ( ) = 0 + 1 ln( ) + 2 ln( ) + ∑
                  ln⁡                                                        ′
                                                                     =3   +  +               (7)

where  ≥ 0 is a one-sided error term representing cost inefficiency and  is a two-sided error term.
The two error components of the asymmetric “composed error” term  =  +  are assumed to
be independently distributed from each other. This study follows Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977)
and makes the following distributional assumptions:

                   ~(0, 

                   ~. . . 

          That is, the two-sided errors  ’s are assumed to be i.i.d. normally distributed and the one-
sided errors  ’s are assumed to have i.i.d. exponential distribution.14 Furthermore, when the two error
components are also independently distributed from the regressors in equation (7), then maximum
likelihood will consistently estimate the  parameters along with the distribution parameters  and
 . The log-likelihood function for a sample of  schools can be shown to take the following form
(see Meeusen and van den Broeck, 1977):
                                                                                           2
                                                                              2
                                                                                 −          
                  ln (, ,  2 ) = ∑

                                                                                                 )−
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                             }   (8)
                                                                               



where Φ(∙) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, and  is the composed error.

Dealing with Endogenous Explanatory Variables
        The assumption that the error components are independently distributed from the explanatory
variables in equation (7) is problematic. Karakaplan and Katlu (2013) argue that increasing cost

14Other distributional assumptions have been proposed for the non-negative inefficiency term, such as the half normal
(Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt, 1977), the truncated normal (Stevenson, 1980), and the Gamma distribution (Greene, 2003).
efficiency may release additional resources that can be reallocated to enhance student performance.
As a result, school output may be correlated with the inefficiency component. Costrell, Hanushek,
and Loeb (2008) assert that some school districts are composed of citizens that are more education-
oriented than others and this characteristic is not captured by observable variables. These districts may
therefore tend to spend more and have more highly performing students. This statistical association
would clearly cause an upward bias in the relationship between spending and performance.
Furthermore, since the cost function is derived under the assumption of perfectly competitive market,
it is implicitly assumed that schools are “price-takers.” This assumption is unlikely to be tenable as
variation in teacher salaries likely includes some discretionary variation which may be correlated with
student performance and per-pupil spending. The presence of endogenous teacher salaries and student
performance variables would result in inconsistent parameter estimates if conventional maximum
likelihood estimation of stochastic frontier model is performed. A proper instrumental variable (IV)
framework is needed to deal with the endogeneity issue in the SFA setting.

         One of only a few studies trying to address the endogeneity problem in SFA is Guan,
Kumbhakar, Myers, and Lansink (2009). The authors propose a two-step procedure to handle
endogenous explanatory variables. In the first step, consistent estimates of the slope parameters are
obtained using instrumental variable regression. Notice that the estimated intercept term from the first
step is, however, inconsistent for the cost frontier intercept. In the second step, they use the residuals
from the first stage as the dependent variable to get the maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic
frontier distributional parameters and a “shift parameter” for the first stage-intercept. Specifically, in
the first step estimate equation (7) using instrumental variable regression to obtain

                ln⁡                     ̂1, ln( ) + 
                             ̂0, + 
                  ( ) =                                ̂2, ln( ) + ∑      ′ ̂
                                                                                  =3  , + ̂   (9)

        In the second step, take the residuals ̂ ’s from the first stage and use them as the dependent
variable in the following stochastic cost frontier model with only an intercept term

                ̂ = 0 +  +                                                                          (10)

        The model in equation (10) is estimated using maximum likelihood as per equation (8) to
                                         2
obtain consistent estimates of  2 =       2
                                           +  ,  =  / , and the shift parameter 0 . Finally, a
consistent estimate of the stochastic cost frontier intercept from equation (7) is constructed by

                       ̂0, + 
                 ̂0 = 
                                ̂0                                                                              (11)

        Cost efficiency estimates for each school can be obtained using equation (6). However, this
study uses an alternative point estimator for  proposed by Battese and Coelli (1988):
                                                        1−Φ(∗ −∗ /∗ )                    1  2
                 = [exp{− }| ] = [                           ] exp {−∗    + 2 ∗ }           (12)
                                                         1−Φ(−∗ /∗ )

                        2
where ∗ =  −  / and ∗ =  for the normal-exponential model.

Predicting the Per-Student Cost in Level
        Using equations (9), (10), and (11); the predicted log per-student expenditure of a particular
school can be written as:
                 ̂
                ln⁡             ̂1 ln() + 
                          ̂0 + 
                  () =                   ̂2 ln() + ∑          ̂
                                                          =3  ′ +                    (13)

where  is the provincial average composition-adjusted teacher salary,  is the level of output (student
performance index),  is a vector of school and student body characteristics,  is the national average
                                     ̂ ’s are the estimated regression coefficients. Notice that we have
level of cost inefficiency, and the 
omitted the  subscript to simplify notation.

         To convert the predicted log per-student expenditure of the school into the predicted cost in
level term (in Thai Baht unit), we apply the following formula:

                          ̂
                 ̂ = exp{ln⁡
                         ()}exp{ 2
                                     ̂ /2}                                                     (14)

         2
       ̂
where    is the variance of the predicted two-sided residuals.

A5.2. Data
The education cost function described in the previous section of this report is estimated based on
2010 cross-sectional school data collected by the Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC),
the Ministry of Education in Thailand. A rich set of information for 31,330 schools were collected on
teacher and personnel salaries, number of students in each education level, number of disabled
students, number of classes, number of teachers by their educational qualification, personnel teaching
experience, etc. However, a small percentage of observations were dropped due to the presence of
missing data on one or more of the variables summarized in Table A5.1.

        The per student cost summarized in the same Table is calculated from the sum of subsidies
schools received under the government’s “15-Year Free Basic Education Program” and the total
expenditure on education personnel, divided by the number of students enrolled in that school. The
subsidies under the 15-year free basic education program can be classified into five categories as
follows; direct per student tuition subsidy, uniforms, learning materials, textbooks, and other activities
which promote quality improvements among students. The expenditure for education personnel
covers salaries of school administrators, teachers, and other educational staffs. All calculations are
based on an annual basis.

        Also included in Table A5.1 are the summary statistics of the variables used in estimating the
cost function model. All the variables are categorized into four major groups as follows; 1) teacher
characteristics, 2) cost variables, 3) Student body characteristics, and 4) School characteristics.

A5.3. Student Performance Outcome
The student performance outcome measure used in this report is a weighted index of mathematics
and science scores in the 2010 Ordinary National Education Test (O-NET) exams for Grades 6, 9,
and 12. These tests are centrally administered by the National Institute of Educational Testing Service
(NIETS) and all students in these respective grades are required to sit the exams. The rest of this
subsection describes the procedure used in constructing the overall school outcome measure needed
for our cost function estimation.

       For each school, we have information on the total number of students who took the exams
by grade and subject. Also reported are the number of students that falls into each of the twelve test
score intervals ranging from; (0), (0.01-10), (10.01-20), (20.01-30),…, (80.01-90), (90.01-99.99), and
(100). Histograms representing densities of the 2010 O-NET scores in mathematics and science for
the three grade levels are presented in Figure A5.1.

        To calculate the average test score for each exam, we first assign students within each test
score interval the upper bound score for that particular interval (see table below). The school average
test score for each exam is then simply calculated as a weighted average of the assigned scores, where
the weights are the number of students in the test score intervals. The school average O-NET score
for each grade level is in turn a weighted average of the mathematics and science test scores, where
the weights are the total number of students who took the exams. The resulting empirical cumulative
distribution and density functions for the student performance measures in the three grade levels are
depicted in Figure A5.2.

              Assigning 2010 O-NET Scores to Students in each Test Score Interval
                       0.01-    10.01-   20.01-    30.01-    40.01-    50.01-    60.01-   70.01-   80.01-    90.01-
 Test score interval
                        10        20       30        40        50        60        70       80       90       100
 Assigned score         10        20       30        40        50        60        70       80       90       100



        Notice that the distributions of the average test scores in the three grade levels are quite
different from each other. The challenge here is to find a way to appropriately combine the average
scores for the three different grades into a single measure of student performance outcome for each
school. This study uses the distribution of the Grade 6 O-NET scores (G6 scores from hereon) as the
reference distribution, where the scores from the other two grade levels are projected onto.
Specifically, we first compute the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) for the G6 scores
using the formula:

                                        ̂ ( 6 ≤ ) = ∑ 
                            ̂6 () ≡ 
                                                              6
                                                                    (6 ≤ )                        (15)

       ̂6 (∙) is the ECDF of the G6 scores,  6 is the random variable representing the school mean
where 
            ̂ (∙) denotes probability, and (∙) is an indicator function equal to unity if the expression
G6 score, 
                                                                    6     6 ∑ 6              6
in the parentheses is true. Each school  is assigned a weight     =  /   , where   is the
total number of students in school  who took the G6 O-NET exams. Equation (15) is evaluated at
some school average test score  .

         In the next step, we similarly compute the ECDF’s for the test scores in the other two grade
levels and then apply the inverse of the reference ECDF (also known as the quantile function), ̂6
                                                                                                   −1 (∙)
                                                                                                         ,
to the values of the ECDF’s of the other test scores to obtain the rescaled scores. For example,
                                                               
consider the school average G9 score at the  ℎ quantile (9 ), where  ∈ (0,1). The rescaled G9
               ℎ            
score at the  quantile (9_ ) is computed as follows:

                            ̂6
                            −1 ̂ (  ))    
                                 (9 9 = 9_                                                    (16)

        In the final step the student performance index is computed as a weighted average of the
rescaled test scores from the three standardized exams. Specifically, for any school  we compute the
student performance outcome index,  , using the formula:
                                       6  +9

        It is decided that the student performance index of 50 represents the required standard of
proficiency used in this report. This is equivalent to the 84th percentile of the national student
performance outcome distribution. In other words, 84 percent of students in Thailand performed at
or below this level in the 2010 O-NET exams in mathematics and science.

A5.4. Composition-Adjusted Teacher Salaries

From the summary statistics shown in Table A5.1, it can be inferred that total salary expenditure
makes up 57 percent of total per-student public subsidy in Thai schools. Furthermore, teacher salary
accounts for most (around 94 percent) of total salary expenditure per student. It is therefore very clear
that teacher salary is the most important resource price to include in the cost function model.
Moreover, it also serves as a proxy for the market prices for other school educational resources such
as non-teaching staff. However, while data on school average salary of teachers are readily available,
they do not only contain variation in the “prices” of teachers across schools. For instance, average
teacher salaries can also vary across schools due to differences in teacher educational qualification,
years of teaching experience, past performance assessment, as well as academic standing allowance
and position allowance of teacher civil service.

         Figure A5.4 presents the raw or “unadjusted average teacher salaries” in OBEC schools across
76 provinces in Thailand. We can immediately see the large provincial differences in average teacher
salaries. In order to measure teacher prices more accurately, we need to measure average salaries for
teachers of comparable average characteristics across schools. This can be done by adjusting average
teacher salaries using regression. It is important to note that for each school we observe only the
shares of teachers by educational qualification and the average years of teaching experience in our
dataset. We do not, however, observe other teacher quality measures such as past performance
assessment and teacher academic standing which are clearly associated with salaries. Therefore, in
addition to pure differences in the price of teachers, the resulting “composition-adjusted average
teacher salaries” will also inevitably contain variations arising from differences in the unobserved
teacher characteristics.

        To construct the composition-adjusted average teacher salaries, we first regress the log of
average teacher salary on the shares of teachers in the school with doctorate, master’s, bachelor’s, and
lower than bachelor’s degree, and a quartic in the average years of teaching experience. The regression
results presented below in Table A5.2 indicate that teacher educational qualification and experience
explain as much as 96 percent of the total variation in average salaries across schools. In the second
step, we then predict what the logarithm of average teacher salary would be for each school if teacher
education and experience are at the country average levels. It is important to note that we need to add
the regression residuals from the first step to the predicted log average salary in this second step. The
variation in the adjusted average teacher salaries is therefore due to the residuals of the log salaries
from the first step alone. The residual wage variation therefore encompasses variations arising from
teacher price differences, the discretionary wage component, and other teacher characteristics
unobserved by the researcher.

         In the final step, we simply exponentiate the predicted log average salaries to obtain the
predicted average salaries in level terms across schools. The results for provincial average adjusted
salaries presented in Figure A5.5 clearly show relatively little variation across provinces compared to
the unadjusted salaries in Figure A5.4.

A5.5. Instrumental Variables

As discussed at length in the previous section, it is highly likely that the student performance variable
is endogenous in the cost equation and instruments are needed in order to consistently estimate the
model parameters. This study follows a similar approach taken by Duncombe and Yinger (2005) and
Gronberg, Jansen, Taylor, and Booker (2005) and uses as instrument the median student performance
of schools in the same province, but not in the same district as the school in question. Since there is
only a single instrument for each endogenous variable, it is not possible to test the validity of the
instrument using an overidentifying restriction test. However, the instrument does pass the necessary
rank condition test as can be seen from the results from the first stage regressions shown in Table
A5.3 where the instruments enter the equations highly significantly with a p-values of less than 0.01.

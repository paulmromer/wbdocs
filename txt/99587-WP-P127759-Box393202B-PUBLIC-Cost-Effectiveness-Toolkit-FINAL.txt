Abstract: Results-Based Financing (RBF), which rewards providers, users, or administrators of services
upon achieving a set of verified results, has been gaining attraction in global health as a prominent approach
to gain value for money. With a large number of countries adopting RBF in the recent years, evidence starts
to emerge which points to the effectiveness of RBF in improving coverage and quality of important services,
such as maternal and child health and reproductive health. A question remains, however, if RBF is more
cost-effective than alternative interventions which aim to improve similar outcomes. Given the limited
resources that countries have for health, the answer to this question is particularly important as it guides
policy makers on which programs to invest to maximize health benefits for the population. A second
question is how the cost-effectiveness varies across different settings and RBF program features.

The current toolkit aims to support country programs to assess the cost-effectiveness of RBF interventions
and to facilitate cross-country comparisons of RBF programs. The toolkit is specifically tailored to supply-
side RBF but its general principles apply to most health systems interventions directed at the health-related
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)— 4 and 5. The development of the toolkit was based on actual
experience of conducting a costeffectiveness analysis of Zambia’s RBF program and an extensive review
of RBF programs features across the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) portfolio. Given that
RBF programs in the HRITF portfolio are typically complex health system interventions, the toolkit
recommends a practical approach of adopting a program implementer’s perspective and presents different
options for cost-effectiveness analysis (for selected key indicators or for an entire package of services). It
also provides guidance on incorporating quality of care, which is strongly emphasized across many RBF
programs.

                                           INTRODUCTION
1.       Over the last decade, the global health community has used Results-Based Financing (RBF) as a
means to strengthen health services. In a broad sense, RBF is an incentive approach to health systems
strengthening that provides financial and non-financial rewards to providers, users, or administrators of
services upon achieving a set of verified results. As an approach, RBF has been receiving increasing
attention in health as well as other sectors for its promise to gain value for money.

2.       With the support from the governments of Norway and the United Kingdom, the World Bank is
managing the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) to pilot RBF programs in more than thirty
countries. The focus of these RBF programs is to improve maternal and child health (MCH) health
outcomes, as well as other conditions of high disease burden in many developing countries such as
tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malaria. A central element of the HRITF’s
learning agenda is to document the extent to which RBF policies are effective, are operationally feasible,
and in what circumstances. As such, rigorous evaluation is essential for generating new knowledge that
can inform governments and partners to effectively design and use RBF mechanisms. The eventual
learning objective is not only to assess the impact of the RBF intervention(s) in individual countries, but also
to compare these impacts across other countries with similar interventions, or to compare the cost-
effectiveness of RBF versus alternative interventions even within the same country.

3.       Given the limited resources that developing countries have for health, policy makers often need to
make decisions on which programs to invest to maximize health benefits for the population. Cost-
effectiveness analysis (CEA) is such a tool to provide evidence to inform policy makers associated costs
and potential benefits for an intervention, and examine both economic and health consequences of
alternatives, for evidence-based decision making.

4.       The current toolkit aims to support country programs to assess the cost-effectiveness of RBF
interventions and to facilitate cross-country comparisons of RBF programs. This is a companion tool to the
Impact Evaluation Toolkit developed under HRITF’s work program, the first version of which was launched
in 2012 (World Bank, 2015). The purpose of the toolkit is to enable impact evaluation teams to conduct a
CEA that compares the costs and health effects of a RBF program themselves when the impact evaluation
results become available. Hence its primary audience is impact evaluation teams who have a high level of
training in economics or public health and are already familiar with the concept of a CEA. Additionally, the
toolkit also aims to contribute to global knowledge of cost-effectiveness of a RBF program if the RBF
program is implemented, and the same methodology could be applied to estimate CE ratio to inform
whether or not to invest in RBF if a program has not been implemented. The toolkit is specifically tailored
to the most common form of RBF in the HRITF portfolio – supply-side RBF, or Performance-Based
Financing (PBF). Nevertheless, the toolkit’s general principles apply to most health systems interventions
directed at the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—Goals 4 and 5. RBF has similar
goals and kinds of inputs (financial and managerial) with other innovations to improve maternal-child
services, such as reproductive health vouchers, subsidized insurance for pregnant women, conditional cash
transfers, mobile health and e-health applications, and incentives for community health workers. The toolkit
was developed incorporating experience conducting a CEA for the Zambia RBF program.

5.       It is important to note that this toolkit is not designed to replace valuable guidelines for the health
sector as a whole (Hutubessy, Chisholm, & Edejer, 2003; World Health Organization, 2003), nor disease-
specific interventions (Jamison et al., 2006). Rather, the aim here is to be concise and practical, providing
hands-on experience and measurement instruments for teams to apply. As such, the theoretical
discussions will be kept to a minimum. One novel aspect of this toolkit is that it explicitly incorporates quality
of care and other system strengthening efforts because they are strongly emphasized in the HRITF’s RBF
programs. Acknowledging that RBF programs in the HRITF portfolio are typically complex health system
interventions, for which a simple and straightforward CEA may not be feasible, we present options for CEA




                                                        1
with different levels of complexity: CEA for selected key MCH indicators and CEA for an entire package of
services with or without incorporating quality of care.

6.      The production of a toolkit to facilitate CEA studies of RBF programs is inspired by the dearth of
empirical evidence on RBF’s value for money. A review of studies on pay-for-performance (P4P), a typical
form of RBF, noted: “Only nine of [the reviewed] studies considered costs beyond the financial incentives,
and only two of these studies included costs of developing and setting up the P4P scheme. The costs to
providers of participating in the scheme and eventual costs to patients have also been omitted from previous
analyses. Outcomes, if measured, are typically restricted to changes in incentivized services, with only four
studies reporting effects on outcomes and one study reporting effects on non-incentivized services. No
study to date reporting on the costs or cost-effectiveness of P4P has been published from low and lower
middle income countries” (Borghi, Little, Binyaruka, Patouillard, & Kuwawenaruwa, 2015).

7.      The section below provides an overall framework for incremental CEA. It is followed by detailed
discussions of cost analysis and assessment of effectiveness in RBF programs, which are then combined
for producing various CEA ratios. The discussions of concepts and methods are illustrated with an example
from a hypothetical country. The toolkit ends with a discussion of strengths and limitations of the
recommended approaches and some practical notes for researchers and evaluators.

CHAPTER 1. A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR COST-EFFECTIVENESS
                       ANALYSIS
8.       Conducting a CEA requires data on a variety of inputs on costs and effectiveness. Typically, the
needed data are assembled from multiple diverse sources. In the case of RBF programs, for example, the
costs often include RBF program costs (i.e. incentives, costs of monitoring and evaluation), costs of
consumables (i.e. costs of drugs utilized due to RBF programs), and other costs above the facility level.
Effectiveness includes information on improvement of both quality and quantity of health services from the
impact evaluation, which should then be translated to the number of lives saved, Quality Adjusted Life Years
(QALYs) or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for a CEA. A health CEA generally compares an
intervention approach (such as RBF or another innovation) with the existing, or control approach. Figure 1
shows a general schema for a CEA of health programs in general, which can apply specifically to a CEA in
RBF programs.

9.       As shown in Figure 1, the final output of a CEA is typically an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER). Here we focus on ICER rather than cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), as a RBF program is built on
existing health system and the complexity of tracking health system costs if CER is conducted. We also
assume that the RBF program is an alternative of the business as usual model. CEA is a tool that can be
used to identify which interventions achieve the greatest level of health impact per unit of investment. In
CEA, the cost of a health intervention is divided by an estimate of health outcomes. Because we are
interested to know whether it is better to invest an additional dollar toward one intervention compared to
another, we are comparing costs and outcomes on the margin. To explain this more formally, the ICER of
interventions, defined as the change in cost (with and without the intervention, or between two alternative
interventions), divided by the change in effectiveness (with versus without the intervention or between two
alternative interventions) is calculated for a standard population as:

                                ICER = Difference in cost / Difference in outcomes

10.     The calculations are most clear if the standard population is one person. The difference means the
value for a person in the intervention group compared to one in the control group. Thus, the equation
becomes:


                                                     3
                      ICER = Difference in cost per capita / Difference in outcomes per capita

11.      Cost-effectiveness ratios of alternative RBF programs can be compared to each other and to the
counterfactual of a situation without the RBF intervention (control). In the context of RBF, CEA can help us
understand how much it costs more for an additional unit of effect (or health outcome) averted or gained in
relation to different alternatives using similar amounts of resources for implementation. It provides evidence
for policy makers on which program to invest given budget constraints. If one uses DALYs averted or QALYs
gained as outcome measures, GDP/capita is used as threshold to determine if the interventions under
evaluation is cost-effective or not: highly cost-effective (ICER less than GDP per capita); cost-effective
(ICER between one and three times GDP per capita); and not cost-effective (ICER more than three times
GDP per capita) (World Health Organization, 2015), (World Health Organization, 2011).

12.     The next three chapters explain the three key steps and associated concepts laid out in Figure 1:
(1) how to conduct cost analysis to obtain incremental cost; (2) how to translate impact evaluation results
to incremental lives saved, QALYs or DALYs; and (3) how to compute the ICER and interpret the results.

                               CHAPTER 2. COST ANALYSIS
13.     The first step in this manual is to apply cost analysis to estimate the costs of RBF interventions.
The principles and approaches that we use reflect general practice for estimating costs of health services
(World Health Organization, 2015), applied directly to RBF interventions.

14.     While cost analysis can be used as a building block for estimating cost-effectiveness or performing
other types of economic analyses, cost analysis in its own right can provide insight as to:

    •   What are the least and most costly RBF strategies?
    •   What components of cost account for the greatest amount of RBF resources?
    •   What is the cost per facility or per person served?
    •   What is the potential cost of scaling-up the RBF strategy?
    •   What is the difference in the cost of establishing the RBF mechanism compared to maintaining the
        program over the long -term?
    •   How do alternative versions of an RBF program compare in costs?
    •   How does the cost of a specific RBF program vary with the site in which it is implemented?



                                KEY CONCEPTS AND APPROACHES IN COSTING

15.    This subsection introduces key concepts commonly used in costing, as well as the main
approaches for cost analysis. It then presents the method we adopt in the Toolkit for CEA of RBF programs
and provides the justification for such decisions.

Incremental cost

16.     Incremental costs are the difference in costs between an RBF program and usual care, or between
two alternative versions of RBF. Incremental costs take one approach as the reference or comparator,
against which the RBF program is compared. Typically, the reference is the status quo (no RBF) and the
new program is the addition of the RBF. Thus, the incremental costs measure the additional costs of adding
an RBF program onto the existing health system. The analysis can be done at whatever level the program
is implemented—one or several facilities, a province, or an entire country.

17.      Costs could be categorized as direct vs indirect costs, and fixed vs. variable costs. In the health
setting, direct costs are those that result from health services, lab tests and drug therapy, while indirect
costs are those forgone due to an illness. Fixed costs are those that do not vary as outputs (inpatients and
outpatients) change while variable costs change as the outputs vary. In calculating incremental costs, as
the fixed costs does not change with the change of the volume of health services, they can be omitted from
the analysis.

Financial and economic costs

18.       There are two types of costs to consider. First, there are actual financial outlays or expenditures
made. For RBF interventions, these would include expenditures related to bonuses paid to facilities and
transfers to households, training of health workers and managers, printing of specialized forms, and special
initiatives for measuring quality. Expenditures for upgrading health services, developing and maintaining
the verification system, and developing and maintaining other systems required for the full functioning of
the program should also be included in RBF costs where applicable.

19.     Financial expenditures are only part of the picture. Other inputs, such as staff time, volunteer time,
and donated equipment contribute to the cost of an RBF program. These costs, often referred to as
economic costs, are the second aspect of a cost analysis. Since there are limits on the availability of time
and inputs, those used to produce one health intervention generally, or the RBF intervention in particular,


                                                      5
cannot be used to produce another intervention, and thus represent an opportunity cost that needs to be
evaluated.

20.     Costs of a health intervention are based on identifying the type and quantity of inputs used to
provide and deliver services, multiplying each by its unit price and the percent use for a specific intervention,
such as RBF, and summing the products.

21.     Conducting costing analysis from the economic perspectives is more complicated in most
circumstances, as economic costs lie in different levels of the RBF program depending on how the RBF
program is designed. Obtaining those costs have to track down resources used at the each level. Another
challenge to obtain economic costs is that there is no system that routinely documents those costs, and
primary data collection may be needed.

22.      On the contrary, tracking the financial flow of the program is more feasible financially and
logistically. Program operational budget and expenditure either from RBF program implementers or from
funders are generally available and well documented. As the CEA focuses on incremental costs, fix costs
that do not change after the introduction of the RBF program could be omitted to ease the data collection.
However, it still requires tracking cost information on consumables.

Top-down vs bottom-up approach

23.      There are two basic approaches to collecting and measuring cost information (see Figure 2). A
top-down approach to cost analysis relies on administrative records of expenditures, which are then
allocated to the health intervention on the basis of a series of assumptions or proxies. In a bottom-up
approach, data on type and quantity of inputs, as well as percent allocation of shared inputs (such as
health workers) can be collected from surveys. Unit cost information may need to come from a centralized
source. The bottom-up approach is commonly used in surveys of lower-level health facilities that have
limited information on expenditures and budgets. It can also be used with facility-level administrative data,
such as shipment of drugs and supplies from a central supply to individual health facilities or a district office.
Because the impact evaluation is based on facility-specific data, this approach is recommended in this
module 1. Many costing studies use the combination of top-down and bottom-up approach.

1The top-down approach can be used to allocate the costs of more complex health facilities (for example, hospitals) and
administrative costs to a particular service, and is also the approach used in national health accounting. A related approach,
macro-costing, allocates a hospital’s costs between ambulatory and inpatient care based on the relative costs of an ambulatory
visit and an inpatient bed day derived from analyses of hospital costs (D. S. Shepard, Hodgkin, & Anthony, 2000).

Societal vs. health system perspectives
24.     Both economic and financial costs can be measured from the societal or the health system’s
perspective. A societal perspective seeks to include all costs impacted by a program, while the health
system perspective counts only the costs incurred or saved by the health system, which exclude costs from
households as costs due to the loss of productivities. The societal perspective thus includes costs incurred
by households, employers, non-government organizations, donors or other parties somehow impacted by
an RBF intervention. As RBF programs focus more on public services, the CEA of RBF also concentrates
on publicly-oriented stakeholders, which include donors, governments, and NGOs, and thus uses the health
system perspective.

                                           CONDUCT COST ANALYSIS

25.        Implementing a cost analysis for a program often involves following steps (Ozaltin & Cashin, 2014):

      1.   Define perspectives and timeframe
      2.   Identify cost components and data collection approach
      3.   Discount future costs and amortize costs if applicable
      4.   Generate annual costs per capita
      5.   Generate incremental costs per capita or total incremental costs

Define perspective and timeframe

26.      For this toolkit, we determined that the health system perspective is generally the more relevant to
decision makers. The toolkit is particularly designed to inform donors, their development partners, and
Ministries of Health about the future implementation or expansion of RBF. The theoretical rationale for
conducting CEA is the application of an objective tool for allocating scarce resources. The scarce resource
in this case is the combined donor and government budget for health. Typically, government has a fixed
budget for health and donors have a fixed allocation for a country. The health system perspective thus
helps determine whether and how RBF helps the health system maximize the population’s health within
those constraints. In a country where household survey includes out of pocket expenditure of seeking care
and information to derive indirect costs, such as productivity loss, a societal perspective analysis could be
implemented as an option.

27.       We also determined that the financial approach is more relevant than the economic perspective.
The financial approach recognizes that many decisions must be made within a time-limited perspective of,
say three years. During that period, within government facilities, most personnel, equipment, buildings and
consumables are fixed in aggregate based on the resources available from national and donor revenues.
With the exception of consumables, allocations of resources at the health-facility level also tend to be fixed
over time based on historical staffing, personnel practices, and existing plant and equipment. On the other
hand, quantities of consumables used in a health facility tend to vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis with
demand for services at that facility. This variation occurs explicitly when a health facility can determine its
own resources for purchase of consumables based on its own revenues. Under systems of cost recovery
from users or insurance systems, additional users generate more revenues through payments for visits,
tests, or medicines. Variation based on demand occurs implicitly if a health system allocates consumables
based on need. As a facility increases services, it consumes more drugs and supplies. The combination of
statistics on increased patients and consumption documents higher need, leading to higher future
allocations.

28.      A CEA must always have a defined time span that is applied similarly to costs and effectiveness.
The time span should relate to the time span over which decisions are made. When a public law or
international donor implements a program, they typically commit funding for a prescribed number of years
(typically 1 to 5) of program operations. This period of funding should generally be used as the time span
for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Additionally, the time span of the cost analysis needs to match of the
impact evaluation, which often has a pre-post design and could help define the time span. If a time period



                                                       7
is not stated explicitly, it is often implicit in the lifespan of an initiative’s major input, such as major equipment
acquisition or the training of key staff. Implicitly, the project continues until the training becomes obsolete
or the staff leave the immediate post for which they were trained. If there is no clear implicit timespan, then
it is useful to choose the five-year time period used for many financial analyses. Finally, if the activity is
expected to continue indefinitely in a similar steady state, then a one-year steady-state perspective is most
useful.

29.    If not specified, the subsection below regarding the cost analysis elaborates on our recommended
approach: adopting financial cost from the health system’s perspective.

Identify cost components and data collection approach

30.     From the health system perspective, the major financial costs of a RBF program often includes: (1)
costs of consumables; (2) program costs of the RBF program; (3) other costs that fall outside the health
system that the RBF program is targeted to. It is important for researchers to estimate cost drivers based
on available data or experts’ opinions, to ensure that key cost components are included in the analysis.

Costs of consumables
31.      Costs of consumables are based on the classical principle that aggregate cost equals unit cost
times quantity. Applying this principle to consumables delivered to a health facility, we estimate the quantity
by the amount of consumable items that it receives – either from its own purchases or as transfers from a
regional or national medical store. In principle, consumption could also be measured as the quantity of
consumable items dispensed to patients or consumed in their care. If a facility maintained a comprehensive
system of electronic medical records, then patient-level use could be obtained and aggregated. Without
such records, it is generally not feasible to know patient-level use. The quantities received serve as a
plausible proxy. If average inventories tended to be similar across years, then the approaches would be
identical. While inventories of a specific product might vary from one year to the next, average inventories
across all products would be expected to be similar over time.

32.       The unit cost of consumables is the cost per unit delivered to a health facility. If the health facility
buys the consumables from a local supplier which delivers them, the amount paid represents delivered
cost. If the health facility obtains the consumable item from a central national or state warehouse, then the
cost must be constructed through the steps in logistic system. It begins with the cost of the product arriving
at that a national warehouse from a domestic or international supplier (i.e. c.i.f. cost, cost including
insurance and freight). To this must be added the costs of the distribution system from the point of entry to
the recipient facility. These include warehousing, all administration, regulation, losses (spoilage, expiration,
damage, disappearance, etc.), transportation to a regional or district depot, and transportation from the
region or district to the health facility. Distribution system costs are best aggregated and converted to a
percentage of the cost of materials.
We term the distribution cost factor as                             Box 1. Example.
(1 + distribution cost percentage). We       A small country spent $10 million to procure pharmaceuticals

batch of products, depending on the          percent on average to the procurement cost of pharmaceutical

                                             shipment is then: $10,000 x 1.20 = 12,000.
   Final cost = [acquisition cost] X
       [distribution cost factor]

RBF program costs
34.      The financial costs of the RBF program are all the financial costs in running the program. These
typically occur both within an RBF program office directly responsible for the program, and financial costs
to health facilities for participating in the program.

35.      RBF program office: Staff and other operational costs (for example, rent, utilities, transportation)
for designing the system, sensitizing and updating stakeholders and participants about the program,
verifying performance (for example, contracting with community associations, staff of other health facilities,
and/or audit companies).

36.     Participating health facilities: Their financial costs include office supplies for documenting
performance, such as notebooks, added costs of electronic record systems, banking fees, and oversight
mechanisms (for example, transport fees or sitting allowances for oversight or community committees). If
an economic, rather than a financial perspective had been chosen, the value of time of facility staff would
also be added.

37.       Incentive payments: These are the payments to health facilities for their performance based on
quantity and quality of agreed indicators. They are considered an added financial cost on the assumption
that they are paid on top of resources that would otherwise have gone to the health facility. However, over
time they could become a transfer in lieu of a financial cost. The base allocation could be lowered compared
to what it would have been otherwise (for example, not fully adjusting for inflation or increase in volume) on
the expectation that a facility will generate sufficient resources from RBF to make up the gap. In that way,
RBF allows an average facility to stay even, a below average facility is punished, and an above average
facility continues to be rewarded.

38.     Inputs from the sponsor (donor) at headquarters or country levels: The sponsor, such as a donor
organization, will also devote resources to the design of an RBF program and monitoring and, if needed,
advising on its implementation. This information can be obtained from the donor if available, or
approximated, based on the amount of staff time and travel involved, and typical unit costs for staff days
and travel at comparable levels of experience.

Other costs
39.      If an economic, rather than a financial, cost analysis were being conducted, a variety of induced
costs would also need to be included. Most important would be changes in referrals to other health facilities.
If RBF improved the capacity and utilization of health centers, they might reduce the number of normal
births at district hospitals. On the other hand, if they improved prenatal care, the identification of risk
conditions, and transport, they would increase the number of complicated deliveries or C-sections at
hospitals.

Annualize capital costs
42.       As RBF programs are often implemented for several years, it is likely that some capital inputs are
increased due to the increased both supply or demand resulting from the program. The additional resources
invested in the capital inputs need to be captured. Capital inputs, such as vehicles, motorcycles, computers,
and medical equipment have a durable life of more than one year. In a cost analysis based on annual costs,
there is a need to transform capital expenditures into their annual equivalents. The value of the capital
equipment is divided by the relevant present value (PV). This present value is based on a discount rate and
years of useful life. The years of useful life will be context specific, but some helpful guidance is that vehicles
last between 3-5 years; computers have a useful life of approximately 5 years; refrigerators have a durable
life of 10 years.

43.      Values for the PV can be computed in Excel using the function PV. A discount rate of 3 percent per
year is generally used for health projects (Jamison et al., 2006). The settings are PV(3%,N,-1), where 3
percent is the annual discount rate, N is the number of years for the asset, and -1 is used because of the
convention in Excel that payments and present value are of opposite signs. The total value of an input
should be divided by the PV to obtain its annualized value. For instance, if $250,000 worth of computers
was purchased for an RBF intervention, and computers have an average life of 5 years, the function PV
(3%,5,-1) has a value of 4.5797. The annualized value of computers would be $250,000 divided by 4.5797,
resulting in a cost of $54,589 per year. To make this process more convenient, the authors have created a

45.    However, if there is no change of some capital inputs, such as the cost of building, before and after
the RBF program, the costs of those capital inputs could be removed from the analysis when estimating
incremental costs.

Allocate costs among target services
46.      Sometimes we are interested in the cost of only one or a subset of the program outputs. Examples,
such as maternal child services, facility-based deliveries, vaccinations, and family planning are especially
salient. For such analyses, it is necessary to allocate costs to one or more of these target services. Since
quantity-based incentive payments are tied to each output indicator, their costs can be linked directly to
each output indicator. Likewise, consumables can, in principle, be tied to each target service by knowing
the service to which the consumable applies. Ones that apply to multiple services should, in theory, be
allocated based on their shares of use. However, if such data are not available, they could be allocated in
equal shares among the services to which they apply. Costs of general RBF program operations and costs
of the donor organization in contributing to the design and monitoring are a joint cost. As a first
approximation, these should be allocated in equal shares among all the output indicators. Another option
for allocating joint cost could be based on the share of quantity-based incentive payment (or tariff) to each
output indicator. However, many RBF programs purposely use the tariff as an instrument for strategic
purchasing to encourage the provision of certain high priority services. Therefore, the tariff is not strictly
correlated with the unit cost of service, and using the share of service-specific quantity payment as the
basis for allocation joint cost can be misleading 2.

47.      However, there could be economies of scope, such that the first service would consume a
disproportionate share of resources. As an illustration, a study of vaccination estimated the cost of a one-
dose measles-only program instead of a comprehensive program entailing nine vaccination doses (D S
Shepard, Sanoh, & Coffi, 1986). Because that one vaccine would require the full cold chain, registration,
logistics, and administrative structure, its cost was estimated at 75 percent of the cost of the full program.
If a more precise allocation is important, analysts may wish to convene a Delphi panel to examine the costs
of a specific subset of indicators more precisely. See Box 4.

                                           Box 4. The Delphi technique.
The Delphi technique is one approach for obtaining missing data or for corroborating uncertain
information needed to estimate the burden of disease for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Using this
method, experts are surveyed (independently and anonymously) for their estimates of the missing
information, as well as the rationale behind their recommendations. These experts can also rate the
quality of information they are using to generate their estimates. Individual opinions are collected,
summarized, and returned to each expert for a second opinion. The process is repeated until a
consensus is reached or until a certain number of rounds (three, for instance) are completed. The theory
behind the technique is that the sharing of information and reasoning and repetition will improve the
quality of estimates and reduce individual biases. If disagreement persists after several rounds of the
exercise, the range of values may be used in a sensitivity analysis.

Generate annual costs per capita

48.      To account for the difference of the population sizes in the control and intervention group, the costs
per capital for each group needs to be calculated. In the intervention group, this indicator is calculated as
the total cost of the RBF intervention divided by the population served by the intervention. Similarly, the



2 For example, if family planning coverage is low, the program administrator may decide to put a high tariff to this service to

encourage health workers to go out of their way to encourage family planning acceptance, whereas the true cost of providing this
service is rather small relative to other services.


                                                              12
costs per capital in the control group(s) can be estimated using the corresponding total costs and population
size.

Calculate incremental costs per capita or total incremental costs

49.      As noted, incremental costs are the difference between an RBF program and a control or
comparison program. Because the populations served by each program are typically not identical, these
are best both expressed in per capita terms. If the control is usual care, it is the difference between RBF
costs per capita and control costs per capita. The RBF program in Zambia compared three alternative
models: an output-based RBF program with incentive payments based on outputs in quality and quantity,
an input-based financing alternative (in which facilities received extra resources averaging those of the RBF
program, termed Control 1), and pure control equal to usual care (termed Control 2). In this case there are
three incremental costs, each with its own interpretation:

    •   Output-based RBF vs. Control 2: Added cost of output-based RBF compared to usual care
    •   Output-based RBF vs. Control 1: Added cost of output-based RBF compared to input-based
        financing
    •   Control 1 vs. Control 2: Added cost of output-based RBF compared to input-based financing

50.     Note that the three incremental costs are interrelated. Any one of these incremental costs can be
derived by adding or subtracting the other two. For example, the first is the sum of the second and third.
They can also be related to the incremental effectiveness, as discussed in the subsequent section.

51.      When quantifying the incremental costs and effectiveness, the counterfactual scenario is trying to
answer the question of “what if there is no intervention?” it implicitly wants to quantify the cost or
effectiveness for a scenario for the same size of the population as the intervention, but without intervention.
Therefore, if one would like to estimate the total incremental costs, it can be calculated as the incremental
costs per capita multiplied by the population size in the intervention group.

52.     One should be cautious about the issue of double counting. When examining financial costs, the
focus is on the cash flow and the additional resources resulting from RBF. From example, sometimes,
overhead costs are funded through receipts of incentives. In other cases, overhead costs do not differ
between the two arms. In both circumstances, the overhead costs should not be counted.

             CHAPTER 3. ASSESSING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS
53.     This chapter discusses the estimation of effectiveness. It uses the same perspective and timeframe
as specified in the cost section, and it begins with the estimate of outputs and uses a model to estimate the
change in outcomes.

54.     All RBF programs measure effectiveness as the change of utilization of health services, which is a
foundation of the incentive payments by the program, and is the focus of most impact evaluations (Basinga,
Mayaka, & Condo, 2011; Falisse, Ndayishimiye, Kamenyero, & Bossuyt, 2014; Janssen, Ngirabega Jde,
Matungwa, & Van Bastelaere, 2015; Soeters, Peerenboom, Mushagalusa, & Kimanuka, 2011; Zeng, Cros,
Wright, & Shepard, 2013). However, the change of utilization of services is generally not the effectiveness
measure in a classic CEA, where the effectiveness is often quantified in terms of lives saved, DALYs, or
QALYs. As more health system initiatives arise and policy makers are increasingly interested in how RBF
programs are compared to other initiatives, there is an increasing need to estimate the effectiveness using
standardized outcome measures. To obtain the standard measure requires the conversion of utilization of
health services to lives saved or QALYs/DALYs, involving several steps:

    (1) Estimate RBF programs’ impact on service utilization and quality of care
    (2) Select indicators for cost-effectiveness evaluation
    (3) Convert coverage of health services and quality of care achievement to reduction of mortality,
        specifically the number of lives saved
    (4) Convert reduction of mortality, i.e., numbers of lives saved to QALYs/DALYs



                ESTIMATING RBF PROGRAM IMPACT ON SERVICE UTILIZATION AND QUALITY OF CARE

55.      Virtually all RBF programs in the HIRTF’s portfolio incentivize a package of services that
incorporates both quantity and quality performance. The package can have anywhere from below 10
services offered in the health centers, mostly maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, and family planning, to
a wider spectrum that includes also TB, malaria, curative care, and surgery, to be provided in both health
centers and hospitals. For quality, RBF incentivizes performance as verified and recorded during quarterly
supervisory visits using a balanced score card approach. The score card covers primarily structural quality
of care, although programs are making efforts to include more measurable clinical aspects. Items in the
score card can be either service specific (for example, focusing on structural and clinical aspects of
childbirth delivery), or cross cutting (for example, looking at the quality of health management information
systems (HMIS) and facility cleanliness) 3.

56.      The effectiveness evaluation is heavily linked to the impact evaluation (IE) of RBF programs, the
methodology of which is covered extensively in the existing World Bank Impact Evaluation Toolkit. The
Toolkit was premised on a ground that that evaluations adopt a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or a
quasi-experiment design and rely on primary data from household or facility surveys (World Bank, 2015).
While such designs and data assure rigor in determining a RBF program’s impact, they may be inadequate
for the purpose of conducting a CEA. In particular, household surveys, which typically select households
that have a pregnancy or childbirth in the last 2 years, do not capture program’s effects on many commonly
incentivized services, such as outpatient curative care, TB, prevention of mother-to-child transmission
(PMTCT), and family planning. Analyses of facility surveys are typically done by questionnaire modules
(such as human resource for health, lab equipment, and drugs), thus providing impact results on cross-
cutting quality rather than service specific, making it difficult to convert the results to health effects.

57.     It is recommended that for evaluating effectiveness, CEA should rely primarily on the most rigorous
impact results from the household and facility surveys, while also make use of other data sources. Because

design.


                                                             14
the cost side considers all associated costs of a full RBF program, ideally the effectiveness side takes into
account all possible outcomes on both quality and quantity fronts and other system strengthening aspects,
such as enhanced supportive supervision and autonomy. Two additional sources of data are available to
expand the effectiveness estimate beyond what is typically produced in an impact evaluation report: the
quarterly quality checklist and routine HMIS data maintained by the Ministry of Health (MoH). In addition, a
CEA team is encouraged to perform additional analyses of the facility survey to obtain service specific
impact information. When multiple sources of data are available, researchers need to carefully examine the
accuracy and representativeness of the data. Table 1 lists sources to assess effectiveness.

     • Treatment of acute malnutrition
     • Minor surgery

proposed is considered to be best in depicting causal effectives of RBF.

58.     It is clear from Table 1 that the most robust effectiveness evidence the team can obtain is on the
key set of maternal and child health (MCH) services, such as ANC, institutional delivery, postnatal care
PNC, and vaccination. This provides additional justification for focusing the CEA on a small package or
single indicators (delivery, vaccination) rather than looking at the whole comprehensive package of
services. In some countries, the household survey also provides information on quality of care in this
package, such as whether the pregnant woman had blood and urine tests during her ANC checkup.

59.      Given that a household survey covers only a small set of services, use of HMIS data is inevitable
if teams want to perform a CEA of a full incentivized package. A major advantage of HMIS data is that they
are available (in many countries) for both treatment and control facilities and they allow for the examination
of trends over a long period before, during, and after the program. Unfortunately, HMIS data are known for
having sub-standard quality. Furthermore, the patterns of error may be different between treatment and
control facilities with direction of error being unknown, making it problematic to compare between the two
using HMIS data. While countries are making great efforts to improve the quality of their HMIS data, for the
purpose of the exercise at hand, i.e., conducting CEA of RBF programs, it is recommended that the facility
surveys collect full HMIS data from the surveyed facilities for at least one quarter. The full HMIS data are
to be collected from original registries of different services to improve the precision of data recorded.

60.      Data from the quarterly quality checklist, while fairly detailed, are typically only available for
treatment facilities. It is recommended that they are used to calibrate the trend line and triangulate with
survey data. Currently, it is very difficult to map the items in the quarterly checklist with the items in the
survey questionnaire. It is recommended that going forward, facility surveys include at least major items in
the checklist, so that data are available for both baseline and end line periods in both intervention and
control facilities.

                         SELECTING INDICATORS FOR COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS

61.      Depending on research design of RBF programs, the evaluation of RBF on incentivized indicators
could take various forms. Here we use the conventional experimental research design as an example to
assess the impact of RBF on utilization of health services. As mentioned above, most RBF programs
incentivize a package of services and not a few individual service indicators. Table 2 provides a summary
of indicators that are commonly used for receiving incentives.

62.      Given the comprehensiveness of the incentivized benefit package in many RBF programs, a CEA
taking into account the whole package is very challenging. In such cases, one option is to select one or
several services, or a smaller and more focused package of services, to perform CEA. We have shown
how to allocate overall program’s cost to specific services. On the effectiveness side, the selection of which
services to perform CEA can be guided by several factors:

    1. RBF’s impact on utilization: It is important to include services on which RBF is expected to have a
       large impact. However, the choice should be made before the data are available. Otherwise, the
       results would be a form of cherry picking, such as picking a winning lottery ticket after all the entry
       numbers have been exposed.
    2. Program’s focus: what is the key priority of the program? In the case of the World Bank’s RBF
       programs, a clear focus is maternal and child health. So selected services could be a package of
       MCH services only, or could be institutional delivery and vaccination only.
    3. Effectiveness: It is also important to include services that have a large impact on mortality. This
       could be done by reviewing literature or conducting expert consultations.
    4. Cost: Similarly important is to examine the cost of RBF programs. Services that consume a large
       amount of incentives should be included in the evaluation.

                              CONVERTING COVERAGE OF SERVICES TO LIVES SAVED

63.      Effectiveness depends on (1) coverage of the interventions; (2) size of affected population—the
absolute population of the intervention area: (3) proportion of the population affected by the intervention of
interest; (4) initial risk of the underlying population (which may depend on demographics, location, poverty,
and other factors); (5) the effect size of the intervention in terms of preventing occurrence of illnesses or
deaths, which is often measured in terms of relative risks (RR) or odds ratio (OR).

64.     Converting service coverage to lives saved is the core component of the effectiveness evaluation
in the CEA of RBF. It is assumed that the increase of utilization of services will bring about health benefits
to target populations through (1) preventing occurrence of diseases (i.e. vaccination); (2) effectively
managing illnesses to improve the quality of life, and (3) reducing risks of death. So far, the software Lives
Saved Tool (LiST), discussed below, is the most comprehensive tool available to convert coverage of a
wide variety of health services to health outcomes (that is, reduction of mortality/the number of lives saved),
and is employed in the toolkit to estimate the effectiveness of the CEA of RBF programs.

Basics of LiST tool

65.      The LiST tool was developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) and was
incorporated    into    the   software    of   SPECTRUM,        which     can     be     downloaded       from
http://www.avenirhealth.org/software-spectrum. The LiST tool aims to estimate the impact of different
interventions on MCH outcomes, which is consistent to the goal of RBF programs. The LiST tool has been
widely applied in projecting the health impact of interventions and is advocated by the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for decision making (Boschi-Pinto, Young, & Black, 2010; Stenberg et al., 2014).
The LiST tool requires numerous inputs to produce desired results on health outcomes. Figure 3 shows the
inputs to the LiST tool. One set of key inputs for the LiST tool will come from results from the impact
evaluation to provide information on baseline and end line coverage of the services. Other inputs are often
preloaded based on literature and country-specific statistics. We will use LiST in this toolkit to obtain lives
saved from interventions 4.

   66.      There are several issues to be aware of when using LiST. First, LiST does not work alone, and it
   is based on the module of DemProj, the primary purpose of which is to project population size at the national
   or subnational level. In RBF program evaluation, DemProj will project the population size in RBF areas.
   Second, if the CEA includes interventions of family planning, the module of FamPlan will be used. Third,
   LiST can also be used for HIV/AIDS interventions, in conjunction with AIDS impact model (AIM), to estimate
   the impact of AIDS treatment and PMTCT services on health outcomes. It should be noted that LiST cannot
   handle RBF’s impact on adult health (except for health among pregnant women). Assumptions are required
   if the impact of an RBF program on adult health is included in a CEA. Fourthly, in addition to the inputs of
   current and future coverage of health services, there are other parameters that should be adjusted before
   implementing the software. Figure 4 shows the LiST tool interface in Spectrum.

   67.      The key formula (Avenir Health, 2015) to estimate the impact in the LiST is

                            %   = {  × (  −   ) ×   }/(1 −  ×   )



   for Jth intervention, ith causes.




                                                                                                     18
where, %RedMortij represents the reduction in mortality (i) before and after an intervention (j) implemented
over time, t
Iij = Effectiveness of intervention j in reducing mortality from cause i
Pjo = Baseline coverage of the intervention j
Pjt = End line coverage for the intervention j
AFij = Affected Fraction; proportion of deaths from the cause that is due to the specific condition addressed
by the intervention
i = mortality for specific cause of death
j = intervention that reduces mortality I,
With multiple interventions, the model uses a multiplicative approach to estimate the combined effect.
                                                                           
                                                                                                                
                                  % = 1 − � �(1 − % )

68.     Thus converting proportional coverage of services (P) to impact on mortality (I) requires obtaining
parameters either from country statistics or international literature. The key parameters are: (1) distribution
of causes of death for neonatal, post-neonatal, as well as pregnant women; (2) the change in coverage of
various interventions; (3) effectiveness of the interventions in terms of reduction of mortality.

Steps to using LiST for estimating number of lives saved

69.     Once researchers have set up population and health status parameters, the LiST tool could be
applied to model the number of lives saved from interventions. Here we focus on the number of lives saved
because most interventions in RBF programs focus on preventing or treating acute illnesses, where the
impact on improving morbidity, in comparison with improving mortality, is likely to be small.

70.      Examining the relationship between disease burden from mortality and that from morbidity can help
improve the accuracy of the estimation. According to WHO, about 75 percent of total disease burden in
Africa was due to mortality in 2004 (World Health Organization, 2008). Assuming this pattern is applicable
to the intervention of interest in terms of gaining QALYs, the results derived from the reduction of mortality
can be multiplied by a factor of 1.33 (calculated as 1/0.75) to obtain the gains from the reduction of both
mortality and morbidity. Similar data for 2010 and 2013 are available from the Institute of Health Metrics
and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington (www.healthdata.org). This calculation uses the
simplifying assumption that the effect of an intervention on morbidity is proportional to its effect on mortality.
Refining this assumption, such as might be needed for many forms of curative care which address health
problems that are uncomfortable or even disabling, but not fatal, would require substantial additional
modeling that is beyond the scope of this toolkit. Unfortunately, we are not aware of another tool as powerful
and user friendly as LiST to address morbidity impacts.

71.       To use the LiST tool, it is required to:

      1. Calculate baseline and end line coverage of services, as well the coverage of service in the
         interim.
      2. Adjust key parameters in LiST tool
      3. Set up the baseline and alternative scenario: The baseline scenario tries modeling the situation
         on what the service utilization would be if there were no RBF. The information from the control
         group will be used to generate such a scenario. The alternative scenario provides utilization of
         service under an RBF program. If an RBF program has an arm of input financing, that could be
         included as an alternative scenario as well.
      4. Implement LiST tool and compare outcomes: each scenario will generate a set of health
         outcomes regarding mortality. We are able to compare the outcome directly.

72.       Each of these steps is explained in detail in the following sections.




                                                                         19
Calculate baseline and end line coverage of services

73.     In the baseline scenario, as counterfactual of “what would happen if there were no interventions,”
the time trend in the control group(s) should be factored in the scenario for the intervention group. In the
example below (Table 3), the net impact of the RBF program should consider the time trend of 20 percent
(50-30 percent) in the control group.

                                 Table 3. Example of impact evaluation
                        Group                             Baseline                   End line                     Difference
                       Intervention group                 40%                        75%                          35%
                       Control group                      30%                        50%                          20%


74.       The difference in difference analysis shows the RBF program improved the institutional delivery by
15% (35%-20%). Assuming the baseline year is 2012 and the end line year is 2014, the coverage of
institutional delivery for the baseline scenario without RBF and the scenario with RBF is presented below
(Table 4).

                   Table 4. Coverage of institutional delivery under two scenarios
                                                        2012                                  2013                  2014
                     Baseline scenario                  40%                                   ?                     60%
                     Scenario with RBF                  40%                                   ?                     75%


75.     However, the coverage of institutional delivery for the year 2013 is unknown in Table 4.
Assumptions will be needed to estimate it if a country does not conduct an annual assessment of the RBF
program. Here we provide two examples to conduct the estimation, one using a linear assumption and the
other using an “S” shaped assumption for the coverage of health services.

76.     With the linear assumption, Table 5 provides the estimates for the coverage of institutional delivery
in 2013 for both baseline and RBF scenarios.

                              Table 5. Coverage using linear interpolation
                                                              2012                            2013                  2014
                     Baseline scenario                        40%                             50%                   60%
                     Scenario with RBF                        40%                             57.5%                 75%


77.     If we assume the increase of the institutional delivery follows an “S” shape, then we can use logistic
function to estimate the coverage for 2013.

                                            
                                      ln �                                     � =  +  
                                          1 − 

78.     Under the “S” shape assumption, Table 6 shows the coverage for the baseline and RBF scenarios

                             Table 6. Coverage using logistic interpolation
                                                          2012                         2013                       2014
                        Base scenario                     40.0%                        50.0%                      60.0%
                        Scenario with                     40.0%                        58.6%                      75.0%

                                                                       20
79.     We will then use the coverage information to feed to the LiST tool to convert the coverage of
services into lives saved.

Adjustment of key parameters in LiST tool

80.      The key parameters of the LiST, as shown in Figure 3, will need to be adjusted to reflect the
situation of the RBF program. The adjustments are explained below.

81.        Demographics: The LiST tool starts with demography projection, which is loaded in a separate
module named “DemProj.” In this module, researchers can select a country to load its national population
data from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). If an RBF program operates at the subnational
level, such as the regional or district level, or in areas where demographic characteristics are so different
from national characteristics, parameters for projecting population, such as total fertility rate, age specific
fertility rate, sex ratio at birth, life expectancy, immigration, and baseline population size, should be adjusted
based on known statistics. If one assumes that all parameters for population projection are similar to
national statistics and the only difference is the size of baseline population, researchers can apply a fraction
factor to the national population to obtain the sub-national population, using the function of “Multiply” in the
figure below. Figure 5 shows the tabs where parameters could be changed to modify the population
projection.

82.      Health Status: When the country population data are loaded, the associated data on nutrition
status, health status, abortion rate and still birth rate and its causes are also loaded. The default values are
drawn mainly from literature and may not be the data from the country of the study. If the CEA team has
country-specific data, those numbers could be modified to better fit the model. Figure 6 show the
parameters on baseline child health status for adjustment. As some interventions are effective for a
particular cause(s) of death, setting these parameters appropriately would ensure the accuracy of the
estimation. Other tabs, such as pathogens for diarrhea, pneumonia and meningitis, can be changed too if
necessary.

83.     Mortality and causes of death: Before estimating the impact of the maternal and child
interventions, it is important to ensure mortality parameters are correctly applied in the model, which include
baseline maternal mortality and child mortality and causes of death. In the tabs of baseline child mortality
and baseline maternal mortality (Figure 7), researchers can review and update associated parameters if
needed.

84.     Impact matrix: LiST tool contains a wide variety of maternal child health service interventions.
Table 7 provides key services that could be modelled in the tool, which is consistent with incentivized
services under RBF.

                                                 Antimalarial treatment
85.       The impact of these services is modelled through direct or indirect channels. For example,
institutional delivery/skilled birth delivery saves lives indirectly through its influence on the distribution on
basic emergency obstetric care, comprehensive emergency obstetric care, essential care for pregnant
women, and clean practices of delivery, etc. (Table 8), while the impact of IPTp is directly modelled using
the efficacy of IPTp.

*Effect size shows the proportion of deaths due to a specific cause that are reduced by the intervention.
For example, Basic Emergency Obstetric Care reduces by 0.2 (that is, 20 percent) the number of deaths
due to ante-partum hemorrhage.

86.     Under the menu of “effectiveness,” researchers can modify the effectiveness size of health
interventions, if they have recent country-specific data. For example for maternal interventions, the LiST
tool provides default values for the effectiveness of basic emergency obstetrical care or (BEmOC) and
comprehensive emergency obstetrical care (CEmOC) on antepartum hemorrhage. Parameters can also be
modified for other causes of maternal death, including postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive diseases of
pregnancy, sepsis, abortion, obstructed labor, ectopic, malaria, and other direct and indirect causes.

Set up baseline and alternative scenario for key services

87.      With the adjustment of the key parameters and the baseline coverage of the services of interest to
be modelled, a baseline scenario will be fully established. Researchers will have to save the LiST project
for the baseline scenario and repeat the same process to establish an alternative scenario by changing the
coverage of services of interest and save the LiST project in another name. In Spectrum, more than two
scenarios can be generated, and each scenario should be saved separately in order to compare results.

Implement LiST tool and generate results

88.      In order to compare the results from different scenarios, LiST allows users to load multiple projects
simultaneously and calculate results for each project, such as neonatal, child, and maternal deaths,
mortality rates, nutrition status and incidence of illness, as shown in Figure 8. For neonatal, child and
maternal deaths, LiST provides not only the overall number of deaths under each scenario, but also the

89.      Table 9 shows the number of deaths among pregnant women and children under five for two
scenarios (baseline scenarios and a scenario with increased coverage of institutional delivery) in a
hypothetical country. An impact evaluation typically has data for each year from the intervention (RBF)
areas and the control areas. The LiST tool is set up to compare a “Baseline” or current policy with an
“Alternative” policy. As discussed under “Calculate baseline and end line coverage of services,” to adapt
the LiST tool for the needed calculation, some adjustments were needed. Specifically, we adjusted the
Baseline to reflect the situation that would have occurred in the intervention area if the intervention had not
been implemented. In that case, it would have started with the actual value in the intervention area prior to
the start of the RBF program, and it would have evolved according to the subsequent year-to-year changes
observed in the control area. Thus, our baseline is set to the population size and distribution of the

intervention area. The baseline initial coverage is based on the actual initial coverage in the intervention
area. The baseline coverage in each subsequent year is based on the baseline coverage in the intervention
area plus the change in the control area from the first year to that year. The coverage in the final year under
baseline thus reflects the change in coverage in the control area. The lives saved under “Baseline” indicate
the number of lives that would have been saved in the intervention area due solely to trends in coverage
observed in the control area.

90.      The “Alternative” shows the actual lives saved in the intervention area due to increased coverage
in that area. With LiST and a little more calculation using Excel, the net number of deaths averted due
specifically to RBF is estimated as the “Difference” in Table 9 and subsequent tables. Adding these
difference amounts in Table 9 for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 shows that 33 maternal deaths and 442
child deaths were averted over the three years.

Institutional delivery
91.       Let us first compare the baseline scenario and the scenario where institutional delivery is improved.
We use parameters from Table 10 to simulate the analysis.

                        Table 10. Institutional delivery coverage from 2012-2014
                                                2012         2013         2014

92.     Setup the baseline scenario: In this example, we focus on institutional delivery/skilled birth
attendance. In the LiST tool, under the LiST main menu, click “coverage””Childbirth”, where users can
change the coverage of skilled birth attendance (SBA)/institutional delivery). Under the baseline scenario,
enter the values estimated from Table 10, as shown in Figure 9, and save the LiST project.

93.    Under the alternative scenario, users need to change the coverage of institutional delivery under
the same tab as the one in the baseline scenario (Figure 10), and save the project in another name.

94.    Assuming that other parameters are appropriate, after running the model, the results on child and
maternal deaths are shown in Figures 11 and 12, respectively.

by summing the respective results, which is shown in Table 11.

96.      In total, 18 pregnant women and 250 children under 1 month are saved from improved institutional
delivery. Due to more children surviving the first month of birth under the scenario with improved institutional
delivery, 5 more children ages 1-60 months die.

Antenatal care, IPTp, and post-natal care
97.    Similarly, if one would like to estimate the impact of ANC, IPTp and PNC on reduction of deaths,
corresponding parameters should be changed. The parameters for ANC and IPTp are under the tab of
“Coverage”  “Pregnancy” (Figure 13), while the parameters for PNC are under the tab of “Coverage” 
“Preventive” .

Vaccination

BCG, polio, pentavalent, pneumococcal, rotavirus and measles (Figure 14).

Family planning
99.     Family planning plays an important role in reducing maternal and child mortality. To model the
impact of family planning, a separate module, named “FamPlan” needs to be used.

100.    Under the FamPlan, users are able to modify the coverage of various family planning approaches
(under tab of “Family planning”  “Method mix,” Figure 15), and effectiveness of family approaches (under
the tab of “Family Planning”  “Effectiveness,” Figure 16).

Other considerations

101.    For services consisting of many disease categories, such as curative care for adults and minor
surgeries, and services that are not included in the LiST, the LiST tool is not able to estimate their impact.
A few aspects should be considered:

    1. Distribution of curative visits and minor surgeries. Users need to select diseases that have a high
       frequency of health facility visits or surgical cases.
    2. The treatment effect. Users need to consider including the diseases that a treatment can
       effectively reduce mortality and morbidity.

102.     Once diseases are selected, researchers would need to review literature to estimate the efficacy
of the treatment/surgery.




                                                     30
103.    There are several approaches that could be adopted to deal with these services:

    1. If literature has DALYs averted or QALYs gained per case for treatment, those values could be
       used directly
    2. If literature does not have information on DALYs or QALYs associated with a particular treatment,
       and if the treatment of illness among children could be modelled with LiST, such as the treatment
       of malaria, the results from children could be used to estimate the treatment effect among adults,
       with proper assumptions.
    3. If literature does not have information on DALYs or QALYs for a particular treatment, and no
       effect could be estimated from children to derive the impact on adults, then a comprehensive
       estimate should be conducted based on disease distribution, efficacy of treatment, and population
       size affected, a similar process as LiST does for maternal and child services.

    INCLUDE QUALITY OF CARE AND OTHER POTENTIAL SYSTEM EFFECTS IN THE EFFECTIVENESS ESTIMATION

104.     Many RBF programs pay for improved quality of care and encourage other system strengthening
efforts, such as enhanced supportive supervision and better decision making power for frontline workers.
Without considering such aspects, the effectiveness
of the program is likely to be underestimated. Most                  Box 5. The quadratic function

* Impact is quantified as the percentage of full health benefits achieved from the intervention.

106.     Assuming the result from the Delphi survey shows that 50 percent of quality leads to 20 percent
health impact, then the function will go through the point of (0.5, 0.2). With three points, the three
coefficients, a, b and c, are initially unknowns that will be determined.

we can obtain a = 1.2, b=-0.2 and c = 0.

107.    We assume that the results from LiST take perfect quality, meaning having the quality index of 100
percent. If the baseline and end line quality of care is not 100 percent, then the impact on lives saved from
LiST should be adjusted according to the quadratic function. Here we use quality-adjusted coverage
approach to correct the results from LiST (See Box 6).

                                        Box 6. Quality adjustment impact
 Case 1. This example assumes that the Delphi survey reveals that 50 percent quality leads to 20
 percent health impact (measured as number of deaths averted) for vaccination among children. The
 quality of care remains constant during the RBF implementation period (1 year), as 50 percent, while
 the coverage has been improved, increasing from 40 percent to 60 percent. The LiST tool estimates
 1000 would die without RBF, while 900 would die with RBF, with 100 lives saved from RBF under
 perfect quality of care. . Due to low quality of care, instead of saving 100 children, the RBF saves 20
 children (100*20%).

 Case 2. This example has all the assumptions as in case 1, plus the assumption that the quality of care
 is increased from 50% to 60% in a year. Instead of saving 20 children, this scenario shows that the
 improved quality of care saved 33 more children, with a total of 53 children saved by the RBF program
 (100/20%*11%), as calculated below. Please note that this is a dramatic example. A 20 percent
 increase of quality of care doubles health gains.

108.     A Delphi survey would also help generate the quality index from primary survey results. For services
included in RBF programs, the quality could be measured with several components, including general
quality indicators (that is, administration and management, and HMIS) and service-specific quality
indicators (i.e., supply chain, clinical process, and availability of equipment), and these components play
different roles in determining the overall quality of a particular service. For example, the supply chain
weights more in quantifying quality of service for vaccination, while qualification and clinical process
probably play a more important role in estimating the quality of prenatal care. Table 12 shows an example
of various quality components. Some are service-specific while others are general.

109.    Appendixes 2 and 3 provide an example of Delphi questionnaire to estimate the relative importance
of generic and specific quality indicator, and the components included in the service-specific quality
indicators in determining the overall quality of care for each service. See Box 7.

110.    If quality survey already has the quality index in percentage scale for each service, then a Delphi
survey is not needed.

                          Box 7. Using Delphi survey to estimate quality index.
 The table below provides quality scores of a health facility from the quality assessment, as well as the
 weights obtained from Delphi survey. Assuming relative weights between general indicators and service
 specific indicators are 0.21 and 0.79 respectively, and the relative weight for drugs and supplies,
 equipment, and staff are 0.51, 0.33 and 0.16, it is estimated that the quality index is 0.79.

111.     It is recognized that the weights for each components would be different from countries to countries,
and thus it is important to ask similar questions during the Delphi survey. An international Delphi panel can
be built up with pooled results from countries where the Delphi survey is conducted to estimate standardized
weight for each component.

  CONVERT LIVES SAVED TO QUALITY ADJUST LIFE YEARS (QALYS) OR DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIVED YEARS
                                            (DALYS)

112.     The LiST tool could produce numbers of lives saved from interventions for both pregnant women
and children. The number of lives saved could be used as outcome measures in the cost-effectiveness
analysis to estimate the cost per live saved. As the RBF program targets to different populations (children
vs. pregnant women), often it is more informative to estimate cost per QALY gained or DALY averted.
However, the LiST does not generate the results on QALYs gained or DALYs averted, which have to be
calculated manually. One would first estimate DALYs averted or QALYs gained per life saved for distinct
population groups (i.e. pregnant women and children under 5) , and then multiply them by the number of
lives saved to obtain the total QALYs gained or DALYs averted due to the program.

113.     QALYs are calculated by adjusting the years of life gained by quality of life (QoL). QoL is measured
on a scale of 0 to 1, where a value of 1 usually represents perfect health, and 0, death. Quality of life is
multiplied by the years of life gained to yield a measure that incorporates both quantity and quality. DALYs
are calculated by summing the morbidity and mortality averted by an intervention. Averted years of life lost
are added to the years of life that would have been spent in disability in the absence of the intervention.




                                                        34
114.    DALYs measure the burden of disease and incorporate both the years of life lost (YLL) due to
premature mortality and those lost from varying degrees of disability associated with disease (YLD) in a
population:

                                                              DALY = YLL + YLD

115.    Methods and tools for calculating DALYs are available from the WHO Burden of Disease website,
including detailed guidance from the WHO National Burden of Disease Manual (Mathers, Vos, Lopez,
Salomon, & Ezzati, 2001).

116.    The DALY is based on loss of time in various states of ill health. Time lost due to premature mortality
(YLL) is a function of the death rate and the duration of life lost due to a death at each age. Deaths at all
ages contribute to the calculation of the burden of disease, and deaths at the same age contribute equally
to the burden of disease.

117.    The time lost due to a disability (YLD) is estimated from the incidence of disabilities, the average
duration of each disability, and a disability weight. The basic formula for calculating YLD is: 5

                                                                  YLD = I x DW x L

118.    where I is the number of incident cases in the reference period, DW is the disability weight (in the
range 0-1, 0 means perfect health while 1 means death, the reverse of the scale used in QALYs, and L is
the average duration of disability (measured in years).

119.      Estimating YLL requires information on total deaths for the condition (by age group and gender) or
death rates for the condition per 1,000, and the average age at death for each age group. For estimating
YLD, the worksheet requires information on incidence rates of disease/condition, age at onset, duration of
the disease or condition, and a disability weight. Total DALYs for the disease/condition is the sum of YLL
and YLD. The model also discounts future healthy years of life at 3 percent and the default does not include
age weighting, though this could be changed in the model. If the country team does not wish to factor in the
disability (morbidity component) of a disease or condition, the measure of effectiveness could focus on the
YLL estimation of the model only, which is the case used in this toolkit.

120.    Similarly, in order to convert the lives saved to QALYs, the information that is needed is the (1)
average age at death, (2) life expectancy at the average of death; (3) quality of life if one survived. With this
information, QALYs gained from each saved life could be estimated manually using the formula for fatal
cases (Sassi, 2006):

                                                                                                       1 −  −(−)
                                                =  ∗
                                                                                                                
or
                                                                                                                   
                                                  = ∑+
                                                                                                 =                        .
                                                                                                             (1+ )−

121.    Here Q is the average quality of life over if one survived, Qt is quality of life at age of t, e is Napier’s
mathematical constant (2.718…), r is discount rate, which is often 3%, and L is life expectancy at the age
of death (a).

122.    In the case of an RBF program, using an estimate of the number of lives saved for both children
and pregnant women, we are able to apply the information to estimate the total DALYs averted or QALYs
gained due to the RBF program. Taking QALYs as an example, Table 13 shows how QALYs are estimated
from saving one pregnant woman’s life, assuming that the average age of program women is 25 years old,


5   This is the formula with zero discounting and uniform age weights.


                                                                                     35
the life expectancy for women at age of 25 is 58 years old, and the quality of life (QoL) from age 25-58
follows the patterns specified in the column of Qt. Using the second formula mentioned above, the total
QALYs gained is calculated as 18.33 QALYs/life saved. Since the information on Qt is not likely to be
available in the country, researchers could also conduct a Delphi survey to obtain it or search for literature
from comparable countries with available information, or conduct a survey on quality of life from a
representative sample to estimate it.

 Table 11 shows that there are 250 children under 1 month saved from improved institutional

 QALYs.

 According to Table 11, five more children died in the alternative scenario. QALYs saved from
 children of 1-60 months would be a negative value, which is -5 X 21.62 = -108.10 QALYs




                                                           37
125.    We then combine QALYs gained from pregnant women and children together to generate the total
QALYs gained due to the loss of lives. Combining the results from Boxes 8 and 9, we can estimate the total
QALYs gained from improved institutional delivery due to the RBF program is 5701.84, which is calculated
as the sum of 329.94, 5480.00, and -108.10.

126.    The calculation of DALYs averted per life saved is very similar to that of QALYs (Gold, Stevenson,
& Fryback, 2002), with two differences: (1) DALY uses disability weight (DW) rather than quality of life in
the calculation; and (2) DALY includes the age weight factor/function in the calculation. Assuming uniform
age weights, DALYs averted per life saved could be calculated as:

                                                                                                        1 −  −(−)
                                  = (1 −  ) ∗
                                                                                                                 
where DW is the average disability weights if those who die survived the rest of their life. DW could be
derived from the global burden disease study implemented by Institute of Health Matrix and Evaluation,
using DALYs due to morbidity divided by life years in the target population in the same period.

127.     Both QALYs and DALYs are widely used in cost-effectiveness analysis. There are some differences
between them. For example, all QALYs have the same value, be it a QALY gained by a young person or
by an elderly person. DALYs, as originally defined, gave greater weight per year alive to people in prime
ages of 20 to 50, and lesser weight outside those age ranges. However, the version of DALYs used in the
2010 Global Burden of Disease and subsequently treats all ages the same (see www.healthdata.org/gbd).
The construction of both QALYs and DALYs also assumes a small gain is the same for many people as a
large gain for few people. While the absolute levels of DALYS and QALYs differ, changes due to any health
intervention are the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. A beneficial intervention would increase the
QALYs but decrease the DALYs by the same amount. Neither QALYs nor DALYs directly address income
levels directly, but both are tools to address equity. As they count a year of life the same whether enjoyed
by a rich or poor person, they count everyone the same. However, if a country does not have accurate
estimate of Qt and DW and life expectancy at the age of death, estimation of DALYs averted or QALYs
gained could be optional.

                            CHAPTER 4. PUTTING IT TOGETHER: GENERATING ICERS
129.    Based on the cost estimation and outcome measures, such as the number of lives saved, the
QALYs gained or DALYs averted, we should be able to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER).

                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                  =
                                                                                                                         ,     

130.      Depending on researchers’ interests, one could generate the ICER for the overall RBF program,
for a particular service, or for a package of services. Box 10 provides an example on calculating ICER for
institutional delivery under the RBF program using both the number of lives saved and QALYs gained as
measures of outcomes. For conducting a CEA of a package of services, researchers can repeat the same
process as that for the institutional delivery, modify multiple parameters in the LiST tool to estimate the
combined impact from a package of services, and estimate the ICER at the end.

                                                                                                                                  Box 10. Example of calculating ICER
 In a hypothetical country, assuming the total RBF operational costs is $10 million over 2012-2014, of
 which 15% is devoted to institutional delivery, incremental costs for consumables for institutional
 delivery are estimated at $3 million, and the coverage of institutional delivery is improved by 15% as
 shown in Table 10. LiST estimates the number of lives saved of 263 (18+250-5) from institutional
 delivery, which is shown in Table 11. We have estimated that 5701.84 QALYs are saved, based on
 the results from Boxes 6 and 7. Then

 ICER for institutional delivery could be calculated as

                                                                                                           15% ∗ 10,000,000 + 3,000,000

  Box 11. Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hypothetical package of RBF services, part 1
Description. A hypothetical country has implemented an RBF program with an experimental
design supported by the World Bank from 2011 to 2013. The RBF program operates in 10
districts with a combined population of 1.5 million persons. Comparative data are available from
10 matched control (usual care) districts with a combined population of 1.7 million persons. For
illustration, we assume that the country has demographic, epidemiologic, and economic
conditions similar to those of Zambia. In 2013, Zambia had a population of 14.53 million and a
per capita GDP of $1845.

Cost analysis. Data from the country’s national pharmaceutical service shows that medications
and supplies with a value of $15 million ($8 million in 2012 and $7 million in 2013) were shipped
to district offices and health facilities in the RBF districts, compared to $10 million ($5 million in
2012 and 2013 respectively) in the control districts. In addition, RBF facilities made local
purchases (funded through user fees and government funding) of $2 million (1 million in 2012 and
2013 respectively) compared to $1 million (0.5 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively) in control
facilities. The RBF districts received $4 million ($1.5 million and 2.5 million in 2012 and 2013
respectively) in incentive payments, while the control districts received no such payments. An in-
country program office provided or arranged training, program management, service verification,
and administration of incentive payments at a cost of $0.8 million per year. In addition, the World
Bank spent $0.3 million ($0.2 million and 0.1 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively) on staff time
and travel to oversee the experimental area. In addition, $250,000 worth of computers was
purchased for an RBF intervention, and computers have an average life of 5 years.

Note: The example does not adjust for discounting, annualization for simplicity.

These calculations show that the incremental cost per capita is $8.74 (i.e., $15.12 - $6.38) over 2
years.

       Box 13. Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hypothetical package of RBF services, part 3
 Effectiveness. The evaluation conducted baseline and end line household surveys in 2011 and 2013,
 which showed greater improvements in the RBF area compared to the control area on numerous
 indicators. These improvements in the quantity and quality of services led to the projected saving,
 when applied to the intervention area of 1.5 million people saved the lives of 45 pregnant women and
 450 children. Each maternal death averted generates 18.33 QALYs. Each child under 5 saved (for
 example, from vaccination against childhood diseases) generates 21.62 QALYs. These results
 generate 824.9 QALYs in pregnant women and 9,729.0 in children for a total of 10,553.9 gained in the
 intervention area population over 2 years. To make this result consistent with the cost data, we
 convert to a per capita basis, getting 0.007035 QALYs per capita. This was calculated as 10,553.9
 divided by 1,500,000.

 Cost-effectiveness. Dividing the cost by effectiveness we have $8.74/ 0.007035 equals $1,242 per
 QALY gained through the RBF program. To interpret this, we note that the cost-effectiveness ratio is
 substantially below the per capita GDP of Zambia ($1,845). Thus, RBF is highly cost-effective in this
 context. In using these results to think about the future evolution of this hypothetical RBF program, we
 note that vaccinations are already doing very well and have little scope for further improvement. On
 the other hand, there is substantial scope for further increase in institutional deliveries, intermittent
 preventive treatment, and quality. Future RBF programs may wish to incentivize those indicators even
 more and reduce the incentive for vaccinations.

132.     Please note that if one would like to examine the ICER of institutional delivery, then both
effectiveness and cost measures should be limited to institutional delivery. For the effectiveness, users are
only allowed to change the parameters related to institutional delivery in the LiST tool, such as baseline
and end line coverage of institutional delivery. Correspondingly, the incremental costs should also be
estimated for institutional delivery only. The allocation of costs for a particular service and a package of
services were mentioned above.


133.    The ICER can be calculated using the aggregate amount of costs and aggregate effectiveness over
the study period as shown in Box 10, and it could also be calculated on an annual basis, using annual costs
and annual effectiveness. As each program goes through a maturation process, we recommend using
average annual costs and average annual effectiveness in the CEA and conducting sensitivity analysis.

                                        SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN CEA

134.     Uncertainty in a CEA can arise from many different sources, including areas of methodological
disagreement, parameter uncertainties (for example, unknown parameters, disagreements about
appropriate values, uncertainty surrounding the estimation process, data from a specific population,
sampling variability), and modeling. The objective of the sensitivity analysis is to test the robustness of the
base-case results against the most important assumptions. There are different ways to perform sensitivity
analysis, but the most commonly used for CEA is to investigate how the results change as a result of
changing the value of each important assumption while holding all other aspects of the analysis constant.
A second alternative investigates whether best- and worst-case scenarios of assumptions change the
conclusions of the analysis significantly. Other alternatives involve statistical analysis of testing the effect
the distributions of key parameters have on the distribution of results (i.e., Monte Carlo analysis). Table 14
highlights some of the approaches that can be taken in the analysis.

135.    For cost-effectiveness of RBF mechanisms, critical factors to consider in a sensitivity analysis
include assumptions regarding:

    •    Assumptions on costs: If a country has a good expenditure tracking system, economic costs may
         be possible and CEA using economic costs could be examined.
    •    Utilization of services: The variation of results of the impact evaluation can also be estimated to
         understand the uncertainty.
    •    Effectiveness of interventions, measured in reduction of mortality, from the utilization of the various
         maternal-child health services and quality of care performance: We assumed the effectiveness
         used in the list as efficacy of the intervention. This assumption could be changed.
    •    Epidemiological parameters (case fatality rates, incidence rates, etc.): the variation of
         epidemiological parameters should be investigated if the sample size for obtaining this parameters
         is small.




                                                       42
    •   Time horizon and maturation of RBF program: CEA could be conducted any stage of the RBF
        program, and the results could vary. Often it is less cost effective when a program at the start-up
        stage, and more cost-effective when it is matured.
    •   Inflation: 3 percent is often used for deriving discount factor for a CEA. In countries with much
        higher inflation rate, discount factor should also be changed to estimate present value of future
        monetary resources.

136.     Country teams are encouraged to focus on variability and uncertainty in key parameters in the cost-
effectiveness analysis. The results of a sensitivity analysis can provide some indication of how robust initial
conclusions of cost-effectiveness are. If the cost-effectiveness results do not change very much, it can
generally be concluded that results are robust. On the other hand, if small changes in the parameters for
estimating costs and/or benefits significantly alter the results (+/- 10%), then it would be important to
highlight a range of findings and discuss the implications for policy-making.

137.    Regarding the sensitivity analysis on the effectiveness measures, users could modify parameters
used in the LiST tool to generate a new set of results, and repeat the analysis multiple times, generating
corresponding results to assess the robustness of the model.

138.     Ideally, if one knows the distribution of parameters, Monte Carlo simulation could be conducted to
generate confidence interval to estimate the uncertainty of the estimate, i.e. ICER. However, as the
effectiveness in this toolkit primarily dependent on LiST tool, Monte Carlo simulation that repeats 1,000
more times may not be feasible as each run requires modifying parameters manually. A simulation of 20-
50 repetitions is possible and could well serve the purpose.




                                                      43
                CHAPTER 5. DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION
                   INTERPRETATION OF IMPACT EVALUATION AND CEA RESULTS
139.      The results of ICER will be used to compare interventions. Cost-effectiveness ratios of alternative
interventions may be relatively similar in value; when this occurs, neither intervention is dominant over the
other. If the ICER is negative and the change in effectiveness is favorable, then the intervention dominates
the alternative. If the ICER is negative and the change in effectiveness is favorable, then the intervention is
dominated by the alternative. Ratios that have an order-of-magnitude difference between them demonstrate
more clearly which intervention is most cost-effective and deserves priority over the alternative. The ICER
will have essentially the same numerical value whether the calculations are based on DALYs or QALYs.

140.     Threshold values of ICERs recommended by WHO CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-
Effective) project are categorized into three categories of cost-effectiveness: highly cost-effective (ICER
less than GDP per capita); cost-effective (ICER between one and three times GDP per capita); and not
cost-effective (ICER more than three times GDP per capita) (World Health Organization, 2015), (World
Health Organization, 2011). ICER ratios have been calculated similarly for other MCH interventions, such
as demand side voucher schemes. Both supply side and demand side RBF (PBF and voucher programs)
are widely implemented in developing countries. Comparing ICER between the two types of the program,
in conjunction with joint program, would better inform policy makers on where to best invest in health.

                                         LIMITATIONS OF THE TOOLKIT

141.     This toolkit applies CEA to an RBF program and bears general limitations of the CEA for decision
making in the health sector. First, CEA measures costs and effects at one point in time and at one particular
level of scale. Costs and outcomes will likely change as coverage increases or declines. As a result, the
relative cost-effectiveness of interventions will fluctuate over time. For this reason, it may be useful to plan
to conduct CEA at more than one point in time.

142.    Second, the estimation of effectiveness in this Toolkit is based on LiST. The LiST tool covers
maternal-child health interventions, HIV/AIDS services, and family planning. Thus, the proposed approach
should provide good estimates of the lives saved through these interventions and reasonable estimates of
the morbidity averted through these interventions. It does not, however, provide estimates of lives saved
from improving curative care for adults. Other health simulation models would need to be developed or
adapted for this purpose.

143.     Third, CEA can be demanding in terms of data requirements and analysis, and much of the analysis
is based on assumptions. Sensitivity testing can provide a better picture of the possible range of cost-
effectiveness results for a particular intervention. Unless specifically built into the study design, the results
of CEA do not tell policy makers about the distributional impacts of a health strategy and whether benefits
accrue to certain population groups, such as the poor, more than others. For this reason, it is useful to
complement CEA with other types of evaluations that examine these concerns more closely. In addition,
some experts argue that health effects should not be discounted as heavily as costs. However, at the
extreme, this may produce a bias in favor of projects with very short time spans.

144.      Fourth, although CEA is an important tool for policy making and allocating resources, it is not the
only tool. Decision making must incorporate other considerations, such as priorities of populations and
political commitment. For example, it may cost much more to deliver services to poor populations living in
remote rural areas than to an urban population, but equity and political considerations would still require
that the rural populations be served equally.

145.      Besides the general limitations, there are two specific limitations pertained to this toolkit: (1) this
toolkit, using the LiST tool to quantify health outcomes, only measures the effectiveness of interventions on
mortality reduction, and is not able to examine their impact on improving quality of life and reducing the




                                                       44
duration of illness; and (2) although the toolkit is very comprehensive for addressing maternal child health
services, it is not able to include services for the general population in the modelling.

                                         STRENGTHS OF THE TOOLKIT

146.    This is the first toolkit to examine the cost-effectiveness of RBF programs. Unlike many evaluation
studies which only focus on outputs of RBF programs, this study incorporates both costs of RBF programs
services and outcomes. Results are translated to outcomes, a more important indicator than outputs. Using
standardized effectiveness measures in the cost-effectiveness analysis allows policy makers to compare
RBF programs to other programs whose primary objective is to improve maternal and child health.

147.    This toolkit uses a widely applied tool, LiST, to evaluate the effectiveness, which enhances the
robustness of evaluation results. RBF programs provide incentives to providers on a variety of services,
and this creates challenges to use one model to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their impact. LiST,
in conjunction with FamPlan, DemProj, and AIDS impact model (AIM), is able to model a majority of
maternal and child health services included in RBF programs.

148.     This toolkit first includes quality of care, an important component of RBF programs, in the modelling.
A significant proportion of incentives are used to improve the quality of care. However, due to challenges
of converting quality of care to health outcomes, quality of care is often disregarded in the effectiveness
evaluation. In this toolkit, we proposed to use a Delphi survey to estimate the impact of quality of care on
health outcomes to address the modelling challenges.

                          RESOURCES FOR CONDUCTING A CEA OF A RBF PROGRAM

149.    On the top of the impact of evaluation, which involved in household and health facility survey,
additional resources are needed to conduct the CEA. Creating a core technical group of 4-6 members
responsible for organizing and implementing the cost analysis exercise(s) is essential. The composition of
the multi-disciplinary team will depend upon the training and availability of individuals. As a whole, the team
needs to have members who have economic and statistical expertise and some experience with survey
analysis. The team must include members who will be able to determine the quality of information collected
and whether alternative sources need to be pursued. Some of the team members should be aware of and
have access to data sources, such as hospital records, or Ministry of Health and Finance documents.

150.    Although it may be difficult for officials from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, or Ministry
of Planning to participate in the analysis, their commitment and involvement can help ensure that the results
of the exercise(s) are linked to the overall decision-making process. Local consultants, university groups,
and other technical experts can conduct field research and provide valuable advice to the economic
analysis country team.

151.    The core team should include a lead technical person who will be responsible for taking the work
forward in-country. The lead technical person should have demonstrated skills in organizing data collection
and analysis efforts, as well as have training in finance, economics, or related field.

                                       IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

152.     Study teams are encouraged to develop a succinct presentation of the approach taken, main
results, and the implications for policy decision making for busy decision makers. Study teams should
remember that the results of cost- and cost-effectiveness analysis need to be interpreted within the
particular country context, and that factors such as level of scale, technologies, and prices will affect cost-
effectiveness results. In addition, cost-effectiveness results do not provide information on the distributional
aspects of RBF.




                                                      45
153.    Country team members should be familiar with the methods presented in this toolkit prior to
embarking on data collection and analysis. A review of basic data requirements and sources for estimating
costs and outcomes should be conducted initially.

154.     The methods discussed in this toolkit are merely tools for providing additional information for policy
and decision making regarding whether to introduce, scale-up, or alter an RBF intervention. We recommend
that the analysis be presented and discussed with a range of stakeholders who may affect decisions in the
country, and to involve them at various stages of the analysis, particularly when key decisions are being
taken on parameter estimates.

155.      All of the generic data collection instruments need to be adapted and pre-tested within each country
prior to use, so that the most relevant cost and outcome information is collected. Country teams also should
assess the data available from secondary information (administrative, impact evaluation data collection,
etc.) early in the process in order to identify whether any prospectively designed primary data collection
tools are required.

156.    Depending upon the policy questions to be addressed, country teams should strive to produce the
following indicators in order to facilitate comparison across countries under the HRITF:

    •   Total annual cost of the RBF intervention (for the sample of facilities in the RBF area)
    •   Cost/capita of the RBF intervention (facility and aggregated)
    •   Total annual RBF cost by line item, by functional classification, and by level of the health system
        as relevant to each country’s RBF program.
    •   Double-difference estimator of total costs between control and RBF areas
    •   Incremental cost-effectiveness between control and RBF areas
    •   The cost-effectiveness analysis should focus on evaluating differences in costs and differences in
        outcomes between control and treatment areas, or in the treatment area with and without the
        RBF intervention. An ICER should be estimated. At the facility level, a double-difference analysis
        can be conducted. The module recommends use of either DALY or QALY as the outcome
        measure for the cost-effectiveness study, but other outcome measures can be used instead, such
        as the number of lives saved. Costs should be collected and reported in local currency units for
        the year of analysis and then converted into current US dollars to facilitate comparison among
        countries.
    •   The objective of the sensitivity analysis is to test the robustness of the base-case results against
        the most important assumptions. There are different ways to perform a sensitivity analysis, but
        the most commonly used for CEA is to investigate how the results change as a result of changing
        the value of each important assumption while holding all other aspects of the analysis constant.


157.    In conclusion, while this toolkit has been oriented specifically around RBF, the concepts of
incremental cost per capita, improvements in coverage, improvements in quality, incremental health
benefits per capita, the ICER are all concepts that apply to many health interventions. The technique of
combining actual coverage with quality to derive adjusted coverage is a feature that may be helpful in
combining improvements in both coverage and quality into other health economics evaluations.

   APPENDIX 1. DELPHI QUESTIONNAIRE FOR EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF QUALITY OF CARE
Purpose: Results based financing (RBF) has been implemented for more than 2 years. The design of the
RBF program aims to enhance both quantity and quality of health care for targeted services, particularly for
maternal and child health services, including prenatal care, postnatal care, institutional delivery,
vaccination, family planning, and curative care in health facilities. However, the quality of care on health
outcomes (impact) is challenging to quantify. We would like to have your opinions to help quantify the
relationship between them. Potential relationship between quality and impact could be represented below,
such as 50% of quality achieves only 25% of the impact on health outcome. For each service, use your
best judgment to estimate the potential impact of a compromised quality.

      APPENDIX 3. DELPHI QUESTIONNAIRE FOR QUANTIFYING RELATIVE IMPORTANCE FOR
              COMPONENTS WITHIN THE SERVICE-SPECIFIC QUALITY INDICATOR


Purpose: Results based financing (RBF) has been implemented for more than 2 years. The design of the
RBF program aims to enhance both quantity and quality of health care for targeted services, particularly for
maternal and child health services, including prenatal care, postnatal care, institutional delivery,
vaccination, family planning, and curative care in health facilities.
The quality of care is measured with general quality and service-specific quality. The potential dimensions
of the each type of the quality include:

             Table A.3.1: Components of general and service-specific quality indicators
                                                             Service-specific quality
                General quality indicators                   indicators
                Infrastructure                               Clinical processes
                Administration and management                Drugs and supplies
                Human resource for health                    Equipment
                HMIS                                         Staff with training

Within the service-specific quality, the relative importance of each component varies, depending on which
service is evaluated. As an illustration, vaccination does not need high technical skills, and the supply of
vaccine is an important factor for a successful vaccination program. In this case, a higher weight will be
given to the component of “Drugs and supplies” while the “clinical processes” received a smaller weight.
We would like the experts help estimate the relative weight among the components within the service-
specific quality for eight indicators. We will provide components and their measures within each service.
Please use your best judgment to determine the relative importance of each component. Thank you!

 Results-Based Financing (RBF), which rewards providers, users, or administrators of services upon achieving a set
 of verified results, has been gaining attraction in global health as a prominent approach to gain value for money.
 With a large number of countries adopting RBF in the recent years, evidence starts to emerge which points to the
 effectiveness of RBF in improving coverage and quality of important services, such as maternal and child health and
 reproductive health. A question remains, however, if RBF is more cost-effective than alternative interventions which
 aim to improve similar outcomes. Given the limited resources that countries have for health, the answer to this
 question is particularly important as it guides policy makers on which programs to invest to maximize health benefits
 for the population. A second question is how the cost-effectiveness varies across different settings and RBF program
 features.

 The current toolkit aims to support country programs to assess the cost-effectiveness of RBF interventions and to
 facilitate cross-country comparisons of RBF programs. The toolkit is specifically tailored to supply-side RBF but its
 general principles apply to most health systems interventions directed at the health-related Millennium Development
 Goals (MDGs)— 4 and 5. The development of the toolkit was based on actual experience of conducting a
 costeffectiveness analysis of Zambia’s RBF program and an extensive review of RBF programs features across the
 Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) portfolio. Given that RBF programs in the HRITF portfolio are typically
 complex health system interventions, the toolkit recommends a practical approach of adopting a program
 implementer’s perspective and presents different options for cost-effectiveness analysis (for selected key indicators
 or for an entire package of services). It also provides guidance on incorporating quality of care, which is strongly
 emphasized across many RBF programs.

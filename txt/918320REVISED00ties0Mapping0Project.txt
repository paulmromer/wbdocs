INTRODUCTION


1.1 HISTORY OF OPEN CITIES AND THE OPEN DATA FOR
RESILIENCE INITIATIVE
The World Bank, through its Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR),
launched the Open Cities Project in November 2012 to create open data ecosystems that will
facilitate innovative, data-driven urban planning and disaster risk management in South Asian
cities. Open Cities is one component of a broader World Bank and GFDRR program, the Open
Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI), further described in box 1.1.



   Box 1.1 About OpenDRI
   Open Cities is part of the Open Data for Resilience Initiative, sponsored by the World Bank and
   GFDRR. OpenDRI brings the philosophies and practices of the open data movement to bear on the
   challenges of building resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. In partner-
   ship with governments, international organizations, and civil society groups, this initiative develops
   open systems for creating, sharing, and using disaster risk and climate change information to
   ensure that a wide range of actors can participate in meeting these challenges. Since its launch in
   2011, OpenDRI has worked to implement these ideas in over 25 countries around the world.

     Box 1.2 The Open Cities Website
     The Open Cities website provides case studies and visualizations of, and access to, much of the data
     collected during the first round of Open Cities projects. It was designed and built by our partners at
     Development Seed and can be accessed at http://opencitiesproject.org. It will be updated continually
     as the program expands and more data become available.

Box 1.3 OpenStreetMap
Open Cities drew from, and was inspired by, a number of projects involving community mapping,
primarily the OpenStreetMap (OSM) response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the “Community
Mapping for Exposure” effort by Australian and Indonesian governments with the Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). Open Cities and the other projects used the OSM platform to harness
the power of crowd and community to create accurate, up-to-date spatial data about locations and
characteristics of the built and natural environments. Dubbed “the Wikipedia of maps” by its
founder, British technology entrepreneur Steve Coast, OSM is an online database and a global com-
munity of over 1 million contributors who collaborate toward building a free and open map of the
world to which anyone can contribute and which anyone can use in their own tools and analysis.

OSM was first used in disaster response in a large-scale fashion in Haiti, following the January 12,
2010, earthquake. In the days following the disaster, the World Bank, Google, and several other
entities made high-resolution imagery of the affected area available to the public. Over 600 indi-
viduals from the global OSM community began digitizing the imagery and tracing roads, building
footprints, and other infrastructure, creating what quickly became the most detailed map of Port
au Prince in existence. OSM’s map became the de facto map for the area, and it was used on the
global positioning system (GPS) devices of search and rescue teams, to help route supplies around
the congested and devastated capital, and to coordinate many other aspects of the response and
reconstruction effort. Subsequent work supported by the World Bank, the International Organi-
zation for Migration (IOM), USAID, and others would go on to help develop an OSM community
in Haiti, ensuring local contributors would continue to shepherd and maintain the resource that
international volunteers had created.

The experience of OSM Haiti demonstrated that volunteers who collaborated around open data
could quickly create accurate and trusted information. Meanwhile, an OSM project in Indonesia
called “Community Mapping for Exposure” has sought to create data—locally and in advance of a
disaster—that could inform disaster preparedness and contingency planning activities. Working
with local governments, university students, and civil society groups, the mapping work has
focused especially on critical infrastructure in the capital region of Jakarta, including schools,
hospitals, community centers, and places of worship. The resulting data have been combined
with hazard information from a variety of sources to produce realistic impact scenarios using the
InaSAFE tool. InaSAFE is an open-source project developed by the Australian Government, the
Government of Indonesia, and the World Bank that was created specifically for this work but is now
being deployed in other DRM projects. The OSM project has since expanded beyond Jakarta and
has mapped over 1 million buildings across Indonesia since March 2011.

1.3 HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
This guide offers a comprehensive understanding of the
design and implementation of an Open Cities mapping
project—for both practitioners in the field and those
interested in a higher-level understanding of the process.
The guide’s content is based on experience in imple-
menting the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh,
Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping
project experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant
examples from those projects in the text and full case
studies at the end of guide.

Figure 1.1 depicts the overall process that the chapters
will discuss in detail. The next chapter, “Project Design
and Preparation,” covers how a project design process
begins: by identifying partners, clarifying a project’s
objectives and scope, assembling a team of managers
and mappers, and assessing the necessary resources for
mapping. Chapter 3, “Getting Started,” then describes
the steps after the initial planning stage: how to locate
an appropriate workspace, assess equipment costs, and
prepare staff training. Chapter 4, “Implementation and
Supervision,” takes a practical look at data collection
techniques from both the organizational and technical
perspectives. It also addresses common challenges and
mechanisms for quality control and reporting. Finally,
chapter 5 examines the lessons learned from previous
Open Cities projects and considers future improvements
to the overall project design.

planning an open cities mapping project


Table 2.1: Potential Partners for Open Cities Mapping Projects

 Universities            Universities and colleges are great potential collaborators. Participation in a mapping
                         project offers students and faculty an opportunity to learn about cutting-edge open-source
                         methodologies, ideas, and software. Students are often technically minded, have flexible
                         time commitments, and enthusiasm to learn new things.

                         Mapping projects that involve academia may also evolve into a permanent part of the
                         university’s curriculum or even a course by itself. Additionally, Open Cities partners that
                         build university capacity in this way help to develop the qualifications of students who can
                         later be hired as interns or staff.


 Scientific              Local scientific communities, whether involved in university research or in civil society
 communities             organizations, can be called upon to support an Open Cities project in several important
                         ways. First, these are important groups to involve in the data modeling process. Civil
                         engineers, planners, and others have experience with relevant data and analysis, so they
                         may be able to provide suggestions as well as important local context. Second, data quality
                         assessment throughout the project, particularly at the end of the data collection period, is
                         critical, and this group may be well placed to support it.


 Technical               Open-source software communities (user groups and private companies) are often closely
 communities             linked with OSM communities. Freelance software developers, geographic information
                         system (GIS) specialists, and private software companies may be interested in providing
                         software that assists the project as well as services for the community. The technical
                         community also can share its collective professional expertise when hosting a skills
                         workshop, and service providers can rent office space or equipment. For example, the
                         widespread Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo, at osgeo.org) is closely related to
                         OpenStreetMap.


 Civil society           Civil society projects may use datasets similar to those of the Open Cities project, and
 organizations           potential partnerships should be explored. The synergies that a collaborating NGO can
                         bring to Open Cities include data sharing and collection, youth outreach, and additional
                         connections to the community.


 International           Many large development projects are funded by international organizations that have
 organizations           significant datasets from previous projects. Their interests focus on a variety of areas and
                         potential synergies may exist. Offices such as the United Nations Office for the Coordina-
                         tion of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) often have existing mapping capacity and already
                         have knowledge of the local context and existing data.


 Youth and adult         Community groups, by their nature, attract members of society who are interested in
 community               volunteering their time for the benefit of the community. A great example comes from
                         Indonesia, where HOT worked with the Scouts to map thousands of buildings in the

   Pilot projects typically map a small part of a much larger area, over a short time frame. The goals
   of pilot projects are not only to collect data but also to experiment with the surveying methodology
   and determine the most effective and efficient ways of mapping. Such projects are also useful for
   demonstrating the effectiveness of innovative mapping tools and strengthening local support.

     Box 2.2 Different Methodologies
     Different structural approaches to mapping offer varying advantages. This guide focuses on the
     most common approach: systematically mapping an area with an Open Cities project team. But the
     same task can also be completed in other ways, such as by engaging volunteers, hosting mapping
     parties, or working through local governments.

     These alternative methods tend to take longer and be less precise, but their advantages should not
     be dismissed. Remember that the more individuals and organizations that are involved in your
     project, the stronger it becomes. The more participants you have, the more users, contributors,
     and awareness of the data you will have—which, in turn, strengthens the open data ecosystem for
     the future. We recommend engaging a project team because of the practical goals of a mapping
     project, but you are encouraged to combine these methods to engage others in the mapping process
     to realize these additional benefits.

planning an open cities mapping project




     Box 2.3 Common Roles
     Open Cities mapping project teams generally include people in the several roles described below.


     Surveyor and Editor (Mapper)

     Surveyors typically work in pairs. Each pair is responsible for field surveying—usually during half
     of the day, as it can be quite physically tiring. They may also engage in small tasks such as printing
     field papers. In most projects, each survey team also edits its own work, but these roles can be split.
     Each day, the pairs will be tasked with part of the target area to map, and they will spend three to
     five hours surveying, with the remainder of their time spent editing the data. Some of the experi-
     ence mappers should dedicate some or all of their time to the quality assurance process.


     Manager

     A small pilot project may have only a single manager, or there may be multiple team managers,
     each of whom manages a subset of mappers, and who report to a top-level project manager. Man-
     agers are responsible for organizing the project workflow, supervising and aiding mappers, and
     managing equipment and logistics.


     Project Lead

     At the top of the management structure is typically a project lead (PL). The PL may be the same
     person as the project manager, or the two roles may be separated. Ideally, the PL will have in-depth
     local knowledge and relationships with government and academia. The PL, aside from supervising
     the mapping project, is usually responsible for high-level discussions with partners and community
     outreach. The PL should be well versed in field data collection and skilled in project management,
     mapping and GIS, internal and external communications, social networking, and community
     building and integration.

   Box 2.4 Data Imports and the OSM Community
   What is the OSM Community? OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project involving hundreds of
   thousands of users and contributors, and the “OSM community” comprises those active members
   who continually participate by adding to or updating the map.

   Each country has what might be called its own community, a group of users who communicate,
   plan activities, and work together to improve the map. And each country’s community is also con-
   nected to the larger global OSM user base. Because an Open Cities project uses the OSM platform,
   it is automatically engaged in this community. Section 2.2.2.2 earlier provided more information
   about engaging the local OSM community.

   Most OpenStreetMap users go out and contribute to the map bit by bit, so they should be consulted
   before importing their data. The import might overwrite the work of other mappers who have
   actually conducted field surveys. You must also send an e-mail to imports@openstreetmap.org and
   let them know what you are planning. Ensuring that they are aware and supportive of the process
   before any importing takes place can save a lot of time explaining or reverting the changes after the
   fact.

  Box 2.5 Imagery and Licensing
  A common question during any mapping project is, “Why can we use imagery from Bing but not
  from Google?” The short answer, and one not always easily understood, is licensing.

  Any company or organization that sells or distributes imagery has a license describing what users
  are allowed to do with it. In most cases, people are forbidden from making derivative products.
  This means we are not allowed to use imagery to help make maps unless we receive specific per-
  mission to do so. Because Google has not given permission for the OSM community to use its
  imagery—or any other information from Google—as a resource, such use is not allowed, and edits
  derived from Google are illegal.

  On the other hand, Microsoft has given explicit permission for OSM contributors to use its
  imagery, which is of good quality in many parts of the world. DigitalGlobe, a satellite imagery
  company, has also released a great deal of imagery through Mapbox. It is always best to check
  these resources first and to assess the quality of the images in your project’s target area. Available
  imagery sources can be viewed in the Java OpenStreetMap Editor (JOSM).

   Box 4.1 Mapping Nonadjacent Blocks
   It is recommended that adjacent blocks are not given to different teams to map on the same day.
   To do so would increase the likelihood of editing conflicts, which occur when two teams try to
   edit the same features at the same time. The assignment of nonadjacent blocks to each team also
   allows your mappers to continue mapping if their block takes less time than they expect. For these
   reasons, it is better to organize daily mapping activities following a checkerboard pattern, as shown
   in figure B4.1.1.

   Box 4.2 Custom Presets
   During editing, your mappers will most likely be using either the offline JOSM software or the
   online iD editor. Because you will probably use a custom data model, you will want to add a cus-
   tomized menu to the editing software for adding the specific features that your mappers are collect-
   ing. This is done by creating a custom presets file, which implements a menu that makes it easy to
   attach the correct OSM tags to features.

   You can read more about creating custom presets here at http://learnosm.org/en/editing/creat-
   ing-presets/. HOT has created an easy-to-use visual editor for creating presets files, available at

LESSONS LEARNED AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The preceding sections took a practical look at how to plan and implement a mapping project.
Open Cities is ongoing, and improved methodologies and knowledge come out of each successive
project. In this chapter, we conclude by highlighting several key lessons learned from the first year
of the design and implementation of previous Open Cities initiatives.

CASE STUDY BATTICALOA, SRI LANKA


           Overview
           Batticaloa, a major city in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province severely affected by the Sri
           Lankan civil war and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, is located in a hazard-prone
           area that has suffered near-annual droughts, floods and cyclones. Some limited hazard
           maps were available for the area, but no detailed digital geographic data of the built
           environment were available for use in risk studies or for informing contingency and
           response planning, potential infrastructure and risk mitigation projects.

           Scope of Work
           The objective of the Open Cities project was to map the complete building stock
           including critical assets and road infrastructures of the Manmunai North Divisional
           Secretariat, which covers an area of 68 km2 and includes about 90,000 people around
           the town of Batticaloa. The characteristics collected focused on basic information nec-
           essary for vulnerability assessment including number of floors, usage, and construc-
           tion materials of walls and roof.

Partners
National Government — Several national government agencies including the Disas-
ter Management Center, the Survey Department and the Census Department were
involved from the beginning in the design of the project. Along the course of the
project, the key national agency were updated on the progress and results of work.
These partnerships provided the OpenCities with a strong country ownership, an
important credibility, and a legitimacy to interact with the local government. The
national agencies also provided staff from the local offices to support the project and
build their capacity.

Local Government — Locally, the work began with a series of meetings with the
Batticaloa local authorities. In part, these were designed to establish the close collab-
oration needed to carry out the actual mapping. They were also meant to ensure local
understanding of and trust in the mapping process and in the data produced, so as
to encourage local authorities to use the tools and data for their own DRM and urban
planning projects.

Humanitarian OpenstreetMap Team (HOT) — HOT provided some remote support
to the team and facilitated a national workshop on OpenStreetMap at the end of the
project to spread the word about OSM and build the capacity of key national agencies
in order to start scaling up the project in Sri Lanka.

Universities — The project was presented to most of the professors of the key depart-
ments in the main Sri Lankan universities (University of Colombo, University of
Peradeniya, Sri Lanka Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa, University of
Sri Jayewardenepura, Eastern University). Some of the professors participated in the
national OSM workshop held by HOT. A small amount of mapping parties were held
however as the location of Batticaloa is very far from most universities, the students
were not involved directly in the data collection for this phase but will be involved in
the next phase of the project.

Building the Team
A team of four technical experts (three recent GIS and IT graduates and one experi-
enced GIS analyst) was hired and trained in OpenStreetMap techniques in order to
supervise and support the overall mapping process. The team was completed by the
staff from local partners, including the Batticaloa Municipal Council, the Batticaloa
District, the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat to constitute a team of about a
dozen person fluent in OSM. For the field survey, the core team worked with the 48
recent university graduates that had been recently hired to work on the local planning
and development of the 48 Grama Niladhari that make up the Manmunai North Divi-
sional Secretariat. The graduates were appointed by the District Commissioner to work

Workspace
It was initially planned to host the team in the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat
premises but due to space, time and connectivity constraints, the team rented a house
in Batticaloa that was used as a headquarter. It was set up with computers, internet
connection, printers, tables, bedrooms in order to provide a space for trainings and to
process field data.

Existing Map Resources
The team found an existing dataset for building footprints on the eastern coast.
However, after examination, the quality was poor as it had been generated by auto-
matic extraction so it was decided not to use it. Some datasets existed for infrastruc-
tures like schools and roads but they were not cleared for use in OSM and outdated.
Therefore, no pre-existing digital data was used in the project. However, the team
worked with Divisional Secretariat and each GN divisions as they maintained paper
maps for each of the 48 GN divisions. A booklet with all the paper maps were shared
with the team and used to add landmarks and street names to the initial base map.

Data Collection
A small group began by tracing all building outlines into OSM using satellite imagery
and then added landmarks, roads and road names, and points of interests using local
paper maps provided by the divisional secretariat. This effort created a solid reference
map for the surveying work. The work was then split into two components: buildings
were surveyed by the 48 recent graduates, and surveyed data were entered by the core
team who were also responsible for fixing the maps and refining the point of interests.
Both groups were trained in OSM and surveying techniques by the Open Cities team.

Quality Control
Several measures were taken to ensure the data quality and ownership. First, the team
worked with the local Building department, the Batticaloa Municipal Council civil
engineer, and a civil engineering professor from the University of Moratuwa to create
the building survey and ensure that it is usable by non-expert and taking into account
local building practices. Second, the local team did ongoing quality assessment by
doing a re-surveying of a sample of buildings for each GN divisions, making sure that
the surveyors were not making mistakes. If some errors were found, corrective actions
would be taken right away to ensure the rest of the data would be correct. Third,
the team ran queries on the database to identify anomalies in the data collected and
accordingly made fixes and took corrective actions through extra training. The trust
and ownership in the data was ensured by the multiple partnerships with the national
and local government and engaging through regular updates and feedback loops
through the different phases of the project.

Results
Footprints and basic characteristics including number of floors, usage, and construc-
tion materials of walls and roof was collected for all 30,000 buildings in the area.
These data are now freely available in OpenStreetMap and in the government geo-
spatial data sharing platform RiskInfo (www.riskinfo.lk) for easy use by many stake-
holders. At the local level, a wrap-up ceremony was held with all the stakeholders and
participants where A3 maps were given to each GN division and T-shirt were handed
out to all the participants. Future plans were also discussed including the request
to extend the project to other DS Divisions in the district and to link the household
survey recently conducted (150 questions per household) with the geographic data.
To publicize the benefits of these techniques at the national level and promote their
adoption, high-level managers of the relevant national agencies were briefed regularly
and given final results when available. Two week-long training courses, one dealing
with OSM techniques and the other with use of data for decision making (specifically
the combination of data with existing hazard maps through GIS tools and the InaSAFE
tool) were conducted at the national level with all relevant national agencies. Discus-
sions are ongoing with various ministries concerning the next phase of the project.
A second phase of the project will take place to cover the flood prone Attanagalu Oya
river basin near Colombo. There is also strong interest in scaling up the project to
cover a greater geographic area, in using OSM to update the Survey Department data,
and in streamlining the use of the data in more DRM applications and sectors.

CASE STUDY KATHMANDU, NEPAL


          Overview
          Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is the most seismically at risk city in the world
          in terms of potential for loss of human life during a major event. In November 2012,
          in partnership with the government of Nepal, the World Bank and GFDRR launched
          a project to build seismic resilience in the Kathmandu Valley’s education and health
          infrastructure, in part by creating a disaster risk model to determine the relative vul-
          nerability of the relevant buildings. Once complete, the model will be used to prioritize
          plans for retrofits of schools and health facilities to improve structural integrity in the
          face of earthquake.

          Scope of Work
          The mapping goal for Open Cities Kathmandu was to collect data on location, occu-
          pancy, and structural characteristics for all of the schools and health facilities in the
          Kathmandu Valley.

          Partners
          Government — The Nepal Department of Education is a key partner in Open Cities
          Kathmandu. They are leading the risk assessment project to which the mapping work



                                                                                                      71

will contribute. In addition to institutional support, the DOE also provided a letter of
support that mappers carried with them as part of the work, instrumental to gaining
access to some of the facilities.

Technical Agencies — NSET, the National Society for Earthquake Technology, is a
Kathmandu-based NGO with significant seismic risk and engineering expertise. They
supported the project through assistance with data modeling, providing training on
structural assessments to the mapping team, and conducting quality assessment of the
data throughout the process.

Universities — Universities were critical partners in the project. Connections to the
Geomatics and Engineering departments in Kathmandu University and Tribhuvan
University assisted with finding the core team and volunteers for the project and
helped provide technical guidance and quality control during key project phases.

Building the Team
The core team comprised six graduates of Kathmandu University who were recruited
based on their prior contribution to Nepal’s then-nascent OSM community. They were
paid full-time salaries at rates commensurate with the local salary structure for recent
graduates in technical disciplines. The project also recruited six part-time interns from
Kathmandu University and 11 volunteers from Tribhuvan University.

Workspace
The project identified a local co-working space and technology startup incubator that
provided access to meeting rooms, reliable Internet service, and opportunities to inter-
act with other technologists and entrepreneurs, some of whom later became active in
the local OpenStreetMap community as a result of the team’s outreach efforts.

Existing Map Resources
The mapping team obtained a spreadsheet containing an incomplete list of 1701
schools in the Kathmandu Valley from the Department of Education (DOE), which was
then used as a starting point for the survey. The list did not provide the exact location
of schools, just the wards in which they were located. For health facilities, Open Cities
Kathmandu used three sources to generate a reference list of hospitals, health posts,
and polyclinics: a list of 100 private and community hospitals received unofficially
from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), a list of 205 medical centers
approved by MOHP that is accessible through the official website of the MOHP, and
the names of 70 hospitals and 27 polyclinics from a private-sector health organization
in Kathmandu. Together, these provided a list of over 400 unique health service pro-
viders that the team worked to locate and survey using a similar approach.

Data Collection
The mapping teams used a snowball approach to find locations of the schools. They
began with what location data were available through other sources, or by using their

                                                                                 case studies


personal knowledge and social networks. They then talked with locals, school officials
and health facilities personnel to locate remaining schools as well as ascertain the
existence of schools not on their list. As a result of requests from school officials, the
team also began carrying and distributing pamphlets and posters that provided basic
information on earthquake preparedness and safety.

Quality Control
The team took a number of steps to ensure that data collected during the project were
accurate and that they would be trusted by the wider group of stakeholders involved in
disaster risk reduction in Nepal. First, the project was carried out with explicit support
of Nepal’s Department of Education and the World Bank, two institutions with credi-
ble reputations in the country. Second, the team consulted frequently on engineering
matters with The National Society for Earthquake Technologies (NSET), a well-rec-
ognized entity in disaster community in Nepal. NSET Engineers helped design the
survey and provided training. The project also provided OSM training to a wide range
of individuals from government, donor, and NGO community to build awareness of
and comfort with the platform and approach. Finally, NSET conducted quality assess-
ment of OSM data regularly during the surveying process.

Through the involvement of NSET in Open Cities Kathmandu, the team regularly
made quality assessments of the survey to both identify problems as they occurred and
also to be able to assess the data collected in full at the project’s completion. Of particu-
lar concern was the building structure surveying, which required training from NSET
for the mapping team and volunteers to survey correctly. The first field verification was
performed immediately after the first training and some initial in-field practice. The
accuracy of the data for building structural system was 50% during this period. Given
this result, NSET provided a “refreshers” training to the surveyors. Following this
second training, the accuracy of the structural data increased collected by the mappers
rose to 100%.

Results
Open Cities Kathmandu surveyed 2,256 schools and 350 health facilities in the Kath-
mandu Valley. In addition to collecting a comprehensive list of structural data for
health and school facilities, the team worked to create a comprehensive base map of
the valley by digitizing building footprints, mapping the road network, and collecting
information on other major points of interest. The Open Cities team also conducted
significant outreach to universities, technical communities, and government in order
to expand the OSM community. Over 2,300 individuals participated in OSM trainings
or presentations during the first year of the project. The data have been used in plans
to retrofit school and health facilities and in applications for transportation planning;
moreover, USAID has incorporated the data into disaster preparedness planning
exercises. That the American Red Cross has begun to contribute to OpenStreetMap
in Kathmandu suggests that development partners remain interested in the project. A
local NGO called the Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), staffed by participants in the first

CASE STUDY DHAKA, BANGLADESH


          Overview
          Dhaka’s Old City is a crowded and complex area of immense historical value and an
          important locus of social and economic activity. In consultation with Dhaka Water
          and Sanitation, seismic risk experts from Bangladesh University of Engineering and
          Technology (BUET), and the Urban Study Group, a local nongovernmental organiza-
          tion (NGO) working on heritage preservation and restoration in Old Dhaka, the Dhaka
          Open Cities pilot sought to create detailed maps of three of the Old City’s 15 wards.
          These maps would provide data useful for planning of evacuation routes, managing
          water and sanitation infrastructure, and understanding the location and characteristics
          of heritage buildings.

Partners
Dhaka Water and Sanitation Department
Dhaka WASA was the primary government partner for this project and provided initial
data describing water and sanitation infrastructure in Old Dhaka as well as input into
the data modeling process.

BUET University
Professors from the Departments of Planning and Civil Engineering provided techni-
cal guidance, assistance with recruitment of project participants, and workspace to the
project.

Urban Study Group
The Urban Study Group provided data on location of critical heritage sites in Old
Dhaka as well as input into the data modeling process.

The Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS)
CEGIS is a local NGO with extensive experience working on GIS and surveying in
Bangladesh. They provided overall management of the mapping work and quality
assessment of the data collected.

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)
HOT provided initial OSM training to project participants and assisted with the devel-
opment of reporting and project tracking processes.

Building the Team
In partnership with BUET, which provided technical support and a working space, 20
engineering and planning undergraduates were hired as mappers and were trained
for a three-month period. A local nonprofit GIS consulting organization, CEGIS, was
contracted with to provide management and quality control for the work. The Human-
itarian OpenStreetMap Team, a nonprofit specializing in the use of OpenStreetMap in
development and humanitarian relief situations, also provided training and technical
oversight to the project.

Workspace
BUET University provided a computer lab to serve as the primary workspace for train-
ing of project participants and data entry work.

Existing Map Resources
The effort began by importing building footprint data for the three wards—created
by CEGIS as part of a different project but until that point unavailable to the

public—directly into OpenStreetMap. This allowed the mapping team to focus on field
surveying, in which basic characteristics, such as building height, usage, construction
materials, and age were collected through visual survey of each building.

Data Collection
Mapping teams divided the three wards into so-called blocks - sections which were
bounded by roads on all sides. Each day a team would be assigned one or more of
these blocks to survey, more easily mapping the densely set buildings due to the small
compartmentalized blocks which they were sent to map. Imagery was less useful than
normal due to the building density, but this methodology helped ensure accurate data
collection.

They also mapped road characteristics (width and surface type) along with important
water and sanitation infrastructure. The data were added to OpenStreetMap during
times when conditions prohibited field surveys (e.g., poor weather conditions, strikes).

Quality Control
The mappers were divided into small groups of surveying teams, each led by a team
leader, who was responsible for organizing and planning their team’s work and ensur-
ing smooth and accurate data entry. The team leaders were also responsible for imple-
menting quality control measures. Twice each month they would randomly select
ten percent of their mappers’ buildings and resurvey them. By doing so they could
calculate the likely percentage of error of the entire survey, correct a limited number of
mistakes, and discover repeated mistakes in the surveyors’ workflow.

Results
During this period, the team was able to finish complete maps of the three wards.
In total, 8,500 buildings, 540 of which were deemed to have historical significance,
were surveyed. Sections of roads measuring 43km and drainage works measuring
over 50km were also assessed. These data are now available to the public through the
OpenStreetMap platform. Several training courses and presentations on OpenStreet-
Map were also given to university students, government partners, and private sector
technology companies during the project period in order to help the OSM community
in Dhaka grow. The results of the pilot were presented to the government and other
key stakeholders in December 2013. Consultations are ongoing concerning the next
phase of the project.

APPENDIX 6.1 DATA MODEL DESIGN
Your data model is a chart of the features and attributes         agree on the same tagging conventions to represent
of those features that you plan to collect in the field. As       features in order to maintain data uniformity. For
described in chapter 3, designing the data model is a             example, this is why nearly all tags are in the English
process of determining the priorities of your project in          language. For most attributes that you want to map, you
coordination with your partners.                                  can probably find an existing tagging convention on the

APPENDIX 6.4 SAMPLE PROJECT REPORT

It is a good idea to provide snapshot progress reports every two to four weeks during a mapping project.
These can be brief, 1- to 2-page documents that highlight any news or changes in project design,
mapping progress, and metrics on data collection and quality control. The sample below suggests content
to include.

Open Cities Project Update - July 1, 2014
I. Project Updates

A brief paragraph summarizing new project developments. For example, any unexpected changes in
the project, either positive or negative, may be recorded here. In other words, any project news, such as
meetings with key partners, mapping activities, and adjustments to the project design.
DD   bullet points
DD   are good
DD   for documenting progress

many factors that go into developing an efficient, effective process.


Partner Outreach
rrIdentify relevant partners in government, academia and civil society
rrMeet with potential partners, discussing support and areas of collaboration
rrCommunicate project goals with OpenStreetMap community, and meet with local mappers

Defining the Scope of Work
rrObtain a map containing the boundary of the target area
rrEstimate the number of features you will map in the area, such as roads, buildings, and so on.
rrWrite out your data model
rrMap the data model to OpenStreetMap tags
rrEstablish a rough time frame for survey completion, noting any holiday periods that will halt the work.

Building the Team
rrEstablish management structure
rrDetermine sources of your staff from and how staff will be compensated
rrHire staff

Assessing Resources
rrList the existing digital and paper data
rrDetermine whether you will import any data; if so, create an action plan and time frame
rrDraw a map showing parts of your target area where no imagery is available
rrDetermine whether you will use GPS devices, smartphones, or both; if so, acquire
rrConfirm that the necessary base map data are available in order to use Field Papers




                                                                                                                      95

Logistics
rrIdentify where your staff will work
rrEnsure reliable Internet connectivity
rrList the equipment you need and acquire it

Training
rrIdentify who will conduct the training and what material will be covered
rrCollect necessary training materials, develop training manual
rrIdentify a location to host the training (maybe the same as the project office)
rrCreate a training schedule

Collecting the Data
rrCreate and print reference maps
rrDivide target area into daily mapping blocks; enumerate and make a statistics spreadsheet, providing
     each block its own row
rrCreate and print survey forms
rrCreate and print survey training manual
rrMake daily work schedule
rrCreate detailed project implementation schedule

Quality Control
rrDetermine methods to monitor data quality, and include these in your project schedule and daily
     schedule

Reporting
rrDetermine the metrics to include in your project reports
rrAdd tasks into your schedule to ensure that metrics are collected and documented regularly
rrMaintain statistics each day in a spreadsheet

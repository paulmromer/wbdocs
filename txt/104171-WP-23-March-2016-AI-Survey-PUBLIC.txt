                                    Access to Information Survey
                                                 2014

During the period of September through November 2014, the World Bank (“Bank?) conducted its fourth
annual Access to Information Survey (“2014 AI Survey?). The Bank directed the 2014 AI Survey to all
members of the public who had electronically submitted an access to information (“AI?) request to the
Bank during the period of July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014. The 2014 AI Survey sought to obtain
public feedback that could help the institution assess the public’s satisfaction with the Bank’s AI systems
and processes, and identify opportunities to improve. Out of 360 requesters, 100 (28%) responded to the
survey.

Similar to the prior surveys, the 2014 AI Survey focused on three specific areas: (i) the adequacy of the
Bank’s information systems; (ii) the quality of the Bank’s service in support of the public’s requests for
information; and (iii) the ability of the Bank to meet the requesters’ information needs. As highlighted
below, the survey results show that the public’s overall satisfaction levels in 2014 were relatively lower
than its corresponding values in 2013.

In 2014, 76% of the survey responses (88% in 2013) rated the adequacy of the Bank’s information
systems in the satisfactory range. With respect to the Bank’s quality of service, 57% of the survey
responses in 2014 (76% in 2013) gave the Bank a rating in the satisfactory range. Lastly, with respect to
the Bank’s ability to meet the requesters’ information needs, 71% of the survey responses in 2014 (84%
in 2013) rated the Bank in the satisfactory range. Alike the past two AI Surveys, in the “quality of
service? category, the 2014 AI Survey gave particular focus to those survey respondents who had their
requests denied by the Bank. The chart below provides a summary of the survey respondents’ satisf action
levels in the three areas.

The 2014 Survey also requested survey respondents to provide comments on their satisfaction. The
comments can be categorized under each topic as follows:

    1. Adequacy of the World Bank’s information systems:

            i. accessibility of information in information systems;
            ii. speed of response;
            iii. sufficiency of information available on website;
            iv. ease of searching and navigating through information categories in website;
            v. availability of older/historical material;
            vi. availability of requested information;
            vii. need for translation;
            viii. direct communication with the Bank staff member; and
            ix. accessibility and usability of the AI request form,

    2. The World Bank’s quality of service in support of the public’s requests for information:

            i.     general satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the answer provided by the Bank;
            ii.    competency and professionalism of Bank staff;
            iii.   speed of response;
            iv.    availability and accessibility of requested information; and
            v.     information available in multiple languages.

    3. The World Bank’s ability to meet the requesters’ information needs:

            i.     general satisfaction/dissatisfaction;
            ii.    availability of information on Bank’s website / Archives files;
            iii.   response time / responsiveness;
            iv.    consistency between information requested and received;
            v.     ability to search and navigate information categories in the Bank’s website;
            vi.    direct communication with Bank staff members; and
            vii.   information available in multiple languages.

Additionally, survey respondents who had their requests denied but chose not to file an appeal were asked
the reason why they did not appeal. For those who had their denial upheld by the Access to Information
Committee, the 2014 AI Survey also sought to ascertain why some requesters chose not to file a second
level appeal. The survey respondents were also asked to provide information about their demographics,
the topics related to their information requests, and how they have used the information obtained from the
Bank.

                                           ABOUT THE SURVEY

Basic Information

        Dates of survey: September 23 – November 3, 2014
        Sent to: 360 members of the public who had made an access to information request, between July 1, 2013
         and June 30, 2014, through the Bank’s AI Request Form
        Total No. Respondents: 100 respondents
        Response Rate: 28%

Change in Scale

In the past AI Surveys, the questions and data were aggregated into two unevenly distributed categories:
      a) Total – Satisfied: comprising Very Satisfied, Satisfied, and Somewhat Satisfied ratings (3 scale points)
      b) Total – Dissatisfied: comprising Dissatisfied and Very Dissatisfied ratings (2 scale points)

To increase accuracy, the 2014 AI Survey has been aggregated into two evenly distributed categories:
     a) Total – Satisfied: comprising Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied (2 scale points)
     b) Total – Dissatisfied: comprising Somewhat Dissatisfied and Dissatisfied (2 scale points)

The change in scale may impact the overall satisfaction results compared to previous results.




                                                                                                       4|Page
Additional Questions

Two questions were added to the survey:
     Was the Access to Information website easy to find from the World Bank’s homepage? (Question 3)
     On August 16, 2013, the World Bank implemented a new case management system that allows users to
       track the status of their requests and communicate with the World Bank. Users are directed to create a
       username and password in order to submit their requests. If you submitted a request for information after
       August 16, 2013, how satisfied were you with the new system? (Question 6)


                                                        RESULTS

Survey results have been aggregated into two categories:
      Total – Satisfied consisting of responses that indicate Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied, and
      Total – Dissatisfied consisting of responses that indicate Somewhat Dissatisfied and Dissatisfied
Percentages may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding. The percentages discount the number of respondents
that identified the respective question as “don’t know? or “not applicable.?

    with the World Bank’s efforts to keep you informed throughout the process?
                                                                                            (N=61 respondents)

               Total – Satisfied:    31.3%              Total – Dissatisfied:     68.7%

12. If your request was denied and you filed a first level to appeal to the Access to Information Committee, how
    satisfied were you with the clarity of the explanation in the Committee’s decision? Note: If you di d not file an
    appeal, please select N/A.
                                                                                                (N=10 respondents)

     Note: Since the inception of the AI Policy, on July 1, 2010, through July 1, 2014, the Access to Information
     Committee (AIC) issued in total 33 decisions on appeals. Of which, nine were issued in the 2014 AI Survey
     period. While the 10 respondents may have in fact filed an appeal to the AIC, and their views are responsive to
     the question, those appeals may not have all been filed within the period for the 2014 AI Survey. This should be
     taken into account when considering the overall results related to the appeals to the AIC.

13. If you filed a second level appeal, how satisfied were you with the clarity of the explanation in the Appeals
    Board’s decision? Note: If you did not file a second level appeal, please select N/A.

     Note: Since the inception of the AI Policy, on July 1, 2010, through July 1, 2014, the Access to Information
     Appeals Board (AIAB) issued three decisions on appeals. Only one decision was issued in the period for the
     2014 AI Survey, despite this question having had nine respondents. This should be taken into account when
     considering the overall results related to the appeals to the AIAB.

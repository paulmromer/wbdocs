      In this paper, show that greater autonomy to cities in Ethiopia through a
      process of city proclamations, led to better economic outcomes at the city
      level, lowering regional spatial inequalities. In addition, the newly-
      empowered cities did not seem to misuse their new powers by favouring
      particular firms over others. We investigate the effect of a nation-wide
      introduction of VAT in Ethiopia ‚Äì and show that the intended recipients of
      the reform, i.e. importing firms performed better (in terms of employment and
      sales) only after the VAT introduction in decentralized cities with greater
      autonomy than in non-decentralized cities. This is suggestive evidence that
      increasing administrative powers (or the mayor‚Äôs wedge) played an important
      role in making Ethiopian cities more competitive, and allowed mayor‚Äôs to
      transmit more efficiently the effect of national-level reforms.

Introduction
The government‚Äôs ability to raise taxes from firms and households to finance public goods
is a major obstacle in developing countries (Besley and Persson 2013). As workers and
firms continue to move to urban areas, the ability of city governments to raise and
administer taxes on firms has become an important channel of growth. In the last few years,
researchers have focused more on local and regional policies that lead to growth within a
country as opposed to explaining cross-country differences in GDP (Moretti, 2014).
Despite the increased focus on local policies, there have been few studies on the impact of
city governments‚Äô administrative powers on firm behavior, and the gap in research is far
larger in the case of emerging countries.
In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap. First we investigate if the process of
decentralization led to worsening of spatial inequalities across cities in different regions in
Ethiopia, and if there was any evidence of misuse of the new administrative powers in
terms of favouring particular companies over others. We find that decentralization leads to
convergence across city-level economic outcomes, suggesting that worse-performing cities
started to catch-up with their better-performing counterparts after decentralization.
To illustrate our point, we use two policy changes in Ethiopia, firstly, a nationwide
introduction of the VAT (value added tax) and secondly the phase-wide roll out of city
proclamations across different regions. We test whether economic outcomes for importers
improve after the introduction of the VAT introduction, especially in cities that had
additional powers post-decentralization. Using a firm-level panel data set from Ethiopia
between 2000 and 2011, we find that importers perform better than non-importers after the
introduction of the VAT in decentralized cities. This provides evidence that cities with
greater administrative powers are better able to pass through national-level reforms to the
benefit of their business community.
This paper is related the literature on place-based policies, where different sub-national
regions provide differential benefits for firms. See for example, Chaurey (2014), Criscuolo,
Martin, Overman, and van Reenen (2012), Ham, Swenson, Imrohoroglu, and Song (2011).
Regional policies in the context of African countries have hitherto been understudied and
this paper also adds to the relatively recent literature focusing on firm-level data from
African countries ‚Äì Shiferaw et.al (2013), Frazer (2005), Rijkers et al (2014). The results
of this paper are informative to the empirical literature focusing on the effects of
decentralization on local economic growth - see Hammond and Tosun (2011), Stansel
(2005) - most of which has focused on regional states in the US. To our knowledge, this is
the first paper to look at the combined impact of a tax and decentralization policy change.
Moreover, by focusing on Ethiopia, the paper provides evidence on a developing country
setting.
Furthermore, this paper provides supporting evidence about the role of importing firms
(defined as firms using imported inputs) in response to policy changes (see Goldberg, et.al
(2010) and Khandelwal and Topalova (2011). In this paper, we provide evidence for the
role of importers following a VAT introduction in Ethiopia.
Background2
Ethiopia had a tradition of centralist authoritarian government until 1991. Municipal
structures were established in some cities, but the mayors were centrally appointed and
municipalities were treated as branches of central government. When the current
government came to power in 1991, it proclaimed a decentralized form of government and
developed a constitution that established a Federal Democratic Republic, consisting of nine
Regional States, the federal capital city Addis Ababa, and the special administrative region
of Dire Dawa. The government structure has four tiers‚Äîfederal, regional, woreda (or
city/municipal) and kebele (neighborhood). The nine regional states have their own
constitutions. The country has introduced a dramatic change in terms of its traditions of
governance. This legal framework has enabled more participation of the regional states in
matters that concern them.

Each region has developed specific ‚ÄúCity Proclamations‚Äù that specify the powers, duties
and responsibilities of the cities.

Table 1: Legal and Institutional Framework for Cities

       Addis Ababa City Government was originally established by the Addis Ababa City
       Government Charter Proclamation No 87/1997, and the proclamation revised in 2003 by
       Proclamation 361/2003.
       Dire Dawa City Administration was established by federal Charter Proclamation 416/2004.
       Amhara Regional State: Amhara passed its first City Proclamation No. 43 in 2000. The urban
       reform process in Amhara Regional State is now guided by the Revised Proclamation for the
       establishment, organization and definition of powers and duties of urban centers in the Amhara
       Region, No. 91/2003.
       Oromia Regional State passed its first City Proclamation as no. 65/2003. The revised City
       Proclamation 116/2006 now guides the urban reform process in Oromia Regional State.
       Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Regional State passed its first City proclamation as
       no. 51/2002. The urban reform process in SNNP Regional State is guided by the revised
       proclamation 103/2006.
       Tigray Regional State: Tigray‚Äôs first regional city proclamation was no. 65/2003. The urban
       reform process in Tigray Regional State is guided by the Tigray Regional State revised City
       Proclamation 107/2006.
       All five remaining National Regional States - Afar, Benshangul/Gumuz, Gambela, Harari and
       Somali have, in 2006/07 developed legal and institutional frameworks (City Proclamations) to
       establish local urban government authorities. Some of these have subsequently been amended
       by (number and years of City Proclamations):
       Gambela: 73/2008, Somali 90/2011, Benishangul Gumuz 69/2007.

Under the highly centralized Derg regime (1974-1991), Ethiopia‚Äôs municipalities were
marginalized and did not function as independent local authorities. Since 2000, national
decentralization policies have formed part of a large-scale reform of government resulting
2
    This section draws heavily from the World Bank‚Äôs Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study (2014).
in creation of institutional and legal frameworks for urban local government authorities.
The objective has been to create and strengthen urban local government that will ensure
public participation, democratization and enhance decentralized service delivery through
institutional reforms, capacity building, systems development, and training.

In all regions, the Bureaus of Urban Development and Construction are responsible for
urban management and development issues within the regional government. All regions
that have enacted legislation creating urban local government (or city) authorities have
adopted an urban governance model that follows the elected council, elected mayor,
Mayor‚Äôs Committee and city manager system.

The 2000-2003 City Proclamations were developed region by region (starting with
Amhara) in a fairly robust participatory process. There was strong debate around principles
‚Äì elected mayor/non-elected, etc. In the end all regions followed, more or less, the result
arrived at in Amhara and Tigray ‚Äì Amhara then revised theirs to included additions other
regions introduced. The City Declarations are therefore relatively similar in scope and
form. Generally, in principle they provide significant autonomy for cities to set their own
standards, policies, plans, budgets, etc. ‚Äì but other parts of the city proclamations also
specify that the region will issue guidelines and directives.

The basic regional legislation that regulates cities‚Äô powers and responsibilities is found in
the respective City Proclamations. However, various subsidiary legislations ‚Äì most
importantly the ‚ÄúCity Tariff Regulations‚Äù - provide more detailed guidance. The City
proclamations give only very broad and generally wide-ranging authority to the cities3. For
instance in Oromia, cities are bestowed with powers to ‚Äúintroduce, adjust and ensure the
collection of taxes, service charges according to law‚Äù, in Tigray, Gambella and
Benishangul Gumuz the cities are empowered to ‚Äúdetermine and collect taxes‚Äù. However,
the practice that regional governments determine local tariff and tax rates has continued
regardless and they continue to provide very detailed guidance in the form of City Tariff
Regulations. Typically the tariff regulations include a prescriptive rating of the various
urban areas within the region according to their size and economy (typically five grades).
For each of these grades of urban areas the tariff regulations will subsequently either set a
fixed rate or a band for each of the revenue sources.

Table 2 below summarizes the extent to which the regional legislation and regulations
effectively allows each city to set its own tariff and tax rates. As indicated by the table,
there is some variation of the extent to which regions grant cities autonomy ‚Äì but the
general rule is that the regions set the tariff and tax rates with limited or no autonomy for
cities to adjust rates.

 Amhara                    Regional council sets the tariff rates but provides a range within which
 Somali                    the cities have some limited discretion.
 SNNP
 Oromia                    Urban Local Governments appear to have full autonomy to select a rate
                           appropriate for their circumstances and/or to introduce a new tax base
                           other than what is suggested by the regional revenue Bureau. In
                           practice, Cities decide within a recommended range established by the
                           region.
 Harari                    Special case as the City is almost the same as the state (mayor =
                           president, council, revenue office ‚Äì although with separate legislation
                           for the city, urban bureau and city administration, etc.)

Value-Added Tax (VAT) in Ethiopia was introduced nation-wide through the VAT
proclamation No. 285/2002, and came into force on 1 January, 2003. The VAT tax rate is
15% of the value of every taxable transaction - import and export services are exempt.
Since the introduction of the value-added tax in Ethiopia, firms have been differentially
impacted depending on the following categories.

Proprietorship firm: Pays VAT at the time of import to the federal government.
   ÔÇ∑ If goods are sold in the domestic market, then the balance of VAT is paid at the
       urban local government level. However, sometimes a firm might be eligible for a
       refund on the VAT paid to the federal level ‚Äì the refund is collected from the ULG.
   ÔÇ∑ If final goods are exported, then the firm receives a full refund from the ULG.
Incorporated firm: Pays VAT at the time of import to the federal government.
   ÔÇ∑ If goods are sold in the domestic market, then the balance of VAT is paid at the
       regional level. However, sometimes a firm might be eligible for a refund on the
       VAT paid to the federal level ‚Äì the refund is collected from the regional
       government.
   ÔÇ∑ If final goods are exported, then the firm receives a full refund from the regional
       government.

Thus, we hypothesize that factors such as (1) ownership (private or company), (2) status
(exporter and/or importer) and possibly (3) size, might influence the extent to which VAT
affects firm performance. Furthermore, urban local authorities handle the reimbursement
and collection of VAT. Therefore, it is plausible that cities with different levels of taxation
and governance capacities, differentially affect firm behavior. We use two exogenous
policy changes ‚Äì first, the nation-wide VAT reform starting in 2003, and second, the
decentralization of powers to the city governments through the phased city proclamations
to identify the effect of the VAT reform and decentralization on firm outcomes.
Data


We use the Ethiopian Large and Medium Manufacturing and Electricity Industries Survey
collected by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). We use the data for the years 2000-
2011. The scope of Large and Medium Manufacturing Industries Survey includes
identification particulars, number of persons engaged and wages and salaries paid (in birr),
products, sales and services of the establishment (in birr), value of stocks raw material
purchase (in birr), cost and quantity of raw materials, parts and containers used (value in
birr), fixed assets and investment (in birr), value of exports, and value of imports. The CSA
restricted the survey to establishments engaged in manufacturing activities (as defined
above) and employing more than 10 full-time employees. The survey covers both public
and private industries in all regions of the country.

Empirical Strategy


In this paper, we test for:
1/     Whether the VAT reform implemented across Ethiopia starting 2003 differentially
impacted importing and exporting firms compared to firms that do not import and export,
and,
2/     Furthermore, whether the VAT reform affected firms differentially after the
decentralization across regions in Ethiopia.

Since the VAT reform was introduced all over Ethiopia in 2003, we first run a difference
in differences specification comparing importing firms to non-importing firms, and
exporting firms to non-exporting firms. In this analysis, we define an importing firm as a
firm that imports greater than 10% of its total raw materials. Similarly we define an
exporting firm as a firm that exports more than 10% of the total value of its sales. We use
regressions of the form:

Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌªΩ1 Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªΩ2 Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌªΩ3 (Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±° √ó Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ ) + Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±°                              (1)

where i represents firm, t represents year and d represents a city. Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° represents outcomes
such as log employment and log sales at the firm level, Ì†µÌªº1 represents firm fixed effects and
Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±° represents year fixed effects. Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±° represents an indicator variable equaling 1 after 2003
(when the VAT policy was introduced) and 0 otherwise. Similarly, Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ represents an
indicator for an importing firm if more than 10% of its raw materials are imported, and an
indicator for an exporting firm if more than 10% of its output is exported. Then, Ì†µÌªΩ3, the
coefficient on the interaction between Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±° and Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ represents the treatment effect of
interest. This coefficient gives us the magnitude of the VAT policy on importing
(exporting) firms as compared to non-importing (non-exporting) firms before and after the
policy change.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that the differential effect of VAT is more pronounced in
cities after decentralization than before decentralization. We tackle this question in two
steps. The decentralization was rolled out in a phased manner across various regions in
Ethiopia. Note that in this analysis we use the year in which the revised city proclamations
took place (see Table 1). This gives us variation across geography (i.e. cities) and time. We
then compare firms of different types (importers and exporters) in cities before and after
the decentralization. In essence, we use a triple difference specification (DIDID) and run
regressions of the form:

Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌªΩ1 (Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° √ó Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ü ) + Ì†µÌªΩ2 (Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° √ó Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ü √ó Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ ) + Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ë + Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±°         (2)

where the coefficient Ì†µÌªΩ2 on the triple interaction term is the treatment effect of interest,
comparing different types of firms before and after the decentralization.

One problem that we encounter while dealing with this hypothesis is that both the VAT
reform and the initial phase of decentralization is the timing of the two events. The VAT
was introduced in 2003 across Ethiopia, and the first phase of city proclamations were
modified in 2003 (and hence began in 2004). Hence, the effect of decentralization on
importers (exporters) versus non-importers (non-exporters) nests the period of the VAT
policy as well. Hence, we cannot separate the effect of the decentralization completely
from the VAT policy.

To provide suggestive evidence that the VAT policy was more effective after
decentralization took place in cities we run DID specifications similar to (1) but restrict it
to the period before decentralization in regions. Note that different regions issued city
proclamations in different years ranging from 2004 to 2011. Hence each region and all
cities within the region had periods in time before decentralization in which the VAT had
already been introduced. If the VAT policy had an effect on different kinds of firms even
in the absence of the decentralization, we would not be able to conclude that the
decentralization at the city level had any additional impact on firms after the introduction
of VAT in 2003. Therefore, we test for the differential effect of the VAT introduction on
different kinds of firms before the decentralization.



Results
In this section, we describe our main results. First, we look at the results from the triple
difference specification (DIDID). In Table 3, we look at the effect of the decentralization
separately for importers and exporters. In all the regressions we include firm and year fixed
effects. Hence, we compare within-firm performance before and after the decentralization
that happened at different points in time for importers versus non-importers and for
exporters versus non-exporters. Firm fixed effects allow us to control for time invariant
firm-level unobservable characteristics such as managerial capacity, relationship with
government authorities etc. We also control for year fixed effects and this allows us to
control for any macroeconomic shocks affecting Ethiopia. In all the regressions we cluster
the standard errors at the city level. In Column 1, we find that importers performed better
than non-importers in cities after the decentralization, as compared to before the
decentralization. The magnitude of the treatment effect translates to an increase of 11.3%
in employment at the firm level. We do not find any statistically significant difference in
outcomes for importers as opposed to non-importers in terms of value of sales (Column 2).
Next, we look at the effect of the decentralization on exporters versus non-exporters and
we do not find any statistically significant difference in outcomes (employment or sales).

Since a large part of the decentralization period coincides with the introduction of the VAT
in Ethiopia, it is plausible that these differential effects on importers and exporters might
be driven by the VAT policy. The VAT was introduced throughout Ethiopia in 2003. To
check whether the VAT policy change differentially affected importers (exporters) as
compared to non-importers (exporters), we run a difference in difference specification. We
compare importers to non-importers, and exporters to non-exporters before and after the
introduction of the VAT. These results are shown in Table 4. Column 1 and 2 show that
the VAT reform differentially impacted importers as compared to non-importers, both with
respect to employment and sales. In Columns 3 and 4, we look at the effect of the VAT
policy for exporters and non-exporters, and find no statistically significant difference in
outcomes. Hence, taken together, Tables 2 and 3 suggest that there was a differential effect
on importers compared to non-importers, and no such effect for exporters.

We hypothesize that the effect of the VAT was more pronounced for importing firms in
cities that had more powers post-decentralization as opposed to those in cities where
decentralization had not taken place. To answer this we need to test whether the differential
effect of VAT on importing firm increases or decreases, if we look only at cities and time
periods when the decentralization did not take place. Hence, we are essentially analyzing
the effects of the VAT policy change on firms before the decentralization took place in
cities. If the VAT policy were driving the results, we would expect to see similar results
on the coefficient of the interaction terms VAT √ó Importer and VAT √ó Exporter as in Table
4. In Table 5, Columns 1 through 4, we do not find any statistically significant differences
in the outcomes of importing or exporting firms before and after the VAT policy.

Hence, the results of Tables 3, 4 and 5 taken together seems to provide suggestive evidence
that the VAT policy led to differential outcomes on importing firms as compared to non-
importing firms. Furthermore, these results were more pronounced in decentralized cities
than in cities that had not gained more powers (not decentralized). These results seem to
suggest that city-level powers are important determinants of how firms respond to tax
incentives.




Evidence of improvement in spatial equality
We also provide additional evidence that an increase in city-level powers leads to better
outcomes for worse-performing cities ‚Äì in other words, leading to better spatial equity
across Ethiopia.

Two separate issues are analyzed:
  1. Whether the city proclamations (decentralization) led to convergence in outcomes
      of cities within regions, and
  2. Whether the proclamations led to convergence in firm level outcomes within cities.
If cities are provided with additional powers, convergence (or better spatial equity) would
suggest that initially worse-performing cities out-perform initially better-performing cities
‚Äì in effect, catching up with their better-performing counterparts. Divergence would
indicate the opposite leading to worsening spatial inequality within the region post-
decentralization.

Since different regions introduced the city proclamations in different years, we test the first
hypothesis, using a difference-in-differences approach. We compare the difference in the
standard deviation of outcomes (employment, sales, value of production, and number of
firms) across cities (within a region) in decentralized regions as compared to non-
decentralized regions, before and after decentralization (city proclamation). Table 6
illustrates these results.

We find that within regions, variance across cities has gone down post-decentralization as
compared to before decentralization in decentralized regions relative to non-decentralized
regions. This is suggestive evidence for convergence of city level outcomes post-
decentralization. This seems to imply that on average, cities have used their powers post-
decentralization to improve economic outcomes and that initially worse-off cities are
catching up with initially better-performing cities.

This leads us to our second hypothesis ‚Äì whether greater powers for cities after the
decentralization has meant abuse of powers by the city governments ‚Äì in terms of favoring
some firms over others. If this were the case we would expect to find divergence in
outcomes at the firm level within cities. If cities had used their powers appropriately, we
would expect to find convergence in the outcomes across firms within a city. We test this
hypothesis using a similar strategy as above. Table 7 illustrates these results.

The results in Table 2 above show that there is no statistically significant difference
between the variance of outcomes across firms within cities before and after
decentralization. This implies that the city proclamations did not lead to cities using their
powers to favor certain firms over others.

The two sets of results from Tables 6 and 7 taken together provide additional evidence that
the process of decentralization in Ethiopia led to better city level outcomes and did not
results in improper abuse of powers by city governments in terms of favoring some firms
over others.

Conclusion
With the growth in urbanization over the last few decades, cities and city governments have
assumed a unique role in economic development. As countries around the world transform
structurally from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing or service-led economy, cities,
especially in developing countries, become a focal point of growth. In this paper, we
hypothesize that greater autonomy to cities in Ethiopia through a process of city
proclamations, led to better economic outcomes at the city level. Initially worse-performing
cities caught up with the better-performing counterparts in their region after
decentralization, leading to lower spatial inequality. This was not accompanied by
divergence in firm-level outcomes within the city, suggesting that the new powers were
not misused to favour particular firms. Indeed, national-level reforms were better
transmitted to the intended recipients post-decentralization. Following a nation-wide
introduction of VAT in Ethiopia, importing firms performed better (in terms of
employment and sales) than non-importing firms. Importantly, importing firms performed
better after the VAT introduction in decentralized cities with greater autonomy than in non-
decentralized cities. This suggests that city governments (or the mayor‚Äôs wedge) can play
a large role in making their cities more competitive through helping the growth of both
incumbent and new firms. The precise channels through which city governments can
influence firm growth are an exciting avenue for future research.

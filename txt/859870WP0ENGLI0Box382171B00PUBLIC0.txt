   1. Strategic Framework
      Bulgaria’s institutional framework for setting workforce development (WfD) strategic
      policies is grounded in legislation that creates clear roles for government ministries,
      industry and other stakeholders. There is sustained recognition of the importance of
      skills and WfD by the country’s leaders. This has been reflected in several important
      strategic documents. However, these statutory provisions have not yet translated
      into a shared policy agenda and sustained commitment to achieve forward-looking
      priorities for preparing the workforce for the economic opportunities of the future.
      The lack of broad and relevant data on skills gaps continues to hinder the design and
      implementation of policy interventions with high potential to improve the WfD
      framework.

   2. System Oversight
      Bulgaria has a robust normative framework that includes occupational competency
      standards and a national qualifications framework for the assessment and
      certification of individuals’ skills. However, many of these standards have not yet
      been integrated into the curricula for technical and vocational education. Students
      are tracked into vocational education too early, thus preventing full formation of
      basic competencies, which can be an obstacle to acquiring the more specialized
      knowledge and skills demanded by employers. Budget resources tend to prioritize
      the creation of low-skilled jobs for quick mitigation of unemployment at the expense
      of investment in innovation in vocational education and training (VET) that could
      underpin longer-term competitiveness. VET and skills training system performance
      are not routinely analyzed and there is no system for quality assurance and
      accountability that informs and supports evidence-based WfD policymaking.

   3. Service Delivery
      The Bulgarian system permits a diversity of state and non-state providers to offer
      training services. Partnerships between employers and public training institutions are
      limited, despite private sector engagement at the strategy level. VET providers are
      given few incentives for setting and achieving learning outcome targets, and the
      relevant ministries impose few requirements to facilitate evaluation. At the system
      level, while administrative data are collected, they are not intensively used for
      identifying opportunities for resource optimization or measuring the impact of
      programs on learning and employability.

The tool is based on an analytical framework4 that
identifies three Functional Dimensions of WfD
policies and institutions:

•      Strategic framework, which refers to the
praxis of high-level advocacy, partnership, and
coordination, typically across traditional sectoral
boundaries, in relation to the objective of aligning
WfD in critical areas to priorities for national
development;

A clear distinction is necessary between social
assistance policy and active labor market measures;
the latter need to be carefully assessed, reshaped
and focused strategically on innovation and
improving the quality of vocational education and
training.

The government needs to implement regular
analyses of the performance of the VET and skills
training system, its cost-effectiveness and labor
market impacts. Per student allocation for vocational
and pre-vocational education at secondary and post-
secondary levels exceed those for general secondary
schools, and yet the latter score significantly better
on PISA and national assessments, which is a cause
for concern and requires a thorough review of the
VET system. The allocation of funding on the basis of
achievements against targets is a better approach
than the current per student funding allocations,
particularly in the absence of post-licensing quality
assurance measures. Equally important, regular
measurement of the impact of funding is key for the
government to better understand value for money.
For instance, regular cost-benefit evaluations of
youth training programs across Latin America have
led to significant labor market impacts, more stable
funding, and an improved delivery model.

    standards and establish the need for upgrading the standards. The Directorate will develop
    sectoral programs on equal access to education, integration, qualifications and ICT. It is also
    responsible for ex-ante evaluation of the developed strategies and conducts ex-post analyses of
    external evaluations, school inspections and the results of program and policy implementation.
    The Directorate introduces methods for policy evaluation in education, youth and science and

                              Annex 6: Validation Workshop Report
This section presents a brief report on the stakeholders’ workshop on implementation of SABER-Workforce
Development in Bulgaria, organized in cooperation between the teams of the World Bank, Open Society
Institute (OSI) – Sofia and the MES. The seminar was held on October 29, 2012 and hosted by the secretary
general of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Science.

Goals

The main objective of the workshop was to present and validate the SABER-WfD analytical approach, the
initial findings from its pilot application in Bulgaria, and the experience and outcomes from SABER-WfD
implementation in other countries.

Participants

The event was attended by 30 professionals from 3 ministries, 2 agencies, local administrations, trade
unions, employers and employers' associations, schools and NGOs, operating in different strands of
workforce development and VET – IVET, CVET, human resources, economic development and the labor
market.

Description

After the official opening and welcome address of the MES secretary general Krassimir Valchev, the World
Bank’s SABER-WfD team leader Jee-Peng Tan made a presentation on the System Assessment and
Benchmarking for Education Results (SABER) and its philosophy, analytical framework, approach and tools.
She underlined the SABER-WfD goals of supporting policy dialogue in this critical area and provided
highlights and relevant lessons learnt from SABER-WfD implementation in four countries: Ireland, Chile,
Korea and Singapore.

After the OSI team’s presentation on the context of WfD and the preliminary results of the application of
SABER-WfD tools in Bulgaria, participants continued the discussions in three small groups so that the
SABER-WfD approach could be examined in greater detail. Each small group was provided with hand-outs
of the graphical representation of the Policy Goal scores, summary results presentation and decision tree as
guiding instruments for group discussions. The participants went through the preliminary findings for
Bulgaria of the three SABER-WfD Functional Dimensions: Strategic Framework; System Oversight and
Service Delivery. At the final plenary discussion, the three small groups presented their major conclusions
and suggested the key priority areas of intervention for the country’s workforce development.

Main outcomes and conclusions

The presentations on the preliminary SABER-WfD findings were positively received and their added value
for furthering WfD policy dialogue in Bulgaria was acknowledged by participants in the plenary discussion
after the WB and OSI teams’ presentations.

All in all, the SABER-WfD framework and instruments were highly appraised by participants as necessary,
timely, relevant and adequate for the Bulgarian context, and only small changes in the terminology used in
regard to state and public education were recommended for further consideration.

The initial outcomes, as presented, also received positive feedback. Participants largely agreed on the
correctness of most scores, the country’s level in the three Dimensions, and the areas for policy actions.
However, some suggestions were made for slightly lower scores for Strategic Framework and System
Oversight.

The participants endorsed the most obvious problems that were identified and made recommendations for
deeper analyses of the underlying factors for the existing national VET and labor market policy and the
status quo of workforce development. Participants also identified the main challenges in developing and
implementing the legal framework for the management and monitoring system, putting in place the
necessary mechanisms and increasing the quality of service provision for workforce development. These
challenges, which require further reflection in the process of preparing the Bulgarian Barometer Report, to
be presented for consideration by the Bulgarian government (particularly MES), include:

      The need for better and more effective and accountable coordination at the national
       level;
      The lack of public incentives for cooperation between training providers and businesses;
      Policy making and accountability for results at regional and local levels;
      Increased accessibility of services for vulnerable groups; and
      The need for in-depth analyses of the links between VET and the whole formal
       education system.

Based on the analysis, the participating experts formulated the strategic priorities and directions for
workforce development and outlined specific opportunities for the improvement of policies and measures
in the following areas:

   Leading Priority:
   1. Strategic Focus.

   Second wave key priorities:
   2. Enhanced dialogue between the institutions and the social partners;
   3. Improved Information management;
   4. Building mechanisms for employers’ involvement in the development of new standards – incl. entrepreneurs
   beyond the employers’ associations;
   5. Development of an incentives system for all participants in WfD to achieve excellent results;
   6. Quality management.

   Other key priorities:
   7. Teachers’ qualifications;
   8. Curricula tailored to the needs of the labor market.

Bearing in mind that the SABER outputs are coming amid the substantial educational reforms – both in
mainstream and vocational education – the participants underlined the relevance of the SABER results to
the work on the new draft laws on preschool and school education and on vocational education and
training.

      The Systems Approach for Better Education Results
      (SABER) initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on
      education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping
      countries systematically strengthen their education systems.
      SABER evaluates the quality of education policies against
      evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic tools and
      detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
      with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers,
      and parents to policymakers and business people—an
      accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of
      their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
      all children and youth learn.

      This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of
      Workforce Development

Executive Summary
Burkina Faso has implemented a unique approach to electrifying rural areas using a
combination of cooperatives and private enterprise.
Around 80 to 100 electricity cooperatives (Coopels) and the state-owned electric utility
SONABEL together are the primary agents for rural electrification in the country. The
Coopels are managed by groups of community leaders, entrepreneurs and citizens who
usually hire private operators to build grid extension projects. Sometimes those private
contractors are retained to manage the ongoing operation and maintenance of the projects.
The Coopels receive subsidies from the government for their projects but they also assume
investment risk and operating risk, which in some cases they pass on to private companies

1           Introduction
In Burkina Faso, cooperatives known as coopels (Coopératives d’électricité), are partly
responsible for rural electrification. As of 2014, there were almost 100 coopels providing
electricity to around 112,000 people. The success of coopels varies, and the business models
they employ vary as well. This model usually combines elements of cooperative with private
enterprise. The coopels raise part of the financing for their projects, and a rural
electrification fund the rest. After construction, the coopels either manage the operation
themselves or delegate it to private companies using affermage contracts.1

2           Sector Background
Access to electricity in Burkina Faso is low. The overall electrification rate2 in 2014 was 17.68
percent: 58.06 percent for urban areas and 2.91 percent for rural areas.3
Burkina Faso’s national utility SONABEL (Société National d’Electrification du Burkina)
serves primarily urban and peri-urban areas of Burkina Faso. A basic map of SONABEL’s
infrastructure is presented in Figure A.1 in the Appendix.
The rural electrification fund, FDE (Fond de Développement de l’Electrification), created in
2003, is a combined financing and implementation agency for rural electrification. FDE also
regulates technical quality of rural electrification projects. As of May 2014, FDE had
electrified 121 rural communities partly through mini-grids but mainly by grid extension.4

3           Rural Electrification Approach
The Government of Burkina Faso implemented electricity sector reforms in 1998. The goal
of the reforms was to increase competition in the electricity sector and reduce costs. 5
SONABEL’s distribution monopoly ended in 1998. The distribution segment was divided
into two sub segments: The first covered the current service area of SONABEL and the
second covered all the areas outside SONABEL’s perimeter.
By 2007, around 10 private operators had entered the rural electrification market.6 These
operators either ran small mini-grids backed by diesel generators or extended the SONABEL
grid. The private rural operators managed generation capacity of 16.8MW.7
Today, FDE, SONABEL and Coopels, and small private companies are each involved in
rural electrification:

              FDE is responsible for planning and managing the extension of the grid
              Operations and maintenance of the newly built network is then undertaken by
               local cooperatives (Coopels) or by the national utility SONABEL
              Coopels and SONABEL contract with private contractors to build out the grid.
Cooperatives have faced competition from private companies.8

4            Characteristics of the Coopel Model
The cooperative is an entity formed by a collection of village leaders and entrepreneurs. A
committee of 12 volunteers coordinates the coopel’s activities. In some cases, each customer
becomes a member of the cooperative after subscribing to an initial capital contribution.9
The coopel signs a concession contract with the FDE, the rural electrification fund. The
coopel is then responsible for recruiting a builder for the generation and/or distribution
assets. The coopel also hires a technical private operator to assume management of the
network. The coopel is responsible for metering and billing and for compensating the
technical operator.10
The contract between the coopel and the private technical operators is an affermage
contract. The private operators are responsible for operation and maintenance of the
infrastructure under long term lease contracts that include defined service and access
targets.11 As such, the approach is in some ways a conventional Public-Private Partnership
(PPP). In the case that the private operators fail to provide its agreed services, FDE can help
coopels hire full-time local permanent staff.12 The coopels usually remain in charge of
metering and billing.
A specific rural electrification project can result from a local initiative or it can be promoted
by the national electrification plan (PNE - Plan National d’Electrification). The community
in question must create a coopel, and obtain approval from the Ministry of Energy and the
FDE (the rural electrification fund). The coopel must prepare a feasibility study. If the
project shows itself to be feasibility, the coopel receives a public service concession.13

Coopels are financed through a mix of loans and grants. The transmission lines are 100
percent financed by grants, and the distribution network is 40 percent financed by loans
taken by the cooperatives and 60 percent by grants.14
The coopel is responsible for:
             Recovering the costs of the initial investment (and repaying any loans)
             Abiding by the legal and regulatory regimes for public service concessions
             Renewing its mandate every three years and its concession contract after 20
              years.15
In terms of technological solution, cooperatives are a mix of grid extension and mini-grids.
One source estimated that 15 percent of cooperatives operate mini-grids, and that the rest
are grid extension projects.

5           Future Directions
FDE is now experimenting with grouping localities under a single technical operator
“farmer? to improve efficiency. FDE is also in the midst of performing a study on
optimizing the relationship between the coopels and the technical operators.16

6           Achievements
There were 92 cooperatives and private sector enterprises operating in Burkina Faso in
selected rural areas at the end of November 2014.

Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, coopels may have increased the rural electrification
rate by 0.8 percent in the past 7 or 8 years.19
The main ongoing support given by the state to the coopels was reported to be diesel, an
effective annual subsidy of CFA (West African Franc) 350 million (US$ 0.70 million, 2013
exchange rate).20

7            Lesson for Africa
Burkina Faso’s experience with concessions to coopels provides a lesson for other African
countries: Cooperatives can be used to manage private operators. The cooperatives serve as
an interface between the state and technical operators and customers.

     A different source gave similar estimates in 2013: there were 88 coopels in Burkina Faso operating in areas where
     SONABEL is not operating, providing electricity to more than 112,000 people. (Lefaso.net, « Electricité : le FDE et les
     Coopel accordent leur violon » (Electricity : FDE and Coopels tune their violins), April 11th 2013, available at
     http://www.lefaso.net/spip.php?article53694 (Accessed September 30th 2015).

     In 2014, Burkina Faso had a rural population of 12.36 million (according to the World Bank Open database). Assuming
     am average household size of 7 people, Burkina Faso has 1.77 million households. 14,250 households is approximately
     0.8 percent of all rural households. We can preliminarily conclude that coopels have increased the rural electrification rate
     by 0.8 percent.

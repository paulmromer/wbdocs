I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in four Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Oman, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain) perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing XXXX1
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in XXXX
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From June to August 2015, 796 stakeholders of the WBG in four GCC countries (139 in
Bahrain; 231 in Kuwait; 206 in Oman, and 220 in UAE) were invited to provide their opinions
on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey. Participants
were drawn from the Office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial
departments; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/ programs; local/regional
governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations;
the financial sector/private banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the
media; independent government institutions; chambers of commerce, academia/research
institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 2312 stakeholders
participated in the survey (29% response rate).

Respondents received and completed the questionnaire on the independent survey platform:
Qualtrics. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing XXXX; their overall attitudes
toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in XXXX; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in XXXX, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in XXXX. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in XXXX, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy efficiency;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.

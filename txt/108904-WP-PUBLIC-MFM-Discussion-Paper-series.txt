Abstract
We review the patterns of cyclicality in fiscal policy in a sample of 180 countries over a period of
more than three decades. First, we consider issues of robustness in the choice of the proxy for fiscal
cyclicality by using alternative filtering methods. Second, we rely on a country-specific approach
to split our sample in sub-periods based on a test for structural break in the series of real GDP per
capita. Third, we investigate the extent to which countries behave pro-cyclically or counter-
cyclically in different phases of the business cycle. In line with earlier findings in the literature, we
confirm that there is a causal link running from stronger institutions to less pro-cyclical fiscal
policy, even after controlling for the endogeneity of institutions and other determinants of fiscal
policy. In that context, we conclude by discussing a few policy directions that could guide countries
aiming to strengthen their fiscal positions and be better equipped to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal
policies.

1. Introduction
A large and growing literature has argued that industrialized and developing countries behave very
differently in relation to their fiscal policy stances over the business cycle. In that context, a
significant number of authors have documented a more pro-cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in
developing countries as opposed to industrial countries. 2 That is, developing countries tend to
orient government consumption and investment in the same direction as that of the cycle in general
economic activity. In doing so, they tend to amplify upswings and worsen recessions ‚Äì what
Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) termed as the ‚Äúwhen it rains, it pours‚Äù phenomenon.
Industrialized countries, on the other hand, tend to behave largely in a counter-cyclical or at worst
acyclical fashion. The most recent evidence of this pattern has been put forward by Frankel, Vegh,
and Vuletin (2013) who not only have found additional support to the when-it-rains-it-pours idea
but also regarding developing countries movement away from pro-cyclicality.
Evidence on the pro-cyclical pattern of fiscal policy in developing countries was first found by
Gavin and Perotti (1997) who showed that Latin America tended to adopt policies that were
expansionary in good times and contractionary in bad times. Talvi and Vegh (2000) later showed
that such behavior was far from being a trademark of Latin America alone as many other developing
countries across the world espoused a pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance. There is a number of
different explanations as to why developing countries tend to behave in that fashion vis √† vis
industrialized economies. 3 Some of the reasons most commonly found in the literature include
credit constraints faced by developing countries which would prevent them from raising money in
international capital markets in bad times and would force them to adopt a contractionary fiscal
policy in downturns (Gavin and Perotti (1997)). Political economy considerations would also seem
to play a role as good times could encourage fiscal profligacy (Tornell and Lane (1998), Alesina
and Tabellini (2005)).
From a theoretical point of view, the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy remains a puzzle from either a
Keynesian or neoclassical perspective as it does not seem to be optimal to exacerbate the business
cycle by adopting an expansionary fiscal policy in booms and a contractionary fiscal stance in a
downturn. In neoclassical models, the optimal fiscal policy stance is either acyclical (Barro (1979))
or counter-cyclical (Baxter and King (1993)). In Keynesian models, on the other hand, with the
presence of sticky prices or wages, the optimal fiscal policy stance is counter-cyclical (Christiano
et al. (2011) and Nakata (2011)). A number of papers have argued that a pro-cyclical fiscal policy

stance is the result of weak and underdeveloped institutions (e.g., Calderon and Schimdt-Hebel
(2008), and Frankel et al. (2013)).
From a risk management point of view, a countercyclical fiscal policy can be useful for at least
three compelling reasons (see World Bank (2014)). First, by leaning against the wind, governments
can continue to provide goods and services and to maintain public investment even in the event of
a drop in public revenues. Second, in a downturn, a countercyclical fiscal policy can help
governments increase social assistance and insurance to a large number of citizens affected by more
adverse macroeconomic conditions. Third, as witnessed during the global financial crisis of 2008-
09, a countercyclical fiscal policy can help countries stimulate the economy and cope better with
the effects of a prolonged recession. In that regard, as argued by Mollick et al. (2011), in the
aftermath of the global financial crisis it became clear that the countries that weathered the effects
of the crisis better were those that had followed some sort of concerted macro-fiscal responses that
helped them build resilience to exogenous shocks. When the crisis hit, these countries were able to
have more favorable access to credit in international financial markets and resist speculative
attacks. Not only had they stronger fundamentals entering the crisis, which allowed them to quickly
deploy counter-cyclical fiscal policies, but they were also better positioned to adopt exit strategies
faster by raising interest rates, controlling domestic credit growth and reverting to more orthodox
fiscal policies.
In this paper, we provide new evidence on the cyclicality of fiscal policy across industrialized and
developing countries. Our sample includes 180 countries, of which 134 are developing countries
and 46 are high income countries over the period 1980-2012. We follow the methodology of
Frankel et al. (2013) but at the same time introduce three innovations to the empirical approach.
First, we subject the proxy for fiscal cyclicality to alternative filtering methods to account for
potential differences in a country‚Äôs reported within-period average, and across-period changes in
fiscal stance. Second, given the sensitivity of cyclicality outcomes to the choice of period, we rely
on a country-specific approach to split our sample in sub-periods. Acknowledging the difficulties
of carrying on such exercise when working with a large sample of countries, we suggest a first
approximation for breaking the sample across countries based on a test for structural break in the
series of real GDP per capita ‚Äì we believe that this could be a better indicator of shifts in a country‚Äôs
overall economic policy, including its fiscal policy stance. Third, we investigate the extent to which
countries behave pro- or counter-cyclically in different phases of the business cycle with the
objective of assessing the empirical relevance of the when-it-rains-it-pours phenomenon when
considering a larger sample of countries in comparison to earlier studies in the literature.
The paper is organized as follows. After this Introduction, Section 2 discusses issues associated
with the choice of filter to smooth the proxy variable for fiscal cyclicality while Section 3 estimates
our own ‚Äúgraduating class‚Äù under different filtering methods and a country-specific approach to
split the sample into two sub-periods. Section 4 presents an analysis of how the countries in our
sample behave over the business cycle. Section 5 discusses our findings on the empirical
determinants of fiscal cyclicality while Section 6 explores endogeneity issues. Section 7 presents
concluding remarks confirming earlier findings in the literature on the causal link between
institutional quality and a less pro-cyclical fiscal stance and suggesting policy directions that could
be useful to countries interested in strengthening their fiscal positions and becoming better
equipped to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policies.

2. Fiscal cyclicality under alternative filtering methods
In a recent paper, Frankel et al. (2013) documented a movement away from pro-cyclicality for a
sizeable number of developing countries in the 2000s. The authors used a sample of 94 countries
(21 developed and 73 developing) over a period of 49 years (1960-2009). Using a proxy for fiscal
cyclicality based on correlation coefficients for time series of real government expenditures and
real GDP smoothed by the Hodrick-Prescott filter, the authors were able to classify the countries
according to their ‚Äúability to graduate‚Äù from fiscal pro-cyclicality. A negative (positive) correlation
coefficient between the cyclical component of government spending and GDP indicates a counter-
cyclical (pro-cyclical) fiscal policy stance. From comparing two subsequent periods (1960-1999
versus 2000-2009) using Boolean logic, the authors grouped countries based on their correlation
coefficients and classified them in four different categories or ‚Äúgraduating classes‚Äù:


        i)   Established Graduates (EG) as those with counter-cyclical fiscal policies in the first
             and second periods;
        ii) Recent Graduates (RG) as those with pro-cyclical policies in the first period and
             counter-cyclical in the second;
        iii) Back to School (BS) as those with counter-cyclical fiscal policies in the first period
             and pro-cyclical in the second; and
        iv) Still in School (SS) as those with pro-cyclical fiscal policies in the first and second
             periods.


We are interested in understanding how the results on the number of countries classified as pro-
cyclical or counter-cyclical may differ if one chooses a different smoothing filter or changes the
window period, even by one year. The latter is based on the knowledge that the Hodrick-Prescott
filter yields results that are notoriously affected by end-point values (cyclical component and trend
of a time series). In investigating these effects, we first compute fiscal cyclicality indicators under
alternative approaches to the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter: Baxter-King (BK), Christiano-Fitzgerald
(CF), Butterworth (BW) and the Harvey unobserved (HU) component model. We also move the
window period by one year forward and backward for all filtering techniques. For this step we use
data for real government expenditures and real GDP covering 180 countries for the period 1980-
2013. We also apply a criterion for splitting the sample, by country, at potentially different points
in time based on potential structural breaks in (per capita GDP) data. The intuition behind this is
that changes in macroeconomic policies and performance generally reflect on changes in per capita
income. A structural break on the series for the latter may be indicative of changes in a country‚Äôs
fiscal stance.
We use data from the IMF‚Äôs World Economic Outlook (WEO) for real GDP and for real
government expenditures over the period 1980-2013. With our larger sample, we compute fiscal
cyclicality indicators (correlation coefficients of cyclical components of real government
expenditures and real GDP) and classify countries according to their graduating class under
alternative filtering methods. We divide our sample into two sub-periods (1990-2000 and 2000-




                                                  3
2013) 4 with the objective of observing changes in the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy over our
total sample period (1980-2013). Out of the 180 countries in our sample, we were able to compute
fiscal policy stance proxies for both sub-periods for only 147 economies (104 developing and 43
developed). Results by selected groups of countries (full sample, high income, developing) are
summarized in Table 1.
In line with the findings of Frankel et al. (2013), our results show that irrespective of the filtering
method, developing countries represent the larger share of recent graduates ‚Äì ranging from two
thirds to three quarters of the total of graduates (i.e., those moving from a pro-cyclical fiscal stance
in the period 1990-2000 to counter-cyclical in the period 2000-2010). Since the number of countries
moving to counter-cyclical fiscal policies (for all filtering methods) exceeds the number of
countries classified as back to school (i.e., those moving from counter-cyclical to pro-cyclical, also
for all filtering methods) the overall share of countries with counter-cyclical policies now rises to
something between 50 and 55 percent for the sample of countries with data in both sub-periods
(1990-2000 and 2000-2010).
A drawback with the classification of countries by graduating class is that this approach does not
allow one to gauge the relative progress of countries towards a more counter-cyclical (pro-cyclical)
fiscal stance. By looking at changes in the value of the correlation coefficient of real government
expenditures and real GDP in 2000-2010 versus 1990-2000 (instead of graduating classes) we see
that 59 out of 104 developing countries (56.7 percent) with data for both sub-periods improved
their fiscal stance. In addition, 30 out of 43 developed countries (69.7 percent) also improved their
fiscal stance. This shows a greater relative progress towards counter-cyclicality among developed
economies compared to developing countries. Nevertheless, our results show that both developing
and developed economies have moved away from pro-cyclicality.

3. Splitting the sample based on country-specific information
Our next objective is to take into account country-specific information in the choice of the sub-
periods that we use to calculate the correlation coefficients. We believe that there is a gain in
accuracy by choosing a country-specific criterion for splitting the series of government
expenditures and GDP in different sub-periods for comparison purposes. Our proposed criterion is
to use tests for structural breaks in the series of real GDP per capita. Our premise is that structural
breaks in that series may be associated with significant changes in economic policy, an external or
internal socio-economic shock, or some other event that could involve a shift in a country‚Äôs fiscal
stance. To test for the structural breaks in the real GDP per capita series we apply the Quandt
likelihood ratio (QLR) test5.
As in Frankel et al. (2013), we were able to document that a sizable number of developing countries
are graduating from fiscal policy pro-cyclicality. This is based on the number of developing
countries shifting from a pro-cyclical to a counter-cyclical fiscal stance between country-specific


4 We use a sub-period, 1990-2010, from the overall 1980-2013 dataset because for many countries, data on real government expenditures
and / or on GDP are missing, mostly for the early 1980s. Also, some filtering techniques discard endpoint values based on user-defined
parameter specification.
5 Likelihood ratio tests are applied to the specification: Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ê = Ì†µÌªº + Ì†µÌªº √ó Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ê
                                                                   Ì†µÌ±°   0    1          Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1 at every point in time for the period 1990-2013 for
a particular country (lypct is a country‚Äôs per capita real GDP in year t, in logs) . Structural breaks correspond to the yea rs that yield the
maximum value for the QLR test. Comprisons to critical values are made based on Andrew (1993) and Andrews & Plogeber (1994).

                                                                       4
defined periods (between 22-25 percent of developing countries, depending on the filtering
method), relative to the number of countries falling back into pro-cyclical fiscal policies (17-19
percent of developing countries classified as back to school). However, our evidence on developing
countries graduating from pro-cyclicality is weaker now than when the sample is divided uniformly
(same year) for all countries. This is visible by comparing results in Table 5 with those reported in
Table 1. In fact, based on the criterion that splits the series on a country-specific basis, the ratio of
developed countries graduating from pro-cyclicality (in the range of 26-34 percent of high income
countries with data, depending on the filtering method) is higher than that of developing economies.
Figure 1 supports that observation.

4. Does it really pour when it rains?
An idea put forward by Kaminsky, Reinhart, & V√©gh (2004) was that for developing countries, and
in particular for upper middle-income countries, macroeconomic policies and in special fiscal
policy tend to reinforce the business cycle (the when-it-rains-it-pours syndrome). They found
evidence in support of that by looking at a sample of 104 countries over the period 1960-2003 and
were able to show that in contrast to that behavior OECD countries seemed to orient their
macroeconomic policies at stabilizing the business cycle. We now turn our attention to the same
empirical question with the objective of assessing if the when-it-rain-it-pours phenomenon remains
relevant over the most recent period.
We make two implicit assumptions as to why countries change their fiscal stance. First, we consider
that changes are generally not random. That they are mostly associated with policy shifts within
given administrations, which may or may not be politically motivated (as incumbent
administrations tend to spend more ahead of elections), or across administrations after elections,
influenced by ideological principles. Second, we assume that they are generally driven or motivated
by observed trends in economic activity and not the other way around.6 This assumption is not
uncontroversial. For instance, Rigobon (2004) argues that fiscal policy shocks drive output and not




6   See, for instance, Kaminsky, Reinhart, & V√©gh (2004).

                                                            6
the other way around, while Ilzetzki & Vegh (2008), on the other hand, find causality running both
ways.
Keeping these assumptions in mind we proceed to re-compute correlation coefficients for the fiscal
cyclicality proxy for the period 1990-2011 by differentiating what happens in fiscal policy in
different parts of the business cycle. It may be the case that a country‚Äôs average fiscal stance within
a period differs during years of expansion compared to that adopted in years of downturn in
economic activity. Countries that are, on average, pro-cyclical in booms and downturns, would tend
to exacerbate their business cycle; those that are counter-cyclical in both, booms and downturns,
have a fiscal policy that contributes to stabilize the cycle7.
But countries may not be always pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical. Whenever a country exhibits an
average counter-cyclical fiscal stance in booms, and a pro-cyclical stance in downturns, other things
equal, it will likely improve its medium to long term fiscal sustainability profile.8 A country that is
pro-cyclical in booms and counter-cyclical in downturns would, ceteris paribus, deteriorate its
fiscal sustainability profile. Figure 2 plots the value of the fiscal stance proxy in periods of
expansion (when the cyclical component of real GDP are positive) versus that registered in
downturns. High-income countries are those in red while developing economies are in blue9. By
quadrants, we identify four groups of countries:
     ÔÇ∑     Upper right quadrant: Those that exhibit pro-cyclical fiscal policies in both booms and
           downturns. Other things equal, such stance contributes to exacerbate output volatility. Not
           surprisingly, one finds many resource-rich economies in this category. In addition, many
           upper middle-income countries appear prominently in that group.
     ÔÇ∑     Upper left quadrant: Those that exhibit counter-cyclical fiscal policies in booms and pro-
           cyclical fiscal policies in downturns. Other things equal, such fiscal behavior improves a
           country‚Äôs fiscal sustainability profile.
     ÔÇ∑     Lower left quadrant: Those that exhibit counter-cyclical fiscal policies in both booms and
           downturns. Other things equal, such stance contributes to stabilize output around its long-
           term trend. Expectedly, most of high-income countries fall under this category.
     ÔÇ∑     Lower right quadrant: Those that exhibit pro-cyclical fiscal policies in booms and counter-
           cyclical fiscal policies in downturns. Other things equal, such behavior deteriorates a
           country‚Äôs fiscal sustainability profile.
A simple visual inspection of Figure 2 seems to lend support to the when-it-rains-it-pours
phenomenon. Most of the countries in the upper and lower right quadrants of the chart are
developing economies (in blue), many resource-rich countries and most importantly upper middle-
income countries. In contrast to that, most of the high income countries appear on the upper and
lower left quadrants with fiscal stances that largely contribute to long-term fiscal sustainability.

7 Of course, there are other sources of volatility, so a country with counter-cyclical fiscal policies may experience a higher output
volatility than that of fiscally pro-cyclical economies.
8 As explained in Villafuerte, Lopez-Murphy, & Ossowski (2010), analyses of fiscal sustainability often focus on a comparison between
the observed cyclically-adjusted primary balance against a debt-stabilizing primary balance. This approach is combined with a
‚Äúreasonable‚Äù objective for the debt to GDP ratio (debt tolerance). Of course, the idea that a country improves its fiscal balance by being
counter-cyclical in booms and pro-cyclical in downturns implicitly assumes a more than proportional change in government revenues
to changes in GDP (Buoyancy).
9 World Bank classification. The sample includes 156 countries after dropping countries with less than 5 observations available when
the cyclical component of real GDP is >0 or less than 5 observations available when the cyclical component of real GDP is <0.

5. Quality of institutions and fiscal policy cyclicality
However informative our results are, they are not sufficient to identify the main determinants of a
country‚Äôs change in fiscal cyclical stance over time. A number of authors have tried to address this
in the literature for different country samples, using different cyclicality proxies and different time
periods, with ‚Äìexpectedly- mixed results (Alesina & Tabellini (2005), Park (2012), Mpatswe,
Tapsoba, & York (2011), Villafuerte, Lopez-Murphy, & Ossowski (2010)). More recently, Frankel,
Vegh, and Vuletin (2013) have considered the role played by institutional quality on a country‚Äôs
ability to graduate from pro-cyclicality. We follow the same approach but are also interested in
checking whether the finding that institutions matter as a determinant of fiscal policy cyclicality
holds for our expanded and more up to date sample of countries, as well as for the cases in which
the series are split based on our country-specific (per capita GDP) criterion. We also consider an
alternative proxy for institutional quality based on Kunƒçiƒç (2013) in addition to the institutional
quality variable constructed from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) dataset used in
Frankel et al. (2013).
We use a sample of 180 countries for the period 1990-2011, but due to the limited availability of
data for the ICRG variable for which information is available for only 138 countries up to 2010,
we include econometric results using an alternative proxy for IQ based on Kunƒçiƒç (2013), which is
available for 193 economies for the period 1990-2011.

First, in Eq. (1) we start with a country panel fixed effects specification (country ‚Äúi‚Äù and year ‚Äút‚Äù)
                                                                               Ì†µÌ±ê

to address possible omitted variable bias problems. The interaction variable is meant to show how
institutional quality increases (a positive sign for ÔÅ°3, in the event of ÔÅ°2>0) or decreases (ÔÅ°3<0, in
the event of ÔÅ°2>0) fiscal pro-cyclicality. The results appear in Table 2 for the period 1984-2009
and include a set of control variables.

Second, in Eq. (2) we consider the case in which the role of initial institutional quality (Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ÑÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±°           )
and changes of the variable ( ŒîÌ†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ÑÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±° ) are assessed separately. One expects both signs of the
parameters of the interaction terms included in the Eq. (2), ÔÅ°3 and ÔÅ°4, to be negative and significant
in explaining the relationships between cyclical components of real government expenditures and
real GDP (in the event of ÔÅ°2>0). Results for this specification are reported in Table 3, which also
include a set of control variables.

                                                                                                                                                            Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±î
Equation 3 is a cross section specification where the dependent variable (Ì†µÌºåÌ†µÌ±ñ ) is the correlation
coefficient of real government expenditures and real GDP for a given time period. The specification
                                                                                          Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±î
is first computed including the average value of the institutional quality variable (Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ÑÌ†µÌ±ñ ) for the
same period as sole control, and then adding additional explanatory variables (vector Z). Again,
the value for 2 is expected to be negative and statistically significant. The results of this
specification are reported in Table 4.
In all cases, the exercises are conducted for the alternative definitions of fiscal cyclicality, namely,
using the Hodrick-Prescott, Baxter-King, Christiano-Fitzgerald and Butterworth filters. Our results
confirm the sign and significance of the institutional quality variable, considering alternative
definitions of fiscal cyclicality, either on average for the full period 1984-2009, or for both, initial
or changes in institutional quality. Our analysis also confirms the significance of institutional

quality in explaining the value of the fiscal cyclicality proxy for the period 1984-2009 under the
cross-country specification in Equation 3 (results in Table 4).

6. Endogeneity test
Endogeneity concerns are common in the context of causality analysis involving institutional
quality and other macroeconomic variables. The work by Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson (2001)
provided an excellent framework for the analysis of institutional quality on current economic
performance by tracing historical relationships of European settler mortality to the type of
settlements and quality of early institutions in former colonies, to current quality of institution and
level of income. From their methodological point of view, the authors were able to identify a source
of exogenous variation in institutions that affected a country‚Äôs current per capita income.
We follow the same approach for addressing endogeneity concerns on the relationship between
institutional quality and fiscal stance. In order to look for potential endogeneity problems, we use
Equation 3, a cross-country specification for the impact of average institutional quality and other
controls, over the fiscal stance proxy, using an instrumental variable specification. Alternative
definitions of institutional quality (ICRG and Kunƒçiƒç (2013)) and alternative fiscal stance proxies
are used. Instruments for institutional quality are European settlers‚Äô mortality rates (in logs) and
latitude, following Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson (2001) and Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2013).
Table 5 compares results of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) versus Instrumental Variable
specifications under the alternative IQ and fiscal stance proxies. Table 6 adds a set of controls,
following Equation 3, including financial depth, financial integration, debt to GDP ratios,
government accountability, output volatility and the reserves to import ratio. In all cases we find
evidence of causality running from IQ to fiscal stance.

7. Concluding remarks and policy implications
We have confirmed earlier findings in the literature showing that a number of developing countries
have graduated from fiscal policy pro-cyclicality (c.f., Frankel et al. (2013)). In comparison with
industrialized countries, however, developing countries tend to behave in a way that contributes to
exacerbate the effects of the business cycle; that is, they tend to exhibit more often than
industrialized economies pro-cyclical fiscal policies in both booms and downturns, contributing to
exacerbate output volatility. This result coincides with the findings from Kaminsky et al. (2004)
and represent additional evidence in support of the ‚Äúwhen-it-rains-it-pours‚Äù phenomenon. This
finding is robust to the choice of different filters to smooth the proxy of fiscal policy cyclicality
over time and to a country-specific criterion based on a test for structural break that we have used
to split our sample in sub-groups for comparison purposes.
We have also found evidence in support of the idea that institutional quality is an important
determinant of a country‚Äôs fiscal stance. This is an important result that suggests that efforts to
graduate from fiscal policy pro-cyclicality need to be accompanied by policy reforms that seek to
strengthen the ability of countries to save in good times to generate fiscal buffers that could be used
in bad times. In that regard, initiatives such as the establishment of fiscal councils and the adoption
of fiscal rules, the development of sound debt management strategies that reinforce fiscal discipline,
and the strengthening of macro prudential regulations appear to be necessary conditions for
graduation from pro-cyclicality.

                                                  10
The adoption of fiscal responsibility laws and fiscal rules, for example, are widely recognized as
effective mechanisms that can increase the discipline and credibility of the fiscal authorities. The
introduction of fiscal rules, however, are usually supported by expenditure reforms in the context
of a medium term fiscal framework to signal the authorities‚Äô commitment to fiscal sustainability.
Many countries that have adopted fiscal rules, or some kind of rules-based fiscal framework, have
also benefitted from the parallel creation of an independent fiscal council that monitors
macroeconomic projections underlying the budgeting process and the compliance with the fiscal
rule.
Finally, countries can also draw on existing good practices on how to strengthen their fiscal
positions and be better equipped to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policies. Moving towards a full
blown fiscal responsibility law, with or without a formal fiscal rule, requires some preparation and
building technical capacity in order to design, implement, and monitor the new policy tool. There
are some well-established good practices in that regard such as an establishment of savings funds
with a strong institutional framework, a solid governance structure and clear operational rules for
the allocation of the fund‚Äôs resources. The proceeds accumulated in such a fund could be used for
emergency situations following a protracted economic shock, for example. Other policy options
that could help countries respond in a more symmetric way to the business cycle include, for
example, expenditure ceilings, cyclical deficit targets, and rules-based stabilization funds.
An interesting topic for further research is associated with the role of external factors or exogenous
institutions as additional determinants of a country's propensity to graduate or not from procyclical
fiscal policies. For example, resource-rich economies might be more tempted to behave in a
procyclical way due to rent-seeking and delay the development of domestic institutions that could
help them become more counter-cyclical. Likewise, small developing countries that have close
commercial ties with larger industrialized economies might behave in the same way as resource-
rich economies and delay moving towards fiscal counter-cyclicality. It would be particularly
interesting to look at the pattern of fiscal policy cyclicality in this group of countries during the
recent commodity super cycle period.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Bolivia perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Bolivia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Bolivia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Bolivia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Bolivia;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Bolivia.
    Use data to help inform Bolivia country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In March-May 2014, 440 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Bolivia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President; office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/programs; implementation agencies overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations;
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 210
stakeholders participated in the survey (48% response rate).
Some respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Others
received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform and filled out
the questionnaire electronically. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Bolivia;
their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s
knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Bolivia; and
the WBG’s communication and information sharing in Bolivia.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were not compared to those in an earlier Country
Survey conducted in FY’06, as survey instruments in the two years were largely different and the
last survey was done almost a decade ago.
A. General Issues Facing Bolivia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Bolivia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Bolivia, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
   Bolivia, WBG staff preparedness to help Bolivia solve its development challenges, WBG’s
   local presence, WBG’s capacity building in Bolivia, their agreement with various statements

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Bolivia, and in which sectoral areas
   the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services).
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Bolivia, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Bolivia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty six development areas, and the WBG’s level
   of effectiveness across these areas, such as poverty reduction and equity, education,
   economic growth, and natural resource management.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the most recent LAC Flagship Report, including whether
   it raised substantive new information, and whether it provided them with useful information
   in terms of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Bolivia: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Bolivia, and which services the
   Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has moved to the
   right direction, and the future role international development cooperation should play in
   Bolivia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Bolivia, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       Respondents across stakeholder groups gave statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in all thirty six development areas except its effectiveness in “public sector
        governance/institutional development.? Respondents from the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks, project implementation agencies and consultants/contractors
        working on WBG projects had the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “public
        sector governance/institutional development,? whereas respondents from CSOs and the
        media had significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents across geographic locations gave statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in almost all thirty six development areas. Respondents from La Paz gave
        significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “other? areas than
        respondents from outside of La Paz.
       Respondents whose primarily specialization of work is in “public sector
        governance/public financial management/anti corruption? (10% of the sample) gave
        significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “financial sector (access,
        regulation, development)? than respondents from other areas of specialization.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 60) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
        “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
        areas.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the
        Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Bolivia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Bolivia. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction and equity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at employment and job creation;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/institutional development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Bolivia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction and equity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for six of WBG’s
        qualities as an effective development partner. They are the WBG’s “responsiveness,?
        “flexibility in terms of changing country circumstances,? “straightforwardness and
        honesty,? “ease of access to the people at the WBG who are making decisions important
        to my work,? “collaboration with civil society,? and “collaboration with the private
        sector.? For the most part, respondents from project implementation agencies and
        consultants/contractors working on WBG projects tended to give the highest ratings,
        whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to give
        significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details). It is worth mentioning that
        respondents from the media gave the highest ratings for the“ease of access to the people
        at the WBG who are making decisions important to my work.?
       Respondents located outside La Paz had significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s
        “straightforwardness and honesty,? than respondents from La Paz.
       There were significant differences between respondents who do and do not collaborate
        with the WBG in their ratings for all of these indicator qualities of the WBG as an
        effective development partner (except the WBG’s “collaboration with the Government?).
        Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly higher
        ratings than those who do not.

 A5. The World Bank Group’s “Shared Prosperity? goal captures two key elements, economic growth
 and equity. It will seek to foster income growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s
 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the
 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “Shared Prosperity? in Bolivia, which of the following
 TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Bolivia? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1   Sustainable economic growth
  2   Increased access and quality of basic services (water and sanitation, electricity)
  3   Expanded access and quality of social services (education, health and nutrition)
  4   Job creation and quality of employment (reduced informality)
  5   Increased access to markets for rural producers
  6   Community-driven development
  7   Better targeted public investment and social policies
  8   Promote inclusion of indigenous people

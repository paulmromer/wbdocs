EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Malaysia has recorded a cumulative total of over 98,000 persons infected with HIV by the end of 2012.

The number of recorded cases of HIV infection in Malaysia is highest among people who inject drugs

(PWID) which constitutes 67 per cent of the total cumulative cases. In the effort to mitigate the HIV

transmission among PWID, the government of Malaysia initiated harm reduction programme

comprising the Needle Syringe Programme (NSP) and Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) in

2006. Since its inception as a National Pilot Project in 2006, the funding for the programmes has

gradually been increased to increase the coverage of these programmes. During the phase of the harm

reduction programme, the NSP was carried out by non-governmental organisations affiliated with the

Malaysian AIDS Council whilst the MMT was provided by medical practitioners in the public and

private health sectors. Since then the MMT programme has been expanded into the non-health sector

and is being implemented by the prisons and the National Anti-Drug Agencies (NADA). By the end of

2011, the Malaysian government has invested a total of RM69.3 million for harm reduction programme.

Despite the official recognition that the harm reduction programme may have been successful in

reducing HIV transmission, concerns have been raised that public funding for these activities may not

be sustainable in the long run and sources of alternative funding is desired. Thus, an assessment of the

economic impact and cost-effectiveness of this programme is very much needed.




Objective: This project aimed to assess whether the harm reduction programme in Malaysia, which

consists of NSP and MMT programmes amongst PWID, have been cost-effective from the perspective

of the government by estimating savings in direct health care cost to the government resulting from

infections that were averted as a result of the NSP and MMT programmes. The following estimates

were included in the estimate of savings in direct health care costs; estimate the cost-effectiveness of

the NSP and MMT programmes in terms of costs for the provision of programmes net of health care

cost savings for each quality-adjusted-life years (QALYs) gained; estimate the return on investment

(ROI) from NSP and MMT programmes where ROI refers to total health care costs saved from averted

infections in comparison to total programme costs. The cost-effectiveness and ROI of these programmes

                                                                                                      9
were evaluated over 3 time periods, from 2006 to current year 2013, a short 10-year future projection

from 2013 to 2023, as well as projections from 2006 to 2050 to capture the long-term costs and benefits

of the programmes.




Population Model Methods: An epidemiological mathematical model developed by a team of

investigators at the Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Australia, was adopted to simulate

the impact of MMT and NSP on the transmission of HIV among PWIDs in Malaysia. The model

required input of HIV prevalence, behavioural and demographic data for PWID in Malaysia. The

required information was obtained through an extensive review of published literature as well as other

data sources from government agencies and non-government organisations (NGOs) involved in the

provision of MMT and NSP services. The model simulates the number of PWID who become infected

with HIV over time and the extent of disease progression among those infected in the presence and

absence of harm reduction programme in the country. The model also tracks the number of people who

were initiated on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), the rate of treatment failure and progression to

second- and subsequent-lines of ART.



Economic analysis methods: The epidemic model results were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of

the programmes. The cost of harm reduction programme and ART were obtained directly from the

Ministry of Health (MOH). A separate costing exercise was carried out to derive the costs of inpatient

and outpatient treatment for PWIDs living with HIV. All costs and benefits were reported for the base

year 2013. The relevant years’ Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) were used to adjust for inflation. A

three per cent discount rate was applied for future costs and benefits. The economic analysis of outcome

of interest are including direct health care cost saved, QALYs gained, incremental cost effective ratio

(ICER) and ROI. The analysis was estimated for combined NSP and MMT programmes as well as

independently for NSP and MMT.

Results

Combined MMT and NSP: Over a period of 2006 to 2013, the combined MMT and NSP programmes

were found to be cost-effective. The programmes implemented to date will have long term

epidemiological and economic benefits.

MMT only: During the 2006-2013 periods, the MMT programme alone is cost-effective but not cost

saving. Projection of expected future epidemiological and economic benefits show MMT programmes

would improve in their cost-effectiveness ratios but not become cost saving. It is worth noting that only

HIV-related benefits and costs were included in these analyses. MMT is primarily implemented for

reduction of drug use and the many other social benefits that result. These benefits are not included in

the analyses. Therefore, the overall cost-effectiveness of the NSP and MMT programmes represent a

significant under-estimate of the overall cost-effectiveness of the harm reduction programme.

1.      Introduction

Cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections were first detected in Malaysia in 1986

(Ministry of Health, 2012). Since then, the number of new HIV cases has been increasing steadily to a

peak of 6,978 new cases detected in 2002 then declining to 3,438 new cases in 2012. By the end of

2012, the country recorded a cumulative total of 98,279 persons diagnosed with HIV infection, 19,047

of them with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and 15,688 HIV/AIDS related deaths.

Despite the declining number of new infections, the challenge of controlling the spread of HIV is far

from over and the HIV disease burden remains high among several key populations, namely female sex

workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID). Of

these, the number of HIV cases has been highest among PWID where it has been estimated that 67.2

per cent of the cumulative reported HIV cases from 1986 to 2012 (or 66,046 out of the total of 98,279

cases) are made up of PWID (Ministry of Health, 2012). Due to the high numbers of PWIDs among

those with HIV, Malaysia has been described as experiencing a severe HIV epidemic due to drug use

similar to countries such as Russia, China, Ukraine and Vietnam (Wolfe et al., 2010).



In response to the escalating epidemic, the Government of Malaysia (GOM) agreed the implementation

of NSP and MMT programmes against much public opposition which viewed these programmes as

being against the Islamic religion and would encourage more people to use drugs. Beginning with a one

year pilot programme, the harm reduction has been expanded with considerable resources being

allocated for its implementation which has come almost exclusively from the public purse. It was

reported that almost 40 per cent of the 2006-2010 budget allocation of RM500 million for HIV/AIDS

prevention activities was set aside for harm reduction activities (Ministry of Health, 2010b). In common

with many other countries, there are multiple competing interests on public funds in Malaysia. Although

there has been some official recognition that the harm reduction programme may have been successful

in reducing HIV transmission, the government has also raised concerns that public funding for these

activities may not be sustainable in the long run and that alternative funding sources for these activities

need to be obtained (Ministry of Health, 2012). Since 2012, mainly funding for such activities has also

been supplemented by international agencies including the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria

                                                                                                        13
(GFATM) and the International HIV/AIDS Alliance although the GOM remains the single largest

funding source (Ministry of Health, 2012).



This economic evaluation of the harm reduction programme is primarily aimed at evaluating the level

to which NSP and MMT as implemented in Malaysia have been effective in averting HIV infections

and whether these programmes have also resulted in cost savings to the government.            Similar

evaluations have been performed in several developed countries and in different programme settings

which have all indicated that the programmes were cost-effective and cost-saving (Gold et al., 1997,

Laufer, 2001, Cabases and Sanchez, 2003, Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing 2002,

Barnett, 1999, Razzaghi et al., 2005, McCarty et al., 2010). Such economic appraisal however has yet

to be performed in Malaysia. Evidence produced would be useful to inform policy debate concerning

future allocations of public funds for HIV/AIDS prevention activities.




2.      Background

The HIV epidemic in Malaysia has thus far been mainly concentrated in four key affected populations

with the prevalence amongst the general population estimated at less than one per cent. Results from

the 2012 Integrated Bio-Behavioural Surveillance Survey (IBBS) conducted by the MOH in multiple

selected sites throughout the country reported HIV prevalence rates of 4.2 per cent among female sex

workers, 5.7 per cent among transgenders, 12.6 per cent among MSM and 18.9 per cent among PWIDs

(Ministry of Health, 2013). An earlier IBBS, which was carried out in 2009 in sites around the Klang

Valley, which are areas around the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, examined the HIV prevalence among

the transgenders (9.3 per cent), FSWs (10.5 per cent) and PWID (22.1 per cent) (Ministry of Health and

Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009). While PWID remain the largest group of people living with HIV

(PLHIV), over the last several years there has been a gradual shift in the predominant mode of HIV

transmission in the country.   In 1990, there was one sexual transmission for every nine infections

attributed to injecting drug use (Ministry of Health, 2012). Twenty years later in 2010, equal numbers

of new HIV cases are reported from injecting drug use and sexual transmission. In 2011, the trend has

                                                                                                    14
been reversed altogether with six sexual transmissions reported for every four from injecting drug use

(Figure 1).

Harm reduction in the context of HIV prevention in Malaysia basically refers to two programmes, the

Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) programme and the Needle Syringe Exchange Programme

(NSP). The MMT programme is an opioid substitution therapy using methadone and is aimed at

preventing HIV transmission by reducing injection drug use and the sharing of contaminated injecting

equipment. Thus, the MMT programme reduces high-risk practices among PWID and the likelihood

of sero-conversion due to its role in reducing injection frequency. Most studies in Malaysia have shown

that heroin is the most commonly used drug amongst PWID in Malaysia. The IBBS study conducted

in 2009 in the Klang Valley found that approximately 87 per cent of PWIDs in noted to use heroin1

(Ministry of Health and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009). An earlier Behavioural Surveillance Survey

(BSS) study in 2004 among PWID in three states across the peninsular Malaysia reported similar

finding that majority PWID used heroin (Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004)



1
    Other drugs used are non-opiates such as diazepam, amphetamines and Subutex.

                                                                                                            15
The MMT programme in Malaysia provides a working example of public-private partnership in health

right from its beginnings in 2006 when methadone was made available from only 17 sites (10 public

health facilities and seven private clinics). There has since been a rapid expansion of the programme

such that by 2011, 20,955 persons had registered to receive free services from 268 public sector MMT

sites, including MOH facilities, prisons and National Anti-Drug Agency (NADA) service centres, and

another 23,573 persons paid for services obtained from a network of 24 private general practitioner

(GP) clinics2. The public sector MMT providers are mainly made up of MOH health care facilities,

followed by prisons and NADA (Figure 2). From 2007 to 2011, the number of clients receiving

services in all public sector MMT service providers had more than quadrupled. In general, the services

provided under the MMT programme by public providers, namely the MOH, prisons and NADA are

similar and include provision of methadone, Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) and referral to

HIV clinics for treatment. In the case of MOH and NADA, programme clients are also offered referrals

for job opportunities whilst private GPs generally only provide methadone with little or no other

support services.

On the other hand, the NSP is aimed at the provision of clean needles and syringes to PWIDs in order

to reduce cross HIV infections among PWIDs through sharing of contaminated needles and other

injecting equipment. Delivery of the NSP programme was through a direct partnership with NGOs,

namely the Malaysian AIDS Council and her partner organisations. The NSP programme started in

2006 with only three NGOs which operated three drop-in centres (DICs) and 42 outreach points and

which collectively provided services to a total of 4,357 PWIDs.                                In 2008 NSP services were

implemented in six MOH clinics as well. By 2011, 34,244 PWIDs had registered to receive NSP

services from 18 NGOs (operating 18 DICs and 203 outreach points) and 76 MOH clinics3 (Figure 3).

In general, all NSP clients receive packages consisting of sterile needle and syringes and other safe

injecting paraphernalia such as alcohol swabs and cotton balls. In addition to these, clients are also

provided with risk reduction counselling such as safer injection techniques and hygiene issues, and

referrals to MMT services, welfare and legal services, VCT and other health care services when

warranted.

In 2011, an average of 429 needles and syringes had been distributed to every PWID who registered

with the NSP programme or 24 needles and syringes for every PWID in the country (Table 1). In

comparison, it has been estimated that PWIDs in other countries in Southeast Asia received between 7

to 68 needles and syringes per year (Mathers et al., 2010).

With the sole exception of MMT services obtained from private clinics, the cost of providing MMT and

NSP services had been predominantly borne by the GOM. In 2008, the financial support for the two

harm reduction programme constituted 12.6 per cent of the total public expenditures for the national

AIDS programme amounting to RM84.0 million (Ministry of Health, 2010b). As shown in Figure 4,

the annual MOH expenditures for harm reduction activities made up between 13.0 per cent and 16.5

per cent of the annual total AIDS public expenditures. And to put everything into perspective, the

national AIDS public expenditures made up 0.28 per cent of MOH’s total expenditures in 20 08 and

0.27 per cent in 2009 (Ministry of Health, 2010b).

Despite the government’s commitment to harm reduction activities, the coverage of the programmes

remained limited. In 2009, it was estimated that less than 12 per cent of the estimated 170,000 PWID,

had access to NSP (Ministry of Health, 2010a). Among the reasons identified as being barriers to

adequate expansion of services were insufficient funds, human resources and infrastructure (Ministry

of Health, 2010a). Unlike many neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and

Cambodia which have received substantial international funds for HIV prevention and treatment

programmes, international donor funding has not played a significant role in the financing of HIV/AIDS

programmes or health care in general in Malaysia (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2011). This is probably

in line with international sentiments that Malaysia, being an upper middle income country would be in

a better position than many other low and middle income countries to self-support the provision of

health care services to its population. In 2009, the country spent approximately 5.0 per cent of her GDP

                                                                                                                                                                                                 20
on health (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2011). Public financing sources contributed slightly more than

half of the total expenditures or 2.7 per cent of GDP. This amount is much less than that committed by

many other countries of similar economic development and thus, it can be argued that Malaysia could

afford to increase public funding for health care and in the context of this study, it can also be argued

that the country can afford to increase public funding of harm reduction activities. In 2011, to

supplement the domestic funds allocated to harm reduction, Malaysia was successful in obtaining funds

from GFATM to supplement funding of its HIV prevention activities. In June 2011, the MOH received

RM15 million for five years to increase NSP coverage and to strengthen intervention programmes for

sex workers. As financial aid from the Global Fund is not intended for long-term support of country-

level programmes, the GOM will need to re-examine its commitment to harm reduction activities by

sustaining and impact expanding the funds that are allocated for HIV prevention and treatment

programmes, in particular the harm reduction programme. In essence, this study is to provide evidence

to inform policy decision making on this matter.




3.      Study objectives

The main objectives of this study are to evaluate whether the harm reduction programme in Malaysia

is cost-effective and also whether they provide return on investments to the government. The cost-

effective evaluation is aimed at examining whether the harm reduction programme represent value for

money from the viewpoint of society, i.e. the benefits obtained justify the money spent by the

government. On the other hand, the ROI analysis examines whether these programmes provide cost-

savings to the government, who is the main programme funder. As such, this economic evaluation has

been conducted from the government perspective only. Cost of provision of MMT from private

practitioners has not been included in the analysis.




Specifically, the study aims to:

                                                                                                       21
i.      evaluate the effectiveness of MMT and NSP in preventing transmissions of HIV among PWID

        in terms of number of HIV infections averted through harm reduction;

ii.     estimate savings in direct health care cost to the government resulting from the averted

        infections;

iii.    estimate the quality of life (QoL) gained from harm reductions programmes as measured using

        Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs);

iv.     estimate the cost-effectiveness of the MMT and NSP programmes in terms of costs for the

        provision of programmes net of health care cost savings for each QALY gained;

v.      calculate the ROI from MMT and NSP programmes where ROI refers to total health care costs

        saved from averted infections in comparison to total programme costs; and

vi.     provide recommendations for resource allocations for harm reduction activities in Malaysia.




4.      Methodology

The study used an epidemiologic mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression,

called the Projection and Evaluation Tool (Prevtool) developed by a team of investigators at the Kirby

Institute, University of New South Wales, Australia to simulate the impact of MMT and NSP on the

transmission of HIV among PWIDs in Malaysia. A description of Prevtool is provided in Appendix A.

Briefly, the model simulates the number of PWID who become infected with HIV over time as well as

the extent of disease progression among those infected in the presence and absence of harm reduction

programme in the country. The model considers both direct transmission of HIV from sharing of

contaminated injecting equipment as well as onward transmission from these infected PWID to others.



Clinical protocol in Malaysia prescribes differential levels of health care to PLHIV dependent on their

CD4 counts. In this respect, the provision of health care to PLHIV differs in terms of frequency of

outpatient consultations, tests performed and initiation of ART depending on the stage of disease. Thus,

in order to estimate the expected demand for health care, Prevtool categorises PLHIV by CD4 count



                                                                                                     22
groupings. The model also tracks the number of people who were initiated on first-line ART, the rate

of treatment failure and progression to second- and subsequent-lines of ART.



Use of the Prevtool model required input of epidemiological, behavioural, demographic and health care

cost data for PWID in Malaysia. The required information was obtained through an extensive review

of published literature as well as other data sources including government agencies and NGOs involved

in the provision of MMT and NSP services (Appendix B). Appendices C1 to C5 list all model input

parameters used in the study, their descriptions, values, data sources and assumptions. Although some

risk behaviours may differ by gender, the model inputs had not been stratified by gender. This is not

expected to have a large impact on the results of this analysis since more than 90 per cent of the PWIDs

in Malaysia are males (Ministry of Health, 2009). A separate costing exercise was carried out to derive

the annual direct health care costs of treating PWIDs living with HIV. Appendix D provides details of

this costing study. Model outputs are provided as medians with 95 per cent confidence intervals.



One of the main aims of this study was to explore whether the MMT and NSP programmes as

implemented in Malaysia were cost-effective or in other words whether these programmes represent

value for money. This required the estimation of a measure, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

(ICER) which compares programme costs to additional health gains from harm reduction activities. In

order to conclude whether the programmes have been cost-effective, it would be necessary to compare

the ICER values to a cost-effectiveness threshold which is generally understood to be the maximum

societal willingness to pay for a unit of health gain either measured in life years gained, disability-

adjusted life years (DALY) averted or QALYs gained (Eichler et al., 2004). As yet there is no such

threshold which has been openly debated and accepted in Malaysia nor is there a global consensus on

how high this threshold should be set.       However, based on the report of the Commission on

Macroeconomics and Health (World Health Organisation, 2001), the WHO has suggested that for

developing countries, “interventions costing less than three times GDP per capita for each DALY

averted represent good value for money” and further that, “very cost-effective interventions as those

which avert each additional DALY at a cost less than GDP per capita, and cost-effective interventions

                                                                                                     23
as those where each DALY averted costs between one and three times GDP per capita” (World Health

Organisation, 2002).



In 2012, the per capita GDP for Malaysia was RM29,683 or nearly RM30,000 (approximately

USD10,00) (Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2012). In this study, health gains have been measured

in QALYs. Theoretically a DALY averted is not equivalent to a QALY gained, and therefore the WHO

cost-effectiveness threshold cannot be directly translated to RM90,000 per QALY for Malaysia.

However, Eichler et al (2004) compared DALY and QALY weights in a broad range of disease

categories and concluded that the value of the WHO threshold of three times GDP in DALY would

exceed equivalent values in QALY. Thus, this study applied the value of RM90,000 per QALY gained

as the conservative threshold for evaluation of cost-effectiveness of harm reduction programme in

Malaysia.



Prevtool was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness and ROI of the harm reduction programme in

Malaysia from the start of the programmes in 2006 to current year 2013, a short 10-year future

projection from 2013 to 2023, as well as projections from 2006 to 2050 to capture the long term costs

and benefits of the programmes.         For purposes of model calibration, parameters involving

epidemiological and behavioural data used covered the period 2000 to 2013.             However, the

effectiveness of the programme was evaluated only after the harm reduction started in 2006. Future

projections, from 2013, were made based on the assumption that the programme coverage remained at

constant at 2013 levels but with changing programme costs in tandem with changes in target PWID

population. Similarly, health care costs savings also changed with changes in estimated averted

infections. All costs and benefits are reported for the base year 2013. Where necessary, adjustments

were made for inflation using Consumer Price Indices (CPI) obtained from the Department of Statistics,

Malaysia. A three per cent discount rate was applied for future costs and benefits.




                                                                                                    24
5.      Results

5.1     Estimates of impact on disease burden

From 2006 to 2013, it is estimated that 20,903 new HIV infections occurred after the implementation

of the MMT and NSP programmes (Table 2). This is in contrast to the estimated 34,220 new infections

for the period 2006 to 2013, had these programmes not been implemented. Thus the harm reduction

programme averted approximately 12,653 new HIV infections. It is expected that continuing the harm

reduction programme to 2023 at the current 2013 coverage level, MMT and NSP would avert an

additional 23,241 new infections.

Table 3 shows the reduction in HIV prevalence among PWIDs in the various time periods evaluated.

Under the situation in which both MMT and NSP had been implemented and assuming that the

programme coverage of 2013 remains a constant, prevalence of HIV among the PWIDs is expected to

be nine per cent in 2013, dropping to four per cent in 2023 and one per cent in 2050. In the absence of

these programmes, the prevalence is estimated to be 14 per cent in 2013 and 16 per cent in 2023 and

2050. This reduction of HIV prevalence is mainly attributed to uptake of harm reduction among PWIDs

and can be explained by both a reduction in incidence of HIV (Table 2) as well as reduction in mortality

among PWIDs (Table 3). Reduction in mortality among PWID in the presence of MMT and NSP is

assumed to be due to reduced numbers of infected PWIDs since other model parameters, including

uptake of ART, have not been varied.



Model estimations suggest that the averted infections and concomitant reduction in HIV prevalence had

been mainly due to the impact of the NSP rather than the MMT programme (Tables 2 and 3).

5.2      Estimates of quality of life effects

The harm reduction programme prevented PWIDs from being infected by HIV. For this group of

people, the MMT and NSP programmes provide QoL benefits from two aspects. The most obvious is

the prolongation of lives of those who would have been infected. The second is from the avoidance of

morbidity and social consequences of HIV infection. These Qol effects of harm reduction have been

measured using the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) approach.



QALYs combines measurement of the benefits gained from prolongation of life for those who avoided

infections as well as the benefits gained from reduction in physical and mental suffering for those who

avoided living with the infection into a single measure. One QALY is equivalent to living one year in

perfect health. Estimations of QALYs require QoL values for different stages of the HIV illness.

QALYs gained would then be the estimated time in which persons had avoided living in each stage of

the disease multiplied by the relevant QoL value for that disease stage. In this study, the cumulative

length of time avoided in each disease stage was estimated using PrevTool. In this analysis, the QoL

values applied to these estimates were obtained from a published meta-analysis of utility for HIV/AIDS

and available relevant utility for HIV-related deaths (Tengs and Lin, 2002). Details of these QoL

weights by disease states are provided in Appendix C4.



As opposed to the NSP programme in which QoL improvement is mainly due to avoidance of HIV

infection, PWIDs who undergo MMT may also experience improvement in other social aspects of their

lives such as reduction in recidivism, increase productivity at work and other psychosocial benefits

(Huong et al., 2009, Razzaghi et al., 2005, Musa et al., 2012). The MMT programme participants enjoy

greater social integration since they suffer less from side effects of drug addiction. This analysis has

also factored in this aspect of QoL improvement for all participants of the MMT programme (Salomon

et al., 2012).



It is estimated that the harm reduction programme have resulted in gains of approximately 51,565

QALYs in the period 2006 to 2013 with an eight-fold increase in benefits for the period 2013 to 2023

                                                                                                     29
and a 40-fold increase for the period from 2006 to 2050 (Table 4). These large future gains in benefits

are not unexpected since QoL impact on persons newly infected with HIV is expected to be small

compared to the impact later in the life-course of infection when they develop co-morbidities or even

AIDS. However, even after incorporating the QoL improvement of MMT due to the social aspects, the

QALYs gained from MMT alone are lower than that for NSP.

5.3        Estimates of direct health care cost savings

Health care services for PLHIV as well as ART drugs (first and second-line drugs) are primarily funded

by the government. Harm reduction programme would thus provide for some cost-savings to the

government since they prevent HIV transmission to some PWIDs who would then not require HIV-

related health care services.




                                                                                                          30
In Malaysia, PLHIV would be eligible for ART once their CD4 counts reach below 350 cells/mL. In

2010, the annual cost of providing first-line ART drugs4 was RM 2,684 per person and if second-line

drugs5 were provided, the cost would have been RM13,643 per person6 .



Most of the PWIDs who have been infected with HIV would seek care in public health facilities. The

main public agency providing care to the PWIDs is the MOH. Other agencies such as the academic

medical centres supplement services provided by the MOH. The care provided in all public facilities

is highly subsidised by the GOM through use of funds from general taxation. Although all public health

care facilities charge user fees for most of their services, these fees have been kept low7. Rohaizat

(2004) estimated that the revenue collected from patients through user fees was far below the cost of

care and contributed only about three per cent of the MOH’s annual budget. The annual government

subsidy for health care consumed by each infected PWID for the year 2010, which represents the cost

of health care borne by the GOM, was estimated in a cost description exercise detailed in Appendix D.

Since existing clinical protocols prescribes health care regimes by CD4 counts, cost estimates had been

conducted separately for those persons with CD4 counts above 350 cells/mL and those whose cell

counts were below this level. The estimated annual outpatient and inpatient care costs for infected

PWIDs who sought treatment are summarised in Table 5.

  First line regimen consist of Stavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine, or Combivir and Efavirenz, or Combivir
and Nevirapine.

  Second line drugs are Combivir in combination with Kaletra.

  A patient needs to pay only RM1 (approximately USD1 for RM3) for an episode of outpatient care (inclusive of
consultation, investigations and medications) at any MOH general outpatient clinic. Many services provided at
these clinics are also free and these include childhood vaccination services. Fees for inpatient care in MOH
hospitals are also controlled and set lower than cost. The daily ward charges in a MOH hospital range from RM80
a day for a single bedded air-conditioned room (First Class) to RM3 a day in a dormitory-like Third Class ward.
Fees for surgical treatment depended on the complexity of procedures and ranges from RM3,000 for a ‘Type A’
procedure (e.g. renal transplant) for a First Class patient to RM10 for a ‘Type F’ procedure (e.g. circumcision) for
a Third Class patient.

Combining the estimated number of infections averted with the health care costs incurred, Prevtool

estimated that over the period of eight years from 2006 to 2013, MMT and NSP programmes resulted

in cost savings of approximately RM 47.1 million (Table 6). In the next 10 years, the model estimated

that a further RM 209.5 million would have been saved. The Prevtool is also used to estimate projection

of cost saving if the programmes were to continue until 2050. It was estimated that MMT and NSP

programmes would save approximately RM909.5 million, from 2006 to 2050 in health care costs. As

is shown in the table, cost savings were mainly from the NSP programme.

Using available information, the model projected the expenditures for years 2012 and 2013. It is

programme (Table 8).

Note. Estimates are medians with 95% confidence intervals provided in parentheses. All estimates

These programme costs were then compared to the estimated QALYs gained from the MMT and NSP

programmes (Table 4) and health care savings (Table 6). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios

(ICER) of these harm reduction programme were estimated in comparison to the baseline scenario in

the absence of such programmes. The ICER values are that of costs for each programme net of health

care savings per QALY gained from the programme. In the case of NSP programme alone, the health

care costs savings exceeded programme costs for all the time periods examined and thus regardless of

cost-effectiveness threshold used, NSP can be considered very cost-effective. In the case of the MMT

programme implemented alone, the health care costs were higher than programme costs but ICER

values for all the time periods showed that the MMT programme if implemented alone was also very

cost-effective8, i.e. below per capital GDP per QALY, with ICER values ranging from RM 2,354 per




8
    Below GDP per capita per QALY or RM30,000 per QALY.

                                                                                                   34
QALY gained for the period 2006 to 2013, RM 723 per QALY gained for the period 2013 to 2023 and

only RM 308 per QALY gained for the period 2006 to 2050.



Since the NSP programme was found to be more cost effective than the MMT programme, further

analysis explored the policy option of the addition of the MMT programme to the existing NSP

programme. The ICER values from the incremental addition of MMT to the NSP programmes range

from RM2,465 per QALY (2006-2013), RM1,611 per QALY (2013-2023) to RM1,482 per QALY

(2006-2053). Thus the combined MMT and NSP programmes have been found to be cost effective.




5.4      Return on investments of the harm reduction programme

Estimates of the ROI resulting from the harm reduction programme in Malaysia are provided in Table

9.    These estimates have been derived from examination of government investments into the

programmes and comparing these to the direct health care cost savings from averted HIV infections.



The analysis shows that from 2006 to 2013, the combined MMT and NSP programmes did not result

in any net cost savings to the government; there was a return of only RM 0.51 in direct health care costs

savings for every RM1.00 invested into the combined programmes. However, these programmes

resulted in saving in the next 10 years when it is predicted that the returns in health care costs savings

would increase to RM1.07 for every RM1.00 investment. Over the period 2006 to 2050, the returns are

expected to increase to RM1.13 for every RM1.00 investment. As described earlier, the health care

cost savings from NSP exceeded programme costs for all the time periods examined. This resulted in

overall cost savings to the government as reflected in the ROI values exceeding RM 1.00 for every RM

1.00 invested in the programme. The opposite is true in the case of the MMT programme examined in

isolation.

6.       Discussion

This study is the first comprehensive economic evaluation of the MMT and NSP programmes in

Malaysia and has produced several important findings which should inform policy discussions on

continued GOM financial support for harm reduction activities in the country. From 2006 to 2013, the

GOM has invested an estimated RM 92 million into harm reduction activities, provided either mainly

by NGOs (as in the case of the NSP programme) or by public agencies including the MOH and NADA

(as in the case of the MMT programme). Though, harm reduction in the context of HIV containment

is undoubtedly an evidence-based prevention strategy, one of the often raised questions in policy circles

concerns the level of effectiveness of the programme – to what extent has the harm reduction activities

in Malaysia actually prevented transmission of HIV? This, perhaps, is the first important contribution

of this study, that the effectiveness of MMT and NSP programmes as they have been implemented in

the country has actually been quantified.



An estimated 21,000 new HIV infections occurred in the eight year period, from 2006 to 2013, after

harm reduction activities commenced in Malaysia. In the absence of such activities, it is estimated that

an additional 12,600 new infections would have occurred. In other words, the MMT and NSP

programmes reduced the burden of new infections by about a third in the first eight years of

implementation. What is more significant is that with the harm reduction programme in place, it is



                                                                                                               36
expected that a further 23,000 new HIV cases would be prevented in the next ten years, reducing the

expected burden of new HIV infections by a significant 87 per cent. Taking an even longer perspective,

from 2006 to 2050, the combined MMT and NSP programmes are expected to reduce burden of new

HIV infections by 79 per cent.



While these findings of averted infections are of value to inform policy discussions, it should also be

pointed out that the benefits of the MMT and NSP programmes do not end with preventing occurrence

of new HIV infections alone, especially if viewed from the perspective of the GOM. The current dual

public-private healthcare sectors in Malaysia offer consumers a wide variety of choice with the private

sector catering to public demand for medical therapies in comfortable, even luxurious surroundings,

and without the need to wait for treatment. Private care is expensive, paid for mainly by direct out-of-

pocket payments and, as such, utilised by those who can afford to pay. On the other hand, access to the

low-priced and widely distributed public health services is available to all citizens of the country9. The

GOM bears approximately 97 per cent of the cost of providing care in the public health sector. Due to

socioeconomic reasons, most PWIDs infected with HIV would seek treatment in public facilities and

thus would directly benefit from government funding for the care that they receive. Hence, the MMT

and NSP programmes, in being able to prevent new cases of HIV would also serve as avenues to procure

cost savings for the Government.



PWIDs who are also HIV infected require health care in many forms. They need regular medical

consultations and laboratory investigations to gauge the progress of their illness.               Those with

opportunistic infections may require more intensive treatment in a hospital setting. In addition, persons

whose CD4 counts fall below 350 cells/mm3 would also need to be started on ART . If the PLHIV

obtain services from the public providers, most if not all of the related health care costs would be borne

by the government. By preventing HIV transmissions to 12,600 PWIDs, it is estimated that the harm

reduction programme allowed the GOM to accrue savings from direct health care costs amounting to


9
 Non-citizens are permitted to use public services upon payment of fees which are set at a higher rate than for
citizens.

                                                                                                            37
RM 47 million over the period 2006 to 2013. Despite the provision of free ART by the GOM, not all

who clinically qualify to receive ART drugs are receiving treatment - only a third of all who medically

qualify to receive ART are receiving the drugs and less than 25 per cent of these are PWIDs. Due to

disease progression for those not on ART, it is expected that they would require higher intensity health

care over time which would translate to higher health care costs for the government. Thus, direct health

care cost savings from averted infections in the initial eight year period are expected to increase over

time. This, combined with cost savings from infections newly averted in the next ten years, is expected

to result in higher health care cost savings to the government of RM 209 million over the 10-year period

from 2013 to 2023.



During the period 2006 to 2013, the GOM invested a total of RM 92 million into harm reduction

activities which resulted in health care cost savings from infections averted of about RM 47 million. It

would then be logical to question whether these programmes represent ‘value-for-money’ or are cost-

effective. To complicate the issue further, by examining each programme individually the study found

that the NSP has out-performed the MMT programme in the sense that the MMT programme costs more

but was able to avert less HIV infections than the NSP programme. Moreover, unlike the MMT

programme, health care costs savings from the NSP programme actually exceeded its programme costs.

From 2006 to 2013, the NSP cost the GOM a sum of RM 34 million but produced direct cost savings

of RM 46 million - a return of RM1.35 in savings from every RM1.00 invested into the programme. In

the following ten years, the NSP programme is expected to produce an even higher return in savings of

RM 3.18 for every ringgit invested. These findings highlight the economic rationale for having a NSP

programme. Thus, the study then focussed its attention to the question of whether the addition of MMT

to complement NSP services is economically justified.



To answer this question, the study turned to another measure of programme effectiveness, QALYs,

which have been used extensively in health care research to measure and compare effectiveness of

various health care therapies. PWIDs, who are infected with HIV, are expected to experience a

deterioration in QoL over time and will probably suffer premature mortality. The extent that both of

                                                                                                      38
these conditions occur can be measured in QALYs - one QALY can be viewed as a year of life lived in

perfect health. Since the number of HIV infections prevented by harm reduction has been quantified in

this study, it was then also possible to estimate the QALYs gained from these programmes. These

QALYs reflect the QoL and length of lives that were preserved for those fortunate enough not to be

infected with HIV because of their participation in harm reduction activities. To determine if the

combined MMT and NSP programmes had been cost effective, the incremental increase in net

programme costs from NSP alone to a combined programme was compared to the incremental increase

in QALYs gained to produce a metric known as ICER. In the first eight years of the combined MMT

and NSP programme, the ICER value was RM 2,465 per QALY gained which is below the cost

effectiveness threshold adopted in this study of RM 90,000 per QALY. Thus the combined MMT and

NSP programme has been found to be cost-effective and can be considered a ‘value-for-money’

prevention strategy.



What does a cost-effective health strategy really mean? To label a health programme as being cost-

effective is to say that after consideration of the benefits obtained from the programme, society in

general considers the money invested in it well spent. However, unlike the United Kingdom which has

an explicit threshold to gauge cost-effectiveness of medical therapies, Malaysia has yet to develop a

culture of using results of economic evaluations before adoption of new medical therapies and thus has

yet to develop an explicit threshold. Despite this, some informative indications can be obtained from

examination of another health prevention programme that has been implemented in this country. In

tabling the 2012 budget, the Prime Minister announced an allocation of RM 50 million to provide free

human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations to 18 year old girls to supplement a similar programme for

13 year old schoolgirls started in 2010. The HPV vaccination programme was added to existing Pap

smear screening services in an effort to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, one of the most frequent

cancers among women in Malaysia. The programme has since received wide public support. Ezat et

al (2010) performed an economic evaluation comparing the combined HPV vaccination and Pap smear

screening programmes to a baseline situation of just the screening programme alone. The estimated

ICER value of the combined cervical cancer prevention programme was found to be RM 35,347 per

                                                                                                       39
QALY gained, which is about 15 times the ICER value of the combined harm reduction programme

evaluated in this study.



This study is one among many other recent studies (Ni et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2011, Kwon et al.,

2012, Tran et al., 2011, Wammes et al., 2012, Xing et al., 2012) which have demonstrated the

effectiveness of MMT and NSP in preventing HIV transmission among PWIDs. The magnitude of

programme benefit differs between studies as is only logical as number of infections averted would be

dependent on HIV prevalence and programme coverage among other factors. In general, though

different thresholds had been applied, these studies have also concluded that harm reduction was cost-

effective in their respective country contexts. The Malaysian findings are in line with this general

consensus. In addition, the benefits of the MMT and NSP programmes are expected to increase in the

future. In the next ten years, these programmes not only become more cost-effective but also produce

cost savings to the Government. From 2013 to 2023, the ICER value of the programme is expected to

decrease to RM 1,611 per QALY gained but an equally important finding is that direct health care cost

savings of RM 209 million would exceed programme costs of RM195 million producing a return of

RM 1.07 per every ringgit invested by the GOM. Together these findings would argue for continuation

of government financial support for harm reduction activities in Malaysia.



In addition to contributions towards informed policy discussion on GOM funding for harm reduction,

this study has also revealed other policy relevant areas for future research. The analysis of future costs

and benefits of harm reduction programme in Malaysia was based on the assumption that the coverage

of these programmes remained at the 2013 levels. This was to directly address the important policy

question of whether existing harm reduction activities had been cost-effective and produced cost

savings. However, it is also acknowledged that additional important policy input could be obtained if

scenarios with different coverage levels had been examined which could specifically address the

question of whether GOM should invest in efforts to expand coverage of services. The current coverage

of harm reduction programme in Malaysia remains limited, as low as less than 35 per cent of PWIDs

have access to harm reductions as of 2011. It is possible that with increased programme coverage and

                                                                                                       40
funding in the future, more infections could be averted resulting in higher savings in direct health care

costs. A study in Indonesia has shown that expansion in MMT coverage from five to 40 per cent in

West Java could be expected to reduce the number of infections among PWIDs by 18 per cent (Wammes

et al., 2012).



The study was very much focused on costs and savings from the perspective of the GOM which

contributed to the decision to compare GOM investments into harm reduction against direct health care

cost savings for HIV infections. At the current time, there are limited publicly financed health care

services for treatment of hepatitis C virus infections, the other medical condition of importance where

disease transmission could be reduced with harm reduction (Commonwealth Department of Health and

Ageing, 2002, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology Research, 2009, Kwon et al., 2012). Future

research can thus be undertaken to include consideration of Hepatitis C and other socially important

benefits of harm reduction such as early return to productive economic activities.



This study has also not looked into the private provider’s role in reducing HIV transmission among

PWID through their participation in delivering MMT services. The inclusion of private providers in the

analysis may serve to provide a holistic policy guide on cost-effectiveness of the different modality, to

address the current challenges of low coverage, accessibility and quality of services and integration

between the different delivery modalities. This will be an interesting area to examine especially in the

light of this study’s finding that MMT programme provided cost-savings when implemented alongside

NSP. At this juncture, it is only possible to speculate as to the reasons for this finding. The main public

providers of MMT services are the MOH clinics. Services are provided alongside normal outpatient

services with no significant increase in human resources and physical structures. The only conceivable

increase in financial outlay is that for purchase of the opioid substitute, methadone. The price for 80mg

of methadone is approximately US$63 in a month per patient10. This figure is much higher compared

to studies in Vietnam (US$ 21) and China (US$13) which included the start-up costs of establishing

dedicated MMT clinics (Tran et al., 2011, Xing et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible that the MMT public

expenditures in Malaysia could have been overestimated and which has contributed to masking the cost-

effectiveness of the programme. It is not within the scope of this study to examine the reason behind

the low uptake of MMT in public clinics. One of the reasons could be the inadequate provision of staff

and physical infrastructure to deliver MMT services in addition to the normal clinic outpatient services.

This can be an area for examination in future studies.



The modelling approach adopted in this study also presented many challenges. Although the best

available data were used in the model, in most instances behavioural and prevalence data came from

non-representative surveys carried out among PWIDs at different times in Malaysia or inferred from

similar studies conducted among PLHIV.          Information was also obtained from administratively

collected sources such as surveillance, case notifications and programme expenditures. While the

quality of data generated through national data collection sources are improving, due to various reasons

such as underreporting of cases, information from these sources may not reflect the true disease or

financial burden of HIV in the country. In certain cases where data required are not available, recourse

was made to expert opinions obtained from clinical experts. In such instances, opinions were sought

from only the main infectious diseases experts treating PLHIV in the country. Data triangulation has

been used to increase confidence in the use of the data. Due to constraints in resources, inpatient health

care costs had been estimated from only one public health care facility, and used with the assumption

that the costs are representative of the country. However, the choice of the facility was based on prior

knowledge that this facility is the main public hospital providing care to HIV infected PWIDs in the

country. In addition, uncertainties in all parameter estimates were incorporated in the analysis which

provided point as well as ranges of possible estimates for each output.




7.      Conclusion

This study has shown that the combined MMT and NSP programmes as implemented in Malaysia are

cost-effective and are expected to produce net cost-savings to the government in the future. Evidence

                                                                                                       42
of cost-effectiveness and expected cost-savings support policy recommendation that both MMT and

NSP programmes should be maintained as part of the key strategy to control HIV spread among PWIDs

in Malaysia. Study findings that even with the present programme coverage, harm reduction activities

are expected to become more cost-effective and cost-saving in the future suggest that policies towards

programme expansion may demonstrate higher value for money.

APPENDIX A                    Epidemic Mathematical Transmission Model



To assess HIV epidemic trends, resource needs, the cost-effectiveness of past programmes, and the

impact of potential future programmes, a detailed mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease

progression, called the Projection and Evaluation Tool (Prevtool), was developed by researchers at the

Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Australia (Kwon et al., 2012).



Prevtool is a flexible population-based HIV model. The basic disease progression implemented in the

model is shown in Figure A1. This is the only aspect of model structure that is fixed, and specifies it as

being an HIV model instead of a universal epidemic model.




Fig. A1: Schematic diagram of model structure. Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified

health state, while each arrow represents the movement of individuals between health states. All compartments except for

Susceptible represent individuals infected with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.




The model uses a coupled system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of people

between health states. The overall population is partitioned in two ways: by group and by health state.

Individuals are assigned to a given population based on their dominant risk. In this study the only

population group examined was the PWIDs.




                                                                                                                     44
The rate at which uninfected PWIDs become infected is determined by the force-of-infection for that

population. This depends on the number of risk events a PWID is exposed to in a given period of time

and the infection probability of each event. Intravenous transmission risk depends on the number of

injecting partners per person per year, frequency of injecting per year, frequency of sharing injecting

equipment and percentage of shared syringes that are cleaned before re-use and the efficacy of cleaning.



Mathematically, the force-of-infection is given by:

                                             = 1 − (1 − )

where  is the force-of-infection,  is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the effective

number of at-risk events (thus n gives the average number interaction events with infected PWID where

HIV transmission may occur). The value of the transmission probability  is inversely related to CD4

count and may be modified by behavioral interventions. The number of events n not only incorporates

the total number of events, but also other factors that moderate the possibility that these events are

capable of transmitting infection.



In addition to the force-of-infection rate, in which PWIDs move from uninfected to infected states, there

are seven other means by which PWIDs may move between health states. First, PWIDs may die, either

due to the background death rate, due to injecting behavior, or due to HIV/AIDS (which depends on

CD4 count). Second, in the absence of intervention, PWIDs progress from higher to lower CD4 counts.

Third, PWIDs can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which

is a function of CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms have a higher testing rate) and

population type (for example, PWIDs usually get tested more frequently than low-risk males). Fourth,

diagnosed PWIDs may move onto treatment, at a rate which is dependent on CD4 count. Fifth, PWIDs

may move from treatment to treatment failure, and sixth, from treatment failure onto second-line

treatment. Finally, while on successful first- or second-line treatment, PWIDs may progress from lower

to higher CD4 count.




                                                                                                         45
The number of PWIDs in the compartment corresponding to undiagnosed PWIDs with a CD4 count

between 200 and 350 cells/mL changes according to the following equation:



    200−350
                      =  350−500 350−500 −  200−350 (200−350 + 200−350 +  350−500 )
             



where  350−500 is the current population size of PWID with undiagnosed HIV and with a CD4 count

between 350 and 500 cells/μL,  200−350 is the PWID population size of the compartment with lower

CD4 count (200-350 cells/μL),  is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count,  is the death

rate, and  is the HIV testing rate. Each compartment (Figure A1, boxes) corresponds to a single

differential equation in the model, and each rate (Figure. A1, arrows) corresponds to a single term in

that equation.




                                                                                                                    46

Most of the parameters in the model are related to calculating the force-of-infection; a list of model

parameters is provided in Table A3. Empirical estimates for model parameter values can be interpreted

in Bayesian terms as prior distributions. The model must then be calibrated, which is the process of

finding posterior distributions of the model parameter values such that the model generates accurate

prevalence estimates. Given the challenges inherent in quantifying all known constraints on the

epidemic, initial calibration is performed manually, with oversight by and collaboration with in-country

stakeholders where possible. This prior distribution is then used in a Monte Carlo Markov chain




                                                                                                        47
(MCMC) algorithm, which uses both epidemiological and behavioral data to calculate the log-

likelihood for a given set of model parameters.



Relationships between spending and risk behaviors

In this analysis, a logistic/sigmoid function is used to describe the relationships between a behavioral

parameter affected by a HIV prevention programme and the level of spending on that programme. Using

this function with assumed uncertainties bounds, logistic curve fits is obtained to available datasets for

overall programme spending and associated behaviours. Indirect costs have no direct impact on HIV

transmission parameters; but changes to HIV programmes may affect these costs to supply additional

condoms, clean syringes, and methadone, for example. Using these relationships, any change in HIV

programmes funding directly affects risk behaviors and changes to the HIV epidemic; an example of

this is demonstrated in Figure. A2. The fitted logistic relationships will represent the change in

behaviors with spending.

Counterfactual scenarios

Prevtool calculates the cost-effectiveness of past HIV programmes by comparing the expected number

of new infections and HIV/AIDS related deaths according to current and past conditions with the

estimated numbers under counterfactual scenarios in the absence of funding for specific programs.

Simulation of counterfactual scenarios using Prevtool is based on the assumed effect of the of NSP

alone programmes, MMT alone programmes and combined NSP and MMT programmes. The calibrated

simulations with the programmes in place represent the baseline scenario. Specific counterfactual

scenarios used depend on the implementation and characteristics of HIV prevention programmes in

each country and the data available. A logistic function was then fitted to behavioral parameters affected

by prevention programmes.



Cost-effectiveness calculations for past evaluations

For each counterfactual scenario, the health benefits of a specific HIV intervention programmes is

measured in terms of HIV infections averted as well as life years and QALYs gained or DALYs saved

compared to the baseline scenario. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are calculated to

estimate the cost-effectiveness of each programme. These are calculated based on the counterfactual

scenarios and comparing the spending of each programme (discounted annually), as well as estimated

annual healthcare costs incurred/saved (using unit health costs and utilities for each country obtained

from data synthesis), with the estimated effectiveness of the programmes. Determining whether a past

HIV programme is cost-effective is dependent on country-specific thresholds. Appropriate thresholds

for each country will be determined after consultation with in-country stakeholders.



Return on investment calculations

Return on investment (ROI) analyses determines the future healthcare costs saved that are attributable

to the past financial investment in HIV/AIDS programmes. For this analysis, two scenarios were

considered: (1) the counterfactual scenarios without HIV/AIDS programmes and the (2) status quo

(with HIV programmes). From these two scenarios, health care costs incurred among individuals

infected with HIV (diagnosed, undiagnosed, and on treatment) is estimated. The ROI in a given year is

                                                                                                       49
equal to the total HIV health care costs saved (compared to the status quo scenario) divided by the total

investment in a HIV/AIDS programme.

APPENDIX B                Literature search to obtain model input parameters

Demographic, epidemiological, behavior and treatment data relevant to PWIDs in Malaysia were

gathered through a review of published literature, grey literature, hand-searches and directed requests

to MOH, Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), National Anti-drug Agency (NADA)

and Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC).



The initial search identified a total of 123 documents consisting of 90 documents from peer-reviewed

journals, 11 published reports from international organisations including WHO, United Nations

Programmes on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United

Nations Regional Task Force (UNRTF) and International Harm Reduction Association (IHRA) and 22

other documents including reports, conference presentations, unpublished administrative data obtained

from MOH, MAC, NADA and CERiA. Of the 123 documents, 55 duplicates were excluded while

another 29 documents were excluded on the basis of irrelevant titles and abstracts (Figure B1). The full

text of the remaining 39 documents were accessed and included in the assessment for the different

model input parameters.

1.   Population size

     Description of parameter:

               Size estimate of PWID population



     Values:

               Year 2002                194,000 (133,000 – 255,000)

               Year 2009                170,000 (117,000 – 223,000)



     Source:

               (Ministry of Health, 2004, Ministry of Health, 2009)



     Assumptions:

               The literature search identified 17 documents related to population size of PWIDs in

               Malaysia (Wodak, 2006, Mathers et al., 2008, Ministry of Health and Universiti Utara

               Malaysia, 2003, Ministry of Health, 2005, UNODC, 2009, The United Nations

               Regional Task Force on Injecting Drug Use and HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific and

               Burnett Institute, 2010, WHO, 2010, IHRA, 2010, Reid et al., 2004, Aceijas et al.,

               2004, IHRA, 2008, WHO, 2011, Ministry of Health, 2010b, Ministry of Health, 2009,

               Ministry of Health, 2012, UNODC, 2010, Ministry of Health, 2004). Of these, 14

               documents were eliminated because they contained only secondary citations which

               could not be traced for further verification. Included in this list were two international

               reviews of the burden of HIV among PWIDs which made mention of the Malaysian

               situation (Mathers et al., 2008, Aceijas et al., 2004). The remaining three documents

               were reviewed (Ministry of Health, 2004, Ministry of Health and Universiti Utara

               Malaysia, 2003, Ministry of Health, 2009).



                                                                                                      53
      Based on information compiled from various sources including the National

       Drug Information System (NADI) database, interviews with key stakeholders

       including officials from local municipal council, NGOs and the Police, head of

       villages as well as drug users, the MOH in collaboration with researchers from

       the Universiti Utara Malaysia estimated that there were 117,955 PWIDs in

       2002 (range from 104,486 to 135,506) (Ministry of Health and Universiti Utara

       Malaysia, 2003).

      However, in a separate estimation exercise, based mainly on data obtained

       from the HIV screening programme among drug users in 11 states, the MOH

       provided a higher estimate of the 2002 PWID population in the country –

       194,000 (range from 133,000 to 255,000) (Ministry of Health, 2004).

      In 2009, the MOH convened a meeting between key stakeholders to review the

       HIV situation in the country. During this meeting, based mainly on a review

       of commonly used estimates, participants agreed that 170,000 represented a

       rough estimate for the PWID population in the country (Ministry of Health,

       2009).



Based on these three estimates, the PWID population in the country could have

increased or decreased in numbers from 2002 to 2009. However, numbers of drug

users entering drug rehabilitation centres had been decreasing from 2005 to 2009

(Agensi Antidadah Kebangsaan Kementerian Dalam Negeri, 2009) and based on this,

the model used PWID population data which showed a similarly decreasing trend -

194,000 in 2002 and 170,000 in 2009.




                                                                                   54

     Source:

               (National Anti-Drugs Agency, 2010)



     Assumptions:

               The literature search identified ten documents related to HIV prevalence among PWIDs

               in Malaysia (Malaysian Aids Council and Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2009, Bazazi

               et al., 2011, Aceijas et al., 2004, Mathers et al., 2008, Ministry of Health, 2005,

               Ministry of Health, 2008, Ministry of Health, 2012, National Anti-Drugs Agency,

               2010, Ministry of Health, 2013). Of these two documents (Aceijas et al., 2004, Mathers

               et al., 2008) were eliminated because they contained only secondary citations which

               could not be traced for further verification. The remaining eight documents were

               reviewed.




                                                                                                  55
The review included four local studies conducted between 2007 and 2012 which

provided some estimates of the HIV prevalence among PWIDs (Vicknasingam et al.,

2009, Malaysian Aids Council and Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2009, Bazazi et al.,

2011, Ministry of Health, 2013). However, the prevalence figures in these studies were

not used in the model mainly because the coverage of the studies was limited and thus

the results were not nationally representative.

   Vicknasingam et al (2009) surveyed 526 PWIDs from five towns found that HIV

    prevalence was 43.9 per cent. Respondents were recruited in locations where

    injecting drug use was known to be rampant and who were PWIDs not in treatment

    in Malaysia.

   The 2009 Integrated Bio-Behavioural Study conducted in six sites in the Klang

    Valley found that 22.1 per cent of the PWIDs surveyed were positive for HIV

    (Ministry of Health and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009). Respondents were

    recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS) method.

   Another RDS study in Klang Valley by Bezazi et al (2011) reported that the HIV

    prevalence to be 19.9 per cent among the 460 PWIDs surveyed .

   A preliminary result of the recent 2012 IBBS conducted by MOH found that HIV

    prevalence among PWIDs to be 18.9 per cent in 7 states (Ministry of Health, 2013).

    However, there was wide variation in prevalence rates between states ranging from

    as low as 5.3 per cent in Selangor to as high as 46.5 per cent in Kelantan. To date

    the IBBS results have not been finalised and thus have not been used in this study.



Some of the UNGASS Country Progress Reports prepared by the MOH also contained

mention of the HIV prevalence rates among PWIDs (Ministry of Health, 2008, Ministry

of Health, 2005, Ministry of Health, 2012). However these figures were not used in

this study because they had been derived from varying sources which could not be

verified to be representative of the rates among PWIDs in the country.



                                                                                    56
   The UNGASS Monitoring the Declaration Commitment on HIV/AIDS Country

    Report December 2005 reported that the HIV prevalence rates among PWIDs was

    20.1 per cent (Ministry of Health, 2005). The rates had been derived from

    information on HIV prevalence among drug users undergoing treatment in DRCs

    in 11 states. Some assumptions had to be made to extrapolate the prevalence rates

    among drug users to PWIDs. The authors applied a factor of 0.8/0.67 was based

    on prior knowledge that 67 per cent of drug users in DRCs were PWIDs and that

    80 per cent of HIV infections among PWIDs was attributed through sharing

    needles. These assumptions could not be validated.

   Based on data from sentinel surveillance, the UNGASS Country Progress Report

    2008 reported that the 2007 HIV prevalence among PWIDs was 11 per cent.

    However, the report provided no further details of the sentinel surveillance

    (Ministry of Health, 2008).

   The 2012 Global AIDS Response Country Progress Report indicated that HIV

    prevalence among PWIDs was 8.7 per cent based on screening programme in harm

    reduction sites and DRCs. The HIV test with rapid test kit programme was carried

    out only in MMT sites where PWIDs are at lower risk of HIV infection. Thus, the

    reported HIV prevalence in 2012 UNGASS may not reflect actual situation of HIV

    prevalence among PWIDs at the national level (Ministry of Health, 2012).



Due to lack of reliable direct estimates of HIV prevalence among all PWIDs in

Malaysia, data on HIV prevalence used in this study was taken from HIV cases detected

among high risk drug users admitted to DRC as reported by NADA (National Anti-

Drugs Agency, 2010).

   NADA reported that the HIV cases detected among new entrants to DRCs showed

    a generally decreasing trend from 16.4 per cent in 2001 to 9.3 per cent in 2009

    (National Anti-Drugs Agency, 2010).



                                                                                   57
   NADA instituted a compulsory HIV screening programme in which all new

    entrants are screened upon admission to DRC, after 6-months and 3-months prior

    to release. The agency operates 23 government DRCs located throughout Malaysia.

    Under the Act 283 Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983, any

    police officer has the authority to arrest any person suspected to be drug dependent

    and if they are found positive for drugs, they would be sent to rehabilitation centres

    by court order (Law of Malaysia, 2006). Based on this, it could be assumed that

    the drug users admitted to DRCs are among the high risk drug users in the country.

   The data from NADA was preferred over the information from other sources

    because NADA data came from a consistent source, DRCs, which is reasonably

    representative of the country.

               There was no available direct estimate of HIV testing rates among PWIDs in Malaysia.

               Data on HIV testing among drug users in DRCs were adapted for use in the study in

               the following manner:

                  NADA reported that there were 6,658 occupants of rehabilitation centres in 2009

                   (Agensi Antidadah Kebangsaan Kementerian Dalam Negeri, 2009). It is the

                   national policy that HIV testing be administered to all drug users upon registration

                   into the programme, six-months after admission and three months prior end of

                   programme. Assuming that all new entrants to the programme would have only

                   two HIV tests in a year, the total number of tests would be 13,316 [6,658 x 2].

                   Averaged over the estimated number of PWIDs in the country (170,000 persons),

                   the testing rate among PWIDs would be 7.83 times per 100 persons. This figure

                   was applied for the year 2009.



                                                                                                    59
                  The HIV testing rate for 2002 was estimated in a similar manner. However, the

                   occupancy rates of rehabilitation centres were not available for 2002. Thus, the

                   estimation was based on the maximum capacity of the centres which was 6,570

                   (National Anti-Drugs Agency, 2010). The testing rate in the DRCs would be 6.77

                   times annually per 100 persons. This figure was applied for the year 2002.




2.   Treatment rate per year

     Description of parameter:

               Proportion of ART eligible PWIDs initiated on treatment annually



     Values:

               Year 2010               16.8 per cent



     Source:

               Adapted from study in Kajang Prison and (Ministry of Health, 2010b, Kamarulzaman,

               2009c)



     Assumption:

               There was no available direct estimate of HIV treatment rates among PWIDs in

               Malaysia. Data available from three sources (Ministry of Health, 2010b,

               Kamarulzaman, 2009c) were adapted for use in the study:

                  Since 2010, patients would be considered eligible for ART treatment only when

                   they reach the CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3.

                  In 2010, there were an estimated 14,002 persons on treatment (Ministry of Health,

                   2010b). Of these an estimated 3,501 or 25 per cent were PWIDs (Kamarulzaman,

                   2009c).



                                                                                                  60
                       Data obtained from a study in Kajang Prison reported that the 38 per cent of the

                        HIV+ PWID prisoners had CD4 counts below 350 cells/mm3 and thus eligible to

                        receive ART treatment11. This rate was applied to the estimated 54,783 HIV

                        positive PWIDs in 2010 (Ministry of Health, 2012) to give an estimated 20,818

                        persons who would be eligible for ART treatment.

                       Thus an estimate of the proportion of PWIDs eligible to receive ART treatment

                        who are on treatment would be 16.8 per cent (or 3,501/20,818).




3.        Treatment failure

          Description of parameter:

                    Proportion of PWIDs on first-line ART but not responding to treatment annually

          Values:

                    40 per cent

          Source:

                    (Kumar, 2012)

          Assumption:

                    The literature search identified only one document related to treatment failure among

                    PWIDs in Malaysia (Lubis et al., 2012). The study was conducted among HIV

                    patients in a tertiary institution in Kuala Lumpur and found that only 64.5 per cent of




11
     The proportion of persons with CD4 counts <350 among HIV+ PID persons was obtained from a study
conducted in Kajang Prison in 2012. Among 124 HIV+ PID prisoners, in which it was found that 38 per cent or
47 PIDs had CD4 counts below 350. The overall proportion of HIV+ persons with CD4 counts below 350 in
Malaysia is 65 per cent (MOH UNGASS 2010). However, feedback from clinicians treating the bulk of HIV+
patients indicated that in general HIV+ PIDs appear to be younger and healthier than non PIDs and that the lower
proportion of HIV+ PIDs with CD4 counts <350 in comparison with the general HIV+ population appear to
support this notion. Kajang Prison is one of the main prisons to receive persons convicted of drug-related crimes
in the country. In this estimate, it is thus assumed that the PIDs held in Kajang Prison are representative of PIDs
around Malaysia.

                                                                                                                61
               the patients who initiated first-line ART treatment achieved viral load of less than 50

               copies/ml. However, the study participants contracted HIV through sexual means and

               not through intravenous drug use. Thus, the findings are not representative of the PWID

               population.



               Due to lack of available direct estimate of HIV treatment failures among PWIDs in

               Malaysia, data was obtained from SBH. SBH is the main hospital involved in clinical

               management of HIV patients in the country. Routine data from SBH shows that

               treatment failure among PWIDs as 40 per cent in 2010 (Kumar, 2012).

          Assumption:

                    There was no available direct estimate of PWIDs on ART treatment. Data available

2008, Ministry of Health, 2010b, Sg Buloh Hospital, 2011) were adapted for use of this

study.

   Kamarulzaman (2007, 2009b) reported that the proportions of PWIDs who

    received ART treatment increased from 7 per cent in 2003 to 25 per cent in 2008.

    The rapid increase was probably due to availability of generic drugs in 2004 and a

    scale-up in treatment coverage by the government (Ministry of Health, 2008). This

    study assumes that prior to 2004, the ART coverage among PWIDs remained

    constant at seven per cent and that after 2004, the coverage was 25 per cent.

   A report by Treat Asia estimated that of 9,500 PLHIV who need treatment, about

    20 per cent were receiving treatment in 2004 (Treat Asia, 2004). The MOH

    reported 64,439 and 58,012 cumulative new HIV cases in 2003 and 2004 (Ministry

    of Health, 2011). Thus, the estimated number of PLHIV who need treatment in

    2003 was 8,550.

   The MOH reported that a total of 6,590 and 9,962 PLHIVs were receiving

    treatment in 2007 and 2009 (Ministry of Health, 2008, Ministry of Health, 2010b).

    Separately, Kamarulzaman (2009) reported that an estimated 8,200 PLHIVs were

    receiving treatment in 2008.

   Thus, the estimate numbers of PWIDs on ART for the years 2003 to 2009 were:

        2003    1,710 x 7 per cent = 120

        2007    6,590 x 25 per cent =1,648

        2008    8,200 x 25 per cent = 2,050

        2009    9,962 x 25 per cent = 2,491



Information on proportions of PWIDs on first and second-line drugs was based on

clinical data obtained from SBH, the main hospital providing treatment to PWIDs in




                                                                                    64

           Assumption:

                     The literature search identified five studies related to the average number of injections

                     per PWID in a year (Ministry of Health and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009, Bazazi

     Assumption:

               The literature search identified nine studies related to the practice of sharing of

               injections among PWIDs (Chawarski et al., 2005, Ministry of Health and Malaysian

               AIDS Council, 2009, Bazazi et al., 2011, Azmel, 2011, CERiA, 2007, unpublished

               report, Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004, Ministry of Health, 2007, Vicknasingam

               et al., 2009, Bachireddy et al., 2011). All documents were reviewed.



               Between 2005 and 2011, there were six local studies which provided some estimates

               of the needle sharing behaviour (Chawarski et al., 2005, Ministry of Health and

                                                                                                 66
Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009, Bazazi et al., 2011, Azmel, 2011, CERiA, 2007,

unpublished report, Bachireddy et al., 2011).      The findings were not nationally

representative and were not used in the study.

   In 2005, a study by Chawarski et al (2005) found that 23.2 per cent of respondents

    in Muar shared needles in the 30 days prior to the study.

   In 2007, a study conducted by CERiA (2007) found that 54 per cent of respondents

    in Kuantan shared needles in the month prior to the study.

   In 2007, a study among HIV-infected male prisoners in Kota Bahru by Bachireddy

    et al (2010), found that 66 per cent of respondents shared needles in the 30 days

    prior to incarceration.

   In 2009, a study by MOH found that 14.6 per cent of 630 respondents surveyed in

    the Klang Valley shared needles in the recent injecting episode (Ministry of Health

    and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009).

   Bazazi et al (2010) and Azmel et al (2011) in studies conducted in the Klang Valley

    reported that the rate of sharing injecting equipment in the month prior to their

    studies were 48 per cent and 37 per cent respectively.



From 2004 to 2007, there were another three relevant studies which had wider

geographical coverage that the ones mentioned above (Ministry of Health, 2007,

Vicknasingam et al., 2009, Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004).

   In 2004, a study by the MOH found that 74 per cent of PWIDs in three sites (Johor,

    Kelantan and Kuala Lumpur) shared needles in the month prior to the study

    (Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004).

   The MOH conducted a sequence of three studies to evaluate the pilot NSP

    programme implemented at three sites, Penang, Johor and KL. The second study

    conducted in 2007 reported that 43 per cent of the respondents had ever passed




                                                                                     67
                used equipment as opposed to 56 per cent in the first study conducted the year

                before in 2006 (Ministry of Health, 2007).

               In 2007, a study among PWIDs in five sites, namely Penang, Pahang, KL, Johor

                and Kelantan, found that 69 per cent of the 526 respondents had ever shared their

                injecting equipment (Vicknasingam et al., 2009). However this study was excluded

                as data from the post-study of pilot NSP would reflect the impact on sharing

                behaviour with the NSP in the setting.



            However, the required input parameter for the model was not proportions of PWIDs

            who shared needles but rather proportion of total injections shared.

               In 2004, the MOH (2004) reported that the average number of injections in the

                month prior to the study among PWIDs in three sites (Johor, Kelantan and Kuala

                Lumpur) was 95 times while the average number of shared injections among those

                who reported sharing needles were 28 times.         Thus, the proportion of total

                injections shared is estimated to be 30 per cent (28 times injections shared / 95

                times injections).

               The above derived proportion of shared injections among PWIDs who shared

                injections were applied to findings of the earlier three studies (Ministry of Health,

                2007, Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004) in the following manner:

                    i.   Year 2004           74 per cent x 30 per cent = 22.0 per cent

                   ii.   Year 2006           56 per cent x 30 per cent = 16.8 per cent

                  iii.   Year 2007           43 per cent x 30 per cent = 12.9 per cent

     Assumption:

               The literature search identified two documents related to the practice of reused syringes

               that have been cleaned (Ministry of Health and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009,

               Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004). All documents were reviewed.

                  In 2004, a study by the MOH found that 77.6 per cent of PWIDs in three sites

                   (Johor, Kelantan and Kuala Lumpur) cleaned their syringes before reusing them

                   (Ministry of Health and WHO, 2004). However, most said they cleaned the

                   syringes using water.

                  In 2009, a study by MAC found that 93.8 per cent of the 630 respondents surveyed

                   in Klang Valley reused their syringes that had been cleaned (Ministry of Health

                   and Malaysian AIDS Council, 2009).

1.      HIV testing

        Description of parameter:

                  Cost of screening and confirmatory HIV test per person tested positive



        Values:

                  Year 2010               RM114



        Source:

                  (Ministry of Health, Order 2007)



        Assumption:

        It is assumed that each positive HIV diagnosis resulted from a screening test (Elisa Test) which

        costs RM26 per test and a confirmatory test (Western Blot Test, costing) which costs RM88

        per test. The unit costs were obtained from the MOH’s full paying patient fee schedule13 which

        is assumed to be reflective of the full costs of each test (Ministry of Health, Order 2007). Thus

        the cost of HIV testing per person in 2010 was RM114.




2.      Costs for First-line ART

     Assumption:

     Information on the ART treatment costs were provided by the MOH. In 2010, the average

     annual cost per person was RM2,684 for those on the first-line regime. The first line therapy

     consists of a combination of

        Stavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine; or

        Combivir and Efavirenz; or

        Combivir and Nevirapine.




3.   Costs for Second-line ART

     Description of parameter:

               Average annual cost of second-line ART treatment per eligible PWID

     Assumption:

     Information on the ART treatment costs were provided by the MOH. In 2010, the average

     annual cost per person was RM13,643 for those on the second line. The second line therapy is

     usually a combination of Combivir and Kaletra.




4.   Health care costs for those with CD4 counts ≥350 cells/mm3

     Description of parameter:

               Average annual health care costs per PWID with CD4≥350 cells/mm3



     Values:

               Year 2010              RM487.00



     Source:

               Cost description study (Appendix E) and expert opinion



     Assumption:

     The cost description study (Appendix E) provided an estimate of the 2010 annual outpatient

     costs for each HIV person with CD4≥350 cells/mm3 which was RM974. However, Prevtool

     required input of annual outpatient costs per HIV+ person averaged over the total population

     of PWIDs with CD4≥350 cells/mm3 regardless whether they were on treatment or not. There

     is no direct information on the treatment coverage for HIV+ PWIDs with CD4≥350 cells/mm3.

     In consultation with clinical experts, this study adopted a conservative assumption of treatment

     coverage of 50 per cent. Thus, the average outpatient cost for HIV+ PWIDS with CD4≥350

     cells/mm3 would be RM487 (RM974 x 50 per cent). Since it is assumed that HIV+ persons

     with CD4≥350 cells/mm3 would not require inpatient services in relation to their HIV status,

     this would also be an estimate of the total annual health care costs for such persons.

                                                                                                  74

     Source:

               Adapted from cost description study (Appendix E), study from Kajang Prison and

               (Kamarulzaman, 2009a, Ministry of Health, 2012)



     Assumption:

     i.        Annual outpatient costs

     The cost description study (Appendix E) provided an estimate of the 2010 annual outpatient

     costs for each HIV person with CD4< 350 which was RM1,461. However, this only applies to

     those who are on follow-up and who adhere to the recommended treatment schedule. Prevtool

     required input of annual outpatient costs per HIV+ person averaged over the total population

     of PWIDs with CD4 <350 cells/mm3 regardless whether they were on treatment or not. This

     was derived in the following manner with the assumption that those on ART would be adhering

     to the treatment schedule:

         In 2010, it was estimated only 14,002 HIV positive persons were receiving ART treatment

          (Ministry of Health, 2012).

         Kamarulzaman, A (2009a) estimated that 25 per cent of PLHIV on treatment were PWIDs

          which gives an estimated of 3,501 (25 per cent x 14,002) PWIDs on treatment in 2010.



                                                                                                 75
               In 2010, there were 54,783 HIV+ PWIDs (Ministry of Health, 2012).

               It is estimated that 38 per cent of the HIV+ PWIDs had CD4<350 cells/mm3 which gives

                an estimated 20,818 (38 per cent x 54,783) persons in 201014 .

               A rough estimate of the proportion of HIV+ PWID with CD4<350 cells/mm3 receiving

                treatment would then be 16.8 per cent (3,501 PWIDs on treatment / 20,818 PWIDs who

                were HIV+).

               Thus the average cost for outpatient services for a HIV+ PWID with CD4<350 would be

                RM245.67 (RM1,461 x 16.8 per cent).



         ii.       Annual inpatient costs

         The cost description study (Appendix E) provided an estimate of the 2010 annual inpatient

         costs for each HIV+ person with CD4<350 cells/mm3 which was RM15,683.29. However, not

         all HIV+ PWID with CD4<350 would have inpatient care. Assuming that only 16.8 per cent

         of them were receiving treatment as was adopted in the previous outpatient cost estimates, the

         average inpatient costs would be RM2,637.17 (RM15,683.29 x 16.8 per cent).



         iii.      Total annual health care costs

         Thus the total annual health care costs for each HIV+ person with CD4<350 cells/mm3 would

         be RM2,882.84 (RM245.64 + RM2,637.17).



APPENDIX D                 Estimations of direct health care costs for HIV+ PWIDs




14
   The proportion of persons with CD4 counts <350 among HIV+ PID persons was obtained from a small scale
project in Kajang Prison. Among 124 HIV+ PID prisoners, in which it was found that 38 per cent or 47 PIDs had
CD4 counts below 350. The overall proportion of HIV+ persons with CD4 counts below 350 in Malaysia is 65%
(MOH UNGASS 2010). However, feedback from clinicians treating the bulk of HIV+ patients indicated that in
general HIV+ PIDs appear to be younger and healthier than non PIDs and that the lower proportion of HIV+ PIDs
with CD4 counts <350 in comparison with the general HIV+ population appear to support this notion. Moreover,
the HIV+ PIDs in Kajang Prison, which is one of the main prisons to receive persons convicted of drug-related
crimes in the country. In this estimate, it is thus assumed that the PIDs held in Kajang Prison are representative
of PIDs around Malaysia.

                                                                                                               76
This appendix details the estimation approach for direct health care cost parameter required for the

Prevtool software. In deriving the estimates, costs for year 2010 have been used as this is the latest year

for which complete information is available. The cost estimates are based on the clinical protocol for

management of HIV+ persons in Malaysia which prescribes different treatment and follow up regimes

for patients based on their CD4 counts.



1.         Outpatient Costs

           It is the current clinical practice for all HIV+ persons whose CD4≥350 cells/mm3 to have

           routine outpatient visits twice a year while those with CD4<350 cells/mm3 to have outpatient

           visits thrice a year15. Tests performed during each visit are the same and include tests for viral

           load, CD4, liver function, renal profile, full blood counts and blood glucose. Table D1 shows

           the unit cost of each test as well as the outpatient consultation fee based on the MOH’s full

           paying patient fee schedule (Ministry of Health, Order 2007).

                  i. Consultation fee                                           85.00

                 ii. Viral load                                                 88.00

                 iii. CD4 test                                                  151.00

                 iv. Liver function test                                        63.00

                  v. Renal profile                                              50.00

                Total                                                           487.00

     Clinical feedback from experts in SBH

                                                                                                          77
     Thus the annual outpatient costs for each HIV+ with CD4≥350 cells/mm3 would RM974.00

     (RM487 x 2) and for HIV+ person with CD<350 cells/mm3 would be RM1,461.00 (RM487 x

     3).



2.   Inpatient Costs

     A study to collect the 2010 inpatient costs for HIV+ PWID patients was conducted at SBH

     which is the main hospital involved in clinical management of HIV patients in Malaysia. This

     study was facilitated by prior costing studies for general inpatient expenditures in the hospital

     as well as availability of a database on patients with infectious diseases admitted into the

     hospital. The clinical management of HIV patients in this hospital follows the clinical practice

     guidelines for HIV management in Malaysia. It is assumed that most HIV+ patients requiring

     hospital treatment would be admitted to public hospitals with resource use similar to that of

     SBH and thus the estimates obtained from this hospital would be representative of the inpatient

     costs for all HIV+ PWIDs in the country.



     Table D2 provides a summary of the cost estimation process using data from the SBH. It is the

     practice of the hospital that all admissions for infectious diseases, including HIV, be admitted

     to Ward 4C. The hospital provided the monthly breakdown of patient fees for the year 2010

     (Column A of Table D2). These fees had been highly subsidised by the government. It is

     estimated that the average subsidy rate for public health care services is 97 per cent (Yon, 2004).

     This figure was used to estimate the total government subsidy provided to patients in Ward 4C

     (Column B). The admission database provided the monthly breakdown of all admissions to the

     ward (Column C). It was not possible to obtain total number of admissions by HIV+ PWIDs

     directly from the database. This information had to be obtained from searching of patie nts’

     files. Due to time limitations, it was only possible to obtain the total number of admissions by

     HIV+ PWIDs for the months of March and September 2010 (Column D). This information

     allowed for estimation of the proportions of total admissions to the ward by HIV+ PWIDs

     (Column E). Examination of patient files also revealed the number of unique HIV+ PWIDs

                                                                                                     78
individuals who had been admitted during those months (Column F). This information was

then used in the estimates of inpatient costs for admitted HIV+ PWID as depicted below Table

E2.



It is estimated that the annual inpatient costs for the year 2010 were RM15,683 for each HIV+

PWID.

Note:
1
  Patient fees are highly subsidised in the country.
2
  Estimated under assumption that subsidy rate is 97 per cent (Yon, 2004).

Thus the annual inpatient costs for each HIV+ PWID would be
        = (B1 x E1)/F1
        = (1,290,159 x 51 per cent)/42

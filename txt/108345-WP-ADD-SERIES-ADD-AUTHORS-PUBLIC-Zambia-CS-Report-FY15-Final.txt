I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Zambia perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Zambia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Zambia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Zambia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               project/program related issues, knowledge work and activities, and
               communication and information sharing in Zambia; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Zambia.
       Use data to help inform Zambia country team’s strategy.




II. Methodology
From December 2014 to February 2015, 546 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Zambia
were invited to provide their opinions on the WBG’s assistance to the country by participating in
a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President
or Vice President; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; project management units (PMUs)
overseeing implementation of a project or consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; local government officials or staff; bilateral/ multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 304 stakeholders participated in the survey (56% response rate).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Zambia; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Zambia; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing. In addition, every country that engages in the Country Survey must include
specific indicator questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 312 respondents (56% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY ’12. Additional comparisons to the 319 respondents (98% response rate)
who completed the country survey in FY ’07 and the 208 respondents (58% response rate) who
completed the country survey in FY ’04 can be found in Appendix F (see page 156).

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues Facing Zambia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Zambia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development
   priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty, and what would achieve
   “Shared Prosperity?.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Zambia, WBG staff preparedness, the
   importance and effectiveness of its capacity building work, their agreement with various
   statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which it is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the WBG to focus its resources, the WBG’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses, its most effective instruments, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should
   collaborate more, if the WBG should have more or less of a local presence in Zambia, and to
   what they attributed slowed or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to indicate where
   WBG decisions regarding its program were made and to rate the extent to which the WBG’s
   work helps achieve development results in Zambia, the extent to which the WBG meets
   Zambia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the extent to which the
   WBG measures and corrects its work in real time, and the importance of the WBG’s
   involvement and its effectiveness across thirty-one development areas.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG knowledge work and to rate the quality of the
   WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to indicate their agreement
   with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG. Respondents were also asked
   to indicate the perceptions of the WBG’s client engagement and support to Zambia.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Zambia: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value and which of its services the WBG
   should offer more of in Zambia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   WBG’s websites. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy and past information requests from the WBG. Respondents were also
   asked to evaluate the WBG’s information accessibility and social media.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, their level of interaction with the WBG, with which WBG agencies they work,
   their exposure to the WBG in Zambia, their gender, and their geographic location.
   Respondents were also asked if their projects involved both the World Bank and the IFC, and
   if so, to indicate their view of the two institutions working together.
Please Note: Only select demographic differences are discussed in the body of this report, but
full breakdowns by stakeholder groups, level of collaboration, location, and gender, and select
sector/specialization comparisons can be found in the Appendix (see page 69).

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position
       For all further analyses, the few respondents from the office of the President/Vice
        President, local government, youth groups, and academia were included in the “Other?
        category. A complete listing of comparisons across stakeholder groups can be found in
        Appendix B (see page 85).

Area of Primary Specialization
       Key comparisons across respondents’ specializations can be found in Appendix G (see
        page 161). In addition, specific comparisons of respondents who identified themselves as
        Generalists or Macroeconomics and fiscal management were conducted to examine if
        respondents from these two sectors dominated overall responses to select multiple
        response questions regarding key development areas and ratings of the WBG’s
        effectiveness across development areas.

Geographic Location
       Because of the small number of respondents from areas other than the Lusaka province,
        these areas were combined into one “Other Areas? category. Only significant geographic
        location differences in ratings of indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this
        report. All comparisons can be found in Appendix C (see page 109).

World Bank Group Collaboration and Exposure

       Differences in responding, based on collaboration with the World Bank Group in Zambia,
        can be found in the Appendix D (see page 125). Differences in responses to the indicator
        questions, based on collaboration and exposure to the World Bank Group in Zambia, can
        be found in Appendix H (see page 173). Please note that where these two factors appear
        to have a significant relationship with overall views of the WBG, it is highlighted in
        yellow in that Appendix.

The World Bank and IFC

       Stakeholders: Respondents from the financial sector/private banks, NGOs/CBOs, and the
        media were significantly less likely to indicate that their projects involved both the World
        Bank and IFC compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.
       Locations: Respondents from other areas were significantly more likely to indicate that
        their projects involved both the World Bank and IFC (53%) compared to respondents
        from the Lusaka province (22%).
       Collaboration: Respondents currently collaborating with the WBG were significantly
        more likely to indicate that their projects involved both the World Bank and IFC (29%)
        compared to respondents who previously collaborated (14%) and those who never
        collaborated (4%).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year Comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher
        ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean familiarity = 6.8) compared to respondents
        from the FY ’12 country survey (mean familiarity = 6.3).
       Stakeholders: Respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG projects, bilateral/
        multilateral agencies, the media, and independent government institutions had
        significantly higher ratings of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from
        other stakeholder groups.
       Collaboration: Respondents who are currently collaborating with the WBG had
        significantly higher ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean familiarity = 7.2)
        compared to respondents who had previously collaborated (mean familiarity = 6.7) and
        those who never collaborated (mean familiarity = 5.7).
       Gender: Male respondents had significantly higher ratings of familiarity with the WBG
        (mean familiarity = 7.0) compared to female respondents (mean familiarity = 6.3).
       Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the World Bank Group
        were significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall
        effectiveness, and significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the
        WBG’s work achieving development results and the WBG’s relevance to development
        in Zambia.

IV. General Issues Facing Zambia (continued)

Development Priority (continued)
       Stakeholders: Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that job
        creation is the most important development priority facing Zambia, respondents from
        PMUs/Consultants on WBG projects also indicated that trade/exports and rural
        development are important priorities, respondents from bilateral/ multilateral agencies
        also indicated that private sector development is an important priority, respondents from
        the private sector and NGOs/CBOs indicated that poverty reduction is also an important
        priority, respondents from the financial sector/private banks indicated that economic
        growth is also an important priority, respondents from the media indicated that economic
        growth and education are the most important priorities, and respondents from
        independent government institutions and faith-based groups indicated that education is
        one of the most important development priorities facing Zambia.

       Collaboration: Respondents who are currently collaborating with the WBG were
        significantly more likely to indicate that poverty reduction is one of the most important
        development priorities compared to respondents who had previously collaborated or
        never collaborated. Respondents who never collaborated with the WBG were
        significantly more likely to indicate that rural development is the most important
        development priority compared to respondents who had previously collaborated or are
        currently collaborating with the WBG.

       Gender: Female respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that rural
        development, poverty reduction, gender equity, foreign direct investment, trade and
        exports, climate change, and social protection are important development priorities facing
        Zambia compared to male respondents, who were significantly more likely to indicate
        that education, private sector development, agricultural development, water and
        sanitation, and anti-corruption are important development priorities.

       Specializations/Sectors:
             Generalist respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that public sector
              governance/reform, private sector development, natural resource development,
              energy, equality of opportunity, and information and communications technology
              are important development priorities facing Zambia, but significantly less likely
              to indicate that economic growth is an important priority compared to respondents
              from other specializations.
             Respondents from the macroeconomics and fiscal management sector were
              significantly more likely to indicate that rural development, education,
              agricultural development, and financial markets are important development
              priorities facing Zambia, but significantly less likely to indicate that poverty
              reduction and foreign direct investment are important priorities facing Zambia
              compared to respondents from other sectors.

Factors Contributing to Poverty Reduction

       Year Comparison: Respondents from the FY ’12 country survey indicated education
        (36%), job creation/employment (33%), rural development (32%), agricultural
        development (31%), and access to finance (23%) would contribute most to reducing
        poverty in Zambia.

IV. General Issues Facing Zambia (continued)

Factors Contributing to Poverty Reduction (continued)
       Stakeholders: Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that
        agricultural development, rural development, and job creation are the key contributors to
        reducing poverty in Zambia, respondents from the private sector indicated that food
        security is also a key factor, respondents from NGOs/CBOs indicated that economic
        growth is a key factor, and respondents from the media indicated that natural resource
        management is one of the key contributors to reducing poverty in Zambia.

       Collaboration: Respondents who are currently collaborating with the WBG were
        significantly more likely to indicate that job creation and private sector development are
        key contributors to poverty reduction compared to respondents who had previously
        collaborated or never collaborated. Respondents who never collaborated with the WBG
        were significantly more likely to indicate that education, social protection, equality of
        opportunity, and food security are key contributors, and significantly less likely to say
        that agricultural development is a key contributor, compared to respondents who had
        previously collaborated or are currently collaborating with the WBG.

       Gender: Female respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that education,
        gender equity, foreign direct investment, food security, trade and exports, and climate
        change are key contributors to poverty reduction compared to male respondents, who
        were significantly more likely to indicate that, agricultural development, private sector
        development, law and justice, and regulatory framework are key contributors to poverty
        reduction in Zambia.

       Specializations/Sectors:
             Generalist respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that agricultural
              development, public sector governance/reform, private sector development, and
              financial markets are key contributors to poverty reduction, but significantly less
              likely to indicate that economic growth is a key contributor compared to
              respondents from other specializations.
             Respondents from the macroeconomics and fiscal management sector were
              significantly more likely to indicate that rural development and job creation are
              key contributors to poverty reduction, but significantly less likely to indicate that
              private sector development is a key contributor compared to respondents from
              other sectors.

Achieving “Shared Prosperity?
       Stakeholders: Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that better
        entrepreneurial opportunities, education and training, and agricultural development are
        the key contributors to achieving “Shared Prosperity? in Zambia, respondents from
        PMUs/Consultants on WBG projects indicated that better opportunities for the poor that
        live in rural areas is a key contributor, respondents from the private sector indicated that
        consistent economic growth is also a key contributor, and respondents from the financial
        sector/private banks indicated that greater access to micro-finance for the poor is a key
        contributor to achieving “Shared Prosperity? in Zambia.

IV. General Issues Facing Zambia (continued)

Achieving “Shared Prosperity? (continued)

       Collaboration: Respondents who are currently collaborating with the WBG were
        significantly more likely to indicate that a growing middle class is a key contributor to
        achieving “Shared Prosperity?, but significantly less likely to indicate better
        entrepreneurial opportunities as a key contributor compared to respondents who had
        previously collaborated or never collaborated. Respondents who never collaborated with
        the WBG were significantly more likely to indicate that better employment opportunities
        for women and greater access to micro-finance for the poor are key contributors, and
        significantly less likely to say that agricultural development is a key contributor to
        achieving “Shared Prosperity? in Zambia compared to respondents who had previously
        collaborated or are currently collaborating with the WBG.

       Gender: Female respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that greater access
        to micro-finance for the poor is a key contributor to achieving “Shared Prosperity?
        compared to male respondents, who were significantly more likely to indicate that,
        agricultural development is a key contributor to achieving “Shared Prosperity? in
        Zambia. Although more female respondents than male respondents indicated that better
        employment opportunities for women would achieve “Shared Prosperity?, this difference

Focusing World Bank Group Resources (continued)

       Stakeholders: Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that the
        WBG should focus on agricultural development and rural development, respondents from
        the private sector and the media indicated that the WBG should focus on economic
        growth, respondents from NGOs/CBOs indicated that the WBG should focus on gender
        equity, and respondents from independent government institutions and faith-based groups
        indicated that the WBG should focus on job creation in Zambia.

       Collaboration: Respondents who never collaborated with the WBG were significantly
        more likely to indicate that the WBG should focus on rural development, economic
        growth, and foreign direct investment, and significantly less likely to say that the WBG
        should focus on agricultural development and job creation compared to respondents who
        had previously collaborated or are currently collaborating with the WBG.

       Gender: Female respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG
        should focus on gender equity, transport, foreign direct investment, food security, poverty
        reduction, and disaster management compared to male respondents, who were
        significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should focus on job creation, natural
        resource management, and health in Zambia.

       Specializations/Sectors:
             Generalist respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG
              should focus on public sector governance/reform, natural resource management,
              climate change, and food security, but significantly less likely to indicate that the
              WBG should focus on economic growth and private sector development
              compared to respondents from other specializations.
             Respondents from the macroeconomics and fiscal management sector were
              significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should focus on agricultural
              development, job creation, education, and transport, but significantly less likely to
              indicate that the WBG should focus on public sector governance/reform, natural
              resource management, and gender equity compared to respondents from other
              sectors.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Zambia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Zambia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Zambia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

Overall Perceptions
       Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across all of these
        aspects of how the WBG operates, except that the WBG effectively monitors and
        evaluates its projects and working with the WBG increases institutional capacity in
        Zambia. Although there was a lot of variation, respondents from bilateral/multilateral
        agencies and the financial sector/private banks tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement for these aspects of how the WBG operates whereas respondents from
        NGOs/CBOs tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement. A full breakdown of
        these ratings by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 85).

IX. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Zambia (continued)

Collaborating with Stakeholders in Zambia
       Year Comparison: Respondents from the FY ’12 country survey indicated that the WBG
        should work more closely with local government (35%), the private sector (30%), NGOs
        (29%), and beneficiaries (26%) to ensure better development results in Zambia.

       Collaboration: Respondents who currently collaborate with the WBG and respondents
        who had previously collaborated were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG
        should work more closely with local government (36% and 42%, respectively) compared
        to respondents who had never collaborated with the WBG (2%), who were significantly
        more likely to indicate that the WBG should work more closely with academia (58%)
        compared to respondents who currently collaborate and respondents who had previously
        collaborated with the WBG (23% and 33%, respectively).

        that they got most of their information about economic and social development issues in
        Zambia from local newspapers and the Internet, a majority of respondents from PMUs/
        Consultants on WBG projects and the financial sector/private banks indicated that they
        also utilize local television.

Appendix F: Responses to Questions across Country Surveys
Comparing responses across country surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in
respondent samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter
factor, only those questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Note that the unique

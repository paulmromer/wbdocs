I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in China perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing China
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in China
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to July 2015, 570 stakeholders of the WBG in China were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from ministries/ministerial departments; local governments, Project
Management Units (PMUs) at both the central and local levels; the Central Bank; financial
sector/banks; private sector organizations; NGOs; the regulatory agency; state-owned
enterprises; bilateral/multilateral agencies; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported
projects/ programs; the media; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and other organizations.
A total of 184 stakeholders participated in the survey (32% response rate).

Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier. Some others completed
the questionnaires online. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing China; their
overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge
work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in China; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 40%, N=207). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. As a result,
means of the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different
from those of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted
stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 90).

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

        respondents in the FY12 country survey (weighted mean in FY’12 = 7.0)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in China, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development and its work helps to achieve development results in China.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in China, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in China. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at railway;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in China, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection.

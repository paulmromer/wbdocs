M    ost commodity prices declined in the second quarter
of 2015 due to ample supplies and weak demand, especially
in industrial commodities. One main exception was the price
of crude oil which rebounded early in the quarter on stronger
demand but has since weakened owing to a still large global
surplus. These trends are expected to persist for the rest
of the year, with a modest recovery in 2016. This issue’s
Special Focus section looks at China’s and India’s commodity
consumption patterns. It concludes that demand from
China and, to a lesser extent India, signiﬁcantly raised global
demand for metals and energy—especially coal—and less so
for food commodities. This pattern reﬂected the countries’
diﬀerent growth models and the way in which consumption
responds to income growth.

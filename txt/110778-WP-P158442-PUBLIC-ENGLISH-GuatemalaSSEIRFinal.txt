   I.      Executive Summary

Overall: Social spending in Guatemala needs to achieve efficiency gains and increase to
minimum levels to meet basic human development objectives. Current levels are so low that
fiscal reform (in revenue generation and spending allocation) is urgently needed so that the
State can fulfill its mandated coverage and quality in social service provision.

In the last ten years, Guatemala has had decent economic growth but failed to improve
human development indicators or reduce poverty (which has increased). Guatemala’s
economic growth surpassed the Central American (CA) average over the past ten years, but most
of the population did not benefit. Despite a recent decrease in inequality (albeit from among the
highest levels in the world), poverty levels are stubbornly high, and rose recently, affecting almost
60% of the population. Guatemala’s human development performance has been disappointing
compared to Latin America, CA, and countries with similar income levels. There has been progress
in primary enrollment, but completion rates and secondary enrollment continue to be low.
Guatemala’s undernourishment rate increased to 30% in the last decade – among the worst in the
world, and three times the averages in Latin America and CA. Unemployment rates remain low,
but a quarter of workers are underemployed, and 70% belong to the informal sector and have low
earning.

One the major causes of this poor performance in poverty reduction and human
development indicators is the limited presence of the State in the provision of key social
public services, starting with very low resource allocations and inefficiencies in spending.
Despite a slight recent increase, social public spending is the lowest in CA as a share of GDP
(across all social sectors, including education, health, and pensions, and just above Nicaragua on
social assistance), and above only Nicaragua in per capita real terms, and also among the lowest
in the world. An allocation of just 8% of GDP is not surprising given that general government
revenues are only 11% of GDP – also among the lowest in the world. Without an ambitious fiscal
reform that would guarantee sufficient resources for public service provision, this situation is
expected to remain in the future. In the meantime, there is significant room to improve the quality
of spending (a tenth of approved budgets to social sectors is regularly left unspent each year) and
its targeting (which overall favors the non-poor, mainly through regressive pension benefits), as
well as spending tracking, evaluation and feedback mechanisms.

Education: Low and inefficient public spending, coupled with outdated legal and
institutional frameworks, are significant barriers to increasing enrollment and providing
quality education.

Regardless of the indicator used, Guatemala spends less on education than all other CA
countries except Nicaragua. Between 2007 and 2013, total public spending on education did not
keep pace with population growth, so per capita spending declined. Despite recent increases,

                                                 10

spending at the secondary level remains low, and funding gaps between Guatemala and CA peers
have widened. The Government has heavily prioritized investing in pre-primary education, more
than doubling the number of pre-primary teachers as enrollments increased by over 10%.
Importantly, since 2009, net and gross primary enrollment rates have declined significantly. Many
countries have seen declines after achieving universal primary education as a backlog of students
age out, but in Guatemala, the decline is associated with high and persistent dropouts and decreases
in initial enrollment. The net primary enrollment rate declined from 95.6% to 85.5% between 2007
and 2013. At the secondary level, 46% of students report dropping out mainly for financial reasons:
low secondary public funding places a heavy financial burden on households. There are stark
differences in secondary enrollment rates across income quintiles, ethnicity, gender, and
departments. In 2013, boys outnumber girls two to one in some rural secondary schools.
Enrollment differs only slightly among demographic groups at the primary level.

In spite of encouraging progress in learning, large inefficiencies and pervasive still low
learning outcomes highlight the history of reduced policy focus on quality. In recent years,
Guatemala has significantly improved learning outcomes. Recently published TERCE results
show improvements in reading and math at both the 3rd and 6th grades between 2006 and 2013.
These improvements in learning are likely partly the result of the increased number of teachers (by
almost 50% at primary level). However, in the 2013 TERCE, the country was still well in the
bottom half of Latin American countries. Guatemala has the highest repetition rate in CA, with
one in eight primary students repeating a grade each year. Even when students are able to complete
primary school, many do not acquire the necessary skills to advance. Recent data show that
problems persist at the upper secondary level, where only one out of four graduating students
achieved the expected level in reading and only one in ten achieved the expected level in
mathematics.

Moving forward, more efficient, equitable and cost-effective public education spending will
require some important policy and institutional changes, including greater use of the
incipient monitoring and evaluation system. First, the current legal framework for the sector is
outdated and needs updating to clarify and formalize responsibilities, reduce fragmentation of
players, and address the core system needs. Second, while the quality of the professional in-service
teacher-training appears to be good, the program’s long run sustainability requires stronger
financial planning and establishment of closer linkages with teachers’ career progression. Third,
at the tertiary level, the existence of only one public higher education institution constrains access
and contributes to inequity.

Short term:
 The legal framework for the 1991 Education Law needs to be completed with new bylaws
   clarifying the roles and responsibilities of institutions and offices involved in education
   provision.



                                                 11
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


   Education policies would benefit from focused attention to issues of access, retention and
    completion, especially at the secondary level where dropouts are heavily concentrated. This
    could be done, for example, by leveraging the incipient monitoring and information system
    more and by piloting and evaluating specific interventions that attempt to redress the lack of
    financial incentives, especially in rural areas.
   To improve quality, it seems imperative to improve teachers’ competencies; this can be
    supported through the flagship professional teacher training program (PADEP/D) and by
    strengthening the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) monitoring and evaluation capacity at
    local levels. The latter will be more feasible if MINEDUC can leverage existing information
    systems, especially those that currently feed the school report cards that are available online.
    The challenge would be systematic and regular use of existing information systems to track
    students and policies, and ultimately for policy-making purposes.
   Improving equity would require, in the short run, rebalancing spending to increase the pro-
    poor profile of per student spending, targeting the most vulnerable, especially in the most rural
    and higher poverty areas. This could be achieved by strengthening programs and incentives
    (including financial) that most help to overcome barriers to enter and remain in secondary
    education and beyond, including scholarships.

Medium term:
 The most important institutional reform ahead is to enact a new Education Law that would
  support the modern needs of the Education system, and align it with several legal agreements
  approved after 1991: the Peace Accords, the Law of Executive Power Law (Community
  Participation), and the regulatory framework for Decentralization.
   In addition, access and quality issues need to be tackled by addressing infrastructure gaps at
    the secondary level, especially in rural areas, and by fostering a dramatic improvement in the
    quality of the teacher corps through improved processes for teacher recruitment, retention and
    evaluation. For instance, one possible way could be to de-compress teacher’s wages by
    increasing financial incentives for the best performers which would make teaching a more
    attractive profession for many who value career and wage progression.
   The long-term sustainability of the professional in-service teacher training program
    (PADEP/D) requires more financing and closer linkages with career progression of teachers.
   The system would also benefit from greater access to subsidized tertiary education for low-
    income students, which would involve expanding access to public and private higher education
    institutions. This could be achieved, among other ways, through piloting and testing new
    scholarships/vouchers for students, and improving the quality standards that private providers
    must meet.

Health: Some progress but insufficient and delayed funding, as well as institutional capacity
and governance challenges limit coverage and quality of services

Despite having among the lowest public spending on health relative to GDP in the Latin
America and Caribbean (LAC) region, Guatemala has made some progress in improving
health outcomes and in increasing coverage rates for certain services, but significant
challenges remain. Guatemala’s chronic malnutrition rate remains the highest in LAC and among
the highest in the world. Maternal mortality has decreased but remains well above the LAC
average. Non-communicable diseases have become the major cause of morbidity and mortality.
Service utilization rates are significantly lower for the poorest and indigenous populations who
tend to live in rural areas. Ministry of Health (MOH) standards for facility-to-population ratios
would be met only if the population were still the same size as in the 50s. Even with the MOH’s
efforts to compensate for the inadequate availability of primary health care facilities through the
use of mobile health teams, less than half of the population are covered by primary health care
services as a result of the cancellation of the Extension of Coverage Program in February 2015
and the delay in rolling out the new institutionalized primary health care model. Quality of care
also remains an issue, with shortages of health professionals and medical inputs. Guatemala’s
health personnel to population ratio in 2013 was only half of the World Health Organization
(WHO) standard. There are frequent shortages in drugs and medical inputs in all facilities,
especially in the major hospitals.

Insufficient funds are a major constraint to improving the coverage and quality of care, and
there is also room for enhancing the efficiency of public spending on health . Guatemala has
one of the lowest per capita health expenditures in the LAC region. The health sector budget is
inadequate to address the significant coverage gaps and quality issues related to staffing and
availability of essential inputs. While there is a clear need to increase public resources allocated
to health and to reduce delays in the flow of funds, there are also several opportunities for
improving the efficiency of health spending, particularly in human resource management and
procurement of drugs and medical inputs. Specific examples include ghost employees, contract
awards that do not meet technical standards and procurement guidelines, pharmaceutical firms that
game the system, and uncoordinated purchases across key health institutions.

On the institutional side, there has been mixed progress in implementing the MOH’s 2014-
19 strategy which aims to contribute to universal health coverage. The MOH has made
progress in: (a) training staff to strengthen service delivery and monitoring; (b) expanding
implementation of integrated health service networks to improve coordination across the three
levels of care from Guatemala City to selected areas in four other departments: Sololá,
Huehuetenango, Quiche, San Marcos; (c) rolling out the new primary health care model which is
based on a life cycle approach and goes beyond the maternal and child focus of the previous model;
and (d) piloting results based budgeting (RBB), emphasizing the first 1000 days of life (pregnancy
and the first two years of a child’s life) based on the agreement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
under the Zero Hunger Program - one of the Government’s flagship programs. The MOH had
originally planned to expand RBB to all Health District municipalities and hospitals based on cost
centers by 2015. While some work has advanced in establishing cost centers, and improvements

                                                13
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


have been made in the Health Management Information System (SIGSA), as well as in the results
orientation of MOH reports to the MOF, progress in implementing the 2015-19 strategy has been
less than planned mainly because of resource constraints and funding delays, cancellation of the
Coverage Extension Program (PEC) without a service delivery transition plan, and limited
institutional capacity at central and local levels.

The new Administration includes health as one of its three priority areas, and has prepared
major strategies that need to be supported by concrete operational plans and resources. The
current Government has officially launched its 2016-2020 strategy to reduce chronic malnutrition.
It has also prepared a strategy to strengthen primary health care and drafted a health sector reform
proposal. It has already launched a series of consultations with different stakeholders with regard
to these proposed initiatives. Implementation of the nutrition strategy and the MOH’s primary
health care strategy will require additional resources to address existing significant coverage and
quality gaps. This makes identifying ways to reassign and/or generate more funds for health and
nutrition a key areas of focus for the proposed health sector reforms. Another important area of
focus of the proposed reforms would be to improve the efficiency of health spending, including by
expanding the use of results-based budgeting in the health sector.

In moving forward, the Government of Guatemala could consider the following
recommendations in the health sector:

Short term:
 MOF and MOH could work together to identify and address key factors that impede funding
   flows from central to local levels. The MOF could also consider increasing spending ceilings
   in sectors that perform well against clear and transparent criteria.
   Identify and implement a transitional service delivery mechanism to quickly provide basic
    services to areas that have been affected by the PEC’s cancellation and that are not yet covered
    by the new Primary Health Care Model.
   Prepare costed operational plans for the 2016-2020 nutrition and strengthening primary health
    care strategies and ensure sufficient budgets to support their implementation. While some
    funds could be reallocated based on efficiency gains from measures like those mentioned
    above, the MOF will need to allocate more resources toward main priorities in the sector if the
    Government wishes to reach its nutrition and health targets.
   Implement measures to reduce the cost of drugs, which could include adopting standardized,
    common bidding documents and a common essential drugs list for all public entities to increase
    economies of scale. Drug procurement savings could also be achieved by amending the
    procurement law so that suppliers who are awarded contracts and do not deliver on time under
    the Open Contract Mechanism are barred from bidding for the same lots after Health Areas
    and Hospitals obtain MOF clearance to purchase outside negotiated prices.
   Strengthen the MOH human resource data base to include disaggregated distribution of the
    MOH health workforce, their academic qualifications, skill levels and training need. These

                                                14
                  Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


    data should feed into the development of a human resource strategy, and the data base used to
    monitor progress in implementing the strategy.
   Explore the feasibility of re-negotiating the collective pact with health workers. The MOH
    could consider offering long term contracts in lieu of annual ones, and providing non-monetary
    incentives or financial ones that are within its budget such as public recognition and special
    training opportunities.
Medium term:
 Develop, cost, and implement a phased and coordinated strategy to improve access to a
  comprehensive package of health and nutrition services through integrated networks (primary
  to tertiary levels) to progressively reach poor, rural, indigenous areas.
   Mobilize more resources and ensure timely flow of funds to enhance coverage and quality of
    services, and expand results-based budgeting in the health sector. The MOH in collaboration
    with the MOF could consider additional funding sources that would work in Guatemala’s
    situation, drawing on experience in other countries.
   Develop, cost, and implement a Human Resource (HR) strategy that attracts and retains health
    workers, and that also addresses inequities in access. For example, the MOH could reclassify
    professional nurses to make their salaries commensurate with their qualifications and
    functions, and identify and address the main factors behind high dropout rates in nursing
    schools.
   Prepare and implement a costed action plan to strengthen pharmaceutical management, and
    develop an integrated public policy on medicines including a mechanism for ensuring
    availability of a package of essential drugs in primary health care facilities. An integrated,
    coordinated public policy on medicines, together with improvements in planning and
    budgeting, procurement, and other steps along the supply chain, could help reduce stock-outs
    of essential medicines.

Social Protection: There is need for increased spending in social assistance interventions,
better coordination among implementing agencies, and revised targeting to ensure decent
coverage of programs among the poorest.

Guatemala’s Social Protection and Labor (SPL) spending has increased in real terms since
2007, and increased as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) until 2010 but then
settled back to 3%. Guatemala has all the key elements of an SPL system, including contributory
programs (social security), non-contributory benefits directed to the most vulnerable groups, and
labor market programs. However, coverage and resource allocation are not always appropriate,
and the degree of implementation of the SPL components varies greatly. Overall, the country has
slightly increased the amount of resources invested in SPL, in real terms and relative to the GDP,
mostly on the social assistance components. SPL spending rose on average 7% per year in real
terms from 6,412 million quetzals in 2007 to 9,928 million quetzals in 2014. As a percetage of
GDP, SPL spending rose from 2.5% in 2007 to a peak of 3.3% in 2010, and then stabilized at 3%.

                                               15
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


Spending in social security has remained stagnant in recent years and is one of the lowest in
CA; the non-contributory component has low coverage and generosity, and is poorly
targeted. Spending in the main contributory regime, Invalidez, Vejez y Supervivencia (IVS), has
not improved in recent years, varying around 1.9 percent of GDP. This is the lowest social security
share in CA. Coverage rose in absolute and relative terms so that 22.4% of the elderly are protected,
but this is still amongst the lowest coverage in LAC. Equity remains an issue for both the
contributive and non-contributive regimes, but adequacy of benefits is fair especially for low
income workers in the contributory regime. The social pension has maintained relatively stable
spending; it is less generous than other countries in CA. Targeting needs to improve, especially of
the poorest two quintiles.

Two main challenges for social assistance are to increase spending, and to prioritize
interventions that deliver more beneficial impacts to the poorest (such as the Conditional
Cash Transfer (CCT)) over poorly targeted utility subsidies. CCT needs to improve its
implementation performance. The adoption of the CCT model increased the resources spent in
cash transfers paid directly to the poorest until 2010, with some beneficial impacts already seen in
health outcomes and school attendance. Some of these outcomes have the potential impacts to
impact poverty rates, which should be analyzed further. Nevertheless, the CCT program has
implementation issues and suffered a budget cut - these need redressing to maintain and improve
the results already achieved. The CCT also requires an increase in benefit levels (more important
than further expansion of coverage which is already high) and changes in the benefit structure. The
current flat benefit irrespectively of the number of children may not provide sufficient support to
larger families, nor provide enough incentive to comply with transfer conditions for all children in
the household. It would be advisable to change to a “per child” benefit as Honduras has done, and
to revise the accountability procedures to achieve more transparency. A strong anchor with the
RUU-N is an opportunity to position the CCT as the main platform for other social assistance
interventions, some of which should be reconsidered to avoid duplication and create more fiscal
space for the CCT. Given budget constraints, it may also advisable to restrict CCT coverage to the
extreme poor (another recent change made in Honduras). Revising the conditionalities of the CCT
is another aspect to consider; there is scope, for instance, to include new areas in the program like
nutrition-related outcomes or secondary education. Additional fiscal space could also be obtained
by reducing and phasing down untargeted utility subsidies, such as for electricity and transport.

The labor market sector faces important challenges derived from the nature of the workforce
in Guatemala. An important labor market challenge relates to young people aged 25 years or
younger, who currently account for 35% of the employed population. Demographic trends have
created a lot of pressure to absorb large numbers of young people in the labor market. This has not
been adequately tackled by labor market programs except for INTECAP, which faces financial
constraints and obstacles to increasing resources for its programs. Intermediation programs are
small and growing very slowly, and passive labor market interventions such as unemployment
insurance schemes are not in place yet. The relatively small unemployment rate hides the

                                                 16
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


prevalence of this problem among some specific groups, mainly young people who have not
completed secondary education. The main message is the need to design and carry out more
interventions to link youngsters to the labor market; for instance, utilizing the platform provided
by INTECAP’s various packages of technical training, and also ensuring that INTECAP’s training
centers are effectively reaching the youth.

On the institutional side, the launching of the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES)
provided a platform to manage the different programs of the sector under one umbrella;
however MIDES has not yet been able to tackle technical deficiencies in implementation.
MIDES gathers under its sector the most important programs in Social Assistance; however, it also
inherited implementation shortfalls related to poor targeting mechanisms, irregular payments and
transfers, and generally low institutional capacities to maintain consistent execution throughout
the year and in all areas. Some progress has been accomplished through the establishment of SISO
and RUU-N, but it is not enough. The sector also faces duplication issues with agencies
implementing different interventions not coordinating roles, targeting mechanisms, and strategies.
Coordination could enable a more integrated approach for different target populations (children,
youth, elderly), and geographic areas (urban/rural). Even though some initiatives on this have
started, MIDES has not consolidated itself yet as the coordinating mechanism across sectors and
levels of government.

To tackle fragmentation, the completion and mandatory use of RUU-N by all agencies
implementing social protection interventions is a must. Precisely to avoid fragmentation,
improve targeting, and reallocate scares resources to those most in need (e.g., as subsidies or social
pensions), RUU-N should be strengthened though legislation to mandate its use and by tying
budget allocations to use; and used effectively as a policy tool to enable more efficient policy
decisions. Improvements could be made also by identifying all beneficiaries in each household,
estimating the type and number of benefits each family receives, and tackling structural
deficiencies in the targeting and coverage of each program.

Short term:
 To improve coverage and generosity of the social security system, it would be important to
   undertake a thorough revision of the targeting of the social pension to ensure it benefits those
   most in need.
   To maximize the CCT’s effectiveness, it is critical to stop coverage expansion, stabilize
    payments by ensuring an adequate budget allocation, and improve internal processes so that
    households receive transfers on time.
   Another consideration for the CCT is to consider restricting coverage to the extreme poor only,
    given current budget constraints.
   To improve active labor market programs (ALMPs), it is important to explore ways to increase
    resources allocated to training interventions. It is also critical to take stock and develop a plan
    to ensure there are employment services in major urban centers at least.

   To enhance coordination and efficiency of the SPL system, it is critical to complete the RUU-
    N within MIDES through agreements among remaining institutions for database sharing.
   It is also advisable to revise the targeting formula for interventions within RUU-N.

Medium term:
 Sustainability of the “Pay-as-You-Go” (PAYG) pension system requires that deficit gaps be
  covered.
   It is advisable to revise CCT benefit levels and conditionalities, and communicate the changes
    appropriately to beneficiaries.
   Utility subsidy reform could be contemplated, ideally to phase them down and reallocate the
    fiscal space to the CCT.
   INTECAP funding mechanism should be revised.
   The mandate of MINTRAB also could be revised to prioritize provision of core employment
    services (rather than executing social assistance programs like social pensions, which should
    probably migrate to MIDES).
   Once the RUU-N is completed, it is critical that its use becomes mandatory for by all social
    protection interventions, possible tying funding to its use as incentive to comply.

II. Context

Guatemala had modest economic growth in the last decade, mostly below the average for
Central America (CA). From 2001 to 2015, Guatemala’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
averaged 3.5%, below the CA average of 3.9% (Figure 1). Guatemala and Panama were the only
CA countries to maintain positive GDP growth in the past decade., Guatemala’s GDP growth
rebounded less well after the 2009 recession, averaging 3.7% from 2010 to 2015 – half a
percentage point below the 4.2% CA average, and higher only than El Salvador (1.9%).
Guatemala’s GDP per capita grew only 1.1% on average between 2000 and 2015, the lowest in
the CA region

Income inequality has fallen, but poverty has increased. In the 1990s, Guatemala was one of
the poorest and most unequal countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. The
country’s social indicators were better only than Haiti’s (World Bank, 2009). Inequality (measured
by the Gini coefficient) has declined from 0.6 in 2000, to 0.56 in 2006 and 0.53 in 2014 (Figure
2). However, overall poverty rose from 51% in 2006 to 59% in 2014 (Figure 3). Extreme poverty
declined slightly between 2000 and 2006 to 15.3%, but increased to 23.4% in 2014. The gap
between rural and urban poverty narrowed slightly in recent years, but both overall and extreme
poverty remain much higher in rural areas (71% vs 35% and 56% vs 29%, respectively). Income
poverty is the highest in CA, surpassing even the 40% poverty level in Nicaragua, a country with
a considerably lower GDP per capita (5,992 compared to 7,706 in 2015 PPP current international
$, World Bank databank, 2016).

On average, LAC and CA countries, and six comparator countries1 have better human
development indicators and have made more progress than Guatemala. Table 1 compares
trends in key education, health, and social protection and labor indicators with three comparator
groups: i) the top 7 economies in the LAC region; ii) the remaining countries in the CA region;
and iii) a set of 6 countries around the world that can be considered “comparator countries” based
on economic and population criteria. In education, Guatemala has increased enrollment at all
levels, but secondary enrollment and completion rates remain lower than the three comparator
groups. Health indicators have slightly improved and are in the same ballpark as the other groups
except for Guatemala’s much lower percent of births attended by skilled workers, fewer hospital
beds, and undernourishment rate which improved in the comparator groups but worsened in
Guatemala from 27.7% in 2000-2006 to 30.1% in 2007-2014. This is almost three times the
averages for LAC (9.8) and CA (12.6) and double the comparator group average (16.8). In Social
Protection, Guatemala shows some improvement in most indicators, but a few indicators worsened
slightly. In particular, although the unemployment rate is lower in Guatemala than in the
comparator groups, it increased from 2.5 to 3.4 while the other groups’ unemployment rates
decreased. Also, Guatemala’s rural poverty rate is extremely high compared to other countries,
and its urban poverty rate increased while it significantly decreased in the comparator groups.

  A group of appropriate comparator countries for Guatemala was defined based on five criteria: GDP per
capita, GDP (size of the economy), total population, population density, and percentage of population in
rural areas. The comparators are: Angola, Bhutan, Kosovo, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Uzbekistan.

III. Recent Trends in Social Public Spending in Guatemala

Social Public Spending’s share of GDP increased in the last decade but has stagnated in
recent years. As a share of GDP, social public spending increased from 7% in 2007 to 8.1% in
2014 (Figure 4). The shares of all social sectors increased, with social assistance and labor
spending growing most (77%) followed by health (18%), education (10%) and social security
(4%). Social public spending’s share of GDP increased significantly between 2007 and 2010. In
2011 social public spending decreased and has increased only marginally since then.

Despite its increased share of GDP since 2007, social public spending in Guatemala is by far
the lowest in CA. Guatemala’s overall social public spending share of GDP in 2014 of 8.1% is
substantially below the 12% share in El Salvador, and the 13-15% shares in Honduras and
Nicaragua which have lower GDP per capita (Figure 5). Guatemala also has the lowest social
sector spending to GDP in CA in all categories except social assistance and labor where it ranks
fifth (just above Nicaragua). Moreover, Guatemala’s per capita social public spending is second-
to-lowest in the LAC region, only marginally above Nicaragua (Figure 6).

In general, social public spending is not progressive, with social security benefits especially
regressive. Figure 7 shows the distribution of social public spending by sectors and quintiles.
Public spending on health appears benefits mainly the bottom three income quintiles with a much
smaller amount going to the richest quintile; education follows a similar pattern although with a
smaller variation across income quintiles than health. Social assistance and labor interventions
(cash transfers, sickness and disability, etc.) are fairly evenly allocated across the lowest four
income quintiles, with significantly less going to the highest income quintile. However, social
security spending appears to be highly regressive, increasing strongly with income.

Note: Distribution of spending was calculated based on the distribution of beneficiaries per sector.
For education, we considered the numbers of public students enrolled in each level of education
by income quintile. For health, we considered the utilization of public health providers by income
quintiles. For social security, we considered the distribution of social pension beneficiaries by
income quintiles and, for social assistance, the distribution of social assistance beneficiaries.

Guatemala’s low total government revenue and expenditure make it difficult to adequately
finance the social sectors. Guatemala ranks last in the world in total spending and total revenue
as a share of GDP (Figure 8). In addition, the country’s overall fiscal deficit increased from 1.4%
of GDP in 2007 to 2.1% of GDP in 2014 (Figure 9). The international economic crisis that began
in 2009 and the adoption of countercyclical policies widened the fiscal deficit which reached 3.3%
of GDP in 2010. Since 2010, Guatemala has reduced its total deficit by decreasing total
expenditures rather than by increasing revenues, which actually declined as a share of GDP in
2014 and 2015. The policy decision to close the deficit (quite successfully) by containing spending
limits ability to increase allocations to social sectors. The only short run option is to focus on
making the available spending envelope more effective and efficient.

On top of inadequate funding, social sectors did not fully spend their budgets; budget
execution averaged 89% from 2007 to 2014. Among sectors, education’s budget execution rate
is the highest, although it decreased from 97% in 2007 to 95% in 2014. Social protection’s budget
execution rate was the lowest but increased from 84% in 2007 to 94% in 2010 and 96% in 2011
and 2012, then dropped to 94% in 2014. The health sector’s budget execution rate was only 84%
in 2014 although its average execution rate from 2007 to 2014 was 92% (Figure 10).

Guatemala’s public social public spending is less effective but more efficient than other LAC
countries. Figure 11 shows levels of Public Sector Performance (PSP) and Public Sector
Efficiency (PSE) in Guatemala and in other LAC countries. PSP is a composite indicator based on
socioeconomic variables that are assumed to be the output of public policies. This indicator
summarizes the effectiveness of public spending in improving social outcomes. The PSE indicator
relates PSP scores to total public spending in these sectors. It represents the “public value” per
public dollar spent. The overall assumption behind the assessment of public sector performance
and efficiency using PSP and PSE indicators is that the observed outcome indicators are solely the
result of public spending policies (Box 1 provides additional information on the PSP and PSE
analyses). Guatemala’s public spending in all sectors is efficient but not effective compared to
other LAC countries. This means that Guatemala is among the countries with the lowest social
indicators,2 but that the country gets higher returns (improvements in social indicators) per dollar
of social public spending.

 Indicators used to measure results in each social sector were: education (Adult literacy rate for population
15+ years, and each sex in %; Percentage of population age 25+ with completed secondary schooling),
health (Maternal mortality ratio, national estimate per 100,000 live births; % of children aged 12-23 months
immunized against measles) and social protection and labor (GINI index; Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90
a day 2011 PPP).

    The relationship between social outcomes and spending was analyzed using the Public Sector
    Performance (PSP) and Public Sector Efficiency (PSE) approaches developed by Afonso,
    Schuknecht, and Tanzi (2005, 2010).3

    PSP is measured by constructing composite indicators based on observable social variables that
    are assumed to be the output of pursued social public policies. Specifically, the PSP for country
     = 1, … ,  with  = 1,2,3 social sectors (education, health and social protection and labor) is
    determined by:

in Afonso, Romero, and Monsalve (2013).

 where ( ) is a function of k observable social indicators (for education, we take gross
 secondary enrollment and literacy rate; for health, we take maternal mortality and immunization
 rates; and for social protection and labor, inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) and
 extreme poverty headcount (percentage of population earning less than USD1.25 a day). To
 obtain PSP indicators we assign equal weights to each sub-indicator, computed as the average
 of the corresponding outcome indicators, each one of them normalized by its sample mean. The
 PSP indicator for each country is then obtained by averaging the values of all sub-indicators.
 Resulting PSP scores are then related to the average value of one of the normalized output
 indicators. Hence, countries with PSP scores in excess of one are seen as good performers, as

 PSE relates PSP scores to their cost in terms of public spending. PSE weights public sector
 performance in each social sector by the amount of relevant public expenditure used to achieve
 such performance. To compute PSE scores, public spending in each sector is normalized across

A LAC “production possibility frontier” analysis shows that Guatemala is on the efficiency
frontier but achieving lower results than others. Figure 12 shows the production possibility
frontier for total social public spending for LAC, applying data envelope analysis (DEA) using
PSP scores as an output and social public spending-to-GDP ratios as an input (explained in Box
2). The results show an efficiency frontier essentially defined by Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
                                                                28

Peru and Chile (Figure 12). However, even though Guatemala is close to the efficient DEA
frontier, this does not imply that there is no room for improvement in the outcome indicators
(directly linked to performance) or the current input/output ratio. In fact, Guatemala could increase
its performance by 20% with the same level of spending. The DEA analysis also suggests that
there is no room for minimizing spending since the country could only save 1% of its spending
and still achieve the same level of output. Sector specific results differ; for example, in the health
sector (discussed in the health chapter), Guatemala is far from the Production Possibility Frontier

  The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology, developed by Farrell (1957), assumes
  the existence of a convex production frontier to construct an envelope around the set of
  observations. DEA compares each unit with all other units, and identifies units that are
  operating inefficiently compared with other units' actual operating results. DEA presents two
  approaches: 1) the input-oriented approach shows how much input quantity could be reduced
  without changing the output quantities; 2) the output-oriented approach assesses how much
  output quantities could be increased without changing the input quantities used. Efficiency for
  each unit can be measured by computing the distance to the theoretical efficiency frontier (or
  compared to the best practice units). DEA provides an efficiency rating that is generally
  denominated between zero and 1, which will be referred to interchangeably as an efficiency
  percentage ranging from zero to 100%. The best practice units are relatively efficient and are

 inefficient units have an efficiency rating of less than
 1 ( < 1). This figure illustrates a single input,
 single output DEA production possibility frontier.
 Countries A, B and C are efficient with output scores
 equal to 1. On the other hand, country D is not
 efficient, and its score [d2/(d1+d2)] is below 1.




IV. Performance and Challenges in Education

   IV.1                                    Recent Evolution of Education Spending

       Between 2007 and 2013, education spending rose in real terms at a modest average of
1.1% per year and per capita education spending fell. In 2007, public spending on education
was USD2.3 billion, and was only slightly higher at USD2.5 billion in 2014 (Figure 13). Real
education spending increased marginally between 2007 and 2009, but decreased each year from
2010 to 2014. During 2007-2014, population growth outpaced growth in public education
spending, leading to a decline in real per capita education spending from USD173 to USD157
(Figure 14). This is equivalent to a decline of 1.4% per year.

Public education spending (as a percent of GDP) is lower than its CA regional peers and
among the lowest in the world. Between 2000 and 2014, Guatemala’s education spending as a
percent of GDP fluctuated between 3 and 2.7% of GDP (Figure 15). This is the lowest in Central
America (Figure 16). It is well below both the Latin America average and the norm for countries
with similar GDP per capita levels (Figure 17). As a reference point, Angola spent 3.5% of GDP
on education in 2010, and Bhutan spent 4.7% in 2011.

Education spending is concentrated on pre-primary and primary education. Between 2007
and 2014, spending on pre-primary and primary education increased from 1.5 to 1.8% of GDP
(Figure 18).4 In 2014, they accounted for 63% of all public education spending in the country
(Figure 19). This is in stark contrast to most Central American countries, which already invest a
larger portion of their budget in secondary5 and tertiary education, and less on pre-primary and
primary education. This bias towards primary reflects Guatemala’s greater focus on achieving
universal access in primary education.6

  In Guatemala, primary education begins at age seven and lasts six years; lower secondary consists of the
three years between ages 13 and 16; upper secondary consists of two (diversified) or three (technical) years
of schooling. Education is mandatory until grade six. When not specified, secondary refers to both lower
and upper secondary combined. Further details on the structure of the formal education system are given in
the Institutional section.

  When not specified, secondary refers to both lower and upper secondary combined.

  Guatemala's secondary and tertiary enrollment rates are much lower than in other countries. This may be
both cause and effect of lower funding in these education levels. A higher than average portion of funding
going to primary education and a lower than average portion going to secondary may encourage more of
the same: higher primary enrollment requires greater investment, which maintains high enrollment;
meanwhile, low public investment in secondary education may shift the financial burden to households,
resulting in lower secondary enrollment.

Between 2007 and 2013, per student spending increased at the pre-primary and primary
level, but decreased at the secondary level. Between 2007 and 2013, inflation-adjusted pre-
primary spending almost doubled per student, increasing from USD271 per student in 2007 to
USD446 per student in 2013 (Figure 20). Increasing per student pre-primary spending required
significant resources, especially given the increase in the number of pre-primary students from

457,000 to 509,000 during the period (Figure 21). Per student primary spending also increased
from USD479 to USD505, while enrollment increased from 2.45 to 2.66 million between 2007
and 2009, but then decreased back to 2.49 million by 2013. Secondary education enrollment
expanded using low-cost education models, and secondary education remains the most poorly
funded level. Total secondary education spending as a percent of GDP has remained stagnant,
while enrollment increased from 864,000 to 1,164,000 between 2007 and 2013. During this period,
secondary spending declined 11%, from USD285 per student to USD254 per student.

In the years ahead, population growth will require increasing the education system’s
capacity to serve additional students. While the Guatemalan education system has made great
strides towards universal primary and lower secondary education in the past two decades, high
population growth means that the system will need to continue to expand its capacity simply to
keep up with the increasing number of students. Population projections confirm a substantial
increase in the number of primary and secondary-age students until 2050 (Figure 22). To maintain
current student teacher rations, Guatemala has the highest need to expand the stock of teachers in
Latin America (Figure 23).

In spite of the recent increases, as of 2013, per student spending in primary and secondary
were still lower than in most comparator countries around the world. Despite a higher
proportion of the budget going to primary education, primary per pupil spending is the second
lowest in CA (Figure 24) and second lowest in comparison with economic peers (such as Slovenia
and Angola). This is worrisome since per student spending in Central America is already much
lower than the world average. The country’s spending per secondary student (as a percent of GDP
per capita) is the tenth lowest worldwide (Figure 25).

Government spending varies considerably across education levels; spending per student in
tertiary education is 1.9 times the level in primary and 3.9 times spending per secondary
pupil. In 2013 the government spent on average USD505 per primary student and USD 446 per
pre-school pupil, but only USD254 per secondary student (Figure 26). In 2013, government
average spending of USD987 per tertiary student was nearly four times the spending per secondary
student. This pattern contrasts with most Central America countries, where per pupil spending is
greater at higher levels of education (Figure 27). Globally, over 80% of all countries spend more
per secondary student than per primary student.7 Guatemala also has a high ratio of pre-school to
primary spending (Figure 27 shows that this ratio varies considerably across the sub-region).

Public education spending in Guatemala benefits the wealthiest quintile most and does not
target the poorest groups. An incidence analysis based on enrollment and per student spending
by education level shows that public education spending is regressive at the top end. On average,
24% of all education spending goes to the wealthiest 20% of the population and 19% to the poorest
quintile (Figure 28). This is primarily due the wealthiest households capturing most of the tertiary
spending and the poorest households benefitting very little from secondary or tertiary education
spending. Households from all wealth quintiles are well represented in primary and secondary
schools. In 2014, 54% of primary students and 37% of secondary students came from the poorest
40% of households (Figure 29). In contrast, 75% of all tertiary students were from the wealthiest
20% of households, and over 90% were from the wealthiest 40% of households. In addition, an
analysis of subnational spending data found that education spending per capita is lower in poorer
regions.8

The wage bill share of total education spending has increased since 2007, driven mainly by
the increased number of primary school teachers. In 2013, the wage bill accounted for 82% of
total education spending; 16 percentage points higher than the 65.6% share in 2007 (Figure 30).

As with most countries in the CA region, and reflecting enrollment numbers, primary and lower
secondary education wages are the largest component of total education wage expenditures
(Figures 30, 32). Between 2007 and 2012, the number of primary education teachers in Guatemala
increased from 66,462 to 90,714 (Figure 31). This increased the wage bill for primary education
from 40% of all education spending in 2007 to 56% in 2013. By 2013 the education wage bill was
2.4% of GDP but still less than in most countries in the CA region (Figure 32).

On average, teachers in Guatemala are paid less per month than other similarly qualified
professionals, but they also tend to work fewer hours. An empirical analysis of wages in
Central America shows that teachers earn 20% less per month than other professions with similar
education and skill requirements (Figure 33). However, teachers in Guatemala are formally
required to work only five or six hours per day (the length of the school day). Assuming that
teachers work only during school hours (the hours recorded in the data set), they make 16% more
per hour than other comparable professionals. This implies that Guatemala has the second highest
monthly wage premium in the sub-region (Figure 33). However, some caution is needed. Most
likely, teachers actually work longer hours than the school day (doing teaching preparation and
grading), implying a smaller “de facto” hourly wage premium relative to other professions.
Differences across countries in this gap between hours actually worked and the hours recorded in
household data sets could also affect the relative ranking in hourly premiums across countries.

The distribution of teacher’s wages is compressed, making teaching unattractive for many
people who value potential wage increases over their career. The attractiveness of a profession
is linked not only to average pay, but also to the potential for increasing earnings over the course
of a career (see Bruns and Luque, 2015, for a discussion). The shape of the wage distribution in
Figure 33 shows that the range between the maximum and minimum pay for teachers is much
smaller than in other professions. Successful workers in other professions can achieve wage
increases through promotions and pay raises, but teachers in Guatemala seem to have limited
prospects for increased compensation over time. Some of the most motivated individuals will
likely prefer professions with greater opportunities for pay growth.

As of 2013, after the increase in the number of teachers, student-teacher ratios for primary
education are in line with countries with similar income levels, but secondary education

ratios are lower. The primary student-teacher ratio of 26.2 is in line with global averages given
Guatemala's low income level (Figure 34). The public secondary school student-teacher ratio was
14.4 in 2013, well below levels in countries with similar per capita incomes (Figure 35) and is the
lowest in Central America (Nicaragua (30.8), El Salvador (24.4), Honduras (19.9), Panama (14.9)
and Costa Rica (14.2). This benefits those currently enrolled in secondary school, but is in part a
result of having the lowest secondary enrollment rate in Central America. As discussed below, at
least one-third of secondary age students are not enrolled in school. The large number of secondary
teachers could be an underutilized resource that could allow for secondary enrollment expansion.

   IV.2        Performance of Education Indicators

Since 2009, enrollment rates in primary education have fallen, although there is a risk of
overstating this fall as official population projections may be inaccurate (based on 2002
census). In 2012, one in ten primary age students were not enrolled in primary school. Between
2009 and 2014, the gross enrollment rate (primary students of all ages divided by the number of
primary age students) declined from 117.3 to 103.6% (Figure 36). Net enrollment (enrolled
primary school age students only divided by total primary age children) appears to have declined
because some families chose not to enroll their children at all, and not from student dropout. In

                                                    41
                     Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


2013, the net enrollment rate fell below 90%; the percent of primary-age students who were not
enrolled increased from 4.4 in 2007 to 10.9 in 2012. The gap between the gross and net enrollment
rate represents students who are not in the age-appropriate grade. While more students are reaching
grade 6 than in the past, enrollment in grades 1 and 2 have been declining substantially since 2009
(Figure 37). It is worth stressing that the decline in enrollment rates could simply be explained by
the fact that the latest available population estimates are based on predictions from the 2002 census.
If the population grew less than predicted, there may be fewer children missing from school than
the numbers suggest.

The high drop off in primary school attendance is an important area of research moving
forward. Although it is possible that population projections are old and enrollment rates actually
are not falling, it may also be that after a reasonably long period of sustained increase in primary
public education access/coverage, low quality – coupled with low returns to education – are
discouraging some students from attending school. The repetition rate (discussed below) is an

                                                     42
                                           Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


indicator of poor quality. It may also be that financial constraints are binding for the poorest (partly
due to low CCT generosity) and are leading to lower enrollment rates. The fall in total primary
enrollments since 2010 suggests that lack of access to schools is not the cause.

Guatemala has the highest repetition rate in primary education in Central America. The gap
between the gross and net enrollment rates is caused by the large student population beyond
primary age. Low education quality often leads to high grade repetition, which in turn results in
lower student completion. Figure 38 shows the percent of primary students that repeat a grade each
year. Guatemala has the highest repetition rates for primary education in Central America,
averaging 11.7% of students between 2007 and 2013. Only Suriname has a higher repetition rate
than Guatemala in Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistently high repetition rates in the past
are likely due to Guatemala’s persistent quality issues (discussed below). While repetition shows
a commitment to hold students to learning standards, it increases education costs and may
discourage students. High levels of repetition and student drop-out result in fewer students
completing primary school (Figure 39).

While secondary enrollment is slowly rising, it is not catching up with the rest of Central
America. The gap between enrollment rates in Guatemala and the rest of Central America is not
closing. In 2014, the secondary gross enrollment rate was 63.5%, consistently below geographic
peer countries (Figure 40). Secondary enrollment is also below the level for many countries with
similar income levels (Figure 41). As discussed below, this is primarily due to two factors: (i)
fewer students complete primary school than in other countries, removing them from the pool of
potential secondary students; (ii) among primary school graduates, transition to secondary is lower
(see below). Over the last decade, the government has invested in several programs that aim to
increase access at the secondary level. New modalities catering to rural and indigenous
populations include Telesecundaria and Núcleos Familiares Educativos para el Desarrollo
schools. Both have greatly increased the accessibility of secondary schools in rural areas -
particularly by eliminating the need for teacher specialization in specific subjects - and therefore
reducing the minimum number of teachers required in a school.9 In addition, limited government
scholarship programs have helped some students enroll despite financial constraints.

 For more details on telesecundaria schools see Barahona and Castro-Valverde (2013). They are an
educational innovation of the Ministry of Education, fostering access to basic education in rural areas where
it is not possible to establish regular schools for geographical and economic reasons. It features support for
one teacher, who is the head of educational process in all subjects. It is usually supported by audiovisual
and printed materials. The program was established through an agreement on distance education between
the Ministry of Education of Mexico and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala in 1996.

Guatemala’s school attendance by student age is lower and students generally drop out from
school earlier than in other Central America countries. Although the shape of the distribution
of enrollments is similar to other countries, Guatemala’s enrollment rate of students aged 5-20 is
lower than most other Central America countries at almost every age (Figure 42). Across the
region, pre-school enrollment (age 5) is lower than enrollment in primary education, and then starts
decreasing again in secondary education as children approach their teens. Guatemala has the
lowest enrollment rate of 5 and 6 years-old students and far from universal primary enrollment
(already achieved in Costa Rica). Guatemala’s decline in enrollment begins around age 11, similar
to Nicaragua and Honduras, but much earlier than Panama and even El Salvador, where the
enrollment rate starts decreasing around age 15.

Among those who start secondary education, completion of secondary education is low.
Despite spending a similar number of years in school as peers in the region, Guatemalan students
complete fewer grades due to repetition. Figure 43 reports the percent of 15-19 year olds that
successfully completed 1 through 9 years of schooling (primary and lower secondary). Less than
one-third of students complete upper secondary school. While enrollment by age suggests that half
of the students spend at least 9 years in school, the average 18 year old student has completed only
7 grades. Low secondary enrollment is likely linked with two facts: first, as in Nicaragua, grade
attainment in Guatemala steadily declines throughout primary school due to repetition and
dropout; second, as in Honduras, many students in Guatemala who finish primary school (grade
6) do not transition to secondary school (grade 7), likely due to increased direct costs, increased
opportunity costs, and low quality. The combination of repetition and dropout leads to very low
enrollment levels in Guatemala by the time students reach upper secondary age. In 2011, one-third
of upper-secondary age students in Guatemala were attending primary or lower secondary school,
and only 20% were attending upper secondary (Figure 44).

Finally, tertiary enrollment is the lowest in CA. The country's gross tertiary enrollment of 19%
is the lowest in Central America (Figure 45). Students in Guatemala who complete upper
secondary have a lower rate of transition than in the rest of Central America. Low upper-secondary
enrollment limits the pool of students who could transition to postsecondary and contributes to the

Public schools dominate education supply until secondary level; private schools are critical
to higher education levels. Pre-primary and primary education is almost exclusively in publicly
managed schools. In 2014, pre-primary and primary education public enrollment was 87% and
91% of total enrolment respectively (Figure 47). In contrast, secondary education depends heavily
on non-public schools. In 2014, public secondary schools comprised 56 and 27% of lower and
upper secondary enrollment respectively. Public secondary schools have limited numbers of
available places, forcing students who can afford to pay into private schools or to terminate their
education at the primary level.10 Tertiary enrollment also relies heavily on private institutions,
which serve just over half of all tertiary students. Future increases in the numbers of students in

  Cooperative secondary schools often serve as low-cost alternatives for the poorest families in lower and
upper secondary, some of which receive local public support.

Wealthier households attend private schools, especially at the beginning of the secondary
level. According to the 2014 ENCOVI, wealthier households enroll in private schools at a much
higher rate than poor households. Less than 1% of the poorest quintile of households enroll
students in private primary schools; 29% of students from the wealthiest household quintile are in
private primary schools (Figure 48). Wealthy households can choose between public schools and
high-cost private schools, which often have better facilities and more qualified teachers than public
schools and may have better learning outcomes and completion rates (Ruano, 2003; Marshall,
2010). Poor households often have to choose between public schools and low-cost private schools,
which can have worse outcomes than public schools.

Financial constraints are the most frequently reported main cause of not dropping out of
secondary education. In 2014, 51% of parents of out-of-school lower secondary age children
reported lack of money as the main reason, 10% said that their children had to work (Figure 49).
The low level of public secondary education funding is the likely underlying cause. Countries with
low education spending often pass costs on to households through tuition, class and activity fees,
shifting costs for basic supplies to students, limiting enrollment.11 The second most mentioned
reason for dropping out was lack of interest, but at 18%, this was the lowest in the region (Figure
50). This may be related to the low quality of education, and/or to low perceived returns to
secondary education. In 2011, 19% of the population aged 15-19 years in Guatemala were neither
working nor in school (“Ninis”), above the Latin America average of 14%.12 Many of these youth
cannot afford secondary school and lack economic opportunities. Only 1.5% of secondary students
cited issues of access (distance, full classes, or no such grade offered).

Despite similar physical access to schools, there are stark differences in secondary enrollment
rates across income quintiles, ethnic groups and rural/urban areas. Participation in secondary
education is exceedingly unequal across quintiles, especially in upper secondary education.
However, the barriers to education do not appear to be the result of geography: travel time is similar
in rural and urban areas through lower secondary (Figure 51). In 2014, the gross enrollment ratio
in upper secondary education was 23% for the lowest quintile, increasing steadily with income to
110% for the richest quintile (Figure 52). Secondary enrollment rates also vary substantially
between urban and rural areas, with a gross enrollment rate of 79% in urban areas and only 41%
in rural areas (Figure 53).

Differences in primary enrollment rates are small, gaps emerge at the start of secondary
school. Enrollment rates of urban and rural primary school-age students are similar, but enrollment
in rural areas drops significantly and rapidly at secondary school-age (Figure 54). The pattern is
similar when comparing indigenous and non-indigenous school-age youth (Figure 55).

More girls than boys drop out from school, especially at secondary level and in rural areas.
Girls and boys have similar enrollment rates during primary school age, and begin to diverge as
they approach secondary school age (Figure 56). The gap in education outcomes for girls and boys
is primarily driven by enrollment in rural areas (Figure 57). In 2014, in urban areas, 66% of both
girls and boys had completed seven years of schooling; in rural areas, only 38% of rural girls and
43% of rural boys had completed seven years. Attendance is quite high throughout primary age,
but enrollment declines significantly after age 12 years, mostly related to the sharp drops after the
final year of primary school.

Boys outnumber girls two to one in some rural secondary schools. While the rest of Central
America has achieved near-equal outcomes for boys and girls, a gap persists in Guatemala.
Nationally, girls make up 47% of secondary students overall and 45% in rural areas. However,
there are stark differences by gender in several rural areas. In rural Alta Verapaz, there are twice
as many boys enrolled in secondary school as girls; in rural Huehuetenango, Baja Verapaz, and
Quiché, there are three boys enrolled for every two girls (Figure 58). Given that girls' access to
secondary is primarily a problem in specific areas, targeted actions to improve girls' access in these
areas could be effective. Survey data on the reasons girls dropped out provide no clear answers:
the only notable differences between girls and boys are the “to work” and “needed at home”
reasons for dropping out (Figure 59). Rural Guatemala has some of the highest rates of child
marriage in Latin America: estimates for child marriage in rural Guatemala are as high as 50%.13

Learning outcomes are poor compared to peers in Latin America. In 2006, Guatemala ranked
second to last in third grade reading and math among countries participating in SERCE, and third
to last in sixth grade reading.14 A nationwide picture of poor learning outcomes is also clear from
the results of national assessments. For instance, MINEDUC 2014 evaluation results show that
among students graduating upper secondary education, only one in four achieved the expected
level in reading and only one in ten achieved the expected level in mathematics (MINEDUC,
2015). 15



14
   SERCE (Secondary Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study) and TERCE (Third Regional
Comparative and Explanatory Study) are part of the largest learning achievement study ever implemented
in Latin America and the Caribbean. SERCE was conducted in 2006, and TERCE in 2013. They assess
learning achievement among third and sixth grade students across 16 Latin American countries.

In recent years, Guatemala has significantly improved learning outcomes. Between 2006 and
2013, the recently published TERCE results show improvements in reading and math (Figures 60
and 61). In 3rd grade reading, the country increased from an average score of 447 in 2006 (ranked
twelfth of sixteen in the LAC region) to an average of 495 in 2013, only 15 points below the LAC
regional average. Most likely, these improvements in learning at primary level are at least partly
the result of the expansion in the number of teachers (by almost 50% in primary and even more in
pre-school). It is also possible, since enrollment rates in primary are falling, that some of the
improved performance is the result of dropout of the poorest performers. 16 The positive trend in
learning is not fully supported by trends in recent national student assessments.

      IV. 3     Institutional Arrangements

The regulatory framework for the Education sector is defined by the Constitution, the
National Education Law and the Peace Accords. The Constitution enacted in 1985 states that
Education is an entitlement of every citizen and mandates that education provided by the
Government be free of charge. Education is supposed to be compulsory from primary level (age
7) to completion of lower secondary (age 15). The Constitution requires that the Government offer

   Compared to other countries, Guatemala has a higher proportion of students not attending primary school.
If – as is plausible – their performers is worse than the average, then country performance is higher than it
would be if they had still been in school and taken the test.

special education for students with disabilities, upper secondary education (grades 10 through 12)
and programs for those who have dropped out of school but would like to achieve a formal
education degree. It also mandates that bilingual education be provided in regions with a
predominantly indigenous population.17

The National Education System is regulated by the 1991 National Education Law (Decree
12-91). The National Education System comprises the Ministry of Education (Ministerio de
Educación, MINEDUC), education community (students, parents, educators and organizations
with educational purposes) and all schools (public and private). The Law does not mention higher
education. It recognizes that learning in Guatemala occurs in a multilingual, multiethnic, and
multicultural environment with diverse communities. It defines and regulates different forms of
education, including initial education, special education, bilingual, and physical education. Other
topics covered by this Law include the quality of education, planning and evaluation, supervision,
validity of studies, and the financial regime. However, this Law has never been operationalized by
a by-law, and continues using the 1977 by-law issued for the previous education law, which has
now been superseded. This is one of the biggest legal gaps.18

                    Box 3: The Impact of Extending Compulsory Schooling
In their study of how to prevent secondary-school dropout in Latin America, Almeida et al (2015)
find that longer compulsory schooling is associated with lower dropout rates. Some countries in
LAC have already extended compulsory schooling through upper secondary. Angrist and
Krueger’s (1991) difference-in-difference analysis using US data found that, depending on the
cohort studied, compulsory schooling laws had kept in school an average of 25% (specifically,
between 10% and one third, depending on the cohort) of students who would otherwise have
dropped out. Angrist and Kruger report that extension of compulsory schooling is typically
accompanied by both restrictions on paid work and direct enforcement by truant officers, which
can keep youth in school longer. If government enforcement capacity is weak, or if the government
fails to budget the funds necessary to expand access to upper-secondary schooling, then it is
possible that the policy would have little effect. Other studies in developed countries have also
found positive effects of compulsory schooling: less dropout and improved earnings, health, and
wealth of potential dropouts (Oreopoulos, 2006). Studying variations in laws across states and
municipalities, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) found that longer compulsory schooling
correlated with better educational attainment and less teen pregnancy in the US and Norway.




17
   In Guatemala, 22 Mayan languages, Xinca and Garifuna are spoken. The Constitution makes no reference
to specific languages beyond saying that bilingual education will be provided.
18
    The National Education Law was approved prior to the Peace Accords and the decentralization
framework, and does not include involvement of parents or the rest of the educational community. Another
gap is a regulation that would provide an appropriate legal framework for the development of private
educational institutions, and verify their results (CIEN, 2015).

Rigorous evidence on the effects of compulsory schooling in developing countries is sparse.
Kirdar, Dayioglu, and Koc (2014) apply a regression discontinuity design on data from Turkey,
and find large effects of compulsory schooling on school attainment (reduced dropout), despite
imperfect compliance with the law. Surprisingly, they find that the policy has increased schooling
not only for the years it covers, but also for post-compulsory schooling years. A similar analysis
for Taiwan finds that compulsory junior high school substantially increased years of schooling
(Spohr, 2003). Note that neither of these papers evaluates compulsory upper-secondary schooling,
although the results from the paper on Turkey do show effects on upper-secondary attainment.
Given the expansion of compulsory schooling to upper secondary in many countries, this is clearly
a topic that would benefit from more rigorous evaluations.

The Peace Accords set a series of important targets for total spending, coverage levels, and
literacy rates, which were partially met by 2000. The two most important Peace Accords for
education, signed in 1995 and 1996, respectively are: (i) Identity and Rights of Indigenous People;
and (ii) Socioeconomic Aspects and Agrarian Situation.19 The Accords agreed that between 1995
and 2000, public education spending as a percent of GDP would increase by at least 50% (it
increased 41% from 1.7 to 2.4%); that at least three years of primary schooling be provided to all
7-12 year olds (true for 83% of children in 2001); and that national literacy rates should be at least
70% by 2000 (increased from 63.8 to 70.7% in 2002).

Management of public educational services is fragmented. There is no single institution
overseeing the whole education sector (Figure 62). For secondary level and below, MINEDUC is
responsible for regulating, directing, planning, supervising and evaluating the country's formal and
non-formal education system, including public and private schools. The formal subsystem
comprises the initial, pre-primary, primary and secondary levels, and serves those within the legal
age limits attending school. The out-of-school or parallel non-formal education subsystem targets
those dropping out of the main system.20 The MINEDUC manages, implements and monitors its
out-of-school education programs through the Direction of Out-of-School Education (Dirección
General de Educación Extraescolar or DIGEEX). The National Education Council21 is responsible

19
   The Accords stress the importance of community participation in the educational process, the need for
curricula that integrate the diverse cultures and languages of the country. They also state that education and
training are key factors to achieve equity and international competitiveness.
20
   The non-formal system was originally designed to support those whose education was affected by the
armed conflict. It includes both skills development courses and paths to complete primary and secondary
school equivalents. Distance-learning education is widely used for the latter. Flexibility in the order of
grades, ages and skills enables the learner to develop abilities and skills that respond to their personal, labor,
social, cultural and academic context.

Public and private higher education are regulated by different bodies. Public higher education
is led by the Superior University Council (Consejo Superior Universitario or CSU), which governs
and administers the University of San Carlos of Guatemala (Universidad de San Carlos de
Guatemala or USAC), and is also the advisory council to the President of USAC. The Council of
Private Higher Education (Consejo de Enseñanza Privada Superior or CEPS) regulates private
higher education and is responsible for ensuring an adequate academic level at private universities
and authorizing the creation of new universities.

Other government and non-government actors also offer specific educational programs. The
Ministry of Social Development (Ministerio de Desarrollo Social or MIDES) grants conditional
cash transfers to poor families with children 12 years or older for secondary education ( Mi Beca
Segura) and offers workshops for vulnerable groups. The Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud
Pública y Asistencia Social or MSPAS) provides health related educational services. The National
Literacy Committee (Comité Nacional de Alfabetización or CONALFA) is responsible for
defining and approving the policies and strategies of the national literacy process and also for
implementing the literacy program for youth and adults, in Spanish and other national languages.

The Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (Instituto Técnico de Capacitación y
Productividad or INTECAP) is the leading training institution for technical training. NGOs also
provide a wide variety of educational services. The Education Workers Union of Guatemala
(Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Educación de Guatemala or STEG), is considered the most
representative teachers' union in the country, with over 38 thousand members.

The structure of the formal education system is similar to that of other Latin American
countries (Table 2). Initial education for 0-3 year olds, monolingual (Spanish) pre-primary for 4-
6 year olds, bilingual pre-primary (Mayan languages and Spanish) for 4-6 year olds and accelerated
pre-primary for children 6 or older who have not attended school before.22 Pre-primary is not a
requirement for enrolling in primary school, which is mandatory. Primary education is directed to
7-12 year olds and has two cycles: basic primary (grades 1 to 3) and complementary primary
(grades 4 to 6). Secondary education is directed to 13-18 year olds who have completed six grades
of primary school and has two cycles: basic lower secondary (grade 7 to 9) and upper secondary
(grade 10 to 11-12, depending on the career that is chosen by the student23). University education
is open to students who have completed secondary education. Universities generally offer technical
programs of 3 years and 4/5-year bachelor’s degrees or “licenciaturas” (architecture, law,
medicine, psychology, and engineering, among others).




22
   Accelerated pre-primary began in 1994 as an alternative for children 6 and older who had not attended
school before, usually children from poorer communities, and is taught in 35 days.
23
   The most common upper secondary level tracks are: accounting, science and letters, education,
computing, secretarial studies or business administration. These teach basic technical skills which enable
students to work after graduating. In order to obtain a degree in these fields, students must continue their
studies at University.

Over the last five years, MINEDUC has made progress in strengthening monitoring and
evaluation of student learning, implementing and promoting national and regional student
assessments. The country has solid data sources compared to peer countries, but could build
stronger school level data for enhanced decision-making processes. Currently, MINEDUC
conducts annual standardized tests in reading and mathematics for students graduating upper
secondary education (grades 11 and 12). MINEDUC also evaluates other grades of primary and
secondary levels (grades 1, 3, 6, 9), but not annually.24 Test results are publically available on
MINEDUC’s web page by year, grade, area (urban/rural) and gender. Additionally, MINEDUC

24
   Standardized student assessments are carried out by DIGEDUCA with different periodicity for different
grades. Between 2006 and 2014, DIGEDUCA evaluated students graduating from the 11th and 12th grades,
with an annual national exam. The 9th grade was evaluated every two or three years, the least evaluated
grade in this period. For 1st, 3rd and 6th grades, national exams were carried out every year or two. Since
2006, these grades have been evaluated every year except 2011 and 2012 (in 2007 only 3rd and 6th grades
were evaluated). Assessments at 9th and 12th grades test all enrolled students. Evaluations of primary levels
use a stratified random sample (representative at the municipal level). Evaluations of 9th graders and
graduating students assess abilities and life skills in math and reading. When DIGEDUCA started testing
at these levels, the Base National Curriculum Base (Currículo Nacional Base or CNB) for these grades did
not exist, so evaluations are based on the minimum skills needed by young people to enter the workforce.
Assessments at primary level evaluate the contents, skills and standards established by the CNB in Math,
Communication, and Reading. In the years ahead, (2016-2024) MINEDUC plans to test a sample of
students every year for 1st grade; every two years for 3rd grade, and to rotate between sampling and census
tests every two years for 6th grade. It also plans to continue census tests for 9th grade and graduating
students every 3 and 1 years (Ministry of Education, 2014). However, actual testing periods may vary
depending on budget.

participated in regional assessments at primary and secondary levels in 2006 for SERCE, 2009 for
ICCS and 2013 for TERCE (UNESCO, 2015).25 Currently the MINEDUC is building the technical
and administrative conditions for Guatemala to participate in the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA), which evaluates education systems worldwide by testing the skills and
knowledge of 15-year-old students. Guatemala will join the PISA for Development26 designed for
countries with low per capita incomes. The first results of this evaluation will be available in
December of 2018 and will allow the country to identify its strengths and weaknesses. The
Ministry of Education also produces good quality school cards (ficha escolar), which provide a
snapshot of every school and allow easy dissemination of the information to civil society and local
communities.27 The school card student level information includes gender, drop-out rates and
existence of mono or bilingual education. However, information regarding the quality of the school
itself is generally missing and could be collected by a systematic school census.28 This would allow
a better assessment of each school’s needs.

The professional in-service teacher training program is a step in the right direction towards
creating a culture of continual teacher improvement; but evaluation, sustained funding, and
incentives are lacking. The PADEP/D program aims at upgrading the skills of the teacher corps
in Guatemala, from pre-primary to upper secondary levels.29 One of the key elements that allowed
the program to reach teachers from the poorest communities was that it offered the training at
municipal level, in the communities where teachers work and live, lowering participation costs.
From 2009 to 2014, roughly 11,000 pre-primary and primary teachers graduated from this program

25
   At the primary level Guatemala participated in the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the
Quality of Education (LLECE), which coordinated SERCE (Segundo Estudio Regional Comparativo y
Explicativo) and TERCE (Tercer Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo), and at the secondary level,
in the International Assessment of Civic education and Values (Estudio Internacional de Educación Cívica
y Valores or ICCS) in 2009.
26
   The countries that have signed a participation agreement with the OECD to participate in PISA for
Development are: Guatemala, Ecuador, Senegal, Zambia, Cambodia and Paraguay.
27
   The school card (ficha escolar) is available on the Ministry of Education website, which displays general
data on each of the country's schools. The data available on the card are: school name, address, whether or
not it has a School Board, number of students per grade and gender, number of promoted and not promoted
students, retention, drop-out, repetition, mono- or bilingual education, special education, languages used at
each school, name of director, supervisor and supervisor, contact information, budget allocation, and
standardized tests. Data can be displayed by year, population, gross enrollment, net enrollment by level, by
grade, and at the national, departmental and municipal levels. School card data can be viewed at school
level, contributing to enhanced local social audit. See http://estadistica.mineduc.gob.gt/fichaescolar/ and

   Honduras is a good example. They recently implemented a National School Infrastructure Plan: Plan
Maestro de Infraestructura Educativa”, based on a school infrastructure census that gathered information
on the specific needs of each school in terms of quality and quantity. This could be used as an example for
developing an equivalent instrument in Guatemala.
29
   In 2012 three years of university studies were added to initial teacher training, which used to be done at
the upper secondary level.

(10% of 108,000 pre-primary and primary level teachers hired by the MINEDUC in 2014)30, which
helped increase the credibility of the program. By the end of 2015, 10,000 more teachers had
graduated. The PADEP/D was the subject of three program evaluations corresponding to different
cohorts of participants:31 these evaluations found demonstrated improvement of pedagogical
ability of pre-primary and primary level teachers. In order to graduate, teachers must show
evidence of class management practices where they apply knowledge learned from different
modules. Additional evaluations of the third and fourth cohort will focus on the program’s effects
on student learning.32 This will shed more light on quality issues. The program lasts four semesters
and is financed through a per capita allocation, ranging from USD535 in 2009 to USD605 in 2014
per teacher per semester.

The long term sustainability of the professional in-service teacher training program requires
financial planning and closer linkages with career progression. While PADEP/D can serve as
a starting point to integrate ongoing and systematic teacher professional development, it will
require a substantial allocation of funds. In addition, teachers need incentives to take part in
professional development. Currently, professional development is not linked to teacher
evaluations, career path or salary increases.33 However, as more teachers obtain the certification,
there will be greater pressure for the MINEDUC to raise wages.




30
   In 2014 the MINEDUC also hired 22,000 secondary level teachers, and private schools hired 27,000 -
primary and primary level teachers.
31
   These evaluations conclude that among the achievements are: 1) teachers have a viable and credible
option to study at the university level; 2) dialogue with the teachers union regarding continuous teacher
training in valuable; 3) there has been a positive change in the attitude of teachers, who are now more
willing to continue their studies and motivated to participate actively within their communities; and 4)
diversity is better integrated in the classroom. They also note room for improvement, with the following
challenges: 1) accelerated implementation resulted in low quality planning in some instances; 2) difficulties
arising from massive coverage of the program - such as inadequate facilities: the program uses primary
school facilities and desks which are not intended to be used by adults; 3) more depth is needed in classes
for bilingual teachers, which did not always meet the expectations of teachers who work within indigenous
communities; 4) increase the time for in-class observation of students by reducing the number of students
per class; 5) improve the evaluation of trainers.
32
   The evaluations of the first and second cohort (2011 to 2012) aimed to measure achievement of the
objectives of the in-service teacher-training program (not the teachers). They used quantitative methods on
a sample of 2,657 students, 149 teachers and 46 pedagogical advisers, and qualitative methods in 10 focus
groups and 4 case studies. The second study had less depth as it came so soon after the first report. The
evaluation of the third and fourth cohort aims to assess the teaching competencies of PADEP teachers. This
evaluation began in 2014/15. The Ministry will conduct classroom observations and film classes, evaluate
teacher portfolios, assess student notebooks, and include peer review (from other teachers), assessment by
director of the school, and teacher self-assessment.
33
   Past wage increases have not been linked to performance, but were reached through collective agreements
with teachers with permanent positions (the latest increase was 12% in 2015).

Past administrations focused on teacher training; future gains in teacher quality could come
from better recruitment, compensation and teacher evaluation processes. The current teacher
selection process does not ensure that the best and most motivated teachers are hired (CIEN 2015).
Under legislation passed in 2013, selection of permanent pre-primary and primary teachers is
based on five criteria and done through a competitive examination. However, only one of the five
selection criteria relates to applicants’ competencies and skills, and makes up only 15% of the total
score.34 Results from the application exams clearly show the low quality of the potential teaching
candidates. When a teaching post opens, the job is offered to the candidate with the best results at
the municipal level from a waiting list of teachers who previously applied for a job in the
municipality. Candidates from neighboring municipalities are not considered, despite being more
qualified in many cases. Teacher compensation has three components: the base salary, an increase
depending on pay scale category and bonuses (bilingual teacher bonus when it applies). Currently,
compensation is linked to time in service, but not directly linked to teacher performance reviews
or other meritocratic criteria.35 Although in theory promotion can be informed by performance,
teachers generally receive pay promotions automatically every four years (Figure 63).36 Current
legislation includes an evaluation of teaching service, however performance assessments and not
done regularly and do not directly impact teachers’ career development.




34
   The five criteria are: (1) length in service; (2) residence; (3) academic merit and credentials; (4) merits in
the teaching service and community outreach; (5) quality of service. The latter takes into account a
diagnostic test that evaluates teachers’ knowledge in language, mathematics and teaching skills. The 2014
results of the diagnostic tests show that on average, teachers who took the test passed only half of the
language and teaching strategy questions. On average only one third of mathematics questions were
answered correctly. This reflects the low quality of potential candidates.
35
   Decree 1485 of the Congress of Guatemala states that basic teacher salaries shall be determined annually
by the Government. This Decree also determines the pay scale applied to teachers, defining six salary
categories (A to F), rising in 25% increments. Category A, for new teachers, is the base salary and category
F is the base salary plus an increase of 125% over the base. Every four years, teachers move up one category.
The increase is supposed to be conditional on time in-service, quality of work and academic achievement.
In practice, school directors certify that most teachers meet the criteria to scale-up every four years. Every
year 27-30 thousand teachers rise a category). In 2015, total monthly salaries in category A (base salary)
ranged from Q524-Q3,143 equivalent to USD68-USD408, depending on the type of teacher post (teacher
for 5 periods, physical education teacher, specialized teacher, director). Total monthly salaries of teachers
in category F ranged from USD153-USD918. Pay is not affected by teachers’ years of schooling.
36
   This is not necessarily inconsistent with the compressed teacher wage curve vis-a-vis other professions
shown in figure 33. The decree establishing regular teacher pay promotions is recent. Most importantly, the
resulting salary changes are most likely still much smaller than those seen by professionals in the private
sector. For example, making double the initial pay after 20 years of service (for someone who starts working
reasonably young and without completing higher education) is still a much smaller increase than in private
sector occupations with similar skill levels.

The budget of the MINEDUC is constrained by delayed release of General Budget funds,
affecting timely staff payments and timely and quality implementation of programs. There
are generally delays in the public sector budget approval, regularly affecting the release of
education funds. Even when the budget is approved in a timely manner, funds are not officially
released until late February or March the following year, resulting in significant and frequent
payment delays for contracts and salaries of non-permanent staff (World Bank, 2013). This has
large operational implications for the MINEDUC, deterring contract competition and reducing the
attractiveness of the teaching profession. Only educational staff with regular (permanent) positions
are paid in a timely manner. Budget dynamics paralyze non-wage bill-based interventions and
contract-based staff payments, despite the availability of funding from external donors. In addition,
the Ministry of Public Finances adds further constraints on the use of funds in designated accounts
of MINEDUC: no replenishments are authorized until 50% or more of the funds have been used.

Having only one public university in the country creates a bottleneck in access to tertiary
education and constrains the equity of the system. The Constitution names the USAC as the
only public university, and does not consider the possibility of other public universities. It grants
sole leadership and development of the Government’s higher education system, and sole authority
to grant recognition to graduates from foreign universities. USAC accounts for around 60% of the
almost 294,000 students in higher education; 14 private universities account for the rest. Students
at private universities pay monthly fees of USD50-USD700; USAC charges a yearly fee of
USD13. Having only one public higher education institute limits access to free higher education,
especially for low-income students who cannot afford fees charged by private universities.

Allowing additional public universities could benefit students who currently lack access to higher
education.37 This would require strong political will, legislative changes and a budget adjustment.

Finally, further development of the information systems is needed to strengthen monitoring
and evaluation of MINEDUC’s programs and for better decision making at all levels . The
information system should integrate periodic data from national and international student
assessments and teacher evaluations in order to monitor the quality of the education system in a
more integral way. MINEDUC produces high quality evaluation documents through DIGEDUCA,
but often they are donor-driven and funded. These more profound analyses of specific programs
are a necessary tool for decision making. More systematic funding must be allocated to enable the
production of evaluation documents to be institutionalized. Also, it will be important to strengthen
the monitoring capacity of MINEDUC at local levels, not just at the central level. Information
systems need to enable real-time dissemination of information to different stakeholders and
decision-makers. Results could then be used to guide policy making, to reward schools with the
best learning achievements (after controlling for the socio-economic background of students) or
to strengthen teacher incentive programs. Better information systems will increase transparency in
the use of public funds and foster accountability.


V.         Performance and Challenges in Health

     V.1        Recent Evolution of Health Public Spending

Between 2007 and 2014, Guatemala’s total public spending on health increased but per
capita spending remained almost constant in real terms. Total public spending in 2007 constant
local prices increased by 50% from 2007 to 2014 (Figure 64). However, per capita public spending
on health in constant 2007 dollars remained almost constant, fluctuating around an average of
$116, alternating with Honduras and Nicaragua in having the lowest real per capita public spending
on health in CA (Figure 65).




37
   There are different ways to increase the supply of higher education, such as authorizing the operation of
two or more public universities, or public-private partnerships, and/or offering scholarships to students and
allowing them to choose the university they prefer.

Guatemala’s public spending on health as a share of GDP also increased during this period
but remained lower than CA and LAC averages. Figure 66 shows that from 2007 to 2014,
public spending on health as a share of GDP in Guatemala increased by 22%, from 1.8% to 2.2%.39
Despite the increase, this is the lowest in CA. It is also lower than the LAC average, but higher
than the average for lower middle income countries (Figure 67).

   PPP is purchasing power parity or international dollars; it refers to currencies adjusted across countries
to make the value of purchased goods and services comparable.

   In the Guatemala National Health Accounts (NHA) 2015, public spending on health includes spending
from the National Fund for Peace (Fondo Nacional para la Paz), and shows the percent of public
spending/GDP unchanged at 2.3% in 2007 and 2013, with some fluctuations in the years between. The
NHA used MOF and Central Bank of Guatemala estimates for GDP while this study used IMF data to be
comparable with the results of other CA SSEIR countries.

The private spending share of total health expenditures consistently has been almost double
the public share. Despite the 2008 Government Policy that established that health services in

public facilities are free of charge and the increase in public spending on health, private spending
continues to account for a significantly larger share of total health spending than public spending.
Although the share of private spending decreased from 68% in 2005 to 63% in 2013, it has never
gone lower than its 1995 share of 60%. Figure 68 shows that the private share of total health
spending in Guatemala is higher than the averages for LAC (49%) and CA (42%), and almost
equal to the LMC average (36%).

Insurance coverage is low throughout the country and lowest for the poorest and those who
live in rural areas. Approximately 17% of the population were insured with the Social Security
Institute in 2013 (direct affiliates and their beneficiaries),40 even fewer had access to private
insurance. As a result, as discussed below, estimated household out-of-pocket payments continue
to be a large share of total private expenditures.

Household spending as a share of total health expenditures in Guatemala has decreased but
remains significant. Partly as a result of increased insurance coverage and because of the 2008
Government policy of free access to health services in public health facilities, household out-of-
pocket spending declined as a share of total health expenditures from 55% in 1995 to 52% in 2013,
and decreased as a share of private spending from 92% in 1995 to 83% in 2013. The latter is higher
than the LAC average of 68% but lower than the CA average of 86%.

  Approximately 8 percent of the population are direct affiliates; their spouses and children under 7 years
of age comprise the rest of the beneficiaries.

Two main public institutions (the Ministry of Health and the Social Security Institute, IGSS)
provide most health services in the country.41 The MOH offers care to the entire population
although estimated coverage rates vary - depending on the source - from approximately 50% to
82%.42 The IGSS, the second largest provider, caters to its affiliates and their families, reaching
16 to 18%43 of the population. The third provider of health public services, the Military, covers
only about 0.5% of the population, providing care to its employees, the national police force and
their families, and retired officials. The private sector includes for-profit and non-profit service
providers. The MOH estimates that the private sector provided 34% of services in 2012. This is
close to the ENCOVI 2011 estimate of 33% for consultations in private clinics and private
hospitals but more than the ENCOVI 2014 estimate of 26% (Figure 69).

The poor tend to use public services the most. Eighty-five percent of the lowest consumption
quintile households used public health facilities, with 51% of them consulting with public primary
care facilities (health post, health center, or community center supported by the Extension of
Coverage Program or PEC). On the other hand, only 43% of the high income households used
public facilities with a much smaller percentage (13%) consulting with a public primary care
facility (Figure 70).

   The public sector includes the MOH, IGSS, Ministry of Defense through its Department of Military
Health (DMH), and Ministry of Governance, which manages the National Police Hospital (NPH).

   Estimates range from 50% (MOH 2012) to 72% (Berkil 2011) to 82% (MOH/CNE 2007)

   Direct affiliates with IGSS account for 8% of the population but the number of affiliates plus their
beneficiaries is close to 18% (Berkil n.d.), MOH 2012 puts the figure at 15%.

While IGSS has much lower coverage than the MOH, its real per capita spending was almost
five times the MOH per capita spending from 2007-2013. Although MOH per capita spending
increased by 20% from 2007 to 2013 compared to 17% for IGSS during the same period, IGSS
per capita spending was consistently far higher than that of the MOH (Figure 71). The NHA 2013
indicates that the MOH real per capita spending was only 21% of IGSS real per capita spending in
2011 and 22% in 2013. IGSS covers only a fourth to a fifth of the population covered by the MOH.

Salaries account for the largest share of public spending followed by medicines. The MOH
faces difficulties in meeting its financial obligations, resulting in payment delays. In 2013,
approximately 40% of total public spending on health was for salaries and 25% was for medicines
(NHA2015). The Ministry of Health spent 56% of its total budget on personnel (salaries and
benefits) and 13% on medicines. In 2014, the MOH allocated a larger share of its budget for
personnel (60%) with no change in the budget share for medicines (MOH 2015). The increased
budget share for personnel was because MOH signed a Collective Pact with unions in 2013 which
included (a) conversion of almost 20,000 contractual positions to permanent positions, and (b)
increases in benefits and per diems. The estimated additional cost of the collective Pact Agreement

is about Q1.35 million per year. However, the MOH’s budgets for 2014 and 2015 increased by
significantly less. As a result, the MOH has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments to
health staff, and payment delays of 3-6 months have been reported.44 Funding delays have also
resulted in shortages of medicines in several facilities.

Hospitals accounted for the largest share of public spending for health programs from 2007
to 2013. Public spending on primary care/ambulatory services increased and the public
spending share for public health services decreased. The share of public spending allocated to
hospitals increased from 44.6% in 2007 to 45.3% in 2013. This is lower than both the CA average
of approximately 48%45 and the average for middle income countries of 52.5%.46 There are
frequent reports of hospital shortages of drugs and medical supplies, partly the result of insufficient
funds allocated to hospitals and partly due to mismanagement of resources – the latter will be
discussed in the following sections. The “unclassified” spending share decreased by almost 3
percentage points, and the share spent on ambulatory care increased almost four percentage points,
which could be because of the emphasis on maternal and child care especially after 2012 when the
Zero Hunger Program – one of the Government’s flagship programs – was launched. The share
of spending on public health services decreased by 1 percent from 22.4 to 21.5%. These
expenditure share patterns (Figure 72) are supported by the NHA 2015 data which show public
spending on hospitals increasing from 41.5% in 2007 to 42.2% in 2013 and the share of spending
on public health decreasing, although the NHA reports much smaller public health spending
shares: 5.4% in 2007 and 3.8% in 2013.

There is a consensus that the Government’s health sector budget should increase, and that
efficiency of public spending on health should improve. Applying the Public Social Spending

mortality, chronic malnutrition, and child measles immunization coverage outcomes by 14% with
the same amount of spending (Figure 73).

Lack of coordination among key institutions and across levels of care, insufficient results-
oriented planning and budgeting, and weak enforcement of accountability mechanisms have
contributed to the inefficient use of resources and sub-optimal results. At the national level,
various ministries and other institutions tend to work in and target the same areas with limited
coordination, resulting in duplication of efforts and wasted resources. Within the health sector
itself, separate fragmented health service delivery sub-systems managed by the MOH, IGSS and
the Military and Police exist. This limits the ability of the sector to benefit from lower prices
through economies of scale in procurement of medicines and other medical inputs. Moreover,
insufficient coordination among the three levels of care, particularly the weak system of referrals
and counter-referrals, results in hospitals providing care to patients who could be handled at the
first or secondary levels of care. Public financial resources in Guatemala have been allocated
mainly using historical budgeting, with slight increases for inflation. Reporting mechanisms tend
to focus more on inputs and costs, rather than outputs and results. Finally, weak enforcement of
accountability mechanisms in the health sector contribute to the misuse of already limited sector
resources. There are frequent reports of inappropriate use of funds, questionable contract awards,
and leakages. Government efforts to address these issues are discussed in the institutional section.

      V.2 Performance of Health Indicators

Despite service delivery challenges resulting from budget limitations and staffing shortages,
Guatemala has improved its health outcomes. Life expectancy increased from 62 years in 1990
to 72 years in 2013. The under-five mortality rate declined from 81 per 1,000 live births in 1990
to 31 in 2013 (Figure 74), and infant mortality rates decreased from 60 to 26 per 1,000 live births.47
During the same period, TB incidence decreased from 75 in 1990 to 60 per 100,000 in 2013.
Guatemala also reached its MDG goal for reducing underweight prevalence (Figure 75). Anemia
among women in the 15-49 year age group - which increases risks during child birth - decreased
from 22.1% in 2002 to 10.6% in 2014/15. Anemia in children under five decreased from 40% in
2002 to 25% in 2014.48

Significant challenges remain, however, with regard to reducing maternal mortality, and
especially childhood chronic malnutrition which presents a serious development issue.
Guatemala’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) declined to 93 per 100,000 live births in 2014, but
is still far from the MDG goal of 51 (Figure 76).49 It remains among the highest in the LAC
region which averaged 73 per 100,000 live births in 2014. Similarly, although chronic

47
   In 2013, Guatemala’s life expectancy was lower than the LAC average of 74.7 years and its under-five
mortality and infant mortality rates were higher than the LAC averages of 18 per 1,000 live births and 16
per 1000 live births, respectively (WDI 2015).

and Nutrition Survey (ENSMI) 2008/09.
49
   The 2014/15 National Maternal-Infant Health and Nutrition Survey also noted that 20 percent of the
women aged 15 to 19 years interviewed already had children or were pregnant. The percentage of
adolescents who were pregnant or already had a child/children was higher in rural areas (24 percent) than
urban areas (16 percent).

malnutrition in young children decreased from 55% in 1995 to 46.5% in 2014/15, it remains one
of the highest in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region and in the world, surpassing
stunting rates even of countries with significantly lower per capita incomes such as Bangladesh,
Ethiopia, and Haiti (Figure 77). Anemia also is high among young children – one out of four
young Guatemalan children is anemic – with serious implications for cognitive development.
Evidence indicates that catch-up growth is difficult after the age of two because the damage to
physical growth and brain development can be extensive and largely irreversible.50

complications, and iron deficiency anemia are among the ten leading causes of disability adjusted
life years (DALYs) in Guatemala, diabetes, ischemic heart disease and cirrhosis had some of the
biggest increases in DALYs51 between 1990 and 2010.52 NCDs cause as many as three out of every
five deaths in the country and about one in every two DALYs lost.53

Inequalities in health outcomes and access to health services also persist. Indigenous women
account for 73% of all maternal deaths in Guatemala, and are twice as likely to deliver a baby
without the assistance of a doctor as nonindigenous women. Almost 84% of urban women have
skilled assistance for deliveries compared to only 55% of rural women.54 Sixty-one percent of
indigenous children are stunted compared to 34.5% of nonindigenous children. In addition, use of
preventive consultations is higher among rich than poor people. Disparities also exist in access to
health service providers, with the rich being more likely to use IGSS facilities and private clinics
(Figure 78).

Of those who reported that they were sick, significantly fewer poor people than rich sought
care when ill. Only 36% of people who reported being ill sought care, this was 33% in the lowest
income quintile compared to 61% in the highest income quintile. Similar to other countries, a
larger percentage of the poorest quintile use public facilities (28%) than private facilities (5%).

Lack of funds and minor illness are the major reasons for not seeking care among the poorest
quintile and rural residents. Figure 80 shows that lack of money and minor illness were the main
reasons for not seeking care cited by the poorest quintile (40% each) and rural dwellers (39%
each). On the other hand, minor illness was the major reason for not seeking care for the highest
income quintile (58%), both indigenous (42%) and non-indigenous peoples (45%), and urban
residents (50%).

   V.3 Institutional Arrangements

In addition to the three main government health providers, Guatemala has a large private
sector. Figure 81 shows the institutions involved in the provision and financing of health services
in Guatemala. In 2014, the public sector operated 1,612 health facilities of which 1,531 were under
the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MOH) and 81 were under the Guatemalan
Social Security Institute (IGSS). IGSS also contracted private health care services to attend to its
affiliates and their beneficiaries. While no recent data are available for the private sector, in 2012,
the MOH estimated that there were 6,963 private for-profit health facilities (MOH 2012b).

There is a general consensus that the health system is fragmented and that public and private
entities tend to operate in an uncoordinated manner, partly as a result of lack of systematic
sector oversight by the National Health Council. Coordination across types of providers has
been limited, even though the National Health Council (NHC), which is headed by the Minister of
Health and includes public and private institutions,55 is supposed to play a coordinating role in
sector activities. Established in 1997, the NCH did not meet regularly until January 2014. Since
then it has met more systematically to discuss ministerial initiatives and review certain programs
and documents. The agenda and conclusions of NCH meetings are not available to the public.

Resource constraints, and a lack of consistent, systematic procedures, limit the extent to
which the MOH can effectively coordinate the sector and perform its stewardship function.
Existing health sector norms and the regulatory framework comprising the Constitution, Health
Code, and MOH Organic Law, are considered generally adequate to facilitate sector governance.
For example, the law requires IGSS to coordinate closely with the MOH and the private sector and
to abide by MOH rules and norms. However, the MOH’s resources and institutional capacity to
coordinate the sector and to systematically monitor compliance are limited, and the MOH exercises
limited authority over other public sector entities providing care (IGSS, DMH and NPH). With
regards to the private sector, given its capacity and resource constraints, the MOH has focused
mainly on issuing operating licenses. As a result, aside from public-private contracting
arrangements, public and private health providers are generally not coordinated, and tend to
operate in their own environment and to serve a socio-economically distinct segment of the
population. There were contracting arrangements between the private sector (NGOs) and the MOH
under the Extension of Coverage Program (PEC) from 1997 to 2014 for NGO mobile teams to
provide basic essential health and nutrition services to areas without a MOH facility. The public
sector – especially IGSS – also purchases advanced diagnostic services from the for-profit sector.

Weak coordination also exists among the three levels of care under the MOH although there
are some recent promising efforts to address this. In order to improve the coordination among
primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care and also to minimize congestion in hospitals, the
MOH initiated a pilot in Guatemala City in 2013. The pilot implemented an integrated service
delivery system that strengthened the capacity of health centers with equipment and a rotation
program in which resident physicians work in the centers. Based on the favorable results reported
in 2014 -- increased medical care provided in health centers and a 20% decline on average in
external consultations in the two reference hospitals -- the MOH expanded the system into two
other departments (San Marcos and Heuheutenango). In 2015, the MOH decided to adopt a more
systematic approach toward expanding implementation of micro-networks, using a common

framework for situation analysis of service delivery gaps, and an implementation and monitoring
and evaluation plan that could be adopted by each area. The MOH is currently (2016) piloting this
systematized approach in three departments (Quiche, Solola, and Totonicapan).

There has been mixed progress in implementing the MOH 2014-19 strategy for moving
toward universal health coverage with the MOH as health sector steward. The MOH’s 2014-
19 strategy has 7 pillars: (i) strengthening the three levels of care and integrating the service
delivery network; (ii) reforming the health sector regulatory framework; (iii) training, development
of human resources, and research; (iv) governance; (v) regionalizing technical and financial
management; (vi) strengthening access to safe water and sanitation; and (vii) quality assurance.
Progress in implementing the strategy has been mixed. On one hand, various training and capacity
building of staff has taken place to strengthen service delivery and monitoring (for example, all
MOH staff were trained on the correct use of the information system in 2014); and implementation
of integrated service networks has expanded from Guatemala City to selected areas in four other
departments: Sololá, Huehuetenango, Quiche, San Marcos. Part of establishing these networks
includes reviewing the service delivery gaps in the areas with a view to addressing them
progressively. To improve the quality of services, the MOH also established a Quality Unit. The
Unit was absorbed recently by the Logistics Unit which has been tasked with creating an
Information and Logistics Administration Module that needs to be integrated with the Health
Management Information System (SIGSA). The MOH also has implemented results-based
budgeting (RBB), starting with activities related to maternal and child health and nutrition, based
on its agreement with the MOF under the Zero Hunger Program. The MOH had planned to expand
RBB to all Health District municipalities and hospitals based on cost centers by 2015 but was
unable to achieve this goal. Some work has advanced in the area of cost centers, and improvements
have been made on information systems and the reporting of results related to the MOH-MOF
agreements, but progress has been less than planned (as discussed below).

Efforts to improve the results orientation of resource allocation within the MOH are
promising but continue to be hindered by funding delays and constrained institutional
capacity. Until 2012, public financial resources were distributed mainly based on historical
budgeting, with a slight increase for inflation. In the health sector in particular, regional allocations
were based on staffing, number of beds, and number of health establishments, unintentionally
penalizing underserved regions. In 2012, the MOH was the first ministry to agree to sign a results-
based budgeting (RBB) agreement with the MOF. The MOH-MOF RBB agreement was focused
on improving maternal and child health and nutrition, prioritizing the first 1000 days of life and
the 166 municipalities with the lowest nutritional status. The RBB approach is seen as an important
step toward enhancing the results-orientation of planning and budgeting, and improving
accountability. In practice, however, results have been mixed. Some indicators have improved:
for example, chronic malnutrition decreased from 60.1% in 2012 to 58.4% in 2013 and
underweight decreased from 17.4% in 2012 to 16.4% in 2013 for children under five; but chronic
malnutrition increased in children under 1 year old (from 32.2% to 33.7 for children aged 3 to 5

                                                   79

months, and from 39% to 43.4% for children aged 6 to 11 months).56 Several targets have not been
met by a large margin (for example, the MOH’s 2015 report notes that only 38% of children
younger than 1 year had all the vaccinations recommended for their age, and only 31% of pregnant
women received timely prenatal care as of September 201457). Although budgets for child and
maternal health and nutrition increased 41.6% in 2013 and remained unchanged in 2014, delays of
several months in the release of funds have made it challenging to implement timely interventions
and hold health sector personnel accountable for results. Other factors that likely contributed to
the mixed results are: the cancellation of the PEC without an immediate service delivery
alternative; shortages of medicines and other key inputs; issues with the quality of counseling by
health staff in health posts and community centers;58 and institutional capacity constraints at
central and local levels. The latest review of the Zero Hunger Program also indicates that too many
areas (municipalities), institutions, and interventions (at least 100) were involved. The review
recommends focusing on selected areas, key institutions, and a much smaller set of interventions
that have proven to be cost-effective in delivering nutrition and maternal and child health results.59

Inadequate internal control systems and weak enforcement of accountability mechanisms in
the health sector have also resulted in the misuse of sector resources. Reports of inappropriate
use of funds, questionable contract awards and leakages in the sector are frequent. For example,
in 2014, a former Minister of Health was accused of approving 17 of 21 refurbishment/
rehabilitation contracts worth Q12.4 million (USD1.6 million) during the State of Emergency that
did not meet minimum legal requirements.60,61 In the same year, there were reports of drug losses
worth more than Q170 million (USD21.9 million) in the Health Area of Santa Cruz in the
Department of Quiche and Q1.5 million (USD193,700) in the Roosevelt Hospital.62 In early 2015,
investigations found at least 18 ghost positions in the MOH with monthly salaries of Q18,000-
20,000, mostly for legal advisers. Since August 2014, at least 22 workers have been reported to
have stolen medicines, and there have been alleged “small thefts” of medical supplies and surgical
inputs in various hospitals throughout country.63 The recent incarceration of the former IGSS
Board for awarding a contract worth Q166 million (USD21.4 million) to a firm that provided
equipment and medicines that did not meet technical requirements is a positive step in enforcing
accountability in the sector, although there are reported cases where justice has not been enforced.

Source: MOH. NHA. 2015; *MOH’s secondary level facilities also include 7 Integrated Maternal
and Child Health Centers, 8 Maternity Clinics, 2 Minimum Emergency Centers; and 20 Centers
of Ambulatory Care but data were insufficient to include them in the trend analysis.

Although the number of MOH health facilities has increased, significant coverage gaps
persist which the Government intends to fill progressively, partly through its new primary
health care strategy. The number of MOH facilities increased by almost 45% since 1990 and by
7% since 2006 (Table 3).64 However, by MOH facility to population standards, the number of
health posts in 2013 only covered a fifth of Guatemala’s population (put another way, they would
have been sufficient for the country’s 1950 population). Similarly, in 2013, there were enough
secondary level care health centers (A and B) to cover only 25% of the population. Including the
other secondary level facilities (7 Integrated Maternal Child Health Centers (CAIMI) which offer
surgical services, 20 Centers of Ambulatory Care, 8 Maternity Clinics, and 2 Minimum Urgent
Care Centers) results in a marginal increase in the secondary level coverage rate. Until 2014,
approximately 4.5 million Guatemalans living in poor and remote areas only had access to monthly
health and nutrition services provided by mobile teams of NGOs contracted under the MOH’s
Coverage Extension Program (PEC). The MOH discontinued the contracts of several NGOs in
mid-2014, leaving an estimated 2.3 million Guatemalans without access to basic services, and then
eliminated the PEC without a transition plan in February 2015, leaving an estimated 4.5 million
people without any access to primary care. In April 2015 the MOH presented its new primary
health care strategy that aims to provide a more holistic package of services using a life cycle
approach, rather than being primarily maternal and child health focused. The MOH has prioritized
implementation of these services by health institutional teams (Equipos Institucionales en Salud
or EIS) of MOH staff in the areas previously covered by NGO mobile teams contracted by the

MOH under the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC). As of end June 2015, the estimated
coverage of this new approach was 7.9 million people or 46.3% of the population.65 The latest
available estimates indicate that, compared to other countries in Central America, Guatemala has
the largest coverage gap for basic health services (almost 50%), followed by Honduras (18%). In
order to address its service gap issue, in 2016 the MOH prepared a strategy to strengthen primary
health care which it recently presented to the President for his support.

The quality of health services in the public sector also remains a concern. The overall physical
condition of health facilities, lack of qualified personnel, medicines, and other inputs are often
cited as major issues in public sector health facilities in Guatemala.66 Although user surveys show
that satisfaction rates with public hospitals in Guatemala increased from 40% in 2007 to 46% in
2011, Guatemala has the lowest satisfaction rate in Central America (Figure 82). It is the only
country in CA where most people surveyed were not satisfied with the way public hospitals work.
Significant shortages of medicines and surgical inputs in major hospitals especially the Roosevelt
and San Juan de Dios –both in Guatemala City– have been reported frequently. In June 2015, for
example, the country’s Human Rights Prosecutor alerted the Government that nine public
hospitals67 faced the risk of temporary closure because of insufficient medicines, financial
resources and staff. A large percentage of hospitals report overcrowding. In particular, 6 hospitals
(Sayaxche, Coban, Salama, Puerto Barrios Amistad, Nebaj, and Salud Mental) had bed occupancy
rates (BORs) above 100% in 2014, and 10 hospitals had BORs between 90 -100%. 68

Insufficient health personnel is a critical factor affecting the quality of health services.
Guatemala has the lowest health personnel to population ratio in CA: 12.5 per 10,000 inhabitants
(Figure 83), half the WHO guideline. Guatemala’s urban health personnel to population ratio is
almost ten times the rural ratio: 25.7 compared to only 2.96 per 10,000 inhabitants.

A disproportionate number of public health personnel work in Guatemala City compared to
other parts of the country. Guatemala City has a disproportionate share of health personnel (41%,
compared to its 29% share of the country’s population); other departments have significantly fewer
staff (Figure 84). In particular, Guatemala City has 55% of physicians, 52% of professional nurses,
and 68% of dentists. Only for auxiliary nurses does Guatemala City’s share roughly equal its
population share (Figure 85).

In order to address the human resource gaps in rural areas, the MOH is taking steps to
recruit and train staff from those areas, and also to use telemedicine. There is one doctor and
less than one professional nurse for every 1000 Guatemalans, and even lower ratios in most
departments. Gender is also an issue: some women expressed embarrassment at the thought of
being attended to by a male doctor.69 The MOH has been hiring and training local women who
speak the local language to become auxiliary nurses. It also established a National Policy in 2015
(Government Agreement 102-2015) for midwives that aims to recognize and disseminate their
knowledge and improve their links with the health system as agents of change; and established a
training program for midwives with two universities. The MOH is also piloting the use of
telemedicine so that health workers can monitor vital signs of patients in rural and remote areas
from a distance.

In order to attract and retain staff, the MOH has taken steps to improve job security,
benefits, and per diems, although insufficient funds and delays in payments have made it
difficult to implement the changes. The MOH signed a collective pact with unions in 2013 to
convert approximately 20,000 contractual positions to permanent jobs and to increase benefits and
per diems. This was considered a welcome move because almost 50% of health workers had
temporary contracts, salary increases had been limited since 2009, and no incentives were offered
to work in rural areas. However, the MOH budget for 2015 only increased by Q67 million
compared to the additional Q1.345 million needed to honor its financial commitments to health
personnel. As a result, health workers have reported delays in receiving their salaries.

The MOH has also been taking actions to improve staff performance through personnel
audits and monitoring systems. In 2015, the MOH undertook a technical audit of staff in
departments to review whether their qualifications met their job requirements/terms of reference.
This audit was also aimed at reducing the risk of politicized appointments. The MOH also has
made progress in monitoring staff productivity through its Health Management Information
System (SIGSA) which is now able to track the number of consultations provided by each health
worker in health departments. All health facilities are required to enter information systematically
and in 2015, facilities that did not comply received ministerial sanctions. The MOH is also working
towards an integrated human resource information system (IHRIS). In 2015, the information for
contractual staff was already on line and the next step is to integrate the information of permanent
staff. As part of its health sector reform, the new Administration plans to undertake a detailed
inventory of its health staff and update its human resource data base.

The MOH 2014-19 Strategy aims to improve human resource management including
establishing a career path for health workers, which would need a budgeted operational plan.
The MOH Human Resource Directorate issued a two page statement in 2013 mentioning general
strategies and policies for managing the Ministry’s human resources. The strategic framework has
three principles: (a) develop the health workforce, (b) generate sustainable processes for this
development, and (c) install an integrated human resource information system. Policies to
implement the three pronged strategy aim to strengthen research, management, and development
of the workforce. They also emphasize deconcentrating the management of human resources from
the executive level to the Ministry and from the Ministry to institutions. These general statements
and intentions are a useful blueprint that provides strategic direction for developing action plans
with specific targets to be achieved within a given timeframe. Recently, the Ministry of Health, in
collaboration with the Vice President’s Office, also introduced a general framework for health
sector reform which includes a plan to improve human resource management including preparing
a career path for health workers. The next step would be to translate this into concrete strategies
and operational plans with measurable and verifiable outcomes, timelines, and a budget.

Stock-outs also impact the quality of health care services provided by health facilities . In June
2015, the average availability of drugs was 87% for all 29 health directorates, with a range of 66%
(Peten Sur Oriente) to 100% (Santa Rosa and Totonicapan).70 Five health directorates had 75% or
less of tracer medicines, another five had 81 to 82%. The average drug availability in MOH
hospitals was 83%, ranging from 66% (San Juan De Dios) to 97% (Fray Rodrigo). Seven of 44
hospitals had drug stocks below 75%.

In principle, drug procurement in the public health sector is based on the state procurement
law of 2009 which promotes centralized price negotiations to take advantage of economies of
scale; in practice there is significant room for improvement. The legal basis for procuring

pharmaceuticals is well established in Guatemala. The method of open contracts is used, which
allows hospitals and health areas to purchase from an approved list of drug suppliers previously
selected by the Government. This system is meant to achieve lower prices from economies of scale
via centralized price negotiations, while retaining the advantages of decentralized purchases. From
2004-2013, 4 firms accounted for contracts over USD38.5M; 10 firms received contracts from
USD12.9M to USD38.5M; 77 smaller firms had contracts of lesser amounts.71 In 2015,
Guatecompras listed 82 providers for 239 contracts for medicines and hospital inputs for 1,633
products under the open contract scheme.72 Implementation experience indicates several
shortcomings in the procurement of medicines. For example, the law stipulates that the supplier
must deliver the products within 20 days after signing the contract. However, suppliers rarely meet
this deadline and receive a 20-day extension and, in the meantime, shortages occur. If the 20 day
extension period expires and the medicines have not yet been delivered then the receiving health
facility may request the Ministry of Finance’s no-objection to purchase outside the open contract
modality. However, the health facility usually purchases the same medicine at a higher price from
the same supplier that did not deliver on time. Moreover there are no limits on the duration of
contracts which have led to reduced competition and outdated negotiated prices. The lack of
standardized bidding documents tends to result in incomplete and/or confusing specifications and
limited coordination among the participating entities (MOH, IGSS and the Military and Police).
The absence of a single list of medicines and pharmaceutical forms has led to partial pooling of
procurement needs for medicines, so the public sector is not able to realize all the potential benefits
of economies of scale.73

The MOH is taking steps to improve procurement and management of medicines and other
medical inputs. The MOH established a Logistical Management Unit in 2015. This Unit is
responsible for verifying the selection, estimation, procurement, storage and distribution of
medicines, surgical inputs, and related supplies, for all implementation units (Health Areas,
Hospitals, and specific programs). The MOH and IGSS are also coordinating with other countries74
in Central America to jointly purchase anticonvulsants, cancer drugs, cardiovascular medicines,
and contraceptives, based on a harmonized list at lower cost. The Government has also partially
modified the Procurement Law. As part of its planned health sector reform, the new Administration
intends to review and modify some procurement processes including establishing a reference price
list for medicines and inputs to avoid overpricing. It also plans to consolidate and harmonize
logistics-related processes between the MOH and IGSS.

Health is one of three major priorities for the new Administration, which has developed
major strategies that need to be supported by concrete operational plans and resources.
Since the new Administration assumed office in January 2016, it has moved forward with
preparing strategies to address chronic malnutrition, strengthen primary health care, and identify
key areas for health sector reform. It launched a Strategy to Prevent Chronic Malnutrition 2016-
2020 in March 2016, and then began consultations on draft strategies for strengthening primary
health care and health sector reform. The Strategy to Prevent Chronic Malnutrition 2016-2020
relies on improving access to and quality of primary health care, as well as clean water and
sanitation, and strategic communication to promote behavioral change. The Government is
preparing the needed costed implementation plan, based on a series of consultations with key
stakeholders. Implementation of this strategy and the MOH’s primary health care strategy will
require additional resources to address existing significant coverage and quality gaps. Inadequate
funding has become an even more critical issue in the sector because the Government reduced the
health sector budget by two percent (Q118 millions) from 2015 to 2016. As a result, identifying
ways to reassign and/or generate more funds for health and nutrition needs to be one of the key
areas of focus of the proposed health sector reforms. Another important area of focus would be to
improve the efficiency of health spending by expanding the use of results-based budgeting in the
sector. The Government plans to undertake an in-depth costing exercise at the primary and
secondary levels of care to generate up-to-date information on the cost of providing services. It
aims to eventually implement results-based capitation payments at the primary and secondary
levels of care in order to improve health and nutrition outcomes and the efficiency of public
spending on health.


VI. Performance and Challenges in Social Protection and Labor

   VI.1        Recent Evolution of Social Protection and Labor Public Spending

Guatemala’s Social Protection and Labor (SPL) spending has increased in real terms most
years since 2007, and increased as a percentage of GDP between 2007 and 2010. Guatemala
has all the key elements of an SPL system, including contributory programs (social security), non-
contributory benefits directed to the most vulnerable groups, and labor market programs. However,
coverage and resource allocation are sub-optimal, and the different SPL components are
implemented to very different degrees. Overall, the country has slightly increased the amount of
resources invested in SPL, in real terms and relative to the GDP, mostly on its social assistance
components. SPL spending rose on average 7% per year in real terms from 6,412 million quetzals
in 2007 to 9,928 million quetzals in 2014 (Figure 86). As a percentage of GDP, SPL spending rose
from 2.5% in 2007 to a peak of 3.3% in 2010, and then stabilized at 3% (Figure 87).

Guatemala’s SPL allocation is the lowest in CA. Guatemala provides less fiscal resources to
SPL as a share of GDP than most countries in CA and LAC. For instance, in 2014 Guatemala
allocated less than half of what Honduras spent for SPL and about a third of Costa Rica’s allocation
relative to GDP (Figure 88). Social assistance spending as a percentage of GDP is below El
Salvador, Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica, but higher than Nicaragua. Fiscal resources for social
security are noticeably low (1.9% of GDP in 2014). Social assistance spending at 1.1% of GDP in
2014 is below the world average (1.6% of GDP, average for 2010-2014) and LAC regional average
(1.3% of GDP).75

Social security is fragmented, comprising three main public schemes plus a social pension
system. Social security in Guatemala is financed in a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) regime, mainly
implemented through the Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social (IGSS). In addition, there is
a social pension administered by the Ministry of Labor (MINTRA), aimed at supporting the elderly
living in poverty. The contributory system is very fragmented – there are currently 11 public
pension schemes plus other private funds with very limited coverage. The two most important
public schemes are: the disability, old age and survival plan (Invalidez, vejez y supervivencia, IVS)
that requires as qualifying conditions being older than 62 years and having contributed at least 240
payments (valid for new affiliates entering the system since January 2011); and the sickness,
maternity and work injury plan (Enfermedad, maternidad y accidentes) which includes as
requisites having contributed at least 3 consecutive months in the 6 month period preceding the
incapacity or accident. These two schemes are administered by the IGSS. A separate scheme for
public workers, ‘Passive sectors of the State’ (Clases Pasivas del Estado), was mandated under
decree 63-68 of 1988. Finally, social security for the military is provided through a special plan
managed by the Military Social Security Institute (IPM). Spending on social security has remained
at around 1.9% of GDP during the period 2007 to 2013. Guatemala’s spending on social security
is the lowest in CA.

Social assistance spending has increased in later years, mostly explained by the rise of
subsidies. Rising SPL spending in recent years was mainly driven by the social assistance
programs that almost doubled their share of GDP from 0.6% in 2007 to 1.1% in 2011, but then
remained stable. Most of the increase in social assistance is explained by the level of subsidies. In
contrast, the increase in cash transfers that took place between 2007 and 2010, mainly through the
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program Bono Seguro (former Mi Familia Progresa), reverted
back after 2010 (Figure 89). Labor Market services get few resources, partially due to the high
levels of informality.

There is an important range of SPL interventions oriented to different groups of the
population. As mentioned above, Guatemala has implemented the most important components of
an SPL system. They reach a large number of beneficiaries and include social security schemes
(contributory) for illness, accidents and maternity leave; old age pension; a social pension; active
labor market programs including a National Training Institute – INTECAP (common in the CA
region); and labor mediation services through employment services carried out by MINTRA
(Table 4). A set of social assistance interventions works across the country to provide support to
the most vulnerable, currently managed by the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES). These
include a scholarship program called Beca Segura; a food assistance scheme Mi Bolsa Segura; the
CCT program Mi Bono Seguro - previously named Mi Familia Progresa; and a program for the
youth that provides recreational activities (Jóvenes Protagonistas). Subsidies are also an important
SPL intervention, particularly in transport and electricity, and are implemented through MIDES
and the National Electricity Institute (INDE).

Overall, SPL spending is much higher for the elderly than for youngsters or children. In 2012
the old age and survival plan (IVS) paid an average of USD 967 per capita and the social pension
paid USD 540 per capita, far higher than per capita spending for the youth (INTECAP’s average
per capita was USD108) or for children (Bono Seguro’s per capita for each scheme was around
USD 100).

Beneficiaries of the main contributory scheme IVS have expanded moderately in recent
years, but coverage remains limited due to high labor informality. Coverage of the main
contributory scheme IVS rose from 144,857 beneficiaries in 2010 to 166,493 in 2013 (Figure 90),
and the share of the elderly covered rose from 21.3% to 22.4%. Nevertheless, Guatemala’s
coverage of contributory social security remains one of the lowest in LAC. By 2010 it was the
lowest in CA, and only performed better than Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay in LAC. It was far below
the top performer Costa Rica whose contributory social security pillar reached almost 70% of its
elderly.76 More details are provided later on Guatemala’s high labor informality that is a key reason
for its low contributory rate.

Payments through the contributory system are quite heterogeneous, and the Guatemalan
Institute of Social Security (IGSS) is facing structural deficits. Eligibility criteria to access the
benefits have recently been tightened and new affiliates entering after January 2011 are required
to be at least 62 years old and to have contributed at least 240 regular payments to the system.
Retirement benefits are calculated at 50% of base salary plus 0.5% for each 6 month period of
contributions beyond the required minimum. Total benefits cannot exceed 80% of the base salary,
earnings cannot be greater than Q 6,000 (or approximately USD 780). Since the new requirements
do not apply to people who entered the system before January 2011, there is considerable
heterogeneity in benefits which can range from Q 340 (approximately USD 44) – the minimum

                                                                         92

monthly pension, including supplements – to Q 4,800 (USD 624) (permanent disability benefits
have the same range). The IGSS has a structural deficit of around 0.8% of GDP each year. This is
aggravated by the low number of people actually contributing to the system. Approximately 1
million workers make regular payments to the system, just 25% of the economically active
population.

Equity remains an issue, but adequacy of benefits is fair especially for low incomes.
Guatemala’s percentage of low income families (people in the first quintile of poverty)
contributing to the system was among the lowest in CA in 2014 (Figure 91). As in most of CA,
the gap in the percent contributing between the poorest and richest income quintiles is large. At
75% gross pension replacement rates (GRR), adequacy of benefits for low earners ranks about the
middle of LAC levels, but is among the highest in LAC for high earners (Figure 92), contributing
to Guatemala’s high inequity.

Social pension spending is declining, and overall coverage and generosity are at very low
levels. The non-contributory or social pension is provided through the Ministry of Labor. Officially
called Programa de Aporte Económico del Adulto Mayor, it was sanctioned by Decree No. 85 of
2005 for people over 65 years who can demonstrate through a socio-economic assessment that
they lack enough economic resources and are in a vulnerable situation. Approximately 100,000
beneficiaries receive the social pension, roughly 9% of the elderly in the country. This is a higher
percentage than El Salvador, which protects 5% of its elderly through non-contributive pensions,
or Nicaragua’s negligible coverage of 0.1%. However, it is far below the coverage in Panama
(26%), Costa Rica (17%) and Honduras (19%), and especially low among poorer quintiles (Figure
93).77 Overall spending of the non-contributory scheme declined from 0.138 of GDP in 2010 to
0.106% in 2014 (Figure 94). The social pension amount in Guatemala is relatively low, only about
USD 50 a month. In 2012, the social pension payment was equivalent to USD 2 per day (PPP of
2005), well below payments in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama. Social pension payments
were much lower than the minimum wage: 19.6% in Guatemala, 35.3% in Costa Rica, 42.2% in
El Salvador, 22.5% in Panama and 22.6% in Nicaragua (Figure 95).

Guatemala not only has one of the lowest non-contributory pensions, but its distribution is
the most inequitable in CA. Only 3% of Guatemala’s social pension beneficiaries are from the
poorest quintile and 62% are from the richest quintile, the most inequitable distribution in CA

       VI.2.2 Social Assistance

Non-contributory social assistance spending as percentage of GDP has increased in recent
years but remains on the low side internationally. Even though spending on social assistance
almost doubled from 2007 to 2013 from 0.6% of GDP to 1.1%, this remains low compared to the
percentage that El Salvador, Honduras and Panama allocate for social assistance programs,
although similar to Costa Rica and slightly higher than Nicaragua. The increase in Social
Assistance spending in Guatemala was triggered by two factors: the launch of the CCT Mi Familia
Progresa in 2008, and an expansion in subsidies, especially in 2009 and 2010 when they accounted
for an important portion of social assistance.

Overall coverage and targeting of social assistance programs is good; the CCT in particular
reaches an important share of the poor. Despite the fact that the resources allocated to social
assistance has not expanded sufficiently to place Guatemala among the top spenders in CA, social
assistance programs have good coverage of the poor and targeting has reached an important share
of beneficiaries subsisting below the poverty line. Two food assistance schemes (Vaso de Atol,
and Bolsas Escolares Solidaridad) and the CCT Program Mi Bono Seguro had particularly high
coverage levels of the poorest households of around 40% in 2014 (Figure 97). The CCT excelled
with almost 70% of its beneficiaries among the poorest 40% of the population (“targeting

75% respectively. For comparison, targeting accuracy of other feeding programs in CA were 35%

implementation concerns of the CCT since then and discussed below, this documented good performance

Housing, transport and (especially) electricity subsidies have become important components
of social assistance; their combined budget equals that allocated to cash transfers, and has
increased slightly in recent years. Guatemala has a very fragmented but large subsidy system.
Government agencies channel funds to private firms that provide various public services in health,
transportation, electricity, etc. The main subsidies are for housing (Programa de Vivienda),
transportation (Subsidio al Transporte Urbano del Adulto Mayor – MIDES), and electricity
(Subsidio de Energia eléctrica and Subsidio Tarifario). In transportation and electricity, subsidies
are untargeted; they are disbursed directly to private providers to prevent a rise in tariffs. Transport
subsidies are normally around 0.1% of GDP, electricity payments are the main budget drivers at
0.25-0.35% of GDP (Figure 99).

Despite the recent increment, Guatemala remains a mid-level spender on subsidies in the CA
region. Guatemala is among the CA countries with subsidy systems that contribute a large share
of the resources invested in social assistance. In 2013, Guatemala’s subsidies rose to 0.43% of
GDP, ranking in the middle of countries in CA (Figure 100).

There is room to improve targeting of energy subsidies. Energy subsidies have been reformed
several times over the years to improve targeting and reach more people who have limited access
to energy. Currently there are two general regimes: “tarifa solidaria” is a 3-tiered scheme of direct
subsidies for households consuming 0 to 50 kWh/month, 51 to 100, and 100 or more per month.
In addition, the government launched a special tariff for households using less than 300 kWh per
month, named “tarifa social”. Currently, tarifa social benefits approximately 11 million people,
76.6% of the population. Clearly, this does not prioritize the poor or more deprived groups.
Extremely poor households in Guatemala consume an estimated average of 24 kW per month;
poor households use an estimated 53 kWh/month; both well below the ceiling of 300kWh/month
for the tarifa social.

Guatemala has recently focused important attention on nutrition. Interventions aim to prevent
chronic malnutrition in children under 2 years old, and include the PEC and Programa de Atención
Integral a la Niñez y Mujer Comunitaria. A national strategy Ventana de los 1000 días, led by the
Ministry of Health, was launched to provide appropriate channels for government programs to
protect the first stages of life, starting with pregnancy (270 days, approximately) and lasting
through the child’s second year of life (730 days). Basic health and nutrition packages are offered
that include prenatal care, promotion of breastfeeding, food supplementation, adequate feeding
practices, etc.; and are intended to complement other social assistance interventions such as the

                                                                99

CCT Mi Bono Seguro, and the feeding program Bolsa Solidaria. Coverage of food assistance
programs is highest for primary-school aged children between 8 and 13 years old (around 60%
received at least one of these programs in 2012). The program with highest coverage is Vaso de
Atol, followed by the Alimentacion Escolar scheme and then Vaso de Leche (Figure 101).

The adoption of the CCT model in 2008 triggered a rise in resources that peaked in 2010 but
decreased in the following years, although the number of beneficiaries kept expanding. Bono
Seguro’s predecessor, Mi Familia Progresa, was launched by the Executive branch in April 2008.
The program was renamed Mi Bono Seguro in 2012 and placed under MIDES. The CCT focuses
on poor families with children under 15 years old, and uses geographic targeting. Beneficiary
families are selected within municipalities mapped as poor. Payments are disbursed every two
months, equivalent to USD 18.50 for each month that the children have attended school, plus
another payment of USD 18.50 per month if parents have taken children for needed health care
treatment and recommended prevention services (such as vaccinations). Education and health
payments are independent of each other, and irrespective of the number of children of the family
– i.e per family, and not per child (“flat benefit” structure). These design characteristics remain,
but Mi Bono Seguro now comprises two sub-schemes: Bono de Salud (health) and Bono de
Educación (education). Since adoption of the CCT model in 2008, resources allocated to cash
transfers rose significantly, peaking at 0.34% of GDP in 2010 and progressively declining
thereafter. The number of beneficiaries expanded significantly to more than 750,000 households
in 2012, making Bono Seguro the CCT with the largest coverage in the CA region (Figure 102).

Guatemala’s CCT spending is comparable to other CA schemes, but generosity is low, and
targeting could improve, especially of the extreme poor. At 0.17% of GDP (2014), Guatemala
is a mid-level spender on cash transfers in the CA region, well below the 0.55% of GDP that
Honduras allocates to its CCT program (Figure 103). The generosity of Mi Bono Seguro is the
lowest of the CCT programs in CA; the transfer is only 15% of the consumption of the extreme
poor or poor, less than half of Honduras’ Bono 10 mil 38% of consumption payment to the poor
(Figure 104). Guatemala’s CCT targeting accuracy has been among the best in the CA region at
89% of the poor, but coverage of the extreme poor is less good.

The CCT program has increased use of health and education services in prioritized areas.
Mi Bono Seguro has not been evaluated since it was launched in 2012, but impact evaluations are
available for its predecessor, Mi Familia Progresa. One study (using a difference-in-difference
method) estimated that the program increased the number of children promoted between grades in
primary education by 8.6%, 10.9% and 11% for the first, second and third levels, respectively
(Table 5). The same study found a rise in health services provided in municipalities where Mi
Familia Progresa was implemented: the number of check-ups attended by children participating
in the program rose 48% compared to 28% among those not targeted. The study conclusion praises
the program as being more effective in promoting use of health services and educational attainment
than previous interventions. However, it also highlights shortcomings in implementation that
hampered the effectiveness of Mi Familia Progresa, especially related to lack of transparency in
the selection of beneficiaries, and the need to improve its targeting systems, and monitoring and

It can be concluded also that the CCT has helped reduce extreme poverty amongst
beneficiaries. If the program had effectively delivered the amount of money stipulated to the
families enrolled (an unrealistic assumption given the program’s implementation and financing
constraints, as discussed below), an upper-bound estimate of the impact that it could have had on
poverty would have been to decrease extreme poverty by 1.5 percentage points, from 24.9% before
the intervention to 23.4% afterwards (Figure 105). The simulation also estimates a possible slight
improvement in overall poverty (extreme plus moderate poverty) among beneficiaries from 92.2%
to 88.6%). Estimates of the impact on poverty among beneficiaries of CCT programs in other CA
countries vary: from 81.7% to 77.2% in Panama; 48.4% to 42.6% in Costa Rica; and 88.5% to
83.9% in Honduras. Similar to Guatemala, CCT programs have had only limited impact on overall
poverty.

The CCT program has been affected by institutional constraints including poor
implementation mechanisms and significant cutbacks in resources. The program was part of
the countercyclical measures that the Guatemalan Government prioritized to deal with the impact
of the 2008-2009international crisis. Under this plan, resources allocated to CCT peaked in 2010,
whereas the number of beneficiaries continued to grow. With the change in administration in 2012,
the program lost strength and has faced cutbacks in resources that have caused difficulties in
making the transfers to beneficiary families. Spending has been erratic throughout the fiscal year,
with periods of no implementation at all, followed by periods in which resources were spent hastily
and irregularly. MIDES has not been able to ensure consistent distribution of the transfers in all
307 municipalities (of 338 in the country) participating in the program. Transparency issues have
also been identified, and MIDES has not been able to recover and strengthen the Program. The
current structure of benefits is also problematic: a flat benefit irrespective of the number of children
may not provide sufficient support to larger families, and does not create sufficient incentive to
comply with transfer conditions for all children in the household.

Unemployment rates are higher among the youth, and people with more education. Youth
aged 15 to 24 years old are less likely to be able to find a job than other age group (Figure 106).
Relatively higher unemployment among people with higher educated is worrying (Figure 107).
Research by the World Bank shows that limited job opportunities for workers with secondary and
tertiary education and lower returns to education are prompting school drop-outs in children under

16, undermining their chances to join the formal market. 79 Data collected in the World Bank
Employer Survey also show that business owners in Guatemala tend to have fewer years of formal
education than peers in LAC, with negative impacts in sectors related to business innovation.
These elements could help explain the negligible increase in labor productivity in recent years,
which has remained well behind other CA countries. According to the ILO, in the period 1992-
2008, marginal labor productivity only rose 0.6% contrasted to 2% in Costa Rica, 1.5% in El
Salvador, 1.6% in Honduras and 1.9% in Panama. Only Nicaragua had a lower increase of 0.3%.

Most employees in Guatemala have low levels of education; their incomes are meager
compared to other groups, and returns to education are falling. Around 73% of current
employees in Guatemala have only primary education or less (Figure 108). These groups (people
with no formal education, primary incompleted and completed primary) unsurprisingly, earn less
than the median income (Figure 109). However, despite the low proportion of high-skilled
workers, returns to education are falling. This trend, coupled with the higher unemployment rate
among educated workers, seems to signal weakening demand for educated workers, perhaps
related to the concentration of production in typically low-skilled sectors (a third in agriculture,
and the rest mostly in low-skilled manufacturing, construction, commerce, and services).
Guatemala has a shortage of new, more productive and profitable jobs adapted to the nature of its
workforce, and is lagging in the creation of business innovation-related jobs.

Similar to other CA countries, persistent informality and underemployment are the norm
among the youth. Overall, informality has been close to 70% for more than a decade (Figure 110).
Indigenous and rural workers are more likely to be in informal jobs, with low productivity and
lower earnings than other groups. High levels of informality help explain Guatemala’s low and
stable unemployment rate of 2%, well below the LAC regional average of 6.8% in 2012. However,
underemployment is high -- 23% in 2014, well above Costa Rica (14%) and the Dominican
Republic (17%).80 Underemployment is highest among younger workers (Figure 111).

The National Training Institute, INTECAP, provides occupational training, but is resource-
constrained. INTECAP’s main mission is to become the national specialized agency responsible
for developing human resources and fostering productivity in Guatemala. The services that
INTECAP provides include: short technical degrees, occupational orientation for youth and adults,
full-time technical career training, and mid-level technical degrees. Under the Law that governs
the Institute (approved by Decree no. 17 of 1972), INTECAP is financed through the public budget
and payroll contributions of up to 1% of salaries, collected from private and public enterprises.
This ties INTECAP’s resources to the formal economy’s performance. INTECAP’s spending lags
behind other training institutes like INATEC in Nicaragua, and the INA in Costa Rica (Figure
112). There are two main reasons: INTECAP’s payroll contribution is much smaller than, for
instance, INATEC in Nicaragua’s 2% of salaries; and the remarkably high levels of informality in
Guatemala greatly constrain INTECAP’s revenue base.

INTECAP resources rose in 2014, in line with the objective of continuing to expand its
number of beneficiaries and reach more youth. Fiscal constraints have hindered the expansion
of INTECAP’s spending in real terms and as a percentage of GDP (Figure 113). However,
INTECAP’s budget rose to 250 million in 2014 (in real 2007 quetzales). The career-training
schemes offered by the institute have almost doubled their beneficiaries in recent years, from
159,319 in 2007 to 277,464 in 2013. INTECAP’s programs also have been aligned to respond well
to current labor market conditions and requirements, and have made special efforts to reach the
youngest segment of the economically active population. People aged 15 to 34 years made up more
than 64% of those who received technical training at INTECAP in 2011 (Figure 114).

Employment services are new, and still have very low coverage and limited linkages with
other SPL interventions. Labor intermediation services are recent labor market interventions and
have not yet expanded broadly, so far serving limited numbers of beneficiaries and with limited
resources. Intermediation programs include MINTRA’s Bolsa de Empleo, an employment service
that aims to link workers and private enterprises seeking employees with specific technical skills
and work experience. The registry is still small. In 2010, MINTRA allocated USD 866,000 for this
program, and cut its resources in 2011 to only USD 620,000 thousand. These programs could
benefit from better synergies with other SPL interventions that target youngsters in precarious or
vulnerable work situations like the Jóvenes Protagonistas program implemented by MIDES.
Jóvenes Protagonistas is one of the few SPL interventions that is specifically urban and potentially
could be linked with other labor market interventions.

       VI.3    Institutional Arrangements

Created three years ago, MIDES is now the leading institution in the SPL sector, and has
inherited the administration of the main social assistance interventions. The new government
sanctioned the creation of MIDES through Decree 1-2012. The Ministry has been established as
the governing body for social development, responsible for designing and establishing national
policies to enhance the wellbeing of socially vulnerable groups including unemployed youth,
children with unmet nutritional needs, and others. MIDES is also accountable for developing
national strategies to optimize food security, and education and health services throughout the
country, and is expected to coordinate with relevant sectors and subnational levels of government
to deliver such services. Among the functions explicitly entrusted to the Ministry are: (a)
formulating social development policy for urban and rural areas in a participative manner in
coordination with other competent authorities and decentralized structures of the Government; (b)
establishing the principles, policies and general actions of this sector; (c) establishing a national
system of social information, including a single database of beneficiaries of social services and
programs, including impact indicators; and (d) establishing norms and procedures to organize and
coordinate social programs across the sectors and levels of government. Some of the most
important social assistance programs fall under MIDES, most created before the Ministry: Mi Bono
Seguro CCT, Mi Bolsa Segura, and Comedores Solidarios, among others. In addition, various
scholarship schemes were added into the Mi Beca Segura program, and a new intervention,
Jovenes Protagonistas, was included, that aims to prevent vulnerable youth falling into criminal
activities by offering different culture-related workshops.

The institutional capacity of MIDES needs strengthening; it has not managed yet to address
the main program implementation challenges (notably of the CCT). MIDES has yet to
complete a thorough process of strengthening its institutional capacities to firmly establish itself
as the effective governing body of the SPL sector. Functions entrusted to the Ministry are very
ambitious, but it has not managed to solve pre-existing technical issues in the CCT programs
related to weak implementation capacity and unpredictable budget allocations from the central
level, which result in transfers being disbursed irregularly to beneficiaries throughout the year. In
addition, small programs still function under other government agencies, and there is no
institutional space to create synergies and enhance coordination across interventions operating
under MIDES and those under other governmental departments. For instance, the social pension
is distributed through MINTRA, along with other services for the unemployed, but this information
is not integrated with systems that MIDES has put in place, like its national social information
system. Other important initiatives like the Zero Hunger Pact (Pacto Hambre Cero), and the Barrio
Seguro program also lack mechanisms to coordinate with MIDES. The Ministry has not been able
to tackle problems resulting from poor coordination of policies in the sector.

There are still SPL interventions that potentially duplicate efforts and roles at various
government levels. The SPL system in Guatemala comprises multiple actors that sometimes have
overlapping roles or functions, target the same population groups, and/or implement programs with
similar objectives without establishing procedures to coordinate with each other. At the central
level, a Social Development Cabinet (Gabinete de Desarrollo Social), led by the Vice-president,
is responsible for designing and administering activities and policies in social development. Its
other functions are to create and develop monitoring systems, and technical coordination of social
programs. Cabinet members are from MIDES and other agencies, and, as can be seen from the
description of its roles, there is overlap with MIDES’s mandate. The Secretary of Planning
(SEGEPLAN) is responsible for evaluating the overall social development policy in the country.
Like some other countries in CA, Guatemala has legally mandated that an increasing amount of
revenues be transferred to subnational levels (1.3% of GDP or approximately 9.3% of total central
government spending).81 This has enabled Guatemala to make significant progress in
decentralizing the implementation of basic services throughout the country. The Coordination
Secretariat of the Presidency (SCEP) is the agency responsible for providing technical,
administrative and financial support to the Local Development Councils (Consejos de Desarrollo)
that work at the regional and departmental levels. SCEP is also responsible for fostering the
decentralization process (with SEGEPLAN), and has played an important role mostly at the local
level. MIDES is responsible for ensuring articulation and complementarity among national
programs and local interventions. All these efforts need considerably improved inter-institutional
coordination in the sector (Table 6).

MIDES is implementing a single beneficiary registry (Registro Unico de Usuarios Nacional,
RUU-N) that systematizes data from beneficiaries currently enrolled in social programs;
however, it has proven difficult to ensure cooperation of different agencies. The single
beneficiary registry RUU-N was launched in 2013. Earlier efforts to compile beneficiaries’ data
used the Sistema de Información Social (SISO) that gathered a collection of social indicators in
health and education, and the Rural Census done to gather data for the CCT. RUU-N is embedded
under MIDES and its main objectives are: (a) to provide a platform for compiling a list of
beneficiaries with unique identifiers; (b) to produce information to analyze and improve the focus
of interventions on target population; and (c) to enhance accountability and transparency practices.
A new Single Identification Code (CUI) will issue a unique ID number for each individual included
in the RUU-N; a CUI will be a requirement for inclusion in RUU-N. RUU-N is already functional
but the information is not publicly available yet because the implementation process is still
underway. Based on its mandate, MIDES began a process to establish a dialogue with other
ministries and public agencies providing social services. The task has not been trouble-free; some

                                                111
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


agencies have been reluctant to share their databases or beneficiary registries. This is an indication
that MIDES needs more institutional strength to be able to fulfill its mandate. Despite these issues,
by 2014, RUU-N had finalized a first list of 2.6 million beneficiaries with information from 16
agencies (including MIDES, SEGEPLAN, and the Ministries of Education and Agriculture) for 72
programs distributing 142 different types of benefits. Information includes beneficiaries’ location
and the specific benefits they are receiving. Even at this initial stage, this is an important
achievement by CA standards regarding the use of codified beneficiaries’ registries.

Guatemala’s 2014 national policy framework includes priorities in the SPL sector. Another
aspect to consider when analyzing the current institutional setting for the SPL sector is the recent
elaboration of the National Development Plan “K’atun Nuestra Guatemala 2032” (2014), produced
by SEGEPLAN. This policy document establishes guidelines for government and private
interventions within a set of national policy objectives. It was drafted following a thoroughly
participatory approach that included large meetings throughout the country with different
stakeholders: representatives of the sub-national levels of government, Mancomunidades (clusters
of municipalities), NGOs, grassroots organizations, women and indigenous organizations, etc.
Some of the social sector goals aim to ensure social protection mechanisms to guarantee individual
and social welfare, secure nutritional and food security, and increase coverage of education, among
others. Its guidelines seek to enhance linkages between the social and productive sectors in urban
and rural areas. The policy recognizes gaps in the social policy sector that are consistent with those
identified by analyses of the performance of social policy programs. These include: protecting
children through more interconnected strategies for which MIDES needs institutional
strengthening to partner with programs like Hambre Cero; and prioritizing training for urban
youth. Social assistance programs such as Bono Seguro could benefit from this approach by
establishing mechanisms to move towards a more inclusive strategy, oriented to enhance
productivity of beneficiaries by linking conditionalities with other goals in Plan K’atun.



VII. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

Guatemala in the last ten years is a story of decent economic growth but failure to improve
human development indicators or reduce poverty (which is actually increasing). Economic
growth in Guatemala surpassed the Central American average over the past ten years, but the
majority of the population has not benefited. Poverty levels are stubbornly high, and despite the
recent decrease in inequality (albeit from one of the highest levels in the world), poverty has risen
recently, and affect almost three-fifths of the population. Performance in human development is
disappointing relative to comparison groups (Latin America, Central America, or countries with
similar income levels). Despite progress in primary enrollment, low secondary enrollment and
completion rates persist. Guatemala’s undernourishment rate has increased to 30%, which is
among the worst in the world, and three times the averages in Latin America and Central America.

Unemployment rates remain low, but a quarter of workers are underemployed, and 70% are in
low-paid informal work.

A major causes of this paltry performance in poverty reduction and human development
indicators is the limited State provision of key social public services, with very low resource
allocations and inefficiencies in spending. Despite the slight recent increase, social public
spending as a share of GDP is not only the lowest in Central America (across all social sectors,
including education, health, pensions, and just above Nicaragua in social assistance), and above
only Nicaragua in per capita real terms, but is also among the lowest in the world. An allocation
of just 8% of GDP for social spending is not surprising when general government revenues are
only 11% of GDP (also among the lowest in the world). Without an ambitious fiscal reform that
could guarantee sufficient resources for public services provision, this situation will remain in the
future. In the meantime, there is significant room for improvement in the quality (a tenth of
approved budgets to social sectors is regularly left unspent each year) and targeting of spending
(which overall favors mostly the non-poor, mainly through regressive pension benefits), as well as
tracking, evaluation and feedback mechanisms.

               VII.1       Education

 Guatemala still spends less on education than every Central American country except
Nicaragua. Major challenges remain in the education sector, including very low spending per
student – especially in secondary education, and the highest repetition rates in Central America.
One in eight primary students in Guatemala repeats a grade each year. This likely demotivates
students, inducing dropouts even before the completion of primary education. Tertiary education
remains a privilege of wealthier households, and the existence of only one public tertiary institution
with limited places raises concerns about equity. There are stark inequalities in spending and
outcomes across the country, especially for enrollments at the secondary level. These inequities
especially hurt girls in rural areas, and data suggest that the financial burden on households is the
most significant cause of low secondary completion. Finally, learning outcomes have improved
significantly82 but Guatemala still ranks well below the LAC average in SERCE or TERCE. These
shortcomings are compounded by three significant institutional challenges. First, the legal
framework for education needs to be updated to clarify and formalize responsibilities, reduce
fragmentation, and address key education system needs. Second, while the quality of the
professional in-service teacher-training is good, the program’s long run sustainability requires
stronger financial planning and closer linkages with teachers’ career progression. Third, at the
tertiary level, the existence of only one public university, USAC, creates a bottleneck in access
and equity. We summarize below the main policy recommendations to address these challenges in
Guatemala’s education system.

     These likely have been supported by falling student teacher ratios and the expansion of the CCT program.

A more efficient and quality-oriented education system requires an updated legal
framework. In the short term, bylaws must be enacted to codify the division responsibilities
defined under the 1991 Education Law. Without this legal framework, the responsibilities of the
Ministry of Education and other government agencies providing education services will remain
fragmented and unclear, resulting in poor service. Second, regulation should focus on
strengthening non-traditional education by establishing a National Board for non-traditional
education (Junta Nacional de Educación Extraescolar), as mandated in the 1991 Education Law.
In the medium term, the amendment of the 1991 Education Law is an inevitable step to reflect the
modern needs of the Education system. In 1991, the Peace Accords had not yet been signed,
primary education was not yet universal, public secondary education was insignificant, and non-
traditional education played a much more significant role. Today, access and quality have
expanded at all levels, and non-traditional education paths need to be more closely integrated with
traditional paths. In addition, there is need to align this Law with the 1995/96 Peace Accords, the
current Law of the Executive Power (Community Participation), and the regulatory framework for
Decentralization.

Drawing more on information systems, and analysis to incentivize the development of access-
boosting policies, especially for secondary education is critical. A short run priority is to tackle
access, retention and completion issues, by piloting and evaluating different interventions to
motivate students to be in school, and address repetition and dropout rates especially for girls and
in rural areas. Recent evidence shows that promising demand side interventions include
simultaneously strengthening CCTs and intervention informing parents of the value of education.83
The analysis of relatively high user fees at the secondary level, low public funding, and high
dropout rates, suggests that the financial burden of secondary education falls too heavily on
households – more evaluation of how user fees for secondary education are an actual barrier to
enrollment is needed. When 2014 ENCOVI data are available, it is important to analyze user fees
for secondary education to inform eventual elimination of financial barriers in a sustainable way.
In the medium term, and as enrollment and quality issues at the primary level are adequately
resolved, there needs to be progressive rebalancing of spending towards secondary education to
address dropout rates.

Guatemala also needs to focus more on improving the quality of education to achieve better
learning outcomes. In the short term, teacher quality will be an important driver of education
quality and learning outcomes. However, measures to actually increase teacher quality need not
necessarily involve significantly increased spending. For instance, strengthening the Ministry of
Education (MINEDUC) monitoring and evaluation capacity at local levels could make a big
difference for quality. Simply leveraging on existing information systems, especially those that
currently feed the school report cards that are available online can make information flow better
and increase accountability. Rethinking the sustainability of the flagship professional teacher

training program (PADEP/D) through a substantial review of the budget allocation to both the
MINEDUC and the USAC could be another important way forward. In the medium term, an
increase in the quality of the teacher corps must be supported by complementary reforms in the
processes of recruitment, retention and teacher evaluation, to ensure that the country has more
motivated and qualified teachers. Addressing the strong compression of teacher’s wages by linking
teacher evaluations and performance with career progression will also increase the attractiveness
of the professionFinally, an increase in the long-term sustainability of the professional in-service
teacher training program (PADEP/D) will require more financial planning and closer linkages with
career progression of teachers.

Increase the equity and efficiency of public spending. In the short run, this implies a reallocation
to increase per student spending on the most vulnerable groups, and across regions from areas with
lower poverty rates to areas with higher rates. It will also require piloting and evaluating different
pro-poor programs/incentives (including financial) to overcome barriers to enter and remain in
secondary education, and scholarships and other measures to enable the most vulnerable to attend
higher education. In the medium term, infrastructure investment is needed to address some of the
gaps especially for secondary education in rural areas. Finally, the country would also benefit from
improved access of the most vulnerable students to higher quality tertiary providers. This could be
achieved, by piloting and testing new scholarships/vouchers for students and by improving the
quality standards of private providers.

           VII.2       Health

Despite having among the lowest public spending on health relative to GDP in the LAC
region, Guatemala has made some progress in improving health outcomes and in increasing
coverage rates for certain services, but significant challenges remain. Guatemala’s chronic
malnutrition rate remains the highest in LAC and among the highest in the world. Its maternal
mortality rate decreased but remains well above the LAC average. Non-communicable diseases
have become the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Service utilization rates are significantly
lower for the poorest and indigenous populations who also tend to live in rural areas. MOH
standards for facility-to-population ratios would be met only if the country still had its 1950’s
population size. Even with the MOH’s efforts to compensate for the inadequate availability of
primary health care facilities through the use of mobile health teams, less than half of the
population are covered by primary health care services as a result of the cancellation of the
Extension of Coverage Program in February 2015 and the delay in rolling out the new
institutionalized primary health care model. Quality of care also remains an issue, with shortages
of health professionals and medical inputs. Guatemala’s health personnel to population ratio in
2013 was only half of the WHO standard. There are frequent shortages in drugs and medical inputs
in all facilities, especially in the major hospitals.



                                                 115
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


Insufficient funds are a major constraint to improving the coverage and quality of care, yet
there is also room for enhancing the efficiency of public spending on health . Guatemala has
one of the lowest per capita health expenditures in the LAC region. The health sector budget is
inadequate to address the significant coverage gaps and quality issues related to staffing and
availability of essential inputs. While there is a clear need to increase the public resources allocated
to health and to reduce delays in the flow of funds, there are also several opportunities for
improving the efficiency of health spending, particularly in human resource management and
procurement of drugs and medical inputs. Specific examples include ghost employees, contract
awards that do not meet technical standards and procurement guidelines, pharmaceutical firms that
game the system, and uncoordinated purchases across key health institutions.

On the institutional side, there has been mixed progress in implementing the MOH’s 2014-
19 strategy which aims to contribute to universal health coverage. The MOH has made
progress in: (a) training staff to strengthen service delivery and monitoring; (b) expanding the
implementation of integrated health service networks to improve coordination across the three
levels of care from Guatemala City to selected areas in four other departments: Sololá,
Huehuetenango, Quiche, San Marcos; (c) rolling out the new primary health care model which is
based on a life cycle approach and goes beyond the maternal and child focus of the previous model;
and (d) piloting results based budgeting (RBB), emphasizing the first 1000 days of life (pregnancy
and the first two years of a child’s life) based on its agreement with the MOF under the Zero
Hunger Program - one of the Government’s flagship programs. The MOH had originally planned
to expand RBB to all Health District municipalities and hospitals based on cost centers by 2015.
While some work has advanced in establishing cost centers, and improvements have been made in
the Health Management Information System (SIGSA), as well as in the results orientation of MOH
reports to the MOF, progress in implementing the 2015-19 strategy has been less than planned
mainly because of resource constraints and funding delays, cancellation of the PEC without a
service delivery transition plan, and limited institutional capacity at central and local levels.

The new Administration includes health as one of its three priority areas, and has prepared
major strategies that need to be supported by concrete operational plans and resources. The
current Government has officially launched its 2016-2020 strategy to reduce chronic malnutrition.
It has also prepared a strategy to strengthen primary health care and drafted a health sector reform
proposal. It has already launched a series of consultations with different stakeholders with regard
to these proposed initiatives. Implementation of the nutrition strategy and the MOH’s primary
health care strategy will require additional resources to address existing significant coverage and
quality gaps. This makes identifying ways to reassign and/or generate more funds for health and
nutrition a key areas of focus for the proposed health sector reforms. Another important area of
focus of the proposed reforms would be to improve the efficiency of health spending, including by
expanding the use of results-based budgeting in the health sector.

                 Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


In moving forward, the Government of Guatemala could consider the following short term
(one to two year) recommendations in the health sector:

   1. Address financial flow bottlenecks. While it might be difficult to increase the health
      budget significantly in the short term, the MOF and MOH could work together to identify
      and address as soon as possible the key factors that impede funding flows from central to
      local levels. The MOF could also consider increasing spending ceilings in sectors that
      perform well against clear and transparent criteria.

   2. Identify and implement a transitional service delivery mechanism in areas that are
      not yet covered by the new Primary Health Care Model. Rolling out the new PHC
      model which seeks to provide health, nutrition and population services using a life-cycle
      approach throughout the country may take time because of funding and staffing constraints.
      In the meantime, the MOH could consider using a short-term, scaled-down delivery
      mechanism to deliver basic health and nutrition services in rural and indigenous
      communities that currently do not have any access to health services, prioritizing areas
      where the PEC used to operate.

   3. Finalize costed operational plans for the new nutrition and strengthening primary
      health care strategies with corresponding budget allocations. While some funds could
      be reallocated based on efficiency gains from measures like those mentioned above, the
      MOF would need to allocate more resources toward main priorities in the sector if the
      Government wishes to reach its nutrition and health targets.

   4. Develop a costed action plan to operationalize coordinated strategies to reduce the
      cost of medicines. In the short term, technical specifications of bidding documents could
      be improved. The availability and adoption of standardized, common bidding documents
      and a common essential drugs list for all public entities especially the MOH and IGSS
      could provide economies of scale. Efficiency gains or savings from procurement could also
      be achieved by amending the procurement law so that suppliers who are awarded contracts
      and do not deliver on time under the Open Contract Mechanism, are not allowed to bid for
      the same lots after Health Areas and Hospitals obtain the MOF’s clearance to purchase
      outside negotiated prices to avoid drug stockouts.

   5. Strengthen the MOH human resource (HR) data base and use it more strategically to
      improve human resource management. The MOH plans to make a detailed inventory of
      health sector staff. A consolidated data base is needed for an Integrated HR Information
      System. The MOH HR information system could include the disaggregated distribution of
      the MOH health workforce, their academic qualifications, skill levels, and training needs.
      These data are essential for designing and implementing a human resource strategy that
      would also need to project HR demand and supply by levels of service and by category of
      personnel, and monitor progress in meeting the national objective of an equitable
      nationwide staff distribution.

                                             117
                  Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review



   6. Explore the possibility of re-negotiating the collective pact with health workers. The
      Collective Pact aimed to increase staff morale and, in turn, performance, by converting
      approximately 20,000 health workers to permanent staff; and to encourage staff to work in
      rural areas by providing incentives and increases in per diems. However, it is not affordable
      because the MOH’s 2016 budget is significantly less than the Q1500 million increase
      required to finance the implementation of the Collective Pact. While politically difficult to
      do, the MOH could consider offering long term contracts instead of annual ones, and
      provide non-monetary incentives such as public recognition and special training
      opportunities or financial ones that are within its budget.

In the Medium term (three to five years), it is recommended that the Government focus on
four main areas:

   1. Develop, cost, and implement a phased and coordinated strategy to improve access to
      health and nutrition services to progressively reach poor, rural, indigenous areas.
      Expanding the coverage of services to vulnerable populations remains a critical need in
      Guatemala. It is important to determine the appropriate service delivery mechanisms to
      ensure good-quality, cost-effective coverage in rural and remote areas and include a phased
      and costed plan to support its implementation. The MOH’s ongoing process of introducing
      its new primary health care model could be evaluated periodically and the lessons learned
      incorporated in moving forward with expanding service coverage. The new PHC model
      will need to be linked with other levels of care to ensure timely and appropriate referral
      and treatment. This makes it important for the MOH to continue to strengthen the capacity
      of secondary level facilities to provide quality services based on established protocols, as
      well as to respond in a culturally sensitive manner to health care needs of local users,
      especially indigenous communities, and also to improve management information and
      supervision systems across levels of care. It will be essential to estimate the cost of
      proposed health system improvements (including infrastructure; key inputs: staffing,
      equipment, medicines; and Health Management Information System) that operationalize
      priorities in the MOH’s new Strategy to strengthen primary health care and its links to other
      levels of care, and prioritize and phase their implementation based on available financial
      resources and other feasible financing mechanisms.

   2. Mobilize resources and ensure timely flow of funds to enhance coverage and quality
      of services and expand results-based budgeting (RBB) in the sector. The MOH’s 2015-
      19 strategy’s main goal of contributing to the achievement of universal health coverage
      and expanding RBB in the health sector to the Health Areas and hospitals will require more
      resources. While some funds could be reallocated based on efficiency gains (for example,
      savings from improving drug procurement, removing ghost employees and preventing
      politicized appointments), additional funds would still be needed to improve service
      coverage and quality, as well as implementation capacity. Guatemala is already using taxes
      on tobacco and alcohol sales to finance health services but public financing of the health

                                               118
                   Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


       sector remains low. The MOH in collaboration with the MOF could consider increasing
       funding for health through taxes on sweetened beverages as Honduras is proposing to do;
       or could look into other options that might be feasible -- for example, Gabon has a levy on
       mobile phone companies, Lao PDR has hydropower levies, and Pakistan taxes
       pharmaceutical companies. Ensuring the timely flow of resources will also be essential.

   3. Develop, cost, and implement an HR strategy that attracts and retains health workers,
      and that also addresses inequities in access. This strategy could include a
      communications strategy to encourage more people to pursue a career in the health sector,
      improved distribution of staff across health areas, and ways to retain staff. Changes in
      training would need to be coordinated with the MOE. The MOH could also consider (a)
      reclassifying professional nurses to make their salaries commensurate with their
      qualifications and functions, and identifying the main factors behind high dropout rates in
      nursing schools; and (b) strengthening the training of auxiliary nurses and ensuring that all
      training schools adopt a common approach. Health human resource management could be
      strengthened by: (i) looking into the feasibility of offering non-monetary incentives (e.g.
      special training, public recognition) to complement recently established monetary
      incentives to attract staff to work in rural and remote areas which have been challenging to
      finance given the MOH’s limited budget; (ii) continuing to explore and use mobile
      technologies in training and providing health services (such as online consultations); (iii)
      implementing measures to mitigate the politicization of appointments and ensure that
      persons hired meet the requirements of their TORs by implementing random technical
      audits, and (iv) implementing a standardized and transparent process of evaluating staff
      performance with well-defined incentives and sanctions that are systematically applied.

   4. Prepare and implement a costed action plan to strengthen pharmaceutical
      management and develop an integrated public policy on medicines. Given that
      medicines make up approximately 64% of out-of-pocket costs, there is a need to improve
      the institutional capacity of the sector to manage pharmaceuticals and ensure the
      availability of a set of essential drugs in primary health care centers. Having an integrated,
      coordinated public policy on medicines, together with improvements in planning and
      budgeting, procurement, and other steps along the supply chain including monitoring and
      supervision could contribute to reducing stock-outs of essential medicines.

           VII.3      Social Protection and Labor

Social security spending has remained stagnant in recent years and is one of the lowest in
CA; the non-contributory component has low coverage and generosity, and is poorly
targeted. Spending in the main contributory regime, IVS, has not improved in recent years,
varying around 1.9% of GDP. This is the lowest share spent on social security in CA. Coverage
rose in absolute and relative terms, but not enough to improve Guatemala’s position in CA in this
regard either. The 23% of the elderly who are protected is among the lowest in LAC. Equity

                                               119
                  Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


remains an issue for both the contributive and non-contributive regimes, but adequacy of benefits
is fair especially for low income workers in the contributive regime. The social pension has
maintained relatively stable spending but is less generous than other countries in CA. In addition,
there is still room to enhance targeting especially of the poor (lowest two income quintiles).

Some of the main challenges for social assistance in Guatemala are to increase spending and
prioritize interventions that deliver more beneficial impacts to the poorest, such as the CCT
(over poorly targeted utility subsidies). CCT needs to improve its implementation
performance. The adoption of the CCT model bolstered the resources spent in cash transfers paid
directly to the poorest until 2010, with some beneficial impacts already seen in health outcomes
and school attendance. Some of these outcomes have the potential to impact poverty rates, which
should be analyzed further. It is also worth continuing to explore other ways to use the CCT model.
Nevertheless, the program has implementation issues and suffered a budget cut, these should be
addressed to maintain and improve the results already achieved. The CCT also requires an increase
in benefit levels (more important than further expansion of coverage which is already high) and a
change in benefit structure. The current flat benefit irrespectively of the number of children may
not provide sufficient support to larger families, and also does not create sufficient incentives to
comply with transfer conditions for all children in the household. It would be advisable to change
to a “per child” benefit as Honduras has done, and to revise the accountability procedures to
achieve more transparency. A strong anchor with the RUU-N is an opportunity to position the
CCT as the main platform for other social assistance interventions, some of which should be
reconsidered to avoid duplication and create more fiscal space for the CCT. Given budget
constraints, it may also advisable to restrict coverage of the CCT to the extreme poor only (another
recent change made in Honduras). Revising the conditionalities of the CCT is another aspect to
consider; there is scope, for instance, to include new areas in the program like nutrition-related
outcomes or secondary education. Additional fiscal space could also be obtained by reducing and
phasing down untargeted utility subsidies, such as for electricity and transport.

The labor market sector faces important challenges derived from the nature of the workforce
in Guatemala. An important labor market challenge relates to young people aged 25 years or
younger, who currently account for 35% of the employed population. Demographic trends have
created a lot of pressure to absorb large numbers of young people in the labor market. This has not
been adequately tackled by labor market programs except for INTECAP, which faces financial
constraints and obstacles to increasing resources for its programs. Intermediation programs are
small and growing very slowly, and passive labor market interventions such as unemployment
insurance schemes are not in place yet. The relatively small unemployment rate hides the
prevalence of this problem among some specific groups, mainly young people who have not
completed secondary education. The main message is the need to design and carry out more
interventions to link youngsters to the labor market; for instance, utilizing the platform provided
by INTECAP’s various packages of technical training, and also ensuring that INTECAP’s training
centers are effectively reaching the youth.

                                                120
                  Guatemala Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


On the institutional side, the launching of MIDES provided a platform to manage the
different programs of the sector under one umbrella; however the Ministry has not been able
to tackle technical deficiencies in implementation yet. MIDES gathers under its sector the most
important programs in Social Assistance; however, it also inherited shortfalls in implementation
related to poor targeting mechanisms, irregular payments and transfers, and generally low
institutional capacities to maintain consistent execution throughout the year and in all areas. Some
progress has been accomplished through the establishment of SISO and RUU-N, but it is not
enough. The sector also faces duplication issues with agencies implementing different
interventions not coordinating among each other on roles, targeting mechanisms, and strategies.
Coordination could enable a more integrated approach for different target populations (children,
youth, elderly), and geographic areas (urban/rural). Even though some initiatives on this have
started, MIDES has not consolidated itself yet as the coordinating mechanism across sectors and
levels of government.

To tackle fragmentation, the completion and mandatory use of RUU-N by all agencies
implementing social protection interventions is a must. Precisely to avoid fragmentation,
improve targeting, and reallocate scarce resources to those most in need (for examples as subsidies
or social pensions), RUU-N should be strengthened through legislation to mandate its use and by
tying budget allocations to its use, and used effectively as a policy tool to enable more efficient
policy decisions. Improvements also could be made in identifying the beneficiaries in each
household, estimating the type and number of benefits each family receives, and tackling structural
deficiencies in the targeting and coverage of each program.

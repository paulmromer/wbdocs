I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Cabo Verde perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Cabo Verde
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Cabo Verde
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From June to September 2015, 272 stakeholders of the WBG in Cabo Verde were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management
Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on
WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 107 stakeholders participated in the survey
(39% response rate).

Respondents received and completed with the presence of a representative of the independent
fielding agency. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Cabo Verde; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Cabo Verde; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Cabo Verde,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Cabo Verde. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Cabo Verde, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.

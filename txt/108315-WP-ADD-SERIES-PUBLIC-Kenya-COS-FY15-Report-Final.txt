I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Kenya perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues facing Kenya
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Sectoral Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Kenya
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information


II. Methodology
From March to April 2015, 646 stakeholders of the WBG in Kenya were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a Minister,
office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project or
consultants working on WBG-supported projects, local governments, bilateral/multilateral
agencies, private sector organizations, private foundations, the financial sector/private banks,
NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), the media, independent government institutions,
trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the
judiciary branch. A total of 558 stakeholders participated in the survey (86% response rate).

Respondents received the questionnaire via courier or post and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Kenya, their overall attitudes toward the
WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness and results, WBG’s knowledge work and activities, working
with the WBG, the WBG’s future role in Kenya; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to the Country Survey conducted in
FY ’12 (response rate was 62%, N=373). The data were weighted to reach similar stakeholder
compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable comparisons.
Stakeholders who identified themselves as “other? in the stakeholder category options were not
included in these comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the
total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data
reported in the FY ’12 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in this report. For the
weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D
(see page 117).

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position
      Note: For all further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a
       Minister were combined with those from the office of the President. The few respondents
       from the office of a Parliamentarian, youth groups, and the judiciary branch were
       included in the “Other? category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Collaboration with the WBG
        Note: For all further analyses, respondents who indicated that they had previously
         collaborated with the WBG were combined with those who had never collaborated to
         make one group of those not collaborating with the WBG. Those who indicated both (that
         they currently collaborate and had collaborated in the past) were combined with those
         who are currently collaborate to create one group of those collaborating with the WBG.
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly less
         likely to be currently collaborating with the WBG (weighted percentage of respondents
         collaborating = 47%) compared to respondents from the FY ’12 Country Survey
         (weighted percentage of respondents collaborating = 78%)1.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had statistically similar
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean rating = 6.9) compared to
         respondents from the FY ’12 Country Survey (weighted mean rating = 6.8)3.
        Stakeholders: As shown in the chart below, respondents from the office of the President/
         Minister had the highest ratings of familiarity with the WBG whereas respondents from
         faith-based groups had significantly lower familiarity ratings.
        Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were
         significantly, moderately correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness,
         and had small, but significant, correlations with the extent to which the WBG achieves
         development results in Kenya, and the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
         development in Kenya.

IV. General Issues Facing Kenya
Headed in the Right Direction

        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly more
         likely to indicate that Kenya is headed in the right direction (weighted percentage of
         respondents = 90%) compared to respondents from the FY ’12 Country Survey (weighted
         percentage of respondents = 84%)4.

        Stakeholders: Although the majority of respondents across all stakeholder groups
         indicated that Kenya is headed in the right direction, respondents from faith-based groups
         were significantly less likely to indicate that Kenya is headed in the right direction than
         respondents from other stakeholder groups.

Importance of WBG’s Support in Sectoral Areas (continued)

     Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across seven of these
      thirty-one development areas (refer to Appendix B, page 76, for a complete breakdown).
      For the most part, respondents from the office of the President/Minister, local
      government, and the financial sector/private banks gave the highest ratings for the
      importance of the WBG’s involvement in these areas whereas respondents from
      PMUs/Consultants on WBG projects and bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to give
      significantly lower ratings. Those development areas with significant stakeholder group
      differences were:
           Private sector development;
           Foreign direct investment;
           Trade and exports;
           Financial markets;

      Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across seven of these
       twenty-eight development areas (refer to Appendix B, page 76, for a complete
       breakdown). For the most part, respondents from NGOs/CBOs and trade unions tended to
       give the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents
       from the office of the President/Minister, local government, the financial sector/private
       banks, and other organizations tended to give significantly lower ratings of effectiveness.
       Those development areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
            Making devolution work and other public sector reform;
            Anti-corruption and improved governance;
            Poverty reduction;
            Gender equity;
            Private sector development;
            Disaster management;
            Job creation/employment;
            Financial markets; and
            Natural resource management.

      Collaboration: Respondents who are collaborating with the WBG had significantly
       higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in nearly all of these development areas
       compared to respondents who are not collaborating with the WBG (refer to Appendix C,
       page 100, for a complete breakdown). The few areas that did not reach statistical
       significance were:
            Making devolution work and other public sector reform;
            Private sector development;
            Equality of opportunity;
            Education; and
            Natural resource management.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kenya, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-eight specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Kenya. The
       areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at making devolution work and other public sector
               reform;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regional integration;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption and improved governance.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Kenya, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

      more likely to indicate that the WBG should collaborate more effectively with
      Government clients (percentage of respondents = 27%), increase capacity development in
      Kenya (24%), reduce the complexity of Bank operational policies and procedures (23%),
      and work faster (16%) compared to respondents who are not collaborating (15%, 11%,
      9%, and 7%, respectively). In contrast, respondents who are not collaborating with the
      WBG were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should provide more
      adequate data on Kenya’s economy (29%) compared to respondents who are
      collaborating (13%).

     Stakeholders: Respondents from local government and bilateral/multilateral agencies
      were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should offer more convening
      services in Kenya compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

     Collaboration: Respondents who are collaborating with the WBG were significantly
      more likely to indicate that the WBG should offer more financial services (percentage of
      respondents = 44%) or that the combination of services is appropriate for Kenya (33%)
      compared to respondents who are not collaborating with the WBG (32% and 23%,
      respectively). In contrast, respondents who are not collaborating with the WBG were
      significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should offer more convening services

Appendix D: Responses to All Questions by Year
Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Although the FY12 and FY15 samples were fairly
similar, the samples from both years were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Mozambique perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mozambique regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mozambique;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Mozambique;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Mozambique;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Mozambique.
    Use data to help inform Mozambique country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In July 2014, 304 stakeholders of the WBG in Mozambique were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 180 stakeholders participated in the survey (59% response rate).
Some respondents received the questionnaires through mail, courier, and email and responded
accordingly. Other respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding
agency face to face. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Mozambique; their
overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge
work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Mozambique; and the
WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’07. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in two
years, which allows for between-year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present
in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the
“other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14 data and
the total number of respondents in two years are slightly different from those of the original data
reported in appendices A, B, C, D, F, G. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year
comparison results, please see appendix E (page 130).
A. General Issues Facing Mozambique: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   Mozambique is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Mozambique, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Mozambique solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity
   building in Mozambique, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s
   work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents
   were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective
   instruments in helping reduce poverty in Mozambique, and in which sectoral areas the WBG
   should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services).
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Mozambique, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Mozambique’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the extent the WBG helps build existing country systems, the importance for the
   WBG to be involved in twenty nine development areas, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness
   across these areas, such as transport, education, security and stabilization, poverty reduction,
   and economic growth.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is adequately staffed locally and the contribution of the WBG’s
   technical assistance to solving Mozambique’s development challenges.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Mozambique: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Mozambique and which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country. They were asked what areas the
   country would benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would
   benefit most from other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Mozambique, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic locations.

        “regional conflict and tensions? and “domestic private sector development? than
        respondents from Centre and South.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 66) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
        “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
        areas.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the
        Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Mozambique,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in
        Mozambique. The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and,
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mozambique, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at security and stabilization.

Appendix E: Responses to All Questions by Year1
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.
FY ’07 Number of comparable respondents = 154  FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 153
By weighting, FY07 and FY14 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.      Between 2008 and 2012 the urban/rural poverty divide substantially narrowed
down, which was the result of relatively stable rural and rising urban poverty rates. 37
percent of the Kyrgyz population lives in urban areas; most of them in the oblasts Bishkek, Osh,
and Jalal-Abad. Poverty estimates based on annual per capita consumption (deflated) in 2012
prices and the 2012 absolute poverty line indicate that urban poverty increased by 10 percentage
points from 25 percent in 2008 to 35 percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Rural poverty, in turn, remained
relatively stable at 40 percent except for a small peak in 2010, which was a year during which
the Kyrgyz Republic experienced political instabilities and political unrest.

Source: Own calculations based on KIHS 2008 – KIHS 2012.
Notes: To allow consistent time comparisons, annual per capita consumption (deflated) is expressed in prices of 2012 and the
2012 poverty line is used. Individual level weights are applied. Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals.

2.      Over the same period, food inflation spiked, whereby strong links between
domestic and global price movements were observed owed to major import dependence
on food. Except for dairy products, vegetables and fruits, the Kyrgyz Republic is highly
dependent on imports of food, particularly with regard to meat and wheat/wheat flour. The latter
commodity is the most important food item for households in terms of caloric intake. Domestic
wheat and wheat flour prices reached record highs in June 2008 and April 2011, which followed
international price hikes in March/April 2008 and spring 2011.

3.      The high shares of consumption that households dedicate to food, especially among
the poor, leave limited scope to deal with food price surges by economizing on non-food
expenditure. In 2012, Kyrgyz households on average dedicated two thirds of total consumption
to food. These shares amounted to 70 percent among poor households and even three quarters
of total consumption among the extreme poor. This large share of consumption expenditure
directed to food is typical for a low-income country and in its magnitude comparable to other
countries in the region.

4.     Conceptually, food price increases affect household welfare via several channels
and the identification of winners and losers is an empirical question. Within a short time
horizon the first-order impact of food price increases is on a household’s income: Net sellers of
a commodity profit from respective price increases, while net buyers lose. Adjustments in
consumption or production patterns are second-round effects. Further effects can materialize
                                                1
through the labor market or adjusted agricultural output. Thus, the distinction between net food
sellers and buyers is central for the analysis of welfare impacts of food price increases.

5.      In 2012, approximately 15 percent of the population lived in a household defined
as net seller of food. The data source for all analyses are five consecutive cross-sections (2008
– 2012) of the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey (KIHS) that provides measurements of
consumption as main welfare indicator and income as well as related socio-economic
characteristics. Households are defined as net sellers of food if their annual sales of food items
are larger than their annual purchases of similar products, and vice versa for net food buyers.
Food thereby refers to all items for personal consumption. Based on this definition, 15 percent
of the population lived in net food seller households in 2012.

6.       The incidence of net food sellers differs starkly in regional terms, but not across
quintiles of the welfare distribution. In 2012, nearly every fourth rural inhabitant lived in net
food seller households, while this figure amounted to nearly two percent in urban areas (Figure
2). The incidence of net sellers of food furthermore varied across oblasts. In Talas, more than
half of the population was classified as net sellers of food, as were approximately every third
inhabitant in Naryn and every fifth in Batken. In contrast, there were basically no net food
sellers in Bishkek, while the shares in the remaining oblasts ranged between 9 and 16 percent.
The spatial distribution of net sellers of food implies that urban and large shares of the rural
population are vulnerable to food price increase, while those households that might benefit are
mainly located in rural areas. The incidence of net sellers of food was furthermore equally
distributed over per capita consumption quintiles. The poorest ten percent of individuals,
however, are more likely to be net buyers of food.



                                                                                       2
7.      In rural Kyrgyzstan, more than every tenth individual lives in a household that is
a marginal food buyer or seller, thus switches in buyer/seller status on an annual basis
can occur easily. Large fluctuations of the incidence of net sellers and buyers in several oblasts
(e.g. Naryn and Issykul) over years motivated identifying marginal food sellers of buyers, i.e.
households for which net food sales or purchases constituted less than 10 percent of their
consumption. In rural areas, more than 10 percent of individuals lived in 2012 in a household
whose buyer/seller status may change easily on an annual basis depending on respective relative
prices and yields.

8.     There are several differences in characteristics of net food seller and buyer
households, as well as between better and worse off net sellers. Net food seller and buyer
households differ from each other in terms of household size – yet not composition – (net seller
households tend to be larger), gender of household head (net seller households are less often
headed by females), and the composition of food baskets (net sellers consume more milk and
dairy products). There are furthermore differences between worse and better off net food seller
households, whereby being a richer net seller is associated with smaller household size, higher
educational attainment of the head, larger land plot size, more stable types of irrigation and
higher specialization in agricultural activities.

9.      Heads of rural net food seller households are typically engaged at farms and engage
in secondary economic activities above average. More than three quarters of heads of rural
net food seller households worked at farms, in enterprises or collective farm, or engaged in
home production for sale, while only 40 percent of heads of net buyer households worked in
similar activities. The share of heads with a secondary economic activity is considerably higher
among net seller households (13 percent vs. national average of 4 percent in 2012) and those
who do so mainly work in home production for sale. Seasonality affects economic activities,
whereby work at peasant farms and home production are more important in the first quarter of
a year. Finally, heads and especially spouses of rural net food seller households are more likely
to work in the informal sector with no written contract or registered activities.

10.    While heads of net food seller households are more likely to run their own
businesses, they frequently do so on a small scale with only occasional hiring of
wageworkers. Two thirds of heads of rural net food seller households have an own private
enterprise or commercial business, compared to merely 36 percent among rural net food buyers
and 4 percent among urban household heads. Most of them do so on a small scale, i.e. they do
not employ wageworkers. Only 10 percent of them hire labor and in most cases this is not a
permanent, but a seasonal position. This suggests relatively limited labor market linkages
between net food seller and buyer households.

11.     The aspect of food security is different from the discussion of net food seller and
buyer status and explicitly looks at food diversity, frequency, and access. According to
estimates of the World Food Programme (WFP), the level of food insecurity was exceptionally
high in September 2012 when every fourth household was classified as food insecure. On the
oblast level, a higher incidence of net sellers of food is not necessarily associated with higher
levels of food security, and vice versa. While the present analysis does not allow comparing
buyer/seller status and food security for individual households, these findings show that net
food seller/buyer status should not be confused with being food secure or not.

12.    To deal with food price increases, households decreased the share of purchased
food in total food consumption and resorted to coping strategies that could endanger
health, nutritional status and future livelihoods. Between 2008 and 2012, total food

                                                3
purchases expressed as a share of total food consumption declined on average by 15 percentage
points. Declines were more pronounced among the rural than the urban poor (17 and 11
percentage points respectively), which is in line with the finding that the urban poor have
limited access to personal subsidiary plots. Furthermore, according to the WFP, Kyrgyz
households increasingly resorted to food-related coping strategies such as foregoing meals or
limiting portion size and partly chose livelihood-threatening strategies including consuming
seeds, decreasing expenditure or selling productive assets.

13.     Based on data from 2008 and 2012, a decomposition technique was used to quantify
the contributions of demographics and different income sources to welfare improvements.
The methodology does not allow establishing casual effects in the sense of concluding that a
factor caused increases or decreases in poverty rates, yet it identifies the most important factors
for changes in income poverty from a quantitative point of view. For this purpose, income per
capita is decomposed in demographic components (share of adults and share of employed) and
a household’s income sources (labor earnings per employed as well as pensions, agricultural
income, remittances, social assistance, other social benefits, and incomes from rent or lease, all
per adult). Results are disaggregated by location (urban/rural) and net food seller/buyer status.

14.    Incomes from wages and self-employment, agricultural income, pensions and
remittances are on average the four most important income sources, whereby the relative
importance varies by location and seller/buyer status. In 2012, income from wages and self-
employment contributed on average 50 percent to total household income, followed by 27
percent generated through agricultural activities, 12 percent from pensions and 8 percent from
remittances. The importance of different income sources varied regionally, with urban
households being more dependent on incomes from wages and self-employment, while rural
households tended to rely to a larger extent on agricultural income and received more
remittances. Among net sellers of food, the most important income source was agricultural
income that represented on average 60 percent of total income.

15.    Developments in consumption per capita and income per capita followed starkly
different trends between 2008 and 2012. Per capita consumption decreased slightly between
2008 and 2012 on a national level, with stronger declines in urban areas. Rural areas, in turn,
experienced increases in per capita consumption between 2010 and 2012, resulting in
decreasing poverty rates. Income per capita, however, followed an upward trend in both urban
and rural areas over the same period in time, as well as across all quintiles of consumption.
Different reasons for diverging trends in welfare based on income or consumption per capita
are conceivable, including measurement error and genuine behavioral changes in savings
patterns.

16.     Agricultural income was the largest contributor to reductions in the income
poverty headcount and gap index among net sellers of food and also accounted for
equalizing effects. Income poverty was identified based on annual income per capita in
constant 2012 KGS and the absolute poverty line in 2012. Nearly half of the percentage point
reduction in income poverty was driven by agricultural income (8 percentage points) for net
sellers of food (Figure 3). Pensions accounted for further four percentage points. Net food
buyers, in turn, profited most from wages and pensions (8 percentage points respectively) and
to a smaller degree from agricultural activities (4 percentage points). The relative importance
of different income sources was similar for reductions in the income poverty gap index. Finally,
looking at changes in the Gini coefficient as measure of income inequality, agricultural income
played an equalizing role among net sellers of food.


                                                4
17.     Labor earnings and pensions were the most important drivers of income poverty
reduction in urban and rural areas of the Kyrgyz Republic respectively. In urban areas,
roughly half of the income poverty reduction was driven by labor earnings (9 percentage points)
and to a smaller amount pensions (7 percentage points). The third most important source was
agricultural income (4 percentage points). Welfare improvements in rural areas, in turn, could
mostly be attributed to pensions and to a slightly smaller extent to agricultural activities and
wages. The results are qualitatively similar for reductions in the income poverty gap index.

18.     The contributions of demographics as well as other income from public and private
sources to income poverty reduction were on average marginal. Net job creation as reflected
by the share of employed, the demographic dividend as represented by the share of adults, and
further private (remittances and help from local friends and relatives; income from property,
rent, or lease) and public (social assistance and other social benefits) income sources did on
average not or only marginally contribute to changes in income poverty.

19.     Using 2012 data, the short-run welfare impacts of future increases of food in
general and wheat and wheat flour specifically were simulated and results disaggregated
across different population subgroups. The conceptual framework for estimating the impact
of price changes on poverty is the welfare effect proposed by (Deaton, 1989), which determines
first-order effects of food price changes. The baseline scenario assumes constant input prices,
proportional changes in consumer and producer prices, and no adjustments in consumption and
production patterns. Economy-wide effects such as changes in wage-rates or changing
agricultural output are equally not taken into account.

20.    Food price increases of 5, 10, and 15 percent are estimated to increase poverty rates
between 2 and 5 percentage points in the baseline scenario. The impact is more adverse in
urban than in rural areas (cf. Figure 4). At the oblast level, welfare gains of food price increases
outweigh losses on average only in Talas, the oblast with the highest incidence of net sellers of

                                                                                                                                                  5
food. In contrast, the estimated poverty impacts are most detrimental in the predominantly
urban oblasts Bishkek and Chui, where poverty rates could rise between three up to eight
percentage points depending on the magnitude of the price increase. Among the group of net
sellers, poverty rates are estimated to decrease between 1.1 and 5.8 percentage points.

21.     Not only can virtually no individual in the bottom quintile of the consumption
distribution exit from poverty through increased profits arising from higher food prices,
but they also on average deepen poverty among the already poor. Under the baseline, only
a 15 percent price increase possibly enables very few individuals in the bottom 20 percent to
increase their welfare levels above the poverty line, yet it could push on average every fifth
individual currently in the third quintile into poverty. Moreover, a 5 percent food price rise
increases the average shortfall from the poverty line expressed as a percentage of this threshold
by 1.2 percentages points; a 15 percent price increases widens the gap by 3.7 percentage points.

22.     A 15 percent increase in prices of wheat flour increases national poverty rates by
2 percentage points in the short run. In the baseline scenario national poverty rates are
estimated to rise from 38.1 to 40.1 percent following a 15 percent increases in wheat flour
prices; and to 41.5 percent as a consequence of a 30 percent increase. The regional poverty
impact of wheat flour price increases is most adverse in Osh. Further, in addition to reducing
welfare levels of individuals so that they fall below the poverty line, poverty among individuals
currently classified as poor deepens. Only very few net sellers of wheat and what flour exit
from poverty as a result of price increases, reflecting that poor households are less likely to fall
into this category.

23.     Estimates of the poverty impact of wheat flour price increases illustrate that price
increases in one commodity alone can lead to large welfare losses. Individuals who live in
households that are self-sufficient or on net sell wheat/wheat flour tend to be better off, while
the poor are likely to depend to a larger extent on wheat flour purchases. Not only does this
increase the vulnerability of households to wheat price increases as there is limited scope to
economize on non-food expenditure, but it also implies that very few individuals can exit from
poverty due to higher wheat flour prices in the short-run. While estimates that take into account
adjustments in consumption and production patterns suggest slightly less adverse effects, one
may not forget that reducing consumption, e.g. through skipping meals or reducing portion
sizes, among already poorer households could have detrimental effects on nutritional status and
health in the longer run.

24.     The potential of less adverse welfare impacts of food price increases in the long run
does not reduce the need for protection against food price shocks in the short-run. Several
studies concluded that poverty impacts of food price increases might be less adverse or even
positive if one considers a longer time horizon during which effects on wage rates or
adjustments in agricultural outputs can materialize. The approach adopted in this note, however,
deliberately focused on short-term losses, as this is also the time frame in which households
have to find other ways to deal with food price increases. As evidence collected by the WFP
suggests that households resorted between 2010 and 2012 to coping strategies that could
jeopardize their nutritional status, health and future livelihoods, the question remains of how
one can protect individuals against future price shocks in the short run.

25.     The results of this note guide to several questions for further research. First, it could
be explored to what extent the survey’s panel component can be used to go beyond the analysis
of trends in net food buyer/seller status to exploring dynamic of switches in status at the
household level. Panel data could furthermore be used to investigate coping strategies and their
impact on outcomes such as nutritional status, health, or livelihoods. Second, in light of low
agricultural productivity, further research should look into levels of productivity among net
food sellers and buyers respectively, barriers to increased productivity and the role of land
fragmentation. Third, research on the actual relationship between consumer and producer prices
could inform future simulation exercises and decision-making based on it.

26.     In addition to food prices, internal migration is another phenomenon that one
should take into account when investigating diverging trends in urban and rural poverty
rates. The point of departure of this note was the puzzle of diverging poverty trends in urban
and rural Kyrgyzstan that led to convergence in poverty rates. While the spatial distribution of
net sellers and buyers implies indeed that short-run winners of food price increases tend to be
located in rural areas, the role of food prices alone tells merely one part of the story. Particularly
internal migration from rural to urban areas could contribute to understanding diverging poverty
trends if on average poorer households decided to move to cities and thus deserve equal
attention in the discussion of poverty trends over the urban/rural divide.

1.1    Between 2008 and 2012, increases in the Kyrgyz Republic’s national poverty rates
masked divergent trends in urban and rural areas. On a national level, poverty rates
increased slightly between 2008 and 2012. Adverse social and political events in 2010 were
followed by increases in poverty rates by four percentage points. These rates subsequently
remained stable, so that the national poverty rate amounted to 38 percent of the population in
2012. Whereas rural poverty rates decreased after a peak in 2010 to eventually 40 percent in
2012, urban poverty, however, has been continuously on the rise since 2008. As a result, the
urban-rural poverty divide has substantially narrowed in recent years (see Figure 1.1).1

1.2     Two thirds of the Kyrgyz Republic’s population lives in rural areas. The incidence
and distribution of the rural and urban populations across all oblasts is shown in Table A.2. The
share of the Kyrgyz population that resides in rural areas amounted to 63 percent in 2012, which
constituted a slight decline compared to 2008. The least urbanized oblasts are Naryn, Talas, and
Chui, while the oblasts with the highest degrees of urbanization are the completely urban
Bishkek and, though to a much smaller extent, Osh. In terms of distribution, the majority of the
urban population lives in the capital Bishkek and in Osh, which is Kyrgyzstan’s most populated
oblast. Most of the rural population is located in Osh as well, followed by Jalal-Abad and Chui.
In international comparison, the degree of urbanization in the Kyrgyz Republic is lower than
the Asian and African averages of 48 percent and 40 percent respectively (United Nations,
2014, p. 1).

1.3     Increases in aggregate urban poverty rates between 2008 and 2012 were driven by
poverty descents in Bishkek and urban Batken, Chui, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. In the three
oblasts with the largest shares of the urban population, namely Bishkek, Osh, and Jalal-Abad,
urban poverty rates increased between 2008 and 2012 by 5, 28, and 29 percentage points
respectively. Urban poverty rates similarly increased in Batken and Chui. In contrast, poverty
rates decreased in the urban parts of Issykul, Naryn and Talas, yet only a small share of the
overall urban population resides in these places.

1.4     Over the same period, food price increases and their welfare impacts triggered
concerns around the globe and were also highly relevant for the Kyrgyz Republic. The
poor in low-income countries spend a major part of their income on food. In the Kyrgyz
Republic, extremely poor households dedicate nearly three quarters of their consumption to
food items. There is thus limited scope to reduce non-food expenditure in order to compensate
for surges in food prices, rendering the issue of food price increases highly relevant for welfare
analyses. The differential impact of rising food prices on rural and urban populations
respectively was previously mentioned as a conceivable factor contributing to convergence in
poverty trends over this divide (World Bank, 2012, p. 5).

1.5     This note aims at exploring changes in household welfare, focusing on the role of
food prices and future vulnerabilities to price shocks. The note proceeds as follows. The
second sections sets out the macroeconomic background and the development of international
and domestic food prices. The following section looks at links between food prices and welfare
impacts, which motivates a description of the incidence of net sellers and buyers of food, a
profile of these households and their labor market characteristics. Section 4 aims to quantify
the forces behind distinct welfare developments in urban and rural areas and looks at
demographic changes and changes in labor and non-labor income, including incomes from
agricultural activities. While this section takes an ex post point of view, section 5 finally
simulates ex ante the short term poverty impact of future food price increases, taking into
account heterogeneous effects on different population subgroups.

                      2. MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND
2.1     The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, landlocked country, ranks among the poorest
economies in the Europe and Central Asia region. In 2013, the Gross National Income (GNI)
per capita amounted to USD 1,210 (Atlas method), which was the lowest value in the region
except for Tajikistan (USD 990) (World Bank, 2015b), and which classifies it as a lower-middle
income country as of 2014 (World Bank, 2014a). A series of internal and external shocks hit
the country in the last decade. Political instabilities and social unrests in 2005 and 2010
coincided with the consequences of the global financial and food price crises of 2009 and 2011.
Kyrgyzstan’s landlocked status and its strong dependence on foreign sources of energy made it
particularly vulnerable to these exogenous shocks.

2.2     Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth depicted strong volatilities between 2008
and 2012. GDP grew at an average rate of 3.3 percent annually over 2008 to 2012, yet rates
were highly volatile (Figure 2.1). Growth volatility was particularly marked in manufacturing,
construction and trade and derived from limited economic diversification in combination with
political instabilities. The contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP growth was limited as
productivity levels and its export potential have been low.

2012, net of workers’ remittances amounted to USD 1,917 millions and is estimated to amount
to USD 2,200 millions in 2013 (World Bank, 2014b). As such, remittances have been a major
source of growth for aggregated private consumption.

2.5     Despite its limited importance for GDP growth, one third of total employment
remains in the agriculture sector. The structure of employment has changed over the last
decade, with the agriculture sector being the only sector that employed fewer workers in 2012
than in 2002, whereas occupations in construction, hospitality, trade, and transport and
communications expanded in terms of their share in total employment (World Bank, 2014b, p.
8). Although labor productivity increased in agriculture and fisheries over the last decade, the
value added generated by the agriculture sector constituted less than 20 percent to GDP, while
one third of the employed worked in this sector (World Bank, 2014b, p. 8; 2015b).

2.6     Kyrgyzstan’s agricultural productivity is low in comparison to neighboring
countries. Table 2.1 depicts the development of selected yields for wheat, potatoes, and oilseeds
in neighboring Central Asian countries and the Russian Federation. The figures show that
Kyrgyzstan has comparatively low yields for example for wheat (particularly compared to the
Russian Federation), potatoes (most strongly when compared to Tajikistan or Uzbekistan), and
oilseeds (lowest yield in comparison to all other considered countries). Furthermore,
agricultural output per worker is in the region only lower in Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan lags behind
Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation and increasingly also Uzbekistan that followed a more
positive trend towards higher agricultural productivity (Figure 2.2). Importantly, low
agricultural productivity is a serious concern with regard to food availability, which is one of
                                                11
four dimensions of food security in addition to access, utilization, and stability (World Bank,
2011, p. 1).

2.7     Except for dairy products, vegetables and fruits, the Kyrgyz Republic is highly
dependent on imports of food, particularly in terms of wheat (flour) and meat.
Kyrgyzstan’s trade balance is negative for all processed food items except for dairy products
and amounted to USD 460 millions in 2013 (see Table A.4). The negative trade balance for
wheat/meslin flour was USD 41 millions in the same year, as well as USD 84 millions for wheat
and meslin. The following further food and agricultural products constituted the largest shares
in the negative trade balance: Meat and edible meat offal (USD 110 millions), animal/vegetable
fats and oils (USD 78 millions), cocoa (USD 69 millions), and sugar (USD 65 millions).
Imports are thus widely diversified across different product groups, while the main exported
products are fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.

2.8     Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation are the largest suppliers of imports of
wheat flour and wheat. In 2012, nearly all imports of wheat flour originated from Kazakhstan
and the Russian Federation (USD 29 and 1 million(s) respectively) (International Trade Centre,
2014). Virtually all imports of wheat came from Kazakhstan as well (USD 88 millions). In the
same year, imports of meat and edible meat offal mainly stemmed from the United States of
America, China, India, and Ukraine. Exports of vegetables, fruits and dairy products, on the
other hand, were largely directed to Kazakhstan, Turkey, and the Russian Federation
(International Trade Centre, 2014).

2.9     In regional comparison the Kyrgyz Republic’s food price levels are below average.
The results for the 2011 International Comparison Program’s (ICP’s) price indices for food and
non-alcoholic beverages for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries are
shown inTable 2.2, with the value of 100 referring to the world level. For an average household,
food items and non-alcoholic beverages are relatively more expensive in the Kyrgyz Republic
than in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova and the Ukraine. They are roughly similar to Tajikistan,
but below the levels in the remaining CIS countries and below the average across these nine
economies.

2.10 The spikes in headline inflation in 2008 and 2011 were largely owed to rising food
prices, with heavy dependence on food imports implying strong links between global and
domestic price movements. Monthly data for headline inflation from January 2007 to August
2014 depicted two large spikes in 2008 and 2011 that were to a large extent driven by sharply
increasing food prices (Figure 2.3). After headline inflation had returned in 2009 to levels before
the 2007 commodity price shocks, it again accelerated between mid-2010 and mid-2011 as
prices of key global commodities (wheat, corn, sugar, as well as energy and oil) soared.
Compared to other regions in the world, these spikes have been particularly intense and declined
at a comparatively slower pace (Al-Eyd, Amaglobeli, Shukurov, & Sumlinski, 2012, p. 5).
Simulations of the impact of global wheat price shocks on inflation by the same authors
suggested that the Kyrgyz Republic as net importer of wheat was particularly vulnerable (Al-
Eyd et al., 2012, pp. 14-15).

2.11 Wheat prices peaked at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013 in the magnitude of
spikes in 2011. In the Kyrgyz Republic, wheat flour is the most important food item in terms
of caloric intake (WFP, 2013, p. 4). As outlined above, domestic prices are heavily influenced
by international prices due to heavy import dependence (Figure 2.4). Following a peak in 2008
and subsequent decline in 2009, international and domestic prices soared again starting mid-
2010 and peaked a second time in the first quarter of 2011. After a short episode of declines in
prices, a similar growth episode was observed at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013.
Notably, domestic prices appear more elastic as international prices rise, while declines in
international prices are transmitted less promptly (Caccavale, de Brouwer, & Flämig, 2013, p.
15). More recently, retail prices for wheat flour (first grade) have remained relatively stable in
the Kyrgyz Republic, yet showing a slight upward trend. Furthermore, retail prices of meat have
remained at a record high over the last months and only decreased slightly recently, which has
raised concerns about food access and the diets of the most vulnerable households (WFP, 2014,
p. 3; 2015).

2.12 Different domestic markets show fairly similar price patterns, whereby wheat
flour prices tended to be higher in Bishkek and more recently in Osh. Figure 2.5 shows the
development of wheat flour prices in five domestic markets, namely Batken, Bishkek,
Jalalabad, Naryn, and Osh. Price correlations are remarkably high, indicating similar patterns
in price signals across these different markets. In addition, price correlations with international
prices are equally strong, with the exception of Osh that is likely to be owed to its geographical
position (Caccavale et al., 2013, p. 17). Overall, wheat flour prices tended to be higher in
Bishkek and Osh than in Batken, Jalal-Abad, and Naryn. In 2011/12 and particularly since 2014
wheat flour prices in Osh have exceeded prices in other Kyrgyz markets. According to
Caccavale et al. (2013), this suggests increasing difficulty in channeling supply to Osh, while
market integration in general has been increasing (p. 17).

2.13 After a slow-down in 2013, headline and food inflation showed upward trends in
the first half of 2014. In 2013, declining global food prices restricted the effect of food price
increases at the domestic level. Further, energy and fuel inflation was limited by the stability of
international energy prices and reductions in domestic prices (World Bank, 2014b, pp. 4-5). In
2014, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic expected increases in the 2014 inflation rate
due to rapid currency devaluations and increasing international food prices and estimated that
the average inflation in the last quarter of the year would amount to 10.2 percent
(National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014b, p. 22).

                                       A.     FOOD PRICES AND WELFARE

3.1     In 2012, Kyrgyz households dedicated on average two thirds of total consumption
to food. Between 2008 and 2012, the share of total consumption spent on food increased
slightly (Figure 3.1). Over this period, food shares have remained remarkably stable for poor
individuals who spent approximately three quarters and 70 percent of their consumption on
food respectively. In contrast, the food shares in total consumption increased from 60 to 64
percent for individuals living in non poor households. Furthermore, analyzing differences
across regions, food consumption shares for individuals residing in urban areas remained
virtually constant, whereas residence in rural areas was associated with increasing budget shares
spent on food (from 63 to 69 percent) between 2008 and 2012. Overall, high shares of food in
total consumption imply large vulnerabilities of households to food price shocks, as they have
only limited scope to offset food price increases by economizing on non-food expenditure.

3.2     Expressed in value terms, per capita food consumption declined in urban and
increased in rural areas between 2008 and 2012. Figure 3.2 shows the development in per
capita consumption in urban and rural as well as among poor and non poor individuals, divided
in the value of per capita food and non-food consumption. Prices are expressed in 2012 KGS
and the value of food consumption is additionally adjusted for regional price differences to
ensure consistent comparisons across time and space. The value of food consumption increased
in rural areas, whereas households cut back on expenditure on non-food items. As a result,
annual per capita consumption (deflated) changed only slightly over this period. In urban areas,
in turn, the value of food consumption decreased between 2008 and 2012 and households
equally economized on non-food expenditure. As a result, urban per capita consumption on

                                                                    16
average declined over this period as reflected by increasing urban poverty rates. Finally, the
value of food consumption increased slightly among individuals living in poor households.

3.3     The large share of consumption expenditure directed to food is typical for a low-
income country and in its magnitude comparable to other countries in the region. The
budget share allocated to food and beverages is usually negatively associated with a count ry’s
level of income. Based on 2005 International Comparison Program (ICP) data, Muhammad,
Seale, Meade, and Regmi (2011) estimated that households in low-income countries spent on
average roughly half of their budget on food, beverages, and tobacco (p. 4). Figures for other
developing countries within the Caucasus and Central Asia region further contextualize the
findings for the Kyrgyz Republic. According to the database on food security indicators by the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2014), the share of food consumption in total
consumption for the lowest income quintile of the respective country’s population amounted to
74 percent in Tajikistan (2007), 64 percent in Armenia (2005), 62 percent in Azerbaijan (2006),
54 percent in Georgia (2005) and 52 percent in Kazakhstan (2011).

3.4   Food price increases affect household welfare via several channels (cf. Isik-
Dikmelik, 2010). The first-order, short-run effect of food price changes is on a household’s
                                             17
income. Whether this effect is positive or negative depends on whether a household
predominantly sells or buys a commodity. Second-round effects occur when households adapt
consumption or production patterns in response to price changes accordingly. Further effects
materialize, third, through the labor market. A price increase in a commodity enhances demand
for the factor that is mainly needed to produce it. This may either lead to higher wage rates or,
in regions where labor is in surplus, more employment. Finally, multiplier effects can lead to
stronger demand for non-agricultural products and services if household incomes increase.

                       B.    DEFINITION OF NET FOOD SELLERS AND BUYERS

3.5     Particularly in the short run, the distinction between net food seller and net food
buyer households is central for the analysis of welfare impacts of food price increases. We
define net sellers of food as those households whose sales of food items are larger than their
purchases of similar products. Accordingly, net buyers of food are those households whose
purchases of food products are larger than their sales of similar products. We look at the value
of food bought and sold (rather than its weight) and determine the values of food bought at
consumer prices and of food sold at producer prices (Ataman Aksoy & Isik-Dikmelik, 2010, p.
116; WFP, 2009). Further, the net benefit ratio (NBR) is calculated to analyze distributional
impacts of supply or price shocks. It is defined as the net sales of food as percentage of total
household consumption (cf. Deaton, 1989; WFP, 2009). It therefore takes positive values for
net sellers of food and negative values for net buyers of food. The NBR provides an indication
of the budget share of food and will be used later in this note to simulate short-run impacts of
food price changes.

3.6     The definition of food encompasses all food items for personal consumption. The
data source for the statistical analyses is the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey (KIHS 2008
– 2012) that provides accurate measurements of consumption as main welfare indicator and
related socio-economic characteristics. Food is defined as all items that are listed in the KIHS’
purchases diary as food items for personal consumption. It excludes tobacco products 2 and
includes expenditures for eating out. Analyses that investigate links to the international trade
dimension frequently look at selected commodities that are internationally traded. For the sake
of poverty analyses, however, the usually high degree of substitutability among different food
items is taken into account by embracing a food definition that includes all food items that are
listed in the diary of consumption (cf. Ataman Aksoy & Isik-Dikmelik, 2010, p. 116). The
simulations in section 5 additionally look at wheat and wheat flour specifically.

3.7     Households are defined as net sellers or buyers of food on an annual basis. A
household’s sales and purchases of food are compared over the time frame of one year so that
seasonal variations matter to a smaller extent. Results are presented for five consecutive years
(2008 – 2012). The analysis is restricted by the fact that it is based on cross-sectional data,
which implies that analyses of switches in seller/buyer status of specific households between
years are not possible. These dynamics could occur due to changing yields and prices of crops
in a specific year or cropping patterns (cf. Ataman Aksoy & Isik-Dikmelik, 2010, p. 117).

3.8    The extent to which sales of food items mainly stem from crops or livestock differs
across oblasts. In Naryn, Chui, and Jalal-Abad, sales of livestock (e.g. cows and sheep) and

2
    In the Kyrgyz Republic, a certain share of wheat crops is used as fodder instead of for human consumption due
    to its minor quality. Since the definition of net food sellers and buyers is only concerned with sales of food
    items, sales of wheat stemming from personal subsidiary plots are adjusted accordingly. Estimates of the share
    of fodder in production are based on information retrieved from the Food Security Bulletins that are published
    quarterly by the National Statistical Committee (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013).

processed items from livestock, such as meat or dairy products, contribute the largest share to
total food sales (including food sales of both net sellers and net buyers of food) (Figure 3.3). In
Talas and on a smaller scale in Issykul, Osh and Batken, in turn, mainly crops (such as wheat,
maize, or rice) and products produced from crops (e.g. wheat flour) are sold on markets. Note
that the composition of food sales specifically among net food sellers does not differ markedly
(Figure A.1 in the appendix).

                            C.     PROFILE OF NET FOOD SELLERS AND BUYERS

3.9     In 2012, 15 percent of the population lived in a household defined as net seller of
food. Net sellers of food can potentially profit from food price increases in the short run,
whereas net buyers of food are particularly vulnerable to food price shocks. In the Kyrgyz
Republic, the share of potential losers from food price increases (85 percent) is thus more than
five times larger than the share of possible winners (15 percent) (Table 3.1). On a national level,
the share of individuals living in net food seller households declined slightly over the period
from 2008 to 2012, with a small increase in 2010. Rising food prices therefore did not encourage
more individuals to specialize in agricultural activities in the medium run.

3.10 In cross-national comparisons of low-income countries, the share of net food seller
households varies widely, with the Kyrgyz Republic being located at the lower end of the
range. In a study of nine low-income countries by Ataman Aksoy and Isik-Dikmelik (2010),
the incidence of net seller households varied greatly between 8 percent in Zambia in 1998 and
52 percent in Cambodia in 1999.3 The remaining countries were either concentrated at the lower
end of this range (8 percent in Nicaragua in 2001; 10 percent in Bolivia in 2002; 11 percent in
Peru in 2003) or at the higher end (41 percent in Ethiopia in 2000; 41 percent in Madagascar in
2001; 45 percent in Vietnam in 1998). The figures in the Kyrgyz Republic tend towards the

3
     These figures are based on a definition of food that includes all food products. However, Ataman Aksoy and
     Isik-Dikmelik (2010) refer to net food seller households as percentage of all households, and not to individuals
     living in net food seller households as percentage of total population.
                                                               19
lower end of this range and come closest to those in Bangladesh (13 percent in 2000).
Furthermore, Zezza et al. (2009) estimated that seven percent of Tajik households were net
sellers of food staples in 2003.4

3.11 On average, net sales of food constituted 33 percent of total household consumption
(as proxy for household income) for net food sellers, while net food buyers dedicated 43
percent of total household consumption to net food purchases. In total, the NBR took the
value -0.32 in 2012, which means that net food purchases constituted on average 32 percent of
households’ total consumption. The negative NBR further reflects that the Kyrgyz Republic is
a net importer of food (cf. Table A.4 in the appendix). Distinguishing between net food sellers
and buyers, the NBR amounted to 0.33 and -0.43 respectively, indicating that net sales of food
represented on average 33 percent of net food sellers’ total household consumption (as proxy
for household income), while net buyers of food dedicated 43 percent of total consumption to
net purchases of food. Overall, the share of net food purchases in total household consumption
was largest in urban areas and among poor households, indicating the vulnerabilities of those
households to food price surges.

3.12 The incidence of net food sellers differs starkly in regional terms and is strongly
concentrated in rural areas. Not surprisingly, the lion’s share of net sellers of food resides in
rural areas. In 2012, nearly every fourth rural inhabitant lived in net food seller households,
while this figure amounted to merely two percent in urban areas. Said differently, 95 percent of
all net sellers of food resided in rural parts of the country. Moreover, the incidence of net sellers
of food varied over oblasts in the same year. In Talas, more than half of the population was
classified as net sellers of food, as were approximately every third inhabitant in Naryn and
every fifth in Batken. In contrast, there were basically no net food sellers in Bishkek, while the
shares in the remaining oblasts ranged between 9 and 16 percent. The spatial distribution of net
sellers of food implies that urban and large shares of the rural population are vulnerable to food
price increase, while those households that might benefit are mainly located in rural areas.

3.13 Several oblasts depicted stark fluctuations in the incidence of net sellers of food
over time, that is, households switched between being net sellers and buyers of food and/or
vice versa. In Bishkek and Osh, the incidence of net sellers of food remained relatively stable
between 2008 and 2012, while Chui and Batken depicted a relatively consistent trend towards
fewer and Talas towards more individuals in net seller households over this time period (Table
3.1). In contrast, the incidence of net sellers fluctuated substantially in Issykul, Jalal-Abad, or
Naryn. Unfortunately, cross-sectional data do not allow investigating to what extent switches
from net food seller to net food buyer status – and vice versa – occurred on the household level.
Yet, one can observe how many individuals lived in households that had a NBR that was close
to zero, as for these households relatively small changes in sales or purchases of food could
change their buyer/seller status.

Notes: Seller: NBR>0.1; Marginal: 0.1>=NBR>=-0.1; Buyer: NBR<-0.1 NBR denotes net benefit ratio, which is defined as net sales of food over total household consumption. Consumption quintiles
are based on deflated annual per capita consumption. Individual level weights are applied. *** p<0.01; ** p<0.05; * p<0.1.

3.14 In rural areas, more than ten percent of individuals live in households whose status
as net food sellers or buyers may change easily over time. Table 3.2 adds a category for
households whose net food sales or purchases constitute ten or less percent of total household
consumption. This means, it shows a category for marginal net food sellers and buyers whose
status may change easily on an annual basis, for example depending on yields or prices of
specific crops. In 2012, more than every tenth individual lived in such a household in rural
areas, and eight percent on a national level. The distinction between net sellers and buyers is
more clear-cut in Bishkek, Chui and Osh where fewer individuals live in households that fall
in this category, whereas every fifth individual in Naryn and 15 percent of the population in
Issykul in 2012 lived in a households where sales and purchases of food approximately
balanced each other.

3.15 Understanding changes in the incidence of net sellers of food at the oblast level
benefits from adding some regional context. In Talas, the consistent trend towards more
individuals living in net food seller households between 2008 (33 percent) and 2012 (61
percent) is remarkable. Over the past decade there has been a shift towards a new export-
oriented monocrop, namely haricot beans (Tilekeyev, 2013). Now more than 90 percent of the
country’s bean production is located in this oblast. After a large decline in bean exports in 2008,
exports increased again substantially, which is in line with the observed increasing trend in net
sellers. In Issykul, there had been a substantial drop in the number of individuals living in net
food seller households between 2011 (26 percent) and 2012 (16 percent). Food sales stemming
from crops decreased substantially in Issykul between 2011 and 2012, which could be linked
to the 2012 drought when wheat production dropped dramatically (Caccavale et al., 2013, p. 7)
and which would explain the reduced number of net sellers in this year.

3.16 Extremely poor households are more likely to be net food buyers. In 2012, the
incidence of net sellers of food was equally distributed over per capita consumption quintiles
(Table 3.1). Among the poorest ten percent of individuals, however, merely six percent lived in
net food seller households in 2012. This means that the very poorest individuals in the Kyrgyz
Republic had a higher probability of falling in the category of net buyers of food, reinforcing
their vulnerability to food price increases on top of the fact that they spend the highest share of
their total consumption on food consumption already. At the same time, since net sellers of
food are present at all quintiles of the consumption distribution, there is the potential that some
households are lifted out of poverty, while others may be pushed into it.

3.17 There are modest indications that poverty trends developed differently among net
sellers and buyers of food. Between 2008 and 2010, poverty rates increased from 35 to 38
percent for individuals in net food buyer households and from 38 to 44 percent for individuals
in net food seller households. 5 In the subsequent period from 2010 to 2012, the poverty
headcount rate decreased to 36 percent among individuals living in net food seller households,
whereas it remained stable at 38 percent among net food buyers. However, since confidence
intervals for these estimates overlap too widely, it is not possible to draw any robust conclusions
in terms of differences in the development of welfare levels among net food sellers and buyers
over time.

3.18 The composition of the food basket differs between net sellers and buyers of food
as well as between non poor and poor individuals. Net sellers of food tend to consume more
milk and dairy products, yet less sugar than net food buyers (Figure 3.4). Bread and bakery
constitute a larger share in the food baskets of poor individuals compared to non poor

    To allow consistent time comparisons, prices in all years are expressed in prices of 2012 and the 2012 absolute
    poverty line is used. Individual level weights are applied.

individuals. Individuals in non poor households, in turn, consume more milk and dairy products
and meat than the poor (Figure 3.5). Diets of the non poor are thus more diverse and deliver
more animal-proteins than those of individuals that are below the absolute poverty line.

3.19 Despite these differences in the composition of diets, common patterns of changes
in food consumption composition occurred for all types of households between 2008 and
2012. Between 2008 and 2010, particularly the share of bread and bakery, but also oil and fat,
in total food consumption decreased for all individuals, which was mainly offset by rising
shares of meat and sugar (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5). In the two following years, the share of
bread and bakery increased again as did the share of meat, yet at the expense of milk and dairy
products and sugar. Thus, there are signs that individuals adjusted their diets in line with relative
prices of different food product groups.

3.20 Compared to rural net food buyer households, rural net food seller households are
less likely to be headed by a female household head. As the large majority of net seller
households are located in rural areas, Table 3.3 summarizes characteristics of heads of rural net
food seller and buyer households respectively. There is no difference in average age of the head
between these two types of households. Women, however, considerably less frequently head
rural net food seller households than men. Every third rural net buyer household has a female
household head, yet only every fourth rural household that is classified as net food seller. Rural
net food seller and buyer household heads do not differ with regard to the levels of educational
attainment. More than three quarters of household heads in rural areas achieved a secondary
degree and every tenth household head completed higher education. These results are consistent
in both 2008 and 2012.

3.21 Rural net food seller households are on average larger than those classified as net
buyers, but do not differ in their composition. The average size of a net food seller household
amounted to 4.6 individuals in 2012 (as well as in 2008), as compared to 4.1 persons (4.2 in
2008) for net food buyer households (see Table 3.3). In terms of household composition, there
are no differences with respect to the share of children below the ages of 6 and 15 respectively,
the share of adults aged between 15 and 64, and the share of elderly aged 65 or older. These
patterns were similar both in 2008 and 2012.

3.22 Access to land and the average size of personal subsidiary plots among landowners
systematically differ between net seller and buyer households. Naturally virtually every net
seller household holds access to at least one land plot, as do three quarters of households in
which food purchases exceed food sales. Among those households that have access to personal
subsidiary plots, the average size of plots that net seller households own is roughly three times
larger than that of net buyers. There has been, however, a declining trend in the average size of
plots among net seller households between 2008 and 2012, which could indicate a trend towards
more fragmentation of land.

3.23 There is a modest positive association between land plot size and the share of net
sales or purchases in total consumption. Figure 3.7 depicts the relationship between the
natural logarithm of total land plot size and the NBR that takes positive values for net sellers
and negative values for net buyers. Larger positive values of the NBR indicate a larger share of
net food sales in total household consumption. For those households that own land plots, there
is a modest positive correlation between the logarithm of total land plot size and the household’s
NBR that is statistically significant. This means that not only do net food seller households on
average own larger land plots than net buyer households (see Figure 3.6), but the share of net
food sales in total household consumption tends to increase with plot size.

3.24 The urban poor are particularly vulnerable to food prices surges: Not only do food
purchases constitute a substantial share of the urban poor’s consumption, but their ability to
produce own food is also constrained by limited access to land parcels. In 2012, the NBR
amounted to -0.52 and -0.28 for the bottom quintiles of the consumption distribution in urban
and rural areas respectively, highlighting the substantial role of food purchases for poor urban
households. At the same time, the average size of land plots owned by urban and rural
households respectively suggests that the urban poor have limited opportunities to increase own
food production. While urban households in the lowest consumption quintile hold on average
902 m2 of land, this amounts to more than 8,200 m2 for rural households in the lowest
consumption quintile (Table 3.4). As a result, constrained access to land plots can limit the
ability of urban low-income households to adjust production of food items. Note, however, that
rural households nonetheless equally face constraints in adjusting food production, e.g. in terms
of access to stable sources of irrigation or availability of good quality agricultural inputs.

3.25 Differences in the wealth of net food sellers are associated with characteristics of
the households and their heads. In 2012, poor net seller households, defined as those in the
bottom 40 percent of the consumption distribution, differed systematically from rich net food
sellers, defined as those in the top 40 percent of the consumption distribution (Table A.5). First,
keeping everything else equal, the probability of being a rich net food seller increased with the
age of the household head. Further, having a higher educational degree heightened the odds of
being a rich net food seller. Third, smaller households, in terms of both having fewer children
aged 14 or below and being composed of fewer adults (15 to 64), were more likely to be rich
net food sellers. Finally, the number of elderly and the number of employed (defined as those
with non-zero income from wages or self-employment in at least one quarter of the survey year)
within the household were not associated with the household’s wealth.

3.26 Land plot size, stable sources of irrigation and more specialization in agriculture
were associated with higher wealth of net food sellers. In 2012, the relationship between the
logarithm of plot size and being a rich net seller of food was non-linear and bowl-shaped. Thus,
everything else being equal, the probability of being a net food seller in the top two consumption
quintiles as opposed to being among the bottom 40 percent first decreased and then again rose
as plot size increased (Table A.5). Having to rely on natural and thus unstable irrigation sources
such as rivers or even having no irrigation was associated with smaller odds of being a wealthy
net food seller. Further, everything else being equal, a higher share of total household income
generated from agricultural activities was associated with a higher probability of being in the
two top consumption quintiles. In contrast, the probability of being a richer net seller of food
did not increase with higher shares of wages in total household income. Finally, wealthier net
food seller households tended to be located in Issykul and Osh.

3.27 Factors constraining agricultural activities and therefore also adjustment of
production patterns to changes in food prices included limited access to dependable
irrigation systems and agricultural inputs and suboptimal practices of cultivating land.
Low agricultural productivity in comparison to other countries in the region has been a key
problem in Kyrgyzstan (see Table 2.1 and Figure 2.2). A range of causes has been mentioned (cf.
World Bank, 2011, p. 3), including lack of access to pastures and irrigation and/or inadequate
management thereof and low-quality agricultural inputs, for instance seeds or fertilizers.
Further factors are issues regarding financial access and poor marketing infrastructure and
services. These aspects could explain why food price increases have not led to adjustments in
terms of higher numbers of net sellers of food. Moreover, input prices, for instance for fuel or
crops used as fodder, increased along with output prices (Guadagni & Fileccia, 2009, pp. 26-
27).

                           D.   LABOR MARKET CHARACTERISTICS

3.28 Labor market characteristics of urban household heads are distinct from rural
ones. Table 3.5 to Table 3.8 provide information on labor market characteristics of household
heads. The tables distinguish first between heads living in urban and rural areas and
subsequently focus on differences between rural net food sellers and buyers. The share of heads
who were in paid or remunerative employment was higher in urban than in rural areas (67 vs.
61 percent in 2012 respectively). Labor market participation of heads declined compared to
2008, yet this reduction was more pronounced in rural areas where it amounted to five
percentage points. At the same time, economic activities of rural spouses increased by three
percentage points to 57 percent in 2012 (see Table 3.9).

3.29 Heads of urban households typically work in enterprises or firms as wageworkers.
In 2012, half of the economically active heads in cities worked in enterprises and firms, while
the remaining half either worked on an individual basis or provided wage work for private
individuals. In rural areas, only one third of the economically active worked at an enterprise,
30 percent engaged at a (peasant) farm, and the remaining heads either worked on an individual
basis or provided wage work for private individuals. Urban household heads much less
frequently ran own enterprises than their rural counterparts, but they typically were
wageworkers. This is also reflected in the different compositions of urban and rural household
incomes respectively (see section 4).

3.30 The domestic urban labor force predominantly works in the service sector, while
the rural one concentrates in the agriculture sector. In urban parts of the Kyrgyz Republic,
50 percent of the domestic labor force works in the service sector, every fifth person in the labor
force is active in the public administration, health or education, and merely 5 percent in
agriculture. The rural labor force, in turn, is strongly concentrated in the agriculture sector (50
percent) and only every fifth person in the labor force is employed in the service sector.

3.31 Zooming in on rural labor markets, every fourth household head in rural areas
engaged in work at their personal subsidiary plots in 2012. Engagement in work at the
personal subsidiary plot was reported regularly in rural areas of the country, though less often
in 2012 (26 percent) than in 2008 (33 percent). It is – not surprisingly – more common among
net sellers of food than among buyers. This type of activity plays only a small and decreasing
role in urban areas, in line with the fact that the average size of land plots is considerably smaller
than in rural parts (Table 3.4).

3.32 Approximately half of the heads of rural net food seller households work at farms
and a further 25 percent at firms or collective farms. First, the share of heads that were in
                                            28
paid or remunerative employment in 2012 was higher among rural net food seller than buyer
households. Second, heads of net seller households most frequently worked at farms (54
percent) and, to a lesser extent, at enterprises or firms (25 percent), while heads of rural net
food buyer households were most often active in an enterprise or organization, provided wage
work for private individuals or worked on an individual basis (36 percent, 20 percent, and 20
percent respectively) (Table 3.5). Compared to 2008, heads of net seller households were
increasingly active at farms while activities at enterprises or collective farms declined. Third,
few heads indicated home production for sale as their principal area of activity, yet more so
among net food sellers (nine percent) than among net food buyers (four percent). Labor market
activities of heads of rural net food seller and buyer households thus differ markedly.
 Heads of rural net food seller households engaged more frequently in additional jobs or employment on top
 of their principal activities than those of net food buyer or urban households. In rural areas, approximately
 five percent of household heads reported some type of additional job or remunerative employment in both
                                                  2008 and 2012 (
3.33 Table 3.6), as compared to only two percent in urban parts. Among them, six out of ten
heads engaged in home production for sale. Particularly heads of rural net seller households
increasingly tended to be active in more than one job (13 percent in 2012 compared to 8 percent
in 2008), whereby home production for sale constituted this additional activity for roughly 60
percent.

3.34 Rural net food sellers frequently run private businesses, but predominantly on a
small scale with merely occasional hiring of wageworkers. Among those household heads
that indicated work at an enterprise, collective or peasant farm or individual commercial
activities as their principal economic activity, rural net food sellers are more likely to have their
own business (68 percent in 2012) than net food buyers (36 percent in the same year) (Table
3.7). The latter, in turn, are most frequently wageworkers (60 percent). Among rural net food
sellers with an own business, the large majority reports that they hire no additional labor, with
only every tenth head employing wageworkers on a seasonal or occasional basis (Table 3.8).
This means that there is the possibility of labor market linkages between rural net food buyers
and sellers, yet most net food seller households operate on a small scale.

3.35 Seasonality affects the main economic activities of household heads in rural labor
markets. Figure 3.8 looks at seasonality in rural labor markets. It depicts the main economic
activities of household heads over the four quarters of 2012, distinguishing between households
classified as net food sellers and buyers. In addition to showing the differences in activities
among heads of net food seller and buyer households, it illustrates that economic activities of
net food sellers follow seasonal patterns. Whereas activities at a peasant farm and home
production for sale are more important in the first quarter of the year, this is later compensated
by wage work for private individuals and work on an individual basis.

3.36 Spouses in net food seller households are equally most likely to engage in farm
activities or home production for sale. A mere focus on the economic activities of household
heads disregards the fact that more household members are economically active and contribute
to a household’s income. The share of spouses that were in paid or remunerative employment
amounted to approximately 55 percent in 2008 and 2012, with relatively similar shares in urban
and rural areas and among rural food sellers and buyers (Table 3.9). Among sellers, roughly half
of the spouses worked at a (peasant) farm (41 percent) and every third spouse at a firm,
enterprise or collective farm in 2012. Among buyers, the majority worked at enterprises (47
percent), while the remaining spouses worked in roughly equal shares on an individual basis,
at farms, or provided wage work for private individuals. Compared to 2008, spouses of rural
net seller households increasingly worked at farms or engaged in home production for sale.
                                                      29
        Household heads and spouses frequently engage in similar economic activities in rural areas.
3.37 Table 3.10 summarizes to what extent household heads and spouses tended to engage in
similar economic activities in rural labor markets in 2012. Overall, every fourth spouse was not
in paid or remunerative employment. This share was higher when the household head was
equally currently not in paid employment, e.g. households with pensioners. In case that both
the household head and the spouse were employed, they typically engaged in the same
economic activity, which implies that factors such as seasonality in employment could affect
them in similar ways.

3.38 Informal employment or activities are more widespread in rural than in urban
labor markets, particularly among net food sellers. Remunerative or paid employment that
is carried out with no written contract or registration or execution of documents is considered
informal. Overall, the level of formality is higher in urban than in rural labor markets, where
roughly three quarters and two thirds of activities are carried out in a formal context respectively
(Table 3.5 and Table 3.9). Informal activities are most common among rural net sellers of food,
especially among spouses of heads in rural net food seller households. These findings align
with the principal economic activities of these individuals, e.g. with a larger share of individuals
working at enterprises or firms in urban areas or many spouses of net seller households
engaging at farm work or in home production for sale.

3.39 Substantially more household heads are mainly active in enterprises or
organizations in urban than in rural areas, leading to the question of how flexible urban
residents are in adjusting their income-generating activities to food price shocks. As
shown in Table 3.5, every second urban household head was employed at an enterprise or
organization in 2008 and 2012, yet only every third rural household head. Urban household
heads might thus experience more income rigidity when faced with food price shocks since
they are employed with fixed wages. In contrast, people who work on an individual basis or
provide wage work for private individuals might be more flexible in increasing their activities
and thus income. Nonetheless, one should also note that wage incomes increased between 2008
and 2012 (Table A.6), potentially offsetting the issue of larger income rigidity.

3.40 Internal rural-urban migration of mainly the poor is another factor that could be
contributing to divergent trends in urban and rural poverty rates. Over the past years the
domestic labor force in rural areas has reduced due to both internal and external labor migration.
Estimates suggested that 60 percent of migration was internal and 40 percent internal over the
past two decades, amounting to 1.9 million internal migrants over this time period (Fryer,
Nasritdinov, & Satybaldieva, 2014, p. 173). Both unemployment and insufficient levels of
income were named as factors spurring internal migration (Fryer et al., 2014, p. 175). Links
between internal migration, household welfare and urban/rural poverty rates is thus another
issue that warrants further consideration in addition to the topic of food prices covered in the
present report.

                                        E.    COPING STRATEGIES AND FOOD SECURITY

3.41 The aspect of food security extends the discussion of net food seller and buyer
status and explicitly looks at food diversity, frequency, and access. Starting in 2008, the
World Food Programme (WFP) conducted a series of nation-wide Emergency Food
Assessments (EFSA) and Household Food Assessments (cf. WFP, 2010, pp. 2-6). Since 2010
it has regularly administered surveys that collect, inter alia, information on food consumption,
expenditures and incomes, crops and livestock, and coping strategies. In these assessments, the
                                                                             33
WFP distinguishes between three food security groups (severely or moderately food insecure
or food secure), which are identified according to a household’s food consumption score (a
composite score based on food diversity and frequency) in combination with its level of income
as proxy for economic access to food.

3.42 After a high in 2012 when every fourth households was estimated to be food
insecure, the situation relaxed in 2013. In September 2012, 25 percent of Kyrgyz households
were considered severely (9 percent) or moderately (16 percent) food insecure, amounting to
approximately 1.3 million individuals (WFP, 2012, p. 5). These figures were substantially
higher than in the preceding assessments in August and March 2011 (950 thousands and 1
million individuals respectively), yet finally declined in September 2013 (14 percent of
households found to be food insecure (WFP, 2013, p. 8)). In regional terms, levels of food
security vary substantially at the oblast level (WFP, 2012, pp. 61-62). In this respect, one has
to keep in mind that these food security indicators depict seasonal variations as the questions in
the surveys conducted by WFP only refer to the preceding week.

3.43 On the oblast level, a higher incidence of net sellers of food is not necessarily
associated with higher levels of food security, and vice versa. As food security takes into
account food diversity and food access, it adds some nuances to the previously described
incidence of net food seller and buyer households. First, Bishkek consistently had the lowest
levels of food insecurity between 2010 and 2012 (WFP, 2012, p. 61), despite the fact that
virtually all households rely on food purchases. While increasing food prices therefore may
have decreased overall welfare of Bishkek residents, they did not threaten food security.
Second, Naryn and Talas, the oblasts with the highest incidence of individuals living in net food
seller households in recent years, are nonetheless also the oblasts with high proportions of food
insecure households. According to WFP, this was in both oblasts related to large shares of
households living in extreme poverty, in addition to high proportions of households with credits
or loans to reimburse (WFP, 2012, p. 61). Third, food insecurity was particularly high in Osh,
Jalal-Abad and Batken during and following civil unrest in mid-2010, but has declined since
then.

3.44 The share of purchased food in total food consumption declined between 2008 and
2012, indicating that households coped with rising food prices by increasing consumption
of food from own production. The KIHS does not include questions that specifically address
what kind of coping strategies households developed when they faced food price surges. Yet,
it is telling that the share of purchases of food in total food consumption decreased in recent
years (see Table 3.11), as this observation indicates that food from own production has become
increasingly important.6 This declining trend is observable in both rural and urban areas and for
net buyers and sellers of food. It is more pronounced among the rural than the urban poor,
arguably in line with access to land plots (Figure 3.6). Note that changes in the NBR also
illustrate the described trend. On the whole, the NBR increased from -0.38 in 2008 to -0.32 in
2012, thus net food purchases declined.

3.45 Between 2010 and 2012, Kyrgyz households increasingly resorted to coping
strategies to resolve difficulties to meet consumption requirements. Contrary to the KIHS,
EFSAs include a specific section on households’ coping strategies. The Reduced Coping
Strategy Index (R-CSI) is computed by counting how often a household resorted to food-related
coping strategies in the preceding seven days of a survey, which are to rely on less preferred

6
    In the KIHS, consumed food that has not been purchased can stem from personal subsidiary plots, processing,
    hunting/fishing/etc., being received as a gift, payment in kind or other sources. The two first sources are thereby
    the most important ones.
                                                          34
and less expensive food; borrow food, or rely on help from a friend or relative; limit portion
size at meal times; restrict consumption by adults in order for small children to eat; and reduce
number of meals eaten per day (WFP, 2012, p. 38). Between 2010 and 2012, households
increasingly used these coping strategies. In line with lower levels of food insecurity in 2013,
the mean R-CSI subsequently also fell (WFP, 2013, p. 9).

3.46 In addition to coping strategies that entail risks for health and nutritional status,
households also resorted to strategies that jeopardized future livelihoods. Livelihood
threatening strategies include consuming seeds, decreasing expenditures for agricultural inputs,
or selling productive assets (WFP, 2012, p. 37). In March 2012, these strategies were observed
in all oblasts except for Bishkek and Chui – which are the oblasts with the lowest incidence of
net sellers of food – and were most often employed in Talas – the oblast with the highest
incidence of net sellers. In Talas, more than 50 percent of households consumed seed stocks,
and between 40 to 50 percent decreased agricultural inputs. In Naryn, Osh, Jalal-Abad and
Batken, between 20 and 30 percent of households reported consuming seed stocks or sold more
animals than usual, thus threatening the future sustainability of their livelihoods.

3.47 After providing an overview of characteristics of net food sellers and buyers in
Kyrgyzstan, the two following sections further analyze forces behind past poverty
reduction, and evaluate the possible consequences of future food price shocks. Section 4
looks at changes in poverty rates and the extent to which different income sources and changes
in demographics contributed to them. This ex post analysis of poverty changes is complemented
by an ex ante simulation of the impact of rising food prices on welfare in section 5. Section 6
concludes.

              4. FORCES BEHIND CHANGES IN WELFARE
4.1     This section aims at quantifying the contribution of changes in demographics and
different income sources to changes in welfare. Following Azevedo, Inchauste, Olivieri,
Saavedra, and Winkler (2013), an accounting approach is used that allows analyzing to what
extent changes in demographics, different sources of income or consumption patterns
contributed to poverty reduction. The analysis thus sheds some light on the respective roles of
the labor market, incomes from agricultural activities, social policies, or private transfers. Based
on the previous discussion, the focus lies particularly on whether changes in welfare levels were
driven by different factors in urban and rural regions and for net seller and buyer households of
food respectively.

4.2     A study on 21 developing countries found that growth in employment and earnings
contributed the most to poverty reduction. In 18 out of the 21 countries studied, increased
labor incomes accounted for at least 40 percent of poverty reduction, whereby mostly labor
earnings per worker rather than more employment opportunities contributed to these reductions
(Inchauste et al., 2014). In the Europe and Central Asia region, a study on Tajikistan equally
concluded that labor earnings were the most important driver in income poverty reduction
between 2003 and 2009, accounting for 21 percentage points out of the total of 36 percentage
points (Azevedo, Atamanov, & Rajabov, 2014). Remittances, the second most important driver,
accounted for further nine percentage points, whereas the role of pensions, social assistance and
demographic changes were minor.



                                           A.    EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

4.3    In order to measure contributions to changes in levels of welfare, income per capita
can be decomposed into components that represent changes in demographics and income
sources. The decomposition approach by Azevedo et al. (2013) builds on work by Barros, de
Carvalho, Franco, and Mendoça (2006). Equation (1) expresses a household’s per capita
income, denoted Ipc, by its demographic components (household size , number of adults  7
and number of employed  8), labor ( ), and non-labor components ( ) (cf. Azevedo et al.,
2013, pp. 6-7):
                                            1            1
                                =       [ ( ∑   ) +  ∑
                                              ∈      ∈ 
                                                                              
                                                                             ]                               (1)
                                                                  


4.4    Contributions to observed changes in income are calculated using counterfactual
simulations. The cumulative density function of the distribution of welfare is referred to by
F(∙). As poverty or inequality measures, denoted ϑ, are determined by this function, one can
express each of these measures as a function of F(∙), which in turn depends on the components
described above:

                                               A      n  L n   NL
                               ϑ = ϕ (F (Ipc ( n , nE , YPE , YPA )))                                          (3)

    It is assumed that adults who are older than 14 years contribute to household income.

    In this section a person is considered employed if he or she reported non-zero labor earnings (including income
    from wages and self-employment) in at least one quarter of the year. Note that this definition slightly differs
    from the definition of being in paid or remunerative employment in section 3.
                                                            36

with YPE = n ∑n    L      NL      n    NL
              i∈A Yi and YPA = n ∑i∈A Yi .
             E                       A


The distribution of Ipc is known in both the initial and end period. This means that through
substituting the levels of the components in the end period by their observed levels in the initial
period – always one at a time –, counterfactual distributions for the end period are constructed.
These counterfactual distributions are subsequently used to calculate the poverty measure of
interest, and can be interpreted as the level of poverty one would observe if the level of the
indicator had remained stable.

4.5      This decomposition approach offers some advantages compared to other
procedures. In contrast to Barros et al. (2006), Azevedo et al. (2013) introduced three
methodological changes. First, they calculated the impact of changes of each component and
its interactions with all other components as the difference between cumulative counterfactuals.
Second, they addressed the problem of path-dependence by taking the average between
decompositions across all possible paths. Third, one could use consumption rather than income
as welfare measure.

4.6      Nonetheless, some caveats need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results.
Importantly, establishing causal effects is not possible based on these decompositions that are
basically an accounting technique. This means that one needs to warrant against interpretations
suggesting that any of the factors caused increases or decreases in poverty rates. Rather, the
purpose is to identify the most important factors from a quantitative point of view (Azevedo et
al., 2013, p. 3). Moreover, the decompositions are equilibrium-inconsistent, as they keep
everything else constant while only modifying one component at a time (Azevedo et al., 2013,
p. 11). It is thus a statistical model with solely descriptive results (cf. Essama-Nssah, 2012, p.
49). Finally, to describe the roots of observed changes, e.g. why labor income grew in case it
did so, one would have to resort to structural models that also account for behavior (Inchauste
et al., 2014, p. 109).

4.7    Taking into account the trajectories of poverty trends, drivers of welfare changes
are analyzed separately by type of location and net food seller/buyer status. Figure 1.1
depicted poverty trends between 2008 and 2012 in urban and rural areas respectively. As
outlined above, urban poverty rates (based on per capita consumption) grew continuously in
urban areas, while rural poverty rates were on the whole stable, with a slight increases in 2010.
In addition, poverty rates fell over this period for net sellers of food, while rates among net
buyers increased. Decomposition results will thus be separately presented for urban and rural
areas and net buyers and sellers of food respectively. Finally, in addition to changes in the
incidence of poverty measured by the headcount index, changes in the depth of poverty as
measured by the poverty gap and changes in inequality as indicated by the Gini coefficient will
be shown.

                                         B.    RESULTS

4.8     To take into account households’ activities on their personal plots, th e amount of
agricultural income as one source of house welfare is estimated. Agricultural income is
defined as the sum of all production of crops or livestock and therefrom processed items net of
all expenditures incurred in these activities. Said differently, it is the sum of sales of crops and
livestock (products) and the value of consumption of food from own production, minus crop or
livestock-related expenses such as seeds, fertilizer, fodder or hiring labor (Covarrubias, Paula
de la O Campos, & Zezza, 2009, p. 8). Sales and agricultural expenses are estimated based on
the survey section on personal subsidiary plots. The value of food from own production is
                                                37
imputed based on information on food consumption and food purchases; all non-purchased food
items are considered to stem from own production.9 The calculation of these net income figures
shows that some households suffer from losses at these agricultural activities. However, in most
cases these losses are offset by gains from other income-generating activities, so that less than
0.1 percent of households have a total annual income that is negative.

4.9     Incomes from wages and self-employment, agricultural income, pensions and
remittances are on average the four most important income sources for Kyrgyz
households. Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 show the composition of per capita income by its
components. In 2012, income from wages and self-employment contributed on average 50
percent to total household income, followed by 27 percent generated through agricultural
activities, 12 percent from pensions and 8 percent from remittances. The remaining income
stemmed from non-contributory social transfers (social assistance), other social benefits, help
from local friends or relatives and income from rent, sales, or dividends. The importance of
different income sources varied regionally, with urban households being more dependent on
incomes from wages and self-employment, while rural households tended to rely to a larger
extent on agricultural income and receive more remittances. Among net sellers of food, the
most important income source was agricultural income that represented on average 60 percent
of total income.

    In addition to buying food on the market or producing it, two other possible sources of food for own
    consumption are gifts and payments. They represent, however, only a small share of total food consumption.

4.10 Developments in consumption per capita and income per capita followed starkly
different trends between 2008 and 2012. As poverty rates in the Kyrgyz Republic are
calculated based on annual consumption per capita (deflated) as welfare indicator, trends of this
indicator reflect the previously described diverging poverty trends in urban and rural areas
respectively (Figure 1.1). Per capita consumption decreased slightly between 2008 and 2012 on
a national level, with stronger declines in urban areas (Table 4.1). Rural areas, in turn,
experienced increases in per capita consumption between 2010 and 2012, resulting in
decreasing poverty rates. Income per capita, however, followed an upward trend in both urban
and rural areas over the same period, as well as across all quintiles of consumption (Table 4.2
and Table A.7 for the development of different income sources among the total population and
the poor).

4.11 Different reasons for diverging trends in welfare based on income or consumption
per capita are conceivable, including measurement error and genuine behavioral changes
in savings patterns. The divergence could indicate measurement error in either the
consumption or the income aggregate. The gathering of accurate data is challenging, for
example for incomes from self-employment in small businesses or agriculture (Deaton & Zaidi,
2002, pp. 12-13). Another explanation could be changing patterns in terms of savings behavior.
A household’s consumption per capita is determined by its per capita income and its propensity
to consume. With rising incomes, households can decide to increase consumption
proportionately, or opt for saving larger shares of their incomes. In that respect, one can observe
that private savings as percent of GDP indeed increased from 7.2 percent in 2008 to 17.9 percent
in 2010, yet subsequently decreased again to 9.3 percent in 2012 (IMF, 2011, p. 33; 2013, p.
23).

Notes: Adults are individuals aged 15 or above. The number of employed is based on the number of household members who
reported non-zero incomes from wages or self-employment in at least one quarter of the respective survey year. Consumption
quintiles are based on annual per capita consumption. Individual level weights are applied.

                                                                  40
4.12 Average household size and the number of adults per household remained nearly
constant between 2008 and 2012, while the number of employed per adult decreased.
Demographic changes affect dependency ratios and are thus one of the factors that could
influence changes in welfare. Average households size was fairly constant between 2008 and
2010, with slight upward trends in urban and downward trends in rural areas (Table 4.3). As
discussed earlier, net food seller households tended to be larger then net buyer households.
Further, levels of consumption were associated with household size. The share of adults was
higher in urban areas and in net food buyer households. Higher shares of adults were moreover
associated with higher welfare levels. In terms of the number of employed per adult, this ratio
decreased between 2008 and 2012, reflecting that employment was falling. Overall, it was again
higher in urban and among net food buyer households as well as in wealthier households.

4.13 The total change in income poverty between 2008 and 2012 was larger in rural
than in urban areas and slightly more pronounced among net food sellers than buyers.
Based on per capita income in constant 2012 KGS and the absolute poverty line in 2012, income
poverty decreased by 16 and 19 percentage points in urban and rural areas respectively (Table
A.7 and Figure 4.3). Regarding net sellers and buyers of food, reductions in income poverty were
slightly larger among the former (20 and 18 percentage points). The poverty gap index
decreased by approximately five to six percentage points in urban and rural areas as well as
among sellers and buyers (Table A.7 and Figure 4.4).

4.14 Labor earnings and pensions were the most important drivers of reductions in
income poverty in urban areas of the Kyrgyz Republic. In urban areas, roughly half of the
income poverty reduction was driven by labor earnings (9 percentage points) and to a smaller
amount pensions (7 percentage points). The third most important source was agricultural
income (4 percentage points). In contrast, net job creation as captured by the share of employed
did not account for changes in income poverty; neither did demographic developments, i.e. the
share of adults. Furthermore, neither private nor public transfers other than pensions were – on
average – drivers of income poverty reduction in urban Kyrgyzstan.

4.15 The income poverty-reducing role of pensions was even more pronounced in rural
areas. 8 out of 19 percentage points in income poverty reduction were attributed to pensions in
rural areas. The two other most important sources of income poverty reduction were income
generated through wages/self-employment (6 percentage points) and agricultural activities (5
percentage points). The role of both new employment opportunities and changes in dependency
ratios as well as other private and public transfers, however, were – on average – negligible.
                                                                                                                                                        42
4.16 Among net sellers of food, agricultural income was the largest contributor to
income poverty reduction. Nearly half of the percentage point reduction in income poverty
was driven by agricultural income for net sellers of food (8 out of 20 percentage points of total
reduction). Pensions accounted for further four percentage points, whereas the role of wages
was on average smaller among this group of individuals (three percentage points), which is also
in line with their comparatively smaller share in total household income. Net food buyers, in
turn, profited most from wages and pensions (8 percentage points respectively) and to a smaller
degree from agricultural activities (4 percentage points).

4.17 Changes in the income poverty gap were equally mostly driven by wages, pensions,
and agricultural income. Figure 4.3 shows that the major contributors to income poverty
reduction in terms of the headcount index also drove reductions in the income poverty gap
index. Consistent with the previous results, wages were the most important factor in urban
Kyrgyzstan; pensions in rural areas and agricultural income among individuals living in net
food seller households. Net job creation, the demographic dividend as reflected by the share of
adults or other private and public sources of income did on average not contribute to income
poverty gap reductions.

4.18 Both changes in human capital endowments and returns to endowments could
explain increased earnings per employed. With regard to the finding that earnings per
employed were an important factor contributing to poverty reduction, the shortcoming of this
method is that it cannot tell why earnings per employed increased. Both changing endowments,
such as health or education, and changes in the returns to these endowments could explain this
trend, yet disentangling those factors would require different decomposition techniques (cf.
Inchauste et al., 2014, p. 58). Nonetheless, Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of the wage gap
between poor and non poor households in 2008 and 2012 shed some light on this question and
suggested that the wage gap decreased as poor households improved on their labor market
characteristics. Remaining wage differences in 2012 were a result of smaller returns to
endowments (World Bank, 2014c, p. 33).

4.19 After analyzing past changes in welfare between 2008 and 2012, the final section
explores household’s vulnerability to future shocks. This section showed that the three most
important drivers of welfare improvements were labor earnings, pensions and agricultural
income, whereby the relative importance of each of these sources varied between urban and
rural as well as between net food sellers and buyers. The final section of the analysis focuses
on household vulnerability to future food price shocks, i.e. it simulates the likelihood that a
household will fall below the poverty line after food price increases and furthermore
investigates who would be the winners.

        5. VULNERABILITY TO FOOD PRICE INCREASES
5.1    Global food price spikes in 2007/08 and 2010/11 triggered a number of analyses
looking at the welfare impact of food price changes. As outlined in section 3, the net impact
of higher food prices on poverty in the short run is not unambiguous from a conceptual point
of view as it depends on the distribution of net food buyers and sellers – the respective short-
term losers and winners of food price increases – along the welfare distribution. Moreover,
households can adjust both consumption and production patterns in response to food price
changes, e.g. by substituting into cheaper food products or increasing agricultural production.
In the medium and long term, higher food prices may further entail economy-wide effects on
wage rates and ultimately lead to output adjustments.

5.2     Simulation studies found that food price increases – at least in the short run – on
average increased poverty, though the magnitude of poverty increases varied. In an
analysis comprising nine low-income countries, Ivanic and Martin (2008) found that a 10
percent price increase of all goods considered would increase initial $1 per day poverty rates
on average by 0.8 and 0.4 percentage points in urban and rural areas respectively, excluding
wage impacts. Taking these wage impacts into account, the respective figures amounted to 0.6
and 0.3 percentage points. The magnitude of this effect varied between countries, amounting
for instance to 2.5 percentage points in urban Nicaragua, while simulation results suggested
that winners outnumbered losers in Peru and Vietnam. In a study of twelve Western and Central
African countries, Wodon et al. (2008) equally concluded the adverse poverty impacts of food
price increases, which were more pronounced in urban than in rural areas in many countries.
With a slightly modified methodology and a larger sample of 28 developing countries, Ivanic,
Martin, and Zaman (2012) came to the results that the 2010/11 food price surges increased
poverty on average by 1.1 percentage points in low-income countries.

5.3     Recent research suggested that food price increases could have more beneficial
impacts in the long run, yet the need for social protection in the short run remains. Ivanic
and Martin (2014) modeled two further factors that should be taken into account in the long-
run, namely beneficial developments in wage rates for unskilled workers and higher agricultural
profits. Comparing impacts across different time horizons, they estimated that a 10 percent
price increase would increase global poverty rates in the short term on average by 0.8
percentage points, with urban households being more negatively affected. In the long term,
however, they estimated that a similar price change would reduce poverty on average by 1.4
percentage points. Headey (2014) equally concluded that higher food prices in the long run, i.e.
episodes of one to five years, contributed to poverty reduction, yet not without pointing out the
justification for short-run social protection when facing high food price volatility.

5.4    Using 2012 KIHS data, this section simulates short-run welfare impacts of
increases in food prices in general and wheat/wheat flour prices specifically and
disaggregates results for various population subgroups. As pointed out in section 2, the
Kyrgyz Republic’s stark dependence on food imports, particularly wheat, made it vulnerable to
sudden and sharp increases in food prices. Thus, the extent to which households are vulnerable
to food price increases in the short run, i.e. within a time frame during which neither increasing
wage rates or adjusted agricultural output could offset adverse consequences, should be an
important concern for policy makers. The welfare measure that is used to calculate poverty
measures is per capita consumption that is deflated to take into account spatial price differences.
Simulations are carried out for both food price increases in general and increases of prices of

wheat and wheat flour specifically.10 This choice is guided by the fact that wheat flour is the
most important item in households’ food purchases, especially among the poor and extreme
poor (Table 5.1), in addition to the Kyrgyz Republic’s dependence on wheat (flour) imports.
Results are disaggregated by location and several socio-economic characteristics to capture the
heterogeneity of welfare impacts across different types of households, as for instance done in
comparable studies by Minot and Dewina (2013) or Zezza et al. (2009).

                                           A.   EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

5.5     The conceptual framework for estimating the impact of price changes on poverty
is the welfare effect proposed by Deaton (1989). Studies on welfare impacts of food price
increases frequently followed and adapted the approach that Deaton (1989) suggested in his
seminal paper. This approach takes the net sales of a commodity as a share of total household
income or expenditure to determine first-order effects of food price changes. The welfare effect
is defined in terms of compensating variation  (Minot & Dewina, 2013, p. 3):
                                                   
                                                   0
                                                          = ∑
                                                             =1(0 − 0 )
                                                                                 ̂                                 (1)

As si0 denotes the value of commodity i as a share of income Y0 and q i0 refers to the budget
share of good i, the expression in parentheses gives the NBR, i.e. the share of net sales of
commodity i in household income or consumption. As pointed out by Deaton (1989), this ratio
can also be interpreted as the “elasticity of the cost of living with respect to the price of good
i” (p. 4). The price change of good i is indicated by p̂i . The compensating variation thus equals
the transfer that would be needed to maintain a household’s welfare before the food price shock
occurred, expressed as a portion of the household’s initial welfare.

5.6    This approach makes a number of simplifying assumptions (cf. Minot & Dewina,
2013, p. 3). First, equation (5) assumes that input prices such as labor, fuel or fodder either do
not change, or that these changes are negligible. Second, equal proportional changes of

10
     On the producer side all sales of wheat (crop code 01.11.11) and wheat flour (product code 10.61.21) are taken
     into account. As in section 3, sales of wheat are adjusted to take into account that domestic wheat production
     is partly used as fodder. On the side of consumers, all purchases of wheat flour (product code 10.61.21) are
     counted. To match crop and product codes as closely as possible it was decided to restrict the analysis to wheat
     and wheat flour. When interpreting results one should keep in mind that prices of further processed food items,
     such as bread, can change along with wheat flour prices; and that the value of bread in total food purchases is
     higher among urban than among rural households.
                                                              45
consumer and producer prices are assumed, i.e. the marketing margin is assumed to be a fixed
proportion of the consumer price. However, the assumption of fixed marketing margins in
absolute terms may be more realistic, which would imply that percent increases in producer
prices are larger than percent increases in consumer prices. Third, the assumption is made that
households do not adjust consumption patterns – or at least not within this time frame – as
response to changes in consumer prices. Fourth, it is assumed that households equally do not
change production patterns in light of rising producer prices.11 The two latter assumptions are
relaxed by taking into account the supply and demand side elasticities, which is given in
equation (6), where  and  denote the elasticities of supply and demand respectively.
                                               1                                               1

                                                    =1 0  (                   ̂ − 2 ∑
                                                                                 =1 0                           ̂ )2
                                                                                                     =1 0  (       (2)

5.7    Additional scenarios are estimated next to the baseline to test the sensitivity of
results to these assumptions. The baseline scenario models short-term impacts and assumes
proportional changes of consumer and producer prices and no changes in consumption or
production patterns. Additional analyses are carried out to test the sensitivity of results if
changes in producer prices are double the changes in consumer prices and to take into account
adjustments in consumption or production patterns in the medium term. In the latter analysis, it
is assumed that supply and demand side elasticities amount to 0.4 and -0.4 respectively,12 while
cross-price elasticities are considered negligible. As the simulations do not refer to a long time
frame, adjustments in wage rates or agricultural outputs are not taken into account.

5.8    The welfare impacts of consumer food price increases of 5, 10 and 15 percent are
estimated. Increases of the consumer price index for food products (as a percentage of the
previous month) of approximately five percent were observed from May to June 2008 or August
to September 2010, representing the highest month-to-month increases between 2008 and 2012
(National Statistical Committee, 2014). Increases of the food consumer price index (CPI) of
roughly ten percent happened over a three months period between March and June 2008.
Between October 2010 and January 2011, the food CPI increased by 15 percent, which
represented the highest increase over a period of three months.

5.9     Furthermore, estimates of the welfare impact of wheat and wheat flour price
increases of 15 and 30 percent respectively are shown. The choice of which price increase
of wheat flour to model is equally informed by historical price data. The largest increases in
real prices of wheat flour (first grade) in the Kyrgyz Republic in the period from 2008 to 2012
were 16.2 percent between July and August 2010 and 27.5 percent between June and September
2010 (FAO, 2015). In line with these historical price data, impacts of price shocks of 15 and 30
percent are estimated.

                                                          B.      RESULTS

5.10 Food price increases of 5, 10, and 15 percent are estimated to increase poverty rates
between 2 and 5 percentage points in the baseline scenario. Table 5.2 summarizes the poverty
impact of food price increases of 5, 10, and 15 percent in the short-run, i.e. not taking into
account household responses in consumption and production or any economy-wide effects.
Based on the assumption that consumer and producer prices rise proportionally, the simulations


11
     This furthermore implies that food price increases are not driven by shocks that impact on domestic agricultural
     productivity (Ivanic & Martin, 2014).
12
     According to WFP (2008), the price elasticity for bread and cereals, the most important food group in the diets
     of Kyrgyz households, amounted to -0.418, which is why these values have been chosen for simulations.
                                                                    46
indicate that national poverty rates would increase by 2.3, 3.4 and 4.9 percentage points
respectively, keeping everything else equal.

5.11 The impact of food price increases is more adverse in urban than in rural areas. In
line with the regional distribution of net sellers and buyers of food, the estimated average
welfare losses of price increases of 10 and 15 percent are more pronounced in urban than in
rural regions. In urban areas, food price increases in these magnitudes entail increases in
poverty rates of 4.6 and 6.7 percentage points. In rural areas, the same price increases would
change rural poverty rates by 2.8 and 3.9 percentage points in the baseline scenario. Only for
smaller price increases of 5 percent would poverty impacts be virtually similar across the
country, showing that urban households have on average some, yet limited scope to deal with
food price increases.

5.12 At the oblast level, welfare gains of food price increases outweigh losses on average
only in Talas, while the estimated poverty impacts are most detrimental in Bishkek and
Osh. As shown in Table 3.1, Talas is the oblast with the largest share of individuals living in
households that are net sellers of food (61 percent in 2012) and the only oblast with a positive
NBR. Sales of crops dominate food sales in this region (Figure 3.3). A 5 percent increase in
consumer prices would decrease poverty rates by 1.6 percentage points, a 10 percent food price
increase by 3.4 percentage points, and a 15 percent increase by 3.0 percentage points. In
contrast, the oblasts Bishkek and Osh where nearly two thirds of the total urban population lives
would suffer most from welfare losses regardless of the size of the increase; with poverty rates
rising between three up to eight percentage points. Note that these results also reflect observed
poverty trends in these oblasts between 2008 and 2012 (see Table A.1 and Table A.3), with urban
poverty rates rising over this time period.

5.13 Virtually no individual in the bottom quintile of the consumption distribution can
exit from poverty due to increased profits arising from higher food prices. There is very
limited potential that the poorest 20 percent of the population could benefit from food price
increases to such an extent that their consumption would be lifted above the poverty line.
Moreover, under the baseline assumptions a five percent food price increase would increase
poverty rates in the second and third consumption quintile by roughly five percentage points
respectively. Only a 15 percent price increase possibly enables a few more individuals in the
bottom 20 percent to increase their welfare to levels above the poverty line than fall below, yet
it could push every fifth individual currently in the third quintile into poverty. Finally, higher
food prices have no impact on poverty rates among the top 40 percent of the population.

5.14 The poverty impact of food price increases is associated with land ownership and
plot size. The largest increases in poverty rates are shown for individuals living in household
that own land plots of a size up to 0.2 ha, while individuals in households that own more than
0.2 ha and particularly 1.0 ha would be only marginally affected by price increases. These
results are in line with the positive correlation between the NBR and land plot size among
landowners shown in Figure 3.7. The small poverty impact among individuals with no land is
related to the fact that they tend to be more well off from the beginning (with the initial poverty
rate of 25 percent being considerably below the national average of 38 percent) and have thus
on average sufficient scope to offset food price surges.

5.15 The extent to which households suffer or profit from food price increases depends
strongly on assumptions on marketing margins. Net food sellers by definition profit from
food price increases, yet the extent to which they do so crucially depends on the assumption on
marketing margins. Estimates for reductions in poverty rates in the short-run after a 5 percent

                                                47
food price increase range between 1 and 6 percentage points, between 3 and 11 percentage
points for a 10 percent increase, and even 6 and 15 percentage points for a 15 percent food price
increase depending on whether one assumes that prices increase proportionally or that absolute
marketing margins are fixed. Overall, higher percent increases in producer than in consumer
prices would naturally lead to less adverse welfare effects, which is particularly apparent in the
estimates for rural areas and for the oblasts of Naryn and Talas. Estimates for urban areas or
the oblasts Chui and Bishkek are less sensitive to assumptions on marketing margins owed to
the fact that only few individuals in these regions live in households that sell food products.

5.16 Behavioral adjustments in consumption and production patterns can alleviate
welfare losses only marginally in the short run. Table A.8 displays the results for food price
increases that are based on the assumption that households adjust consumption and production
patterns in response to food price increases. Poverty impacts are slightly less adverse in these
scenarios, but the difference is very modest. For instance, the aggregate impact of a 15 percent
food price increase with proportional changes in consumer and producer prices is an increase
of poverty rates of 4.9 percentage points in the short-run versus 4.8 percentage points in the
model that takes into account behavioral adjustments.

5.17 Food price increases deepen poverty among the already poor. Results for the
estimated short-term impact of food price increases on the depth of poverty complement
estimates of the impact on the poverty headcount index (Table 5.3). As the bottom 20 percent
of the population already falls entirely below the poverty line, food price increases do not
increase the poverty headcount index for this quintile. However, they further deepen poverty,
with the average shortfall from the poverty line expressed as a percentage of this threshold
increasing by 1.2 percentage points for a 5 percent food price increase. A 15 percent food price
increase widens the gap by 3.7 percentage points. The impacts are even more adverse among
the second consumption quintile, ranging between 1.5 and 4.7 percentage points depending on
the magnitude of the price increase. In the baseline scenario, the depth of poverty decreases for
net sellers of food, while landowners with large plots only marginally suffer from welfare losses
and the top 40 percent in the consumption distribution are not affected.

5.18 The Kyrgyz Republic’s strong dependence on wheat imports is reflected by the
small number of individuals who live in households that are net sellers of wheat or wheat
flour. Table 5.4 shows the NBR calculated for wheat and wheat flour only. On average, net
purchases of wheat flour constitute nine percent of household consumption. It is higher in rural
than in urban areas, reflecting that urban households tend to buy more processed food such as
bread. The 80 percent of net buyers dedicate on average 12 percent of their consumption to
wheat flour purchases. 20 percent of individuals are classified as self-sufficient as they neither
sell nor buy wheat or wheat flour, suggesting that they either satisfy needs from own household
production or do not consume this commodity at all. Finally, merely one percent of the
population lives in households that on net sell more wheat or wheat flour than they purchase;
these sales constitute on average six percent of household consumption (as proxy for income).
13
   These low figures are in line with low domestic wheat production in 2012, when the Kyrgyz
Republic used extensively its national stocks of grains to fill these gaps (Caccavale et al., 2013,
p. 7).


13
     As noted above, sales of wheat were adjusted to take into account that a certain share of domestic wheat
     production is used as fodder. If one assumes that all wheat sales are suitable for human consumption, 1.2
     percent of the population lives in a household defined as net seller and the average NBR among this group
     amounts to 0.13. The NBR of net buyers does not change. This means that the simulations might to some extent
     underestimate the potential benefits accrued to net sellers, yet they still show the vulnerabilities of net buyers.
                                                           48
5.19 A 15 percent increase in prices of wheat flour increases national poverty rates by
2 percentage points in the short run. In the baseline scenario national poverty rates are
estimated to rise from 38.1 to 40.1 percent as consequence of a 15 percent increase in wheat
flour prices (Table 5.4). A 30 percent increase would increase national poverty rates further to
41.5 percent. The simulations suggest that poverty impacts are more detrimental in rural than
in urban areas. The interpretation of these results, however, warrants caution as one should keep
in mind that urban households rather than wheat flour buy bread, for which prices could equally
rise depending on the grain.

5.20 The regional poverty impact of wheat flour price increases is most adverse in Osh.
Poverty rates in the oblast of Osh are simulated to rise by 3.9 and 6.6 percentage points for
wheat flour price increases of 15 and 30 percent respectively, which is nearly twice as high as
the national average. The same is true for increases in the poverty gap ratio (Table 5.5). The
specifically detrimental impacts in Osh are in line with the fact that this is one of the oblast with
the highest poverty rates in 2012 (Table A.1) and that its per capita production of wheat is the
lowest in the country. The highest wheat production in relation to its population is reported in
Talas and Issykul (Caccavale et al., 2013, p. 8).

5.21 Not only do surges in wheat flour prices reduce welfare to levels below the poverty
line, but it also deepens poverty among the currently poor. Table 5.4 shows that individuals
in the second and third quintile of the consumption distribution can suffer from welfare losses
induced from higher wheat flour prices to such an extent that they fall below the absolute
poverty line. A 30 percent price increase is estimated in the baseline to increase poverty rates
in the second and third quintiles by 5.6 and 11.4 percentage points respectively. Furthermore,
Table 5.5 shows that the depth of poverty would be affected as well, with similar price increases
deepening poverty in the first and second quintiles by 2.6 and 3.0 percentage points
respectively.

5.22 Only very few net sellers of wheat or wheat flour exit from poverty as a result of
price increases, reflecting that poor households are less likely to fall into this category.
The extent to which wheat flour price increases could alleviate current poverty is extremely
limited, both in terms of the headcount index and the poverty gap index. This finding is linked
to the distribution of net seller households of wheat (flour) along the consumption distribution:
Only 25 percent of these net sellers belong to the bottom 40 percent of the population, while 40
percent of net sellers are located in the top consumption quintile. The chances of being self-
sufficient and thus not being affected by price increases at all are equally higher among the top
20 and lower among the bottom 40 percent.

5.23 Adjustments in consumption and production patterns are estimated to alleviate
welfare losses slightly. Table A.9 shows the sensitivity of estimates to changes in demand and
supply elasticities. On a national level, the expected increases in poverty rates are 0.3 and 0.2
percentage points lower when one takes into account behavioral adjustments. The simulated
poverty impacts are particularly lower in Osh, where changes in demand – potentially
substituting wheat by cheaper food items – could reduce the poverty impact of a 15 percent
wheat flour price increase from 3.9 to 3.0 percentage points; and from 6.6 to 6.0 percentage
points for a 30 percent price increase. However, these results should be cautiously interpreted,
as these estimates do not capture the effects of reduced or substituted calorie intake on other
dimensions of welfare, such as nutrition or health.

5.24 The simulations of the poverty impact of surges in food prices in general and wheat
flour prices specifically illustrate the vulnerabilities of the Kyrgyz population to sudden

                                                 49
price changes in the short run. As outlined above, the simulations model short run impacts.
Impacts in the long run could be less adverse or even beneficial when one takes into account
changes in the supply of a commodity (e.g. switching to crops that are relatively more expensive
and increasing land allocation to agriculture) and changing wage rates for unskilled labor (cf.
Ivanic & Martin, 2014). On the other hand, changes in input prices such as labor, fuel and
fodder could reduce profits for producers and lead to less positive outcomes for net sellers.
Overall, the focus in this note on the short term is justified by the fact that it estimates poverty
impacts in a time horizon during which individuals have limited scope to adjust behavior and
to profit from economy-wide effect, which leads to questions of appropriate immediate
responses to alleviate welfare losses and prevent households from adopting coping strategies
that could be detrimental in the short- and long-run.

Notes: NBR denotes net benefit ratio, which is defined as net sales of food over total household consumption. CP and PP stand
for consumer and producer prices respectively. A household is defined as demographically dependent if the ratio of the number
of children and elderly over the number of adults aged 15 to 64 equals or exceeds 2. Consumption quintiles are based on
deflated annual per capita consumption. Poverty rates are calculated using deflated consumption per capita as welfare indicator
and the absolute poverty line in 2012. Individual level weights are applied.

Notes: NBR denotes net benefit ratio, which is defined as net sales of food over total household consumption. A household is
defined as demographically dependent if the ratio of the number of children and elderly over the number of adults aged 15 to
64 equals or exceeds 2. Consumption quintiles are based on deflated annual per capita consumption. Poverty gaps are calculated
using deflated consumption per capita as welfare indicator and the absolute poverty line in 2012. Individual level weights are
applied.

                                   6. CONCLUSION

6.1     The large majority of the Kyrgyz Republic’s population lives in net food buyer
households that differ from net food sellers in several respects. 15 percent of the Kyrgyz
population lives in households defined as net food sellers, whereby 95 percent of them reside
in rural parts of the country. Net food seller and buyer households differ from each other in
terms of household size, gender of household head, composition of food baskets and labor
market characteristics. There are also differences between better and worse off net food seller
households regarding educational attainment of the head, land plot size or type of irrigation.

6.2     The status of being a net food seller or buyer may change easily; implying that a
household’s vulnerability to future food price shocks also changes over time. The finding
of substantial fluctuations of the incidence of net sellers and buyers in Naryn or Issykul over
years motivated the identification of households that were marginal food sellers or buyers, i.e.
households for which net food sales or purchases constituted less than 10 percent of their
consumption. In rural areas, more than every tenth individual lived in 2012 in a household
whose buyer/seller status could change easily on an annual basis depending on respective
relative prices or crop yields. This also means that the extent to which households are vulnerable
to food price surges can change quickly over time.

6.3     Being a net seller of food does not necessarily imply being food secure. The concept
of food security combines aspects of food diversity, frequency, and access and should thus not
be confused with the identification of net seller/buyer status. The status of food security has not
been calculated based on the KIHS and thus it is not possible to analyze the overlap between
these two concepts directly. Yet, results of WFP surveys suggest that a higher incidence of net
sellers of food is not necessarily associated with higher levels of food security, and vice versa.

6.4     Incomes from agricultural activities were a major contributor to reductions in
income poverty for net sellers of food and played an equalizing role. Agricultural income
is the most important income source for the average net seller of food household. It is also the
income component that contributed most substantially to income poverty reduction between
2008 and 2012 for this group of individuals. Moreover, decompositions of the changes in the
Gini coefficient showed that agricultural income had an income inequality-reducing effect
between 2008 and 2012.

6.5     Labor market linkages between net food sellers and buyers may lead to wage
increases and more employment opportunities in the long run, yet at least the latter has
not happened in the last years. Second-round effects of food price increases can materialize
through the labor market, as price increases in a commodity increases demand for the factor
needed to produce it. Effects can either show up in increased wage rates or more employment
if labor is in surplus. Based on the results of the income decompositions, net job creation –
captured by the share of employed – had not been a driver of changes of income poverty. Wages
for employed played an important role, yet the extent to which these were agricultural wages is
not captured by the present analysis. This could be a topic for further research.

6.6     Simulations of future food price increases show adverse welfare effects on most
population subgroups in the short run, with only net sellers of food and the richest 40
percent of the population not being at risk of falling into poverty. Everything else being
equal, food price increases of five percent could push two percent of the population below the
poverty line. A 15 percent price increase would increase poverty rates in the short-run by nearly

                                                55
5 percentage points. These figures show that a substantial amount of individuals in the Kyrgyz
Republic has very limited scope to deal with food price shocks. These individuals tend to live
in urban areas and their pre-shock consumption is relatively close to the poverty line. In
addition, food price increases further deepen poverty among the already poor.

6.7     Estimates of the poverty impact of wheat flour price increases illustrate that price
increases in one commodity alone can lead to large welfare losses. Individuals who live in
households that are self-sufficient or on net sell wheat/wheat flour tend to be better off, while
the poor are likely to depend to a larger extent on wheat flour purchases. Not only does this
increase the vulnerability of households to wheat price increases as there is limited scope to
economize on non-food expenditure, but it also implies that very few individuals can exit from
poverty due to higher wheat flour prices in the short-run. While estimates that take into account
adjustments in consumption and production patterns suggest slightly less adverse effects, one
may not forget that reducing consumption, e.g. through skipping meals or reducing portion
sizes, among already poorer households could have detrimental effects on nutritional status and
health in the longer run.

6.8     The potential of less adverse welfare impacts of food price increases in the long run
does not reduce the need for protection against food price shocks in the short-run. Several
studies have concluded that poverty impacts of food price increases might be less adverse or
even positive if one considers a longer time horizon during which effects on wage rates or
adjustments in agricultural outputs can materialize. The approach adopted in this note, however,
deliberately focused on short-term welfare losses, as this is also the time frame in which
households have to find other ways to deal with food price increases. As evidence collected by
the WFP suggested that households resorted between 2010 and 2012 to coping strategies that
could jeopardize their nutritional status, health and future livelihoods, the question remains of
how one can protect individuals against future price shocks in the short run.

6.9     The exploration of the occurrence and frequency of switches in seller/buyer status
as well as of coping strategies and the extent to which they jeopardize future livelihoods
could be further informed by panel data. The nature of the used data, that is, five cross-
sections in consecutive years, limits the analysis as it only allows exploring trends, yet not
dynamics at the household level. Following individual households over time and investigating
the frequency and possibly reasons for switches in buyer/seller status could shed more light on
the question at what points in time a household is particularly vulnerable to price surges.
Further, panel data could be used to investigate coping strategies and the medium to long-term
impact of these strategies on outcomes such as health or livelihoods.

6.10 Further research could investigate the level of agricultural productivity among net
food sellers and buyers respectively, barriers to increased productivity and the role of
land fragmentation. Agricultural productivity is low in the Kyrgyz Republic in comparison to
neighboring countries. The drop in domestic production of cereals also relates to the area of
cultivated land, but productivity ranks foremost. This leads to the question whether there are
differences in agricultural productivity between net buyer and seller households as well as
among net sellers of food. These questions can be furthermore linked to investigating barriers
to increased agricultural productivity, including the role of land fragmentation, as the size of
land plots of net sellers has been declining between 2008 and 2012.

6.11 Research on the actual relationship between consumer and producer prices could
inform future simulation exercises and decision-making based on it. Sensitivity of
estimation results to changes in consumption or production patterns were rather marginal, yet

                                               56
the relationship between consumer and producer prices emerged as an important parameter.
The assumption that the percent increase in consumer and producer prices is proportional
implies that marketing margins widen. In contrast, when the percent increases in producer
prices is double the increase in consumer prices, marketing margins are fixed in absolute values
if consumer prices are twice as high as producer prices. Further research could look into this
empirical question to inform the model, which could also improve decision-making based on
simulation results.

6.12 In addition to food prices, internal migration is another phenomenon that one
should take into account when investigating diverging trends in urban and rural poverty
rates. The point of departure of this note had the puzzle of diverging poverty trends in urban
and rural Kyrgyzstan that led to convergence in poverty rates. While the spatial distribution of
net sellers and buyers indeed implies that short-run winners of food price increases tend to be
located in rural areas, the role of food prices alone tells merely one part of the story. Particularly
internal migration from rural to urban areas could contribute to understanding diverging poverty
trends if on average poorer households decided to move to cities and thus deserves equal
attention in the discussion of poverty trends over the urban/rural divide.

64 equals or exceeds 2. Consumption quintiles are based on deflated annual per capita consumption. Poverty rates are calculated
using deflated consumption per capita as welfare indicator and using the absolute poverty line in 2012. Individual level weights
are applied.

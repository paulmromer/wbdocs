1.       Earmarked credit was about half of total credit in Brazil at end-2015—after
declining to one third of total credit in 2007, it is back to the levels in late 1990s.
During 2008-15, earmarked credit increased from 12 to close to 30 percent of GDP.
Initially, the objective was to counteract the retrenchment in lending by private lenders.
However, earmarked credit expansion continued during the subsequent commodity
boom period.

2.     This paper provides a taxonomy of the complex earmarked credit system
and a preliminary analysis of the potential implications. The interventions include a
complex web of price and quantity regulations, reserve requirements, tax exemptions
and forced savings schemes that are used for earmarked lending to specific sectors.

3.     The objective of the taxonomy is to understand who funds the system, who
benefits from it and how is it intermediated. Below are the main findings.

Funding sources for earmarked credits:

    Savers fund about 40 percent (13 percent of GDP). The savings have been
     shifting away from deposits into tax-exempt instruments, repos, or investments
     outside the banking system. These funds are placed voluntarily.

    Employees fund about 12 percent (4 percent of GDP) through monthly salary
     deductions to the Severance Indemnity Fund (FGTS), at very low remuneration.

    The fiscal sector funds about 48 percent (15 percent of GDP), through direct
     lending to BNDES (9 percent of GDP) and through various special and
     constitutional funds (6 percent of GDP, excluding FGTS).

The costs of earmarked credits:

    The estimated fiscal cost of explicit and implicit subsidies amounts to about
     3.7 percent of general government revenue (1.5 percent of GDP) for 2015.
     This is mainly due to the differential between regulated rates and market interest
     rates at which the government finances its lending.

    Savers and employees each contribute about 0.3 percent of GDP to lowering
     interest rates on earmarked credit. The savers and employees receive low
     remuneration on deposits and contributions to FGTS, respectively.


Beneficiaries of earmarked credits:

    Among firms the main beneficiaries are in the services, rural, and energy
     sectors, and larger, older and less risky firms benefit more. Conversely, the
     sectors intensive in positive social externalities were not the main beneficiaries.


                                       Page 3 of 41
      The effect of earmarked credit on investment is insignificant for publicly traded
      firms.

    Among household borrowers, those with access to rural credit and
     mortgage loans enjoy large subsidies.

    Average interest rates on earmarked loans (at about 10 percent) were less
     than one fourth of the interest rates charged on non-earmarked loans.
     Smaller firms with access to earmarked credits benefit most from the rate
     differential.

Intermediation of earmarked credits:

    Government-owned banks and the largest private banks dominate the
     earmarked credit market. BNDES — directly and through on-lending via
     commercial banks — accounts for 72 percent of earmarked firm credits.

    Banks make small profits on directed credits and seem to compensate with
     higher rates on non-earmarked credits and fee income. An estimated 82
     percent of nominal interest income is derived from the non-earmarked credits,
     despite accounting for only half of total credits.

    The interventions have implications on the credit channel of monetary
     policy. Our analysis suggests that the changes in the policy rate, SELIC, have to
     be larger to have the same impact. Also, monetary policy may distort credit cost
     and allocation as earmarked credit is unevenly distributed across sectors and
     firms.

4.     The size of the programs, the high costs, and the absence of clear evidence
of their positive impact, calls for a comprehensive evaluation. Earmarked credit
programs are key levers of policy interventions. The policy options include the
following:

    Clarify the objectives and intended beneficiaries of the various earmarked
     credit schemes and develop a results framework accordingly. The intended
     recipients behind the original creation of the schemes—infrastructure projects,
     low-income housing, small scale rural families, small firms—may no longer be
     adequately and efficiently served. In some cases technical support to improve
     productivity could be more beneficial than preferential credit.

    Enhance transparency and develop monitoring and evaluation frameworks.
     Greater transparency is the foundation for accountability and for senior policy
     makers’ ability to identify reform needs. Initiatives are underway to this effect.

    Increase public awareness and discuss the need for reforms . Changes to
     earmarked credit schemes will occur as interest rates converge. The authorities


                                     Page 4 of 41
can drive the process by determining the appropriate speed and sequencing of
reforms, which may differ across various schemes.

I. EARMARKED CREDIT MARKET IN BRAZIL

5.      Earmarked credit accounts for about half the credit market (27 percent of
GDP) as of end-2015. After declining to one third of total credit in 2007, it is back to
the levels in late 1990s. Since 2008, earmarked lending has grown from 32 percent to 49
percent of total credit (Figure 1). This policy shift was initially attributed to the global
financial crisis and an expectation among policy makers that Brazilian firms would be
credit constrained. However, the earmarked credit expansion continued as Brazil
recovered from the global crises buoyed by the commodity price boom.

6.     Earmarked credit is mainly targeted to infrastructure and development
projects, mortgages and rural activities. Total credit is roughly equally divided
between firms and households, and within those categories, credit is roughly equally
divided between earmarked and non-earmarked credit (Figure 2). Within these four
buckets, however, there is important segmentation:

        Earmarked credit to firms is targeted to firms’ fixed investments, infrastructure
         and development projects, whereas non-earmarked credit is dominated by
         working capital (46 percent).

        There is large variation across sectors regarding the access to earmarked credits
         (Figure 4). The services and manufacturing sectors receive the largest shares of
         total earmarked credit (27 and 31 percent), followed by the energy sector.1

        Earmarked credit to households is targeted to real estate financing (70 percent)
         and rural activities (22 percent), whereas non-earmarked credit is mostly payroll
         deducted loans, goods financing and standard personal credit.

Brazil have motivated interventions. The interest rates charged for earmarked loans
are mostly regulated and substantially lower than those charged in the non-regulated
loans market (Figure 7). The Long Term Interest Rate (TJLP), the benchmark rate for
BNDES loans, and rates for loans to specific sectors are set well below the monetary
policy rate, the SELIC, and often below the inflation rate. The non-earmarked lending
rates tend to follow the SELIC (Figure 8). Annex 1 provides a description of the key

II. A TAXONOMY OF THE CREDIT MARKET INTERVENTIONS

9.      This study classifies the Brazilian credit market interventions into two main
categories: (1) Governmental interventions; and (2) Central Bank regulations
(Figure 9). Table 1 provides a summary description of the main interventions.
Government interventions include the funding of earmarked credit through banks at
below market rates, mandated saving schemes for earmarked credit programs at
regulated interest rates, and direct fiscal subsidies to lower interest rates.2 Central Bank
regulations channel a share of standard reserve requirements on demand, time and
savings deposits to housing, microcredit, and rural credit. 3

2
  Other interventions, such as preferential access to federal employees’ payroll and judicial deposits by
government-owned banks are not included in this analysis. These interventions are not linked to
earmarked credits although they may have implications for financial intermediation more broadly.
3
  See Lundberg (2011) for a description of the different interventions by type of borrower (BNDES
borrower, rural and housing) and a historical perspective.

    Government interventions
    Special Funds (FAT,   As of end-2015, 27 percent of total BNDES resources comes from the
    Constitutional Funds  Workers Support Fund (FAT), which in turn is remunerated with the
    and FGTS)             regulated Long Run Interest Rate (TJLP) by BNDES.4 Other funds of
                          fiscal nature include the Marine Merchant Fund, directed for the naval
                          industry and related infrastructure, and PIS-PASEP (precursor of FAT)—
                          these amount to 7 percent of BNDES’ total resources.

                             The FGTS, a severance indemnity fund for employees, is a mandatory
                             saving scheme that collects 8 percent of the employee’s salary to
                             individual accounts at Caixa Econômica Federal (Caixa), a commercial
                             public bank.5 Its resources are mostly directed to real estate credit at
                             subsidized interest rates. The fund is under-remunerated earning 4.8
                             percent in 2015, well below inflation.

                             Other funds include Regional Development Constitutional Funds, which
                             are Northeast Fund (FNE), North Fund (FNO) and Midwest Fund (FCO).

    Implicit subsidies       The central government issues public debt at an average 13.6 percent
    through under-           interest rate6 to finance credit programs through (mostly) BNDES, which
    remunerated funding      in turn remunerates the central government with the TJLP, which was 7
                             percent at end-2015. The below-market remuneration implies a subsidy.
    Direct subsidies         The Government provides subsidies reimbursing banks for lending under
                             certain programs at below market interest rates. The largest such program
                             was the Investment Support Program (PSI) operated by BNDES, which
                             offered loans at an average rate as low as 3 percent in 2015. Other
                             subsidized credit programs include Minha Casa Minha Vida housing
                             program and PRONAF for farmers, both directed to low income families.
    Tax exemptions           Savings instruments such as savings accounts and real estate and
                             agriculture letters of credit are exempt from income tax.7 Certain credit
                             operations are exempt from the financial transactions tax (IOF), such as
                             infrastructure and development financing that fulfill certain criteria, all
                             credit transactions that use Regional Development Constitutional Funds
                             (FNO, FCO and FNE), Minha Casa Minha Vida housing program’s
                             infrastructure projects, among others.

    Central Bank regulations
    Deposits earmarked for Central Bank regulations require that commercial banks lend for real estate
    lending to certain     and rural projects at below-market interest rates based their deposit
    sectors                collection.

    requirements for       contractual terms can be deducted from Central Bank’s reserves
    earmarked credits      requirements.8
    Regulation of          The TJLP rate is regulated by the National Monetary Council (CMN) and

   The FAT is funded with a 0.65% tax on gross revenues of the companies, 1% on the payroll of
nonprofits and 1.65 % on imports of goods and services. Brazilian federal constitution, article number
239, assigns at least 40% of FAT resources to economic development programs, implemented through
BNDES, with criteria that maintains its values.
5
  FGTS was created in 1966 and is currently managed by a trustee board, composed by workers,
entrepreneurs and central government’s representatives.

  Following MoF methodology, we adopt the average cost of new issuing of public debt on December
2015, accumulated for the last 12 months.

Sources of Funding for Earmarked Credits

10.     Demand deposits, special funds, and direct lending from the fiscal sector
are the main funding sources of earmarked credit. Figure 10 provides a taxonomy of
funding sources for earmarked credits, using a static balance sheet approach as of end-
2015 (see Annex 4 for a comparison with 2007). Funding accumulated by the special
funds are directed to BNDES (R$291bn) and to other development and public
commercial banks (R$299bn). BNDES provided R$285bn of its resources to public and
private commercial banks to on-lend to specific projects, based on agreed criteria. The
Figure does not fully capture the flow of funds as some funding sources are used for
other purposes than credit, and for example BNDES also raises funds in the capital
market, from multilateral institutions, etc.

Note: Numbers scaled to total outstanding credit in 2015 of R$ 3.2 trillion, and GDP of R$ 5.9 trillion.
Not all BNDES sources are directed to credit. BNDES also invests in stocks, debentures, securities, etc.,
which are not included. Resources from Special Funds to other banks than BNDES are approximations
based on Central Bank of Brazil, BNDES, FGTS and Ministry of Agriculture data. Not all special funds
for earmarked credit are covered in the study and as such total outstanding credit does not add up.

11.    To understand who funds the earmarked credits, we grouped the funding
sources into three categories: savers, employees, and the fiscal sector. The Special
Funds are separated into: (i) Severance Indemnity Fund (FGTS), which is a mandatory

    See Resolution nb 4.511/2016 as an example of regulatory oversight over the earmarked rural credit.

savings scheme imposed on firms based on wage expenditures10; and, (ii) FAT and
other constitutional funds which are based on tax collection and are thus considered
under fiscal resources. It should be noted that there are interest rate subsidies given to
certain earmarked programs, which do not have funding associated with them
(PRONAF and Minha Casa Minha Vida).

12.      The funding of earmarked credit comes from the following sources11:

       Savers fund about 40 percent (R$760bn; 13 percent of GDP) as of end-2015,
        compared to 49 percent (10 percent of GDP) at end-2007. Funding comes from
        demand and savings deposits as well as tax-exempt instruments such as from
        real estate and agricultural letters of credit (LCI and LCA).

       Employees fund about 12 percent (R$ 224bn; 4 percent of GDP) as of end-
        2015, through monthly salary deductions to the Severance Indemnity Fund
        (FGTS), at very low remuneration. FGTS provided funding for 18 percent of
        directed credit (7 percent of GDP) at end-2007.

       The fiscal sector funds about 48 percent (R$890bn; 15 percent of GDP),
        through direct lending to BNDES (R$523bn; 9 percent of GDP) and through
        various special and constitutional funds (6 percent of GDP, excluding FGTS).
        Fiscal sector funded 33 percent of directed funds (7 percent of GDP) at end-
        2007.


Direct Costs of Provision of Earmarked Credits
13.     The “costs? of the provision of earmarked credits are borne by the fiscal
sector, and by under-remuneration of certain deposits and forced savings (Figure
11). The costs considered here are a mix of direct and implicit subsidies and provide
only a partial analysis. A comprehensive analysis of net costs should consider the
benefits due to the provision of earmarked credits (on investment, growth, jobs etc.),
which is partially addressed in the next section.

14.     The cost of potential equity injections are not considered although they can
be large. In particular when credit risks materialize in Government owned banks
recapitalization can be costly. In the period 1995-1998 mostly those banks owned by
Brazilian states were recapitalized. Moreover, in 1996 Banco do Brazil was
recapitalized and Caixa was relieved of losses on unpaid mortgage debt. In 2001 under
the PROEF program, Caixa, Banco do Brazil, Banco do Nordeste, and Banco da
Amazonia all received capital contributions. In light of the recent credit expansion and
substantial Government ownership of the banking sector the potential costs could be

10
   Firms pay into the FGTS based on their wage expenditures. It can be argued whether the cost is
ultimately fully passed on to the employees or borne by the employers. For simplicity we consider it to
be borne by employees.
11
   The sources are based on total directed funds. For some schemes it was not feasible to separate
between earmarked credit and other directed funds.


                                            Page 13 of 41
substantial, but an assessment of possible capital needs are beyond the scope of this
work.

Figure 11: Costs of Earmarked Credit




15.      The fiscal costs of earmarked credits are estimated at 3.7 percent of general
government revenues or 1.5 percent of GDP (Table 2). The fiscal costs include direct
subsidies on specific programs as well as financing provided to BNDES. Regarding the
latter, to finance additional BNDES programs, the government issued public debt at
market rates (14 percent on average) and lend to BNDES at subsidized rates (TJLP; 7
percent on average). The increase in the interest rate differential combined with the
growth in earmarked credit contributed to increasing costs as a share of general
government revenues from 1 percent in 2009 to 2.6 percent12 (see Table A3.3 in Annex
3 for details).

  The calculation does not take into account dividends from BNDES, which is considered remuneration
on invested capital, nor tax revenues from BNDES.

credit programs were computed by the MoF. The remaining estimates are our own. The figures estimated
by MoF for 2015 might be overestimated as some payments from previous years were deferred to 2015.

16.     New funding for development and infrastructure projects through BNDES’
credit programs was costly, reaching R$ 28.5 billion or 1.3 percent of fiscal
revenues in 2015. BNDES’ Investment Support Program (PSI), which was in place
during 2008-15, received most of this new funding and charged borrowers an average
interest rate of 4.6 percent. The central government had to reimburse BNDES 2.5
percent in equalization rate, which implied R$ 9.5 billion in direct explicit subsidies in
2015 (0.43 percent of general government´s revenues).13,14 The fiscal cost of Treasury’s
direct lending alone reached R$ 19 billion in 2015, 0.86 percent of the year’s general
government revenues. Direct and indirect credit subsidies from this operation amounted
to 1.3 percent of 2015 general government revenues.

17.    The rural program, PRONAF, also carries a large fiscal subsidy. The
program had an explicit fiscal cost from interest rate equalization of R$ 8.3 billion, with
13
  MoF (2016).
14
  Besides decreasing interest rates through programs such as PSI, BNDES has also increased the average
maturity of its overall loans from 6 years during the period 2002-2008 to 8 years during 2009-2015 for
direct lending and from 7 to 8, for on-lendings.

interest rates as low as 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent - well below SELIC market rate and
inflation (Figure A3.1 in Annex 3 presents the yearly fiscal cost flow as percentage of
GDP).

18.    The implicit costs to employees and depositors result mainly due to the
under-remuneration of forced savings and deposits (Figure 12). Most Special Funds
are remunerated at 7 percent suffering a loss relative to investing in government bonds.
The depositors who finance rural credits through demand deposits typically receive no
remuneration while other deposits earn up to 7.8 percent. Borrowers benefit from
subsidized interest rates that are frequently below the inflation rate. Lending rates vary
by sector and can be as low as 2.5 percent for certain rural loans.

19.      Savers often receive limited remuneration and their savings options are
constrained (Table 3). Funding from savers reached R$ 760 billion in 201515, which
corresponds to 24 percent of total outstanding credit in the economy. Savings accounts
(poupança) pay less than inflation at 9 percent, but are tax-exempt. The reference rate
for rural credit and savings accounts are set by the Central Bank.16 The savings account
rate has usually followed the inflation rate thus offering about zero real return. Recently
the real return has been negative leading to a loss of savings mobilization, which in turn
has constrained earmarked housing credit, which relies on such deposits. Time deposits
are remunerated close to the SELIC rate, whereas demand deposits are not remunerated
at all. Employees that contribute to the FGTS earn just 4.8 percent.

15
   Some of the funding raised is not for credit, but for other types of funding for directed purposes. It
was not feasible to separate the funds, and the total funding therefore exceeds total earmarked credit.

20.      The cost of earmarked credits increases in line with the increase in market
interest rates. In particular, the gap between the Government’s borrowing cost and the
yield on its lending to the financial sector increases. Similarly, the burden of FGTS’s
mandatory savers and accounts without a direct link to market costs suffer a loss. An
estimation of these costs’ sensitivity to a 1 percentage point increase in market interest
rates is presented in Table 4.

21.    The explicit regulation of earmarked interest rates is unusual by
international standards. In searching for international evidence on directed credit,
India, China, and Argentina were identified as comparators (Box 1). Argentina
introduced a program for lending to enterprises at a specified interest rate but other
programs do not impose caps on lending rates.




17
   Following the methodology described in Annex 3 for estimating fiscal costs, the costs to savers are
estimated multiplying the outstanding balance of (1) savings accounts and (2) demand deposits and the
(3) FGTS’ total outstanding credit operations to its respective earnings differential to the CDI interest
rate.

Box 1. Provision of Directed Credits: International Comparisons

India: Industrial Financial Corporation and Directed Credit Requirements

The Indian banking system remains dominated by public banks, which collected over
77 percent of deposits and comprise over 90 percent of all branches18. The main
provider of long-term loans is the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, which
focuses on industrial and infrastructure sectors. Banks typically provide short-term
working capital to firms.
Both public and private banks are required by the Reserve Bank of India to offer
‘priority sector’ loans, which are small value loans to farmers for agriculture and
allied activities, micro and small enterprises19, poor people for housing, students for
education, other low income groups and weaker sections.20
Interest rates are freely set, but the dominance of public banks may lead to lower rates
as these banks pursue social and economic development objectives.21
Banks that fail to achieve the lending target of at least 40 percent of their adjusted net
bank credit to the ‘priority sectors’, are required to lend money to specific
government agencies at very low rates of interest.22

China: Dominance of state banks and lending to state owned enterprises

State banks dominate China’s banking sector with large part of lending going to state
owned enterprises. According to Szamosszegi et al (2011), state owned enterprises
benefit from: (1) access to credit at favorable interest rates; (2) debt forgiveness; and
(3) in some cases, access to loans, despite lack of creditworthiness. More recently, the
three policy banks have been playing an increasing role in credit expansion as the
economy slows. The mandates of policy banks, traditionally focused on infrastructure
and basic/pillar industries, have been broadened to support the government’s
economic and social policies. However, evidence of extensive earmarking credits
through regulation or government interventions were not identified.

Argentina: “Line for Productive Credit? Program

Argentina requires its 30 largest banks to lend the equivalent of 14 percent of their
deposits to enterprises at a fixed interest rate of 22 percent (negative in real terms).
Up to 30 percent can be for working capital, but the rest has to be for investment
purposes. The program parameters have been relaxed since it was introduced in
2012.




18
   Banerjee and Duflo (2014).
19
   More than 15 percent of credit must be directed to small and medium firms. However, banks have
difficulties achieving this target loans and many companies still rely on alternative financing channels as
main source of funds (Bhue et al, 2016).
20
   Weaker sections include small and marginal farmers, artisans, village cottage industries, scheduled
castes and tribes and distressed poor.

III. POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF EARMARKED CREDITS ON ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL

22.     Regulation of credit markets may be justified when market failures prevent
viable or socially valuable projects from being pursued. In these cases, interventions
should benefit firms that are new, particularly innovative, or belonging to sectors that
generate social externalities. Government intervention may be justified whenever
projects whose social benefits exceed their costs would not be funded if private markets
were functioning without intervention (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1980).

23.    This section provides a preliminary analysis of the impact of earmarked
credit on the allocation of resources among sectors and firms. The analysis is an
update of Bonomo, Brito and Martins (2015) and includes both earmarked credits and
other credits by public banks, collectively referred to as government driven credit
(GDC). The detailed econometric results are provided in Annex 2. One directed credit
program, FINAME, targeted firms in the value chain other than the borrower, and this
methodology cannot assess such impact.

24.     Firms that benefited from earmarked and other public bank credits were
larger, older and less risky. An econometric analysis of lending to firms in the period
2004 to 2015 illustrates the characteristics of those firms that benefit vs. those that do
not.23 Separate results were obtained for the post global financial crisis period (2008-
2015), and the results are summarized in Table 5 and detailed in Annex 2. Statistically
significant results indicate that in the recent period firms that had higher probability of
accessing earmarked loans were older, larger, had lower rate of non-performing loans
(Annex 2, Table A2.1, Panel A). The share of BNDES outstanding credit to the public
sector increased from an historical average of 17 percent to 25 percent by the end of
2009, reaching 37 percent on December, 2015, amounting to R$ 260 billion or 4.5
percent of GDP24. Mixed-capital companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras and Furnas
were the major beneficiaries.




23
   The analysis is based on the credit registry at the Central Bank of Brazil (SCR). It provides a repository
of loan contracts between banks and firms, composing an unbalanced panel of more than 1 million firms
between 2004 and 2015.

25.     Firms that borrowed from public banks outside of the earmarked programs
were also less risky, but were smaller than the earmarked borrowers. Although
after the crisis public banks also increased their market share through non-earmarked
lending, the firms targeted by this expansion were smaller and less risky (Annex 2,
Table A2.1, Panel B). They charged lower average interest rates than the private banks.

26.     Firms that received earmarked credits did not invest more. Based on a
subsample of public firms25 from 2004 to 2012, it is analyzed how a higher proportion
of government-driven loans affected the firms’ investment rate, leverage ratio and
financial costs. There was no significant relationship between the firms’ investment rate
and the proportion of BNDES loans and other earmarked loans.

27.     Firms that received earmarked loans lowered their financial expense and
increased their leverage. A higher proportion of BNDES loans were associated with a
higher leverage, and firms with a larger participation of earmarked loans had lower
financial expenses. These results are in line with those obtained by Lazzarini et al.
(2014) which shows that BNDES mostly finances large and profitable firms, lowering
their financial expenses, but with no effect on their investments and performances.
Similarly, Lage de Sousa and Otaviano (2014) show that firms that were granted
BNDES credits did not outperform those that were not granted such credits. A recent
macro-economic analysis26 suggests that because earmarked expansion is counteracted
with a higher monetary policy rate in turn impacting other borrowers, the effect on
productivity is negative.

28.    Earmarked loans may have been used for financial arbitrage. Caballero,
Panizza and Powell (2016) find that, in face of low global interest rates, firms in
countries with capital controls were issuing external bonds to finance carry-trade

25
     Balance sheet data were available for these firms and could be linked with data on credit.

activities. Since firms that borrowed earmarked loans expanded indebtedness without a
corresponding increase in investment, it is plausible that this leveraged expansion was
partly motivated by the existing opportunity of financial arbitrage, since low-risk
investment opportunities were widely available in the financial market at rates higher
than those of earmarked loans.

29.     Interest rates on government driven credit are substantially lower than free
      27
credit rates (Table 6). Average interest rates on earmarked loans (about 10 percent)
were less than one third of the interest rates charged by private banks on unregulated
loans (always larger than 34 percent) for the whole period. Rates on non-earmarked
loans from government-owned banks decreased from about 30 percent in 2011 to 20
percent in 2012 and 2013, mainly as a result of a strong push from government to
reduce interest spreads. Average non-earmarked interest rates from private banks had
much less variation, decreasing from 37 percent in 2011 to about 34 percent in 2012 and
2013. In 2015 non-earmarked interest rates from both private and government-owned
banks were above those of 2011.

30.     Interest rate differentials between earmarked and non-earmarked credits
particularly benefit smaller firms (Table 7). Within earmarked loans, the average
interest rates on earmarked loans was only 1 percentage point higher for smaller firms
than for the 50 largest. The difference was 13 percentage points for non-earmarked
loans from public banks and 24 percentage points for non-earmarked loans from private
banks. Thus, the interest rate benefit and implicit subsidy for a small firm accessing
earmarked funding is greater than for larger firms.

31.     The allocation of subsidies is unequal across sectors even after adjusting for
their share of credit (Figure 13). The distribution of the subsidies reflects in large part
the amount of credit to each sector. However, the proportion of subsidies a sector
received divided by its share of the total credit also demonstrates variation. When this
measure is greater than one, the sector is receiving a share of the total subsidies that is
larger than their share of credit. By this measure, subsidies are high for basic sanitation
and energy and low for the extractive sector.

35.    The strong credit growth since 2008 promoted by earmarked credit may
have contributed to build-up of risks in the system. The increase in credit/GDP was
mainly due to the increase in earmarked credit. The quality of these credits may be
impacted due to the economic downturn and the increasing maturity mismatch. On the
other hand, the subsidies reduce credit risk by lowering debt service requirements.

V. POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ON MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION

36.     The interventions have implications on the credit channel of monetary
policy. Our analysis suggests that the changes in the policy rate, SELIC, have to be
larger to have the same impact. Furthermore, as earmarked credit is unevenly distributed
among sectors and firms, monetary policy has a distortive impact on credit cost and
allocation.

37.   As the interest rates on earmarked credits are regulated, the impact of a
change in the policy rate vary widely between credit segments. Correlation between
the monetary policy rate, the SELIC, and interest rates on new loans in the non-
earmarked market is 96 percent compared to 76 percent for earmarked loans.

38.     This implies a lesser impact of monetary policy on firms with earmarked
loans. Our analysis shows that an increase in 1 percent in policy rate reduces the growth
rate of corporate loans by an estimated 3 percentage points. This effect is reduced by
one third for firms that receive earmarked credits. The mitigating impact of earmarked
loans in the transmission of monetary policy is also evident in firms’ employment
growth: a 1 percentage point increase in policy rate reduced a firm’s employment
growth rate by almost 1.2 percentage points, but this effect is reduced to 0.73
percentage points for firms with only earmarked loans. Large firms were not impacted
by changes in the policy rate. Annex Table A2.1 provides detailed results.

39.     As a consequence, changes in the policy rate (SELIC) have to be larger to
have the same impact. As the proportion of earmarked credit in the economy increases,
this effect becomes larger. We estimate that if earmarked loans responded to changes in
the SELIC in the same way as non-earmarked loans, an increase by 0.84 percent would
have the same effect as the current effect of a 1 percent SELIC increase.

40.     Earmarked credit is unevenly distributed among sectors and firms, and
monetary policy therefore has distortive impact on credit cost and allocation. As
discussed earlier, the interest rate for some sectors has greater correlation with the
policy rate than others, and the effect on credit demand is therefore affected. Similarly,
the subsidies associated with earmarked lending is affected. Thus, monetary policy
generates effects beyond its objective.

VI. POLICY IMPLICATIONS

41.     The magnitude and the complexity of the credit market interventions call
for a comprehensive evaluation to assess their effectiveness. The costs to the savers,
the fiscal sector, and borrowers with no access should be carefully balanced against the
benefits for those that benefit from access to earmarked credit. Policy elements include
transparency, accountability, objectives and results setting, earmark policy setting, and
state bank activities.

42.     The objectives and intended beneficiaries of the various earmarked credit
schemes should be clarified. The intended recipients behind the original creation of the
schemes—infrastructure projects, low-income housing, small scale rural families, small
firms—may no longer be adequately and efficiently served. In some cases technical
support to improve productivity could be more beneficial than preferential credit. These
objectives appear to have motivated large fiscal expenditures, an acceptance of low
returns to savers, and the tolerance of high interest costs for the remaining market. A
clear view on how to balance these objectives and a cost-benefit analysis should drive
the design of the credit market interventions.

43.    It is important to develop an impact analysis framework. The credit
interventions are executed by a multitude of actors including the finance ministry, the
state banks, the Central Bank, and those who govern various funds. A result-based
framework can help communicate policy objectives and create accountability for those
who execute the programs.

44.     Earmark policy setting has many dimensions including pricing, eligibility,
funding mechanisms, and tradability of lending obligations. The pricing of
earmarked lending defines the associated subsidy and by implication the cost of
operating the subsidy. The eligibility criteria create segmentation in the credit market,
which define the economic outcomes of the interventions. The funding mechanisms
determines who pays the subsidy allowing for below-market interest rates. Mechanisms
that allow financial institutions to trade the directed lending obligations may reduce the
burden on intermediaries. For example, deposit based earmark lending obligations could
be traded between intermediaries with a strong deposit base and those best able to reach
the targeted borrowers.

45.     Transparency and accountability should be the key pillars of good
policymaking. The complexities of the interventions make it challenging for policy
makers to understand if the objectives are being achieved in an efficient manner.
BNDES has improved disclosures on its lending, and policy initiatives are put forward
to support greater transparency (see Box 2). The Central Bank provides useful data to
assess the evolution in state bank lending and earmarked credit by different segments.
These are pillars that can be built on to enhance transparency and accountability.

46.   There is a need to increase public awareness and discuss the need for
reforms. Changes to earmarked credit schemes will occur as interest rates converge.



                                      Page 25 of 41
The authorities can drive the process by determining the appropriate speed and
sequencing of reforms, which may differ across various schemes.



Box 2: Initiatives for greater transparency

The magnitude of credit market interventions and the risk of poor governance
create the impetus for greater transparency. Transparency allows major
stakeholders to have a clear picture of the costs and social impacts of the
interventions. Transparency mechanism must assure that public credit programs are
under formal and public evaluation and periodically monitored with regard to its
effectiveness vis-vis its primary objectives, that is, whether it succeeded in reducing
the market failures it intended to mitigate.

Besides efforts to increase transparency, the accurate fiscal cost of the Brazilian
credit policy is not clear. The BNDES has made important steps towards improved
disclosure of individual lending transactions, publishing its respective lending rates,
grace and maturity periods. In 2011, a new law regulated the public access to public
information, which fostered several new decisions to guarantee that society have
comprehensive access to tractable and useful information.28,29

Initiatives are underway to strengthen transparency of credit market
interventions. One project under evaluation at the Senate aims to turn obligatory for
BNDES to process the cost of subsidized credit (based on TJLP) to the Tribunal de
Contas da União (Central Audit Court or TCU), estimating the difference between the
present value at market rates and the remaining parcels to be paid. Aggregate
numbers per program should be available to the public, to improve society’s
oversight. A second project is to turn credit program monitoring an obligation, in
particular with respect to its effectiveness. In addition, any new program must
demonstrate, whenever feasible, its public policy motivation with specific analysis of
expected results and counterfactuals.




28
   The Law nb 12.527/2011 established the mechanisms through which any person or entity, without the
need for reason, can demand the delivery of public information any layer of government or public
entities.
29
   As an example, the National Accounts Court (TCU) has determined the publication of all credit and
financial subsidies distributed through the different credit programs in place by the MoF, which includes
the BNDES’s Investment Support Program (PSI) and rural credit programs.

Annex 3: Methodology adopted to estimate the fiscal costs of public
funds
The tables below present the concepts and the methodology adopted to estimate the
fiscal costs of some of the public funds dedicated to Brazilian credit policy. Some
estimates were provided by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the remaining are own
estimates.
The MoF estimates the effect on revenues and expenses that arise from tax exemptions,
remissions, subsidies and tax, financial and credit benefits. Fiscal costs are classified
into implicit and explicit cost. Explicit costs are the actual disbursements of central
government made through the equalization of interest rates to banks or other entities
that offer under-remunerated earmarked loans. The fiscal implicit cost comprises
expenses arising from official credit programs operated through funds or programs,
where the interest rate is lower than the central government’s cost of funding.
The estimated fiscal costs of Treasury’s direct loans to BNDES, Constitutional Funds
and some rural credit programs were computed by the MoF, which assumes that the
government’s opportunity cost is the average implicit cost to renew its public debt.
The implicit cost of FGTS and BNDES’s funding from FAT were estimated using the
same MoF methodology using the average CDI interest rate as the opportunity costs of
public funds. This fiscal costs of FGTS and FAT are the outstanding credit volume
multiplied by the difference between the CDI interest rate and the weighted average of
the interest rate charged to FGTS borrowers or TLJP, in the case of FAT.
The foregone resources from tax exemption for the credit letters and savings
investments are the product of the investment’s earnings, the income tax and
outstanding balances for each year.
The table below characterizes the credit policy instruments by type of cost.

Regarding the Treasury’s direct loans to BNDES, two comments: (1) the implicit costs
of Treasury’s direct loans to BNDES is the difference between this opportunity cost and
how much BNDES remunerates the Treasury for the loans, which is mostly the TJLP
rate; (2) the explicit cost is how much the central government reimburses value paid for

1. Introduction
Horizontal inequalities (HIs) within a country, or inequalities among groups, have been
shown to be an important source of violent conflict (Stewart, 2008; Cederman et al., 2011;
Cederman et al., 2013). Relevant group categorizations include religion, ethnicity, and
region. Generally, more attention has been paid to vertical inequalities, which consist of
inequalities among individuals or households, than to horizontal inequalities, in
measurement, analysis, and policy. Yet, HIs are more important in some significant
respects, particularly as a cause of violent conflict and a source of injustice. They are highly
relevant in most West African countries, not only because these countries are ethnically,
religiously, and regionally heterogeneous, but also because quite a few of them have been
confronted with violent conflicts and other types of violent disturbances in the recent
past.

People have multiple identities and hence can be grouped in a variety of ways.
Accordingly, HIs can also be measured in different ways. Ethnicity,1 language, religion,
race, and region are examples of potentially relevant and salient group categorizations.
While identity groups are socially constructed, they can nonetheless be deeply felt, or
perceived to be “natural? or “age-old? differences and categorizations. Salient categories
vary across societies and time, depending on historical experience, group leaders, the
media, and the contemporary context, particularly in relation to how group members
perceive their treatment by governments and others, and the way in which groups are
used by potential leaders as a mechanism for mobilization and gaining power.2

Horizontal inequalities are multidimensional: significant dimensions include political
power at many levels; status (including levels of wealth); and cultural status recognition.
Horizontal inequalities along any of these dimensions can be a cause of grievance,
especially if inequalities are experienced simultaneously along each dimension. The
combination of political HIs (or exclusion) with cultural HIs is particularly likely to lead to
group mobilization, because political exclusion gives leaders a strong incentive to mobilize
supporters, while cultural inequality generates strong grievances among potential
supporters, who are therefore ripe for mobilization (Langer, 2005; Stewart, 2008).

There is mounting empirical evidence, across countries and within them, that large HIs
raise the potential for conflict (see for example Mancini, 2005; Murshed and Gates, 2005;
Brown, 2008; Østby, 2008; Cederman et al., 2011; Cederman et al., 2013). Moreover, the
evidence shows that conflict is particularly likely if significant political and economic and
social inequalities are both simultaneously present and run in the same direction (Langer,
2005; Cederman et al., 2011). However, it is not only crucial to analyze and track HIs
because of the threat of violent conflict, but also because group inequalities are


1
  Broadly defined as “any group attribute that provides recognition or definition, reference, affinity,
coherence and meaning for individual members of the group, acting individually or collectively ?
(Osaghae and Suberu, 2005, p. 5).
2
  In some contexts group alliances offer the best potential for achieving power. Consequently, the
emphasis on differences within such an alliance are minimized, and those with outsiders are
emphasized (see Posner, 2004).


                                                  4
fundamentally unjust, as people suffer or are privileged simply because of the group to
which they belong, rather than their individual merit or efforts.

In analyzing HIs in particular cases, the first requirement is to identify relevant group
categories. We should emphasize that membership in different categories may sometimes
overlap, partially or wholly—for example, people of one ethnicity may all (or mostly)
adhere to one religion, and people of another ethnicity to a different religion; and
members of a particular ethnicity or religion are generally concentrated in particular
regions. Sometimes—for example, with respect to religion, ethnicity, and region—it is
difficult to know which is the more salient category, and this can change over time.3
Where there is considerable overlap, one can use one category as a proxy for the other(s)
in measurement and in some types of policy. In the case of West Africa, there is a strong
overlap between region and ethnicity, since ethnic identities develop as people live in
proximity and develop a common language and culture. While migration (especially to the
capital city) has diluted the identification of ethnicity and region, it remains strong. In this
paper, mainly due to data availability, the bulk of our evidence relates to regional HIs.
Given the overlap between region and ethnicity, this also provides a guide to ethnic HIs
(and in some cases religious HIs, too) but we cannot infer from this that regional
inequalities are more relevant than ethnic ones to political developments, including
conflict. Indeed, there are strong reasons to think that in many sub-Saharan countries,
people primarily mobilize by ethnicity (or by some coalition of ethnicities) (Posner, 2005;
Guichaoua, 2006; Guichaoua, 2012).

In this paper we will review the prevailing HIs and their management in four West African
countries—Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria. Table 1 provides some basic facts
about these four countries, which vary greatly in area, per capita income, poverty, child
mortality rates, and other features.

Further, in terms of economic structure, Nigeria stands out for its heavy dependence on
oil, which accounts for over 70 percent of government revenues and 84 percent of
exports. However, oil exports are rising in both Ghana (39 percent of total exports in 2012)
and Côte d’Ivoire (31 percent of total exports in 2012) as well. On the other hand, Mali’s
exports are mainly agricultural (cotton in particular), with a rising proportion of
manufactures (24 percent of total exports in 2012).4

The case study countries also differ with respect to their colonial past. Nigeria and Ghana
were British colonies, while Mali and Côte d’Ivoire were French colonies. In terms of
ethnoreligious demography, it is important to note that all four countries have a highly
diverse ethnic population, and three of the four (Ghana, Nigeria, and Côte d’Ivoire) have
substantial Christian and Muslim populations (see Table 2 and Figure 1). Mali is the
exception in that is almost entirely Muslim (see Section 2 for more details on each
country’s ethnoreligious demography and geography).

  For example, in the Bosnian conflict, what started as primarily an ethnic division evolved into a
religious one, with religious symbols used for mobilization (see Powers, 1996). See also Stewart
(2012).

Each of our case study countries has had a relatively turbulent and complex political
history in recent decades (see the appendix for an overview of some key political events in
each country). Indeed, all of them have been subject to different and varying types of
violence in the recent past. There have been secessionist movements in Nigeria and Mali;
violence aimed at “regime change? and control over the state in Côte d’Ivoire and Mali;
violence with religious objectives (notably the introduction of Sharia law) in Nigeria and
Mali; violence against corporations and the state in Nigeria; and all have experienced
intercommunal violence at the local level with varying degrees of severity.

While conflicts in Africa are often described as “ethnic,? this is not a valid description of
most of the violence in our four case study countries. Illustratively, the violence that
occurred in the northern region in Ghana in the 1990s was partly intraethnic; in Nigeria,
Mali, and Côte d’Ivoire the divisions underlying the tensions and violence that have
occurred in recent years were as much religious as they were ethnic, and different sides
usually included a coalition of ethnicities. However, it is notable that regional differences
and disparities have been a common feature of the conflicts in our case studies:
north/south differences in Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Nigeria; and southeast and south versus
the rest in the Biafran War and the oil protests, respectively. Yet despite the contribution
of regional differences and inequalities to political mobilization and violence, policies have
hardly addressed the issue in three of the four countries, and in two of them, politics have
been very exclusionary for at least some of the time.

Thus, despite acknowledged structural and historical differences, the four case study
countries present instructive examples of the possible (mis)management of HIs. In the rest
of this paper we analyze the evolution and management of the prevailing HIs in each of
the four cases. In Section 2, we present evidence on the evolution and current state of HIs
in each country. We also present data on how people perceive the prevailing HIs (for
example, subjective HIs). In Section 3 we analyze the main causes of the prevailing HIs,
while Section 4 focuses on the governments’ attitudes, policies, and measures toward HIs.
Section 5 discusses the links between the HIs we observe and the political outcomes. In



                                               7
the last section, we draw some conclusions and make policy recommendations for
improved management of HIs in multiethnic developing countries generally, and
specifically in our four case study countries.

2. Horizontal inequalities in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria,
and Mali
In this section we analyze the main horizontal inequalities in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria,
and Mali5 and present data concerning the “objective? situation as well as people’s
perceptions of the prevailing horizontal inequalities.6,7 The data concern the economic
dimensions of horizontal inequality, although we recognize the importance of political and
cultural status inequalities for well-being and political stability. We focus predominantly
on presenting evidence on the prevailing interregional inequalities, since data is more
extensive for this. Since, as we show below, there is a considerable overlap between
ethnicity, religion, and region in each of the countries, these regional inequalities are
indicative of ethnic and religious inequalities. This is demonstrated by the limited amount
of data we present on ethnic and religious inequalities.

2.1 Ghana

Ethnic and religious demography and geography. Ghana’s four main ethnic groups, which
together account for about 86 percent of the Ghanaian population, are Akan, Mole-
Dagbani, Ewe, and Ga-Dangme. The Akan are by far the largest ethnic group, with
approximately 48 percent of the population. They form the majority of the population in
five of the country’s ten regions in the south (that is, the Western, Central, Eastern,
Ashanti, and Brong Ahafo regions) (see Figure 2). While the Akan are comprised of around
twenty smaller groups (of which the Ashanti and Fanti are demographically the most
important), these ethnic groups share important cultural, social, and political institutions,
and traditions and customs. The second largest ethnocultural group is the Mole-Dagbani.
They constitute about 17 percent of the population and are predominantly found in the
northern regions (the Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions).




5
  Besides using country-specific census data, we also use data from the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS). The standard DHS survey consists of a household and women's questionnaire, for
which a nationally representative sample of women is interviewed. In addition to asking an
elaborate range of questions regarding issues such as family planning, maternal and child health,
contraception, and nutrition, the surveys also ask about respondents’ ethnic background, place of
birth, and socioeconomic situation. For more information see http://www.measuredhs.com/.
6
  While it is often assumed that objective and subjective horizontal inequalities are broadly the
same, some recent studies have shown that there may be quite serious discrepancies between the
perceived and objective levels of inequality (Langer and Smedts, 2013).
7
  In order to assess people’s perceptions of prevailing economic HIs, we make use of the
Afrobarometer surveys. The surveys are repeated on a regular basis (every 4 –5 years) and the latest
round of surveys was conducted in 2012. For more information see www.afrobarometer.org.


                                                 8

However, the Mole-Dagbani are a very loose ethnocultural grouping that consists of about
ten relatively small ethnic groups, including the Dagomba, Frafra, and Dagarte. While
these ethnic groups have certain social and cultural institutions in common, they have very
different histories, customs, and traditions (Brukum, 1995). The third largest ethnic group,
with about 13 percent of the population, are the Ewe;8 they are the dominant ethnicity in
the Volta region, which is located in the eastern part of the country. With about 8 percent
of the population, the Ga-Dangmes are the fourth largest group. They are concentrated in
coastal plains stretching from Accra to Tema, and hence constitute the largest group in the
Greater Accra region.

Internal migration has qualified the simple equation of region and ethnicity. One estimate
for 2003 suggests that as many as 37 percent of males of northern ethnicity live in
southern Ghana, although only 1.5 percent of people of southern ethnicity live in the
north (Mancini, 2009).

Religion is another important dividing line in Ghana, as shown in Figure 3. Ghana is a
predominantly Christian country, with almost 73 percent of the population adhering to
one of the Christian denominations, in particular Catholic, Protestant, and
Pentecostal/Charismatic. Muslims constitute around 18 percent of the population, while
about 5 percent adhere to a traditional religion (Ghana Statistical Service, 2013). Muslims
form a particularly significant part of the population in the northern regions. Indeed, in the

8
 The Ewe are usually portrayed as the most homogenous ethnic group mainly because of a lack of
sharp subdivisions, as well as the perception that they speak a single language, despite the fact that
there are a considerable number of Ewe dialects.


                                                  9
largest of the three northern regions (itself called the “Northern Region?), the majority of
the population (about 60 percent) is Muslim. However, traditionalists also constitute a
significant proportion of the population in the three northern regions, especially in the
Upper West and Upper East regions. Based on data from the 2010 Population Census,
about 48 percent of the population in the three northern regions are Muslim, while 30
percent are Christian and 19 percent have a traditional religion. In the south, around 10
percent of the population is Muslim, and the vast majority are Christian.

Objective socioeconomic and political horizontal inequalities. In Ghana, a serious
developmental divide compounds the ethnoreligious north-south divide discussed above.
The disadvantage of the northern regions—and to a lesser extent the Volta region
compared to the rest of the country, especially with regard to the Greater Accra region—
was already present at the time of independence, as illustrated in Table 3.

Throughout Ghana’s postindependence period, inequalities between the northern and
southern regions and, correspondingly, inequalities between northern and southern
ethnic groups, and between Muslims and Christians, have persisted. The north remained
much poorer in terms of income, infrastructure, education, and medical services in the
1970s and 1980s. Illustratively, it was estimated by Ewusi (1976) that the Northern and
Upper East and Upper West regions had levels of development equivalent to only 11
percent and 7 percent respectively of the level found in the Greater Accra region in the
mid-1970s.

Although the north appeared to have slightly caught up with the south by the 1990s with
respect to some socioeconomic indicators (such as literacy and infant mortality), with
regard to other indicators (such as the incidence of poverty and annual mean income per
capita), the north-south divide actually worsened considerably during this period, as
illustrated in Table 4. While the Greater Accra region (which is the country’s
administrative/industrial/economic core region), the Western, Eastern, Ashanti, and Brong
Ahafo regions (that is, the Akan-dominated, cocoa- and mineral-producing regions) and
the Volta region saw a considerable drop in their poverty rates, in two of the three
northern regions (the Northern and Upper East regions) poverty increased between 1991–
1992 and 1998–1999. While in 1991–1992 the mean annual income per capita in the
Greater Accra region was about two times higher than in the Northern and Upper West
regions, in 1998–1999, this was more than four times as high. The northern regions’
position vis-à-vis the national average also worsened noticeably.

Figure 4 provides information on contemporary inequalities in Ghana. It is clear that the north
still lags considerably behind. With regard to all four indicators (that is, the proportion of people
with access to electricity; the level of Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI); the proportion of
females without education; and the under-five mortality rate), the three northern regions are
doing considerably worse. Thus, for instance, while the national average of the proportion of
people without education was 31 percent in 2008, in the Northern, Upper West, and Upper East
regions, these proportions were 68 percent, 55 percent, and 54 percent, respectively. Similarly,
while on average 61 percent of the Ghanaian population was connected to the national
electricity grid in 2008, in the three northern regions, only about 32 percent of people had access
to electricity. Unsurprisingly, under-five mortality rates were also much higher in the north
compared to the national average. In line with Ghana’s ethnic and religious geography, Table 5
shows that the main northern ethnic group (the Mole-Dagbani) and people who are Muslim are
doing considerably worse in these areas.

If we look at the evolution of these three indicators over the last two decades, one can see that
the situation in Ghana has generally improved substantially since 1993 (see Figure 5). But while
the absolute situation in the three northern regions has improved considerably, the
improvement was not faster than in the rest of the country. Consequently there was very little or
no real catch-up, so horizontal inequalities remain very severe.

Perceptions of horizontal inequalities. In order to assess people’s perceptions of the prevailing
horizontal inequalities, we use data from Ghana’s Afrobarometer R4 survey conducted in 2008.
The survey asked people about the extent to which they felt their group was disadvantaged in
economic and political terms compared to other ethnic groups. Figure 6 shows the proportion of
people per region in Ghana who perceived their group’s economic situation to be “worse? or
“much worse? than other ethnic groups.

It emerges that the people in the north correctly perceive their economic situation to be worse
than that of other groups in the country. In line with this, the proportion of people in the south
who feel their group is doing worse than other groups is much lower, except in the Volta region,
where quite a large proportion of people feel they are doing worse than other groups, despite
the fact that the objective situation indicates otherwise. In other words, there appears to be a bit
of a mismatch between perceptions of HIs and a more objective assessment of reality among the
people in the Volta region (that is, predominantly Ewe people).

Despite these perceptions of deprivation among northern groups, the proportion of people in
the north who feel they are consciously discriminated against by the government on a regular
basis is relatively low and has decreased significantly since 2005. Indeed, the proportion of
people who felt treated unfairly by the government “often? or “always? has consistently
decreased in the three northern regions since then, much in line with perceptions of
improvement in other regions of Ghana. Illustratively, in the Northern region, the proportion of
people who felt treated unfairly “often? or “always? in 2012 was about 14 percent, down from
33 percent in 2005. A similar sharp drop occurred in the two other northern regions.

2.2 Côte d’Ivoire

Ethnic and religious demography and geography. Côte d’Ivoire’s ethnic groups are usually
clustered into the following five larger ethnocultural groups: Akan, Voltaic, Krou, Northern
Mandé, and Southern Mandé.9 The Akan consist of a number of ethnic subgroups, including the
Abron, Agni, Baoulé, Abbey, Abouré, and Akyé, and are predominantly found in the eastern and
central parts of the country (see Figure 7). The Baoulé are the largest Akan ethnic group and
inhabit the center of the country, which contains the traditional cocoa-growing zone.

Figure 7. Main ethnic groups in Côte d’Ivoire




Source: Authors’ calculations and graphics based on data from Côte d’Ivoire’s Afrobarometer R5 survey.

The southwestern part of the country is predominantly inhabited by people from the Krou ethnic
cluster, who constituted about 16 percent of the population in 1975; however, since then, their
share of the population has fallen to about 13 percent. The Bété are the largest ethnic group
among the Krou. The Southern Mandé, which include the Dan, Yacouba, and Gouro ethnic
groups, are predominantly found in the western part of the country, and constitute about 10
percent of the population. The northern population mainly consists of Voltaics and Northern
Mandés, and these two ethnic groups together accounted for 34 percent of the population at
the time of the last census (in 1998). The largest ethnic group of the Voltaic cluster are the
Sénoufo, who originate from the northeast and are particularly concentrated in and around
Korhogo, the largest city in the north and the most important cotton-growing area of the country
(Coulibaly, 1978). The two main ethnic groups of the Northern Mandé cluster are the Malinkés
and the Dioulas.

 The ethnic categorization discussed here is based on the classification used by the Institute National de la
Statistique.


                                                      18
Due to extensive international migration in both the colonial and postcolonial period, a large
proportion of Côte d’Ivoire’s population is of foreign origin. In 1998, people termed “foreigners?
accounted for more than four million people or about 26 percent of the population, though
many of these foreigners were born in Côte d’Ivoire and have parents who were born there as
well, or have parents who migrated before independence. Because the vast majority of these
foreigners originate from Burkina Faso, Mali, and Guinea, they share important ethnocultural
and religious traditions with people from these countries (Langer, 2005).

As in Ghana, religious differences appear to some extent to reinforce ethnoregional differences.
While the Akan and Krou ethnic groups are predominantly Christian, the northern ethnic
groups—the Voltaic and Northern Mandé—are mostly Muslim. Consequently, a majority of
people in the northern regions (comprised of the Savanes, Vallée du Bandama, Denguélé,
Worodougou, and Bafing regions) are Muslim (see Figure 8). Although the northern population is
predominantly Muslim, a majority of all Muslims actually lives in the southern regions. But
Christians nonetheless constitute a majority of the population in the southern regions.

Objective and political horizontal inequalities. Like Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by
serious regional socioeconomic inequalities, especially between its southern and northern
regions. Although there were no distinct regional disparities in development before 1950
(Hinderink and Tempelman, 1979, p. 4), as a result of changed colonial policies in the 1950s,
north-south inequalities had become quite severe around the time of independence in 1960.
Table 6 demonstrates the extent of the regional income inequalities in 1965, when domestic
income per capita (including nonmonetary income) in Abidjan (by far the most developed area in


                                                    19
the country) was 11 times higher than in the north. The north was also doing considerably worse
than the center (with a domestic income per capita of 1.9 times higher than the north) and
southern (2.6 times higher) regions. If one only takes into account cash income, the northern
disadvantage was even more pronounced: domestic monetary income per capita in Abidjan,
center, and southern regions was respectively 37, 4.5, and 7 times higher than in the north.

Regional inequalities have remained severe throughout the postindependence period.
Illustratively, in 1985 the mean consumption expenditure per capita in the northern Savannah
region was about 50 percent below the national average (Glewwe, 1988) (see Table 7). Since
then, no substantial or sustained reduction in the north-south divide has occurred, although
some moderate “improvement? took place as a result of the economic recession in the period
1985–1995, as shown in Table 7, because the negative impact of the recession on expenditure
levels was considerably larger in the southern regions. While the mean household expenditure
per capita of the Savannah region was 39 percent below the national average in 1985, in 1995,
this was only 25 percent. Yet, in absolute terms, the expenditure levels in the Savannah region
also dropped substantially between 1985 and 1995, and as a result poverty levels further
increased in the northern regions (affecting 80 percent of the population in 1995) (Azam, 2004).

Côte d’Ivoire’s inequalities persist today. With regard to all four indicators (the proportion of
people with access to electricity; the level of MPI; the proportion of females without education;
and the under-five mortality rate) shown in Figure 9, it is clear that the northern regions are
performing much worse than the southern regions. For example, while in 2012 on average 56
percent of the Ivorian people had access to electricity, in the north (the Savanes region),
northeast (the Zanzan region), and northwest (the Bafting, Worodougou, and Denguélé regions),
only 31 percent, 40 percent, and 39 percent of people were connected to the national electricity
grid. Similarly, while on average 53 percent of Ivorian females had no formal education, in the
north a much higher proportion of women were uneducated; 75 percent in the north, 63 percent
in the northeast, and 83 percent in the northwest regions. Under-five mortality rates were also
much higher in the north compared to the national average, especially in Savanes, Worodougou,
and Denguélé regions. The main reason why the region of Vallée du Bandama, which is quite far
north, is doing considerably better than its surrounding regions is because the country’s second
largest city (Bouaké) is situated in the southern part of this region.

Looking at the prevailing HIs across ethnicity and religion in Côte d’Ivoire (see Table 8) reveals
that while the southern ethnic groups (the Akan, Krou, and Southern Mandé) are doing
considerably better in terms of educational achievements than the northern ethnic groups (the
Northern Mandé and Voltaic), in terms of the proportion of people who have access to
electricity, the Northern Mandé are performing best. However, a closer inspection of the DHS
survey data indicates that this is a direct consequence of the fact that a higher proportion of
Northern Mandé live in urban areas, which tend to have higher levels of development. With
respect to the inequalities across religions, it emerges that Christians, as expected, are doing
relatively better than Muslims in terms of having access to electricity. Yet, the difference
between Christians and Muslims is moderated by the fact that a relatively higher proportion of
Muslims lives in urban areas.

Perceptions of horizontal inequalities. Unfortunately, survey data like that for Ghana concerning
people’s perceptions of inequalities are not available for Côte d’Ivoire. The Afrobarometer
survey was conducted for the first time in Côte d’Ivoire only in 2012, and unfortunately, the
latest round of this survey no longer included questions about the extent to which people felt
their group was disadvantaged in economic and political terms compared to other ethnic groups.
However, the question regarding to what extent people feel the government is treating their
ethnic group unfairly was included. Figure 10 shows the proportion of people who felt this
“often? or “always.? It is interesting to note that the regions with the highest proportion of
people feeling discriminated against are not in the north, but rather in the west and in the east.
In contrast, except for the Zanzan region in the northeast, relatively few people feel the
government treats them unfairly. This might be explained by the fact that the current president,
Alassane Ouattara, originates from the north and his government has a very clear northern
representation.

2.3 Nigeria
The exact number of ethnic groups in Nigeria is disputed. As Mustapha (2006) notes, estimates
range from 250 to 374 (Otite, 1990) and 400 (Bangura, 2001). Official figures on the number and
size of different ethnic groups are not available because of the omission of ethnicity in
population censuses. Based on the last colonial census and more recent Afrobarometer surveys,
it is clear that the three most populous ethnic groups are the Hausa-Fulani, Igbo, and Yoruba,
respectively indigenous to the north, east, and west of the country (see Figure 11). The last
colonial census of 1952 suggests that the three so-called “majority? groups together constituted
about 52 percent of the population (Mustapha, 2006). If we look at the ethnic composition
derived from the nationally representative 2012 Afrobarometer survey, it emerges that these
three groups together now constitute about 66 percent of the population (that is, Hausa-Fulani,
28.9 percent; Igbo, 15.6 percent; and Yoruba, 21.3 percent).

Figure 11. Main ethnic groups in Nigeria

Again based on data from the 2012 Afrobarometer survey, it emerges that Christians constitute
about 54 percent of the Nigerian population, and Muslims about 44 percent. There is an
important overlap between ethnicity and religion in Nigeria—the Hausa/Fulani and Kanuri are
predominantly Muslim; the Igbo and Southern minorities are predominantly Christian; and the
Yoruba and Northern minorities have an almost equal number of adherents of both religions
(Langer and Ukiwo, 2010). In 2003, it was estimated that only 1 percent of people of northern
origin were living in the south, while 6 percent of people of southern origin were living in the
north. With respect to religion, almost a quarter of people in the north are Christian and 12.5
percent of people living in the south are Muslim (Mancini, 2009). Hence, the religious north-
south divide, while not exact, is more pronounced than in Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire (see Figure 12).

Objective and political horizontal inequalities. Like all countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea in
the south, the most marked socioeconomic inequalities in Nigeria are those between the
northern and southern regions, and correspondingly, between its northern and southern ethnic
groups as well as between Muslims and Christians. The sharp north-south divide developed from
the early 1900s (Mustapha, 2006) and has persisted throughout the postindependence period.

Table 9 illustrates the extent of the regional disparities on a range of indicators in the mid-1990s.
It is clear that the two most northern zones or regions, the northwest and northeast, are the
least developed. Illustratively, in these two northern zones, about 2.5 to 3 times fewer people
have access to electricity or are literate than in the most developed southwestern zone. While
the third northern zone, north central, performed considerably better in access to electricity and
in literacy, it is still significantly less developed than the most developed zones, the southwest
and southeast. The main reason why the north central is doing somewhat better than the other
two northern zones is because Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, is located in this zone (Langer and Ukiwo,
2010). Another interesting finding that emerges from Table 9 is that the south-south zone
performs almost as poorly as the north central zone when it comes to access to electricity,
immunization of newborn babies, and the proportion of pregnant women who have access to
health clinics (Langer and Ukiwo, 2010).

Examining the current situation in Nigeria, it is notable that these inequalities remain very severe
(see Figure 13). Comparing the MPIs of the regions in the northeast with the levels observed in
the southwest, in the northern regions the poverty ratio was 4–5 times as high in 2008. A similar
picture emerges with regard to the three other indicators. Thus, for instance, in 2008 in most
regions in the south, a considerable majority (60–70 percent) had access to electricity, but in the
northern regions, far fewer people were connected to the electricity grid: 20–30 percent in the
northeast. The northeast was also doing extremely poorly with respect to under-five mortality,
with rates more than twice as high as in the southwest and considerably above the rates found
in other regional zones. The northwest is doing particularly badly compared to other regions in
the proportion of women who lack formal education. While only 6 percent of women in the
south had no formal education, in the northwest this ratio was 74 percent. In line with Nigeria’s
ethnic and religious geography, it emerges that the Hausa-Fulanis and Muslims are doing
considerably worse than people who belong to the Yoruba or Igbo ethnic groups or people who
are Christians, all of whom are predominantly found in the south (see Table 10). Further, if we
look at the evolution of HIs over time, it is noteworthy that regional inequalities got even worse
with respect to some indicators over the last decade (see Figure 14). For example, the ratio of
females without formal education in the northwest to the proportion in south-south was 6 in
1999 and rose to 12 in 2008,10 even though there had been a small improvement in the absolute
proportion.

  Of course, the ratio depends on the nature of the indicator. If we had measured the proportion of girls
with some formal education, there would have been no change in the ratio over these years.

Perceptions of inequalities in Nigeria. As Figure 15 shows, the northeast has the highest
proportion of people (65–77 percent) who consider their group’s economic situation worse or
much worse than that of other groups, a perception that is supported by objective indicators.
This view is shared by people in the northwest and some in the southwest and south-south, yet
the latter two regions “objectively? have quite low inequalities in relation to their region’s
average performance. This may be accounted for by high but unrealized expectations in the oil-
producing region of Niger Delta, and by high vertical inequalities, so that many people are very
poor despite the greater prosperity of the region. The north central region also showed a high
proportion of people thinking their situation was worse than other groups (although less than in
the northeast and northwest), also largely reflecting the objective situation. Interestingly, it is
the southeast (mainly Igbo) that showed the largest proportion of population believing that they
are unfairly treated by the government between 2001 and 2008 (see Figure 15), although there
was a large reduction in this between 2008 and 2012. The northern regions do not regard
themselves as particularly unfairly treated by the government.

2.4 Mali
Mali is divided into eight regions and the capital district, of which three regions are in the north
and the remainder are in the south of the country. The north is sparsely populated, accounting
for just 9 percent of the population (2009 census). Population per square km is just 1.6 in the
three northern regions, Timbuktu, Gao, and Kidal, compared with 31 in the south. As noted
earlier, virtually the entire population is Muslim. About half are classified as belonging to the
Mandé group, located in the south, which includes the Bambara, Soninké, Khassonké, and
Malinké. Other sizeable groups are the Fula (17 percent), Voltaic (12 percent), Songhai (6
percent), and Tuareg and Moor (10 percent). As in the other countries, ethnic groups are
geographically located (see Figure 16).

In Mali, the geographic differences in socioeconomic indicators are less clear-cut than in the
other countries (see Table 11 and Figure 17). Bamako, the capital, does the best, but in other
respects there is no systematic difference across regions. Basically, it seems like a situation of
shared poverty, with every region showing marked deprivations. With respect to the prevailing
inequalities between different ethnic groups, a similar picture emerges, with the Bambara,
Senofu, Soninké, and Malinké (that is, the dominant ethnic groups in the southwest and
in/around Bamako) doing somewhat better than the ethnic groups in the north. It is noteworthy,
however, that the Tuaregs appear to be doing worst of all ethnic groups, although not by a large
margin compared to the Moors. Worsening performance over time is to be noted in Timbuktu,
the area most affected by the ongoing violent conflict (see Figure 18). The lack of a clear pattern
is repeated in the perceptions data. Again, people in Bamako are least likely to perceive that they
are less well off or unfairly treated, but elsewhere no particular pattern can be observed and the
data appear very erratic (see Figure 19). However, it may well be that the data are not reliable,
especially in the north, as surveying nomadic populations poses particular problems.

2.5 HIs: A comparative assessment
Table 12 shows how the north and south in each of our four case study countries is doing
regarding two indicators—the proportion of people with access to electricity and the proportion
of females who have not had formal education. The table also shows the north-south ratio
regarding these two indicators. It is interesting to note that the north-south divide with respect
to the proportion of people with access to electricity is the sharpest in Ghana, followed by
Nigeria, Mali, and Côte d’Ivoire. In terms of the proportion of females who have not had formal
education, Ghana and Nigeria are also doing very poorly compared to Côte d’Ivoire and Mali.
Illustratively, in Nigeria, the proportion of females in the north who have not had any formal
education is more than 7 times higher than in the south. In Ghana, this ratio is 4.27. In contrast,
in Mali, there is hardly any north-south divide with respect to the proportion of females who
have not had formal education. Indeed, it appears that both regions are performing equally
badly concerning this indicator, with about 80 percent of females lacking any formal education.

Interestingly, the two countries doing “best? in terms of regional HIs (Côte d’Ivoire and Mali)
have actually both experienced a violent national conflict in their recent past. In contrast,
Nigeria, which has the largest north-south gap on these indicators, has not experienced conflict
at the national level since 1970, but has had sporadic and serious violence in the Middle Belt and
from Boko Haram in the north. Ghana, on the other hand, which has remained relatively
peaceful and stable for the last two decades, appears to have the largest north-south divide.
However, while Ghana has regional HIs that are in objective terms worse than the ones in Mali
and Côte d’Ivoire, and more or less similar to the ones in Nigeria, the north-south divide
nonetheless appears to be less politically salient and threatening than in the other three
countries. Indeed, very few people across Ghana (both in the north and south) feel that their
ethnic group is “treated unfairly? by their government (see Figure 6). In the other three
countries, the proportions of people both in the north and south who feel they are treated
unfairly by their respective governments were much higher. Arguably, a key element that makes
the north-south disparities in Ghana more tolerable than those in the other three countries is
the fact that Ghana is the only country that appears to have made substantial progress in
improving its situation over the last 15 years in the north as well as in the south, even though
this has not been accompanied by a rapid decline of the north-south divide.

3. An overview of causes of inequalities
In each case, it appears that a combination of climatic and other geographic differences and
colonial policy lay at the origin of the HIs. Postcolonial policy often reinforced the imbalances.

In all four countries, rain is more abundant and more evenly spread throughout the year in the
south than the north. This has obvious implications for fertility, although in the case of Mali,
even the south has very limited rainfall and the north is basically desert (see Figure 20). Hence
the evidence for Mali shows considerable areas of deprivation in the south as well as the north.
In each country, the south consequently formed the locus of colonial cash crops (and irrigation
schemes around the Niger river in the case of Mali), while the north consists of dryer savannah
country that colonial policy left largely to subsistence crops. In Ghana, for example, it was
estimated that in the 1980s, the northern regions, which accounted for 40 percent of land area,
produced only 14 percent of total agricultural output (Roe et al., 1992). Further advantaging the
south, minerals (gold and bauxite) were found in the south of Ghana, and gold in the south of
Mali. In Côte d’Ivoire, which had limited commercial development until the 1950s, there was
little regional imbalance (Hinderink and Tempelman, 1979), but from then on, the production of
cash crops in the south and southeast was promoted. Consequently, in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and
Nigeria, infrastructure and markets were concentrated in the south, where the colonial capitals
were also located and where commercial crops and mineral producers were found. The small
amount of modern industrialization was also concentrated there.

Education was initially introduced by missionaries—northern missionary activities were
restricted by the governments in Ghana and banned altogether in Nigeria, ostensibly to avoid
conflict with Muslims, and possibly also to preserve these areas as a “reservoir? of labor for
mines and commercial agriculture in the south, and to provide the personnel for the military
forces (see Langer, 2009; Bening, 1975, Osaghae and Suberu, 2005). In Côte d’Ivoire, too, most
missionary activity was concentrated in the country’s south and center rather than in the
Muslim-dominated north. At independence in Ghana, there was only one secondary school in
the north (Roe et al., 1992). Missionary schools were particularly focused on the Ewe (in the


                                                 36
west of Ghana), who were considered the most suitable recipients of Western education. In
Nigeria, it was the Igbo in the southeast who were regarded as having a special aptitude for
Western education. Education in the north was deliberately neglected by Governor Frederick
Lugard, who believed that education had made southerners discontented (Graham, 1966). In
1957, in northern Nigeria there were 2,080 primary schools and 18 secondary schools, compared
with 13,473 primary and 1,305 secondary schools in the south (population numbers were
broadly equal) (Mustapha, 2006). French colonial policy involved a much narrower focus of
education on tribal chiefs and their families, so that at independence the total number of
children attending school in Côte d’Ivoire was very low throughout the country, just 1 in 20 , or
only 10 percent of the number of pupils in Ghana. But there, too, regional imbalances occurred,
as shown by data for 1967 when the north and west had primary enrollments of less than half
the national average (Salem, 1975). Education in the French colony of Mali mirrored that in Côte
d’Ivoire.11

Most postcolonial governments continued the development bias against the north, since the
south offered better prospects for growth, given its greater infrastructure, education, and
markets. Import-substituting industrialization was located in the south in each country. North-
south migration tended to reproduce ethnic inequalities within the southern regions, as
northerners, with less education, mostly secured only the lower paying jobs. The first
independence presidents in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, conscious of the need to support nation-
building, made efforts to offset this southern bias. Between 1965 and 1975, of the eight regions
in Côte d’Ivoire, the north received the third highest rate of public investment per head. In the
light of continued regional inequalities, President Félix Houphouët-Boigny initiated a
“Programme du Nord? and from 1971–1977, the region was the second highest recipient of
pubic investment per head (Bresson, 1980; Den Tuinder, 1978), while the Ministry of Planning
included a unit devoted to developing regional plans in the context of the 1971–1975
development plan. However, the worsening economic situation in the late 1970s halted these
efforts. In Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah tried to offset the bias with large state-financed investments
in agricultural production and processing in the north, but these were mostly unsuccessful and
ended after his displacement and the political turmoil that followed. In both countries, the 1980s
was a period of structural adjustment. The switch in policy away from import substitution to
exports did not improve regional balance, since the export crops and minerals were located in
the south.

Nigeria became conscious of the dangers arising from political inequalities following the Biafran
War, and made a major effort to counter these through the design of the Federation and the
Federal Character Principle, which aims to ensure a fair distribution of public appointments
among the five major groups; the relocation of the capital city was also intended to advance
national integration (Mustapha, 2007). On the economic side, import-substituting
industrialization was largely located in the south. Oil was discovered in the southwestern Delta
region, although the region itself did not gain that much from the discovery. But oil displaced
agricultural activities from the early 1970s and generally disadvantaged agriculture, worsening

In general, former French colonies had much less extensive educational systems than British ones at

the conditions of previous agricultural export producers, which were mainly located in the
southern part of the country. The revenue allocation formula that applied to federal revenue
(mainly derived from oil, which became the dominant source of revenue) was intended to
contribute to regional balance. The formula has been modified over time; it currently gives each
state the same proportion of total federal revenue (40 percent) and distributes the remainder
according to the size of the population (30 percent), the inverse of the level of social
development (10 percent), and revenue generation (10 percent) (Lukpata, 2013). In principle,
this would seem redistributionary. But in practice, the relatively prosperous eastern states get
most, and the poorest northern states get the least, although the differences are not as great as
the income differences, so from the latter perspective it constitutes a progressive distribution.
However, a formula that simply gave every person the same would clearly be much more
progressive.

In Mali, postcolonial development has focused primarily on activities in the south and west,
including cotton, gold, and rice. While growth has led to a reduction in poverty at the national
level, “poverty in the northern regions has remained largely unchanged over the decades?
(European Parliament, 2014, p. 35). Conflict has been mainly confined to the north and has
generally involved destruction of infrastructure and the disruption of services and
development.12

While the analysis above was predominantly presented in regional terms, there is a
corresponding ethnic and religious dimension due to the strong overlap of region, ethnicity, and
religion, as shown in the previous section.

  According to UNICEF, conflict and crisis in Mali has disrupted the education of around 700,000 Malian
children, mainly in the north, with 115 schools in the north closed in 2012 –2013.

In all countries, one factor has tended to reduce inequalities, while one has tended to
perpetuate them. The push to universalize some basic services, notably primary education and
health care—to the extent that it is achieved—reduces inequalities in the education and health
dimensions (although the extent to which inequalities are reduced must be qualified, because in
the early stages of achieving these goals regional differences often widen while quality may
continue to be uneven, even if quantity becomes more equal). Moreover, reductions in
educational inequalities are not necessarily to the benefit of regional output, as these enable
people to migrate to where economic opportunities are greatest. To reduce regional HIs, it is
necessary to reduce inequalities in economic as well as social dimensions. The factor tending to
perpetuate inequalities is the well-established tendency for HIs—or categorical inequalities, to
use Tilly’s term (1998)—to be durable. This arises for several reasons: first, because parental
circumstances (in education and income) influence children’s opportunities; second, social and
cultural capital tend to be lower for deprived groups; and third, there is interaction between
returns to one type of capital and access to other types, so that, for example, returns to
schooling are lower for children who have limited access to jobs because of deficiencies in social
capital or because of discrimination (Figueroa, 2006; Stewart and Langer, 2008; Figueroa, 2010).
This implies that to reduce HIs it may be necessary not just to “level the playing field? but to give
more than proportionate resources and opportunities to deprived groups. Moreover, action on
just one front—for example, education—will not be sufficient if economic opportunities are not
expanded simultaneously.13

Political inequalities also underlie socioeconomic ones, since politicians tend to favor their own
group. In many West African countries, political HIs were instituted initially by colonial
governments, which generally favored southern groups in education (as noted above) and in the
bureaucracy, although northern groups were often called on to comprise the military. Upon
independence, the countries followed different paths in this respect. In both Ghana and Côte
d’Ivoire, the first presidents made a conscious effort to have regionally and ethnically inclusive
cabinets. In the case of Ghana, this policy has continued—for example, although the presidents
have mostly come from the south or east, by convention the vice president is usually a
northerner. Moreover, the current president, John Dramani Mahama, is actually a northerner, as
he took over following the death of John Atta Mills in 2012. In Côte d’Ivoire, Houphouët-Boigny
was inclusive, but after his death in 1993, Henri Konan Bédié and his successors excluded
northerners, and this became a major cause of the civil war (Langer, 2005). Since independence,
Nigeria has adopted conscious policies to distribute power to northerners as well as southerners,
structuring its federation and principles of public appointments to do so, and also having an
informal convention that the presidency should alternate between a southerner and a
northerner. However, members of minority groups have been excluded in this process. In
contrast, Mali has been exclusionary in its politics, especially toward the Tuaregs. Federalism is
never considered and even decentralization has been largely token, with very limited transfer of
power or resources.



13
   Our analysis suggests that group inequalities in various types of capital, and in the returns to this capital,
initiate HIs, but this is often perpetuated by inequality of accumulation and by differential returns across
groups, because the returns to any one type of capital are kept low by deficiencies in quantity and quality
of other types of capital, as well as by past and current discrimination (Stewart and Langer, 2008).


                                                        39
This section of the paper has briefly considered factors underlying the continued severe HIs,
which included some postcolonial policies. The next section reviews contemporary policy,
focusing on whether the problem of HIs is acknowledged, whether the need to reduce them is
incorporated in policy, and what actual policies have been adopted to this end.

4. Recent policies toward HIs
It is not possible, given time and space, to conduct a detailed review of policies in all four
countries. Consequently, Table 13 summarizes actions, objectives, and policies of the four
governments, drawn from their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), and, in the case of
Nigeria, the 2004 National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy. Since the PRSPs
represent the governments’ considered position on economic objectives, especially toward
inequality and poverty, reached after extensive consultation, this seems to be a good way of
ascertaining the various governments’ attitudes toward HIs.

The following conclusions can be drawn from this exercise:

     In terms of recognition in each country, the regional dimension is acknowledged in one
      way or another, but is not given much priority—targets and most data are national.
      However, none of the governments consider ethnic or religious inequalities explicitly,
      although there is reference to “underprivileged communities? in the case of Côte d’Ivoire,
      “poor communities? and “marginalization? in Ghana’s case, and “marginalization? and
      “social inequalities? in Mali, all of which can be taken as proxies for ethnic inequalities.
      While equitable and effective regional policies would do much to correct ethnic and
      religious inequalities, they may not be sufficient, as migrants in the south tend to be
      significantly poorer than locals, while southerners located in the north often secure many
      of the benefits of commercial opportunities there.
     In terms of explicit objectives, national objectives appear to be given priority, and
      economic growth in particular. In Ghana, however, the need to correct regional
      imbalances has been a recurrent theme: “Bridging the gap between northern and
      southern parts of the country has been a long-term goal of most post-independence
      governments of Ghana;? (Rep. of Ghana, 2010, p. 95). Nigeria included the objective of
      providing “equality of status and opportunity? (Gov. of Nigeria, 2004, p. 4) in its 2004 plan,
      and its formula for the distribution of federal revenue has redistributionary intention.
      Regional development goals were included by Côte d’Ivoire and Mali in their postconflict
      policy papers; the aim of combating all forms of exclusion and building infrastructural
      capacities of under-privileged communities was included by Côte d’Ivoire; while Mali put
      big emphasis on rehabilitating and reconstructing the north.

  The PSPSDN was a donor funded program that aimed to develop eleven “pôles sécurisé de développement et de gourvernance? in northern Mali, to be protected by
security forces. It followed agreements to enhance the development of the north included in previous peace agreements (1991, 1992) and a special investment fund
established in 2006, but “neither the funds nor effective security forces materialised? (see Wing, 2013b, p. 6). The PSPDN was established without consultation and
emphasized security and not development (Wing, 2013b).

     Few actual policies to reduce (regional) horizontal inequalities were mentioned, with the
      exception of Ghana. In each case, however, the goal of extending basic services to the
      whole population should eventually reduce disparities in these dimensions.
      Decentralization is included in most documents, but not how it might be designed to
      combat inequalities (as against accentuating them, which it may well do). Despite the
      intention to reduce inequalities in postconflict Côte d’Ivoire, no specific policies were
      noted. However, Mali mentioned projects in the north in the Recovery Plan (2012 –2013)
      and a Special Program for Peace Development and Security, which included reconstruction
      of northern facilities and the improvement of health and educational services in the 2012–
      2017 PRSP. But evaluation of this program shows it has emphasized security rather than
      development (Wing, 2013a). Ghana has the most advanced set of regional policies with
      Special Development Zones (including the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority),
      which include tax incentives and infrastructure to assist in regional development, but
      assessments suggest that implementation lagged behind intentions (Abdulai and Hulme,
      2014). No specific policies were mentioned in Nigeria’s 2004 “Meeting Everyone’s Needs.?
     Over the last twenty years, progress appears to have been made in terms of recognition.
      Policy papers produced around 2000 were mainly growth-focused, but more recent papers
      have tended to include regional balance in one way or another.
     Conflict itself tended to worsen regional inequality, but the need to focus on the conflict-
      affected areas (the north) is clearly acknowledged in postconflict Côte d’Ivoire and Mali.
      Nigeria has reacted to conflict with politically inclusionary measures, but has done little on
      the economic side.
     The PRSPs mostly report on progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals
      (MDGs). The fact that the MDGs are all defined as national objectives may act as a
      disincentive to adopt regional targets or to report on regional achievements. Sometimes
      indeed, national MDG targets can more easily be achieved by enhancing regional
      differentials. Ghana is an example in which regional poverty disparities widened at one
      point, while there was good progress on the MDG national poverty target. This is highly
      relevant to the development of post-2015 targets.

5. From horizontal inequalities to violent conflict: Insights from
our four case studies
The idea that horizontal inequalities raise the risk of conflict stems from the view that if there
are sharp inequalities between different groups in society, the relatively disadvantaged groups
are likely to feel aggrieved about their inferior position and may mobilize against the
advantaged, while advantaged groups may act violently to preempt possible opposition or even
rebellion. Group identity provides a powerful mechanism of mobilization. The idea that the
presence of large horizontal inequalities raise the risk of conflict can be seen as a development
of Ted Gurr’s relative deprivation theory, first developed in the well-known book Why Men Rebel
(Gurr, 1970), and originally related to individuals’ motivations for joining a rebellion. But he later
extended the logic of relative deprivation to the political mobilization of minority groups (Gurr,
1993). He argued that discontent stimulated by deprivation relative to contemporaries and by
unfulfilled expectations, combined with a sense of group cultural identity, may lead to political
mobilization, violent and otherwise, of minority groups against the dominant group(s) in society


                                                  47
(Langer and Stewart, 2014). However, in contrast to the horizontal inequalities hypothesis, he
did not “explicitly focus on interpersonal or intergroup wealth comparisons? (Cederman et al.,
2011, p. 479), nor did he allow for advantaged groups instigating violence, which is a quite
frequent occurrence.

It is not claimed that horizontal inequalities automatically lead to conflict, but rather that they
raise the risk of conflict. Other factors need to be present for this risk to turn into actual conflict.
One element is the nature of horizontal inequalities themselves. Where different dimensions of
horizontal inequalities are consistent (that is, particular ethnic groups are both politically
excluded and economically disadvantaged) countries are more at risk of experiencing violent
conflict (see, in particular, Østby, 2008; Cederman et al., 2011). The risk of violent conflict
increases in these situations because both the political “elites? and “masses? of the relatively
deprived groups have a strong incentive to mobilize along ethnic lines in order to improve their
position (Langer, 2005). Moreover, violent group mobilization may be more “feasible? in certain
political, economic, regional, and geographical contexts and settings, as argued by the feasibility
or opportunity hypotheses, which suggest that rebellions occur where they are feasible or there
is a good opportunity rather than because of insurgents’ motivations (see for example Tilly,
1978; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; Fearon and Laitin, 2003).

In the light of these general considerations, below we briefly explore the impact of the prevailing
horizontal inequalities in our four case studies on these countries’ political situation and
histories.

5.1 Understanding Côte d’Ivoire’s descent into violence

Following its independence in August 1960, Côte d’Ivoire enjoyed two-and-a-half decades of
relative peace and stability under the leadership of President Felix Houphouët-Boigny. While
Côte d’Ivoire’s strong economic performance in the first two decades contributed heavily to the
country’s relatively stable political environment, Houphouët-Boigny’s approach to politics—the
so-called “Le modèle Houphouétiste?—also played an important role. His approach was
characterized by a culture of dialogue, compromise, rewards, punishment, forgiveness, and
reintegration (see Akindès, 2007), and the effective use of economic incentives to co-opt actual
and prospective political challengers into his patronage system (see Zartman and Delgado, 1984).
The robustness of the economy in the first two decades provided sufficient resources for
Houphouët-Boigny’s patronage system to defuse most sources of discontent (Gyimah-Boadi and
Daddieh, 1999). Another factor that contributed to maintaining political stability under
Houphouët-Boigny was his (informal) “system of ethnic quotas,? which was aimed at establishing
a balance between different regions and ethnic groups within the main state institutions (Bakery,
1984, p. 35). Hence, political horizontal inequalities under Houphouët-Boigny were relatively
moderate. As discussed above, he also undertook efforts to reduce the prevailing inequalities.

The sharp decline in the commodity prices of coffee and cocoa at the end of the 1970s clearly
exposed Côte d’Ivoire’s vulnerability to the international commodity markets. The negative
economic environment in the 1980s not only substantially reduced the standard of living in the
country, but also had important political consequences. Due to the sharp decline in government
revenues, the Houphouët-Boigny regime was no longer able to provide cozy state jobs to large

numbers of university students, which in turn led to serious student protests. The economic
problems also exacerbated tensions between locals and foreign migrants, as well as between
internal migrants from the north and locals in the southern regions. As most internal and
international migrants belonged to the northern ethnic groups and were Muslim, the communal
tensions were increasingly perceived as a conflict between north and south (Dembélé, 2003). As
Dembélé (2003) argues, “the communal conflict between north and south was mainly related to
land issues and the presence of too many migrants from the center and north in the rural
economy in the south-western regions and the urban economy in the south? (p. 36).

The divisions in the economic sphere were transmitted to the political sphere with the arrival of
Alassane Ouattara (that is, a politician from the northern regions who would become the leader
of the main northern party, RDR) and the introduction of competitive elections at the beginning
of the 1990s. The first competitive presidential elections took place in October 1990.
Houphouët-Boigny won the elections with a considerable margin against the main opposition
party candidate, Laurent Gbagbo. The most significant aspect regarding these elections,
however, was the introduction of ethnonationalism and xenophobia into the political arena.
When Houphouët-Boigny subsequently died in December 1993, this unleashed a power struggle
between the new political leaders, which contributed substantially to the disintegration of the
Ivorian state a decade later.

A growing northern consciousness was another important change that contributed to the
escalation of ethnic tensions at the beginning of the 1990s. The distribution of an anonymous
document called “Le Charte du Grand Nord? (Charter of the North) in 1992 illustrated the
changed attitudes of the northerners regarding the sociopolitical system in general and the
Baoulé group in particular. The Charter “called for fuller recognition of the Muslim religion …,
more efforts to reduce regional inequalities, greater political recognition of the north’s political
loyalty during the upheavals of the 1980s and … an end to Baoulé nepotism in recruitment to
public jobs? (quoted in Crook, 1997, p. 226).

In sharp contrast to Houphouët-Boigny, his successor Henri Konan Bédié largely stopped the
efforts to balance different ethnoregional interests in the Ivorian state and instead started
favoring people from his own ethnic group, the Baoulé (Dozon, 2000). In addition to the
Baoulization of the political-administrative sector, Bédié also began to change the ethnic
composition of the military forces in favor of his own ethnic group (Contamin and Losch, 2000).
The ethnic tensions that stemmed from favoritism toward the Baoulé were compounded by
general discontent in the armed forces due to a gradual decline in their status during the 1990s,
mainly arising from reduced expenditures due to the precarious financial situation (Kieffer,
2000). The grievances within the armed forces triggered a coup d‘état in December 1999.
Importantly, at the time of the coup d‘état in December 1999, both the Baoulé
overrepresentation and the underrepresentation of the northerners in government were the
most severe in Côte d’Ivoire’s postcolonial history up to that point (Langer, 2005).

The military regime that was in charge after the coup d’état of December 1999 eventually
organized new presidential elections in October 2000. These were marked by chaos and
violence, and by the exclusion of the main northern presidential candidate, Alassane Ouattara.
While the results were heavily disputed, ultimately Laurent Gbagbo became the new president.



                                                 49
In line with his anti-Ouattara, anti-RDR, and therefore de facto anti-northern rhetoric, Gbagbo
allocated most government positions in his government to his own party, the FPI. Northerners
were largely excluded from his government. Moreover, the northern underrepresentation in
Gbagbo’s government of January 2001 was considerably worse than in any government under
Bédié (Langer, 2005). This obviously aggravated feelings of political exclusion among the RDR
supporters. In September 2002, a group of northern insurgents attempted to overthrow the
Gbagbo regime, thereby sending Côte d’Ivoire into a violent conflict that would only be resolved
when Alassane Ouattara came to power in 2012. The main grievances put forward by the
insurgents related to the land ownership laws, the criteria of eligibility for presidential elections,
the question of identity cards, and the political domination of the northerners by southerners
(Dembélé, 2003).

5.2 Nigeria’s political turmoil and violent conflict

Over the half century of its independence, Nigeria has experienced several different types of
violence. The first, and most severe, was the Biafran secessionist rebellion from 1967–1970, led
by the Igbo ethnic group, who dominated the southeastern region. This group experienced
several different types of horizontal inequality. The Igbo were the most educated group and,
along with other southerners, notably the Yoruba, had been dominant in the bureaucracy.
Northerners, however, dominated the military. The area was a relatively rich one, both in terms
of agriculture and the location of some of the oil fields. However, the immediate cause of the
war was political. An initial coup in January 1966 led by several majors involved the murder of
some prominent northern political leaders and was believed to be an Igbo conspiracy, especially
since General Ironsi (an Igbo) became president and failed to put the conspirators on trial. A
northern counter-coup and the massacre of large numbers of Igbos living in the north provoked
a declaration of Biafran independence by Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, and a bitter civil war
ensued as the federal government (which had much greater military resources) sought to
suppress the rebellion (Ekwe-Ekwe, 1990; Korieh, 2012). More than a million civilians are
believed to have died from a combination of famine and violence. As Mustapha (1986)
concludes: “High levels of ethnoregional confrontation and conflict over [the] skewed
distribution of bureaucratic and political offices up to 1966 contributed in no small measure to
the eventual collapse of the First Republic in 1966 and the Civil War in 1967? (p. 7). In this case,
the horizontal inequalities worked in several ways. The Igbos resented and feared their political
exclusion, while at the same time they aimed for complete control over the economic wealth,
which would come with successful secession. Yet the rest of the country, especially the
northerners, resented the more privileged position of the better educated Igbos in the civil
service and educational establishments, and of course, the loss of wealth that secession would
have involved.

Following the tragic events of this war, Nigerians were determined to avoid any recurrence, and
redesigned the constitution to make power more diffuse (by increasing the number of states),
adopted the Federal Character principle for all major appointments, and introduced a formula
for spreading the oil revenue around the country. The new constitution prevented major political
horizontal inequalities, and the formula for revenue distribution moderated economic ones
somewhat (Mustapha, 2007). They also created a new capital, Abuja, located in the precise
center of the country, to replace the Lagos, on the south coast. There was also a conscious effort


                                                  50
to give the major ethnic groups equal cultural recognition. Perhaps because of these actions,
there has been no further major national conflict, though there have been other conflicts.

One recurring conflict is a communal one—that does not involve the government—in the Middle
Belt between settlers (from the north, many of whom had settled in the area for generations)
and indigenous groups, which is also a conflict between Muslims and Christians and between
particular ethnic groups. There is indeed considerable controversy as to which is the dominant
mobilizing identity. While the clearest cleavage is between the settlers and the indigenous
groups, the mosques and churches actively assist each side (Ehrhardt, 2012; Higazi, 2009). In this
case, there are three types of horizontal inequality. First, there is inequality in land ownership;
the settlers occupy the better land, and for this reason they are much resented by the
indigenous people. Second, political inequalities go the opposite way—the settlers are basically
excluded from local political power. Finally, in cultural terms, the settlers are treated poorly.
Hence both sides feel aggrieved, and a single incident can set off serious riots involving killings
and property destruction (Diprose, 2011). It is worth noting that this (and the Biafran case)
involve inconsistent HIs (that is, those that go in different directions), and show that this
situation, too, can be unstable.

Another serious source of violence is that in the Niger Delta region, in which the Ogoni and the
Ijaw rebelled against the multinational oil corporation as well as the federal government. The
Niger Delta region is the center of oil production and is relatively well off. But poverty is
nonetheless high, and the people feel they do not receive their entitlements in relation to the oil
wealth. While development projects have been initiated in the region, much is appropriated by
richer people and little trickles down to others. The fighters wanted more autonomy and a
greater share of the oil revenues. The rebellion escalated after the execution of the author Ken
Sara-Wiwo, despite major international protests. After a fierce military crackdown in 2008,
fighters were offered an amnesty, and the situation has quieted down. This is unlikely to lead to
sustainable peace in the medium term, however, unless regional development occurs. The
situation is what Tadjoeddin (2003) describes as one of “aspirations to inequality? and is similar
to that which is experienced in oil-producing regions in Indonesia; that is to say, people who live
in an area that is the source of immense riches, yet personally receive very little of it (Obi and
Rustad, 2011).

The latest form of violence in Nigeria is that perpetrated by Boko Haram, a group of young
fundamental Islamists in the north who appear to be inspired by similar groups in neighboring
countries (including Mali), and who aim to establish an autonomous Islamic Republic in the north
that follows strict Sharia law. There are cultural, economic, and political elements underlying this
movement, which carries out violent and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Poverty, lack of
education, and scarce economic opportunities make it easy to recruit adherents. While there is
not a direct or explicit connection between economic HIs and this movement, the region’s
underdevelopment and the economic exclusion of these young men makes this fertile territory
for such a movement to emerge.

5.3 Explaining Ghana’s national stability and ethnic conflicts in the north

Ghana has had a turbulent postcolonial political history, with long periods of political instability,
repeated nonconstitutional regime changes, and occasional ethnic tensions. Yet since the
introduction of the Fourth Republic a functioning multi-party democracy has emerged. While
ethnic conflicts have occurred at the local level (in particular in the northern regions), at the
national level ethnic tensions and conflicts have never boiled over into serious violence.
Interestingly, like Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana is confronted with major ethnic, social, and economic
cleavages between its northern and southern regions. But “there has been no development of
‘Northernness’ as a basis for political cohesion, and no north versus south patterning of political
alignments? has occurred (Brown, 1982, p. 42). Before briefly analyzing the conflict in the
northern region, we will reflect on the main strategies and measures that successive Ghanaian
regimes have undertaken to keep ethnoregional tensions and mobilization in check.

Kwame Nkrumah, the first national Ghanaian leader, was confronted with serious ethnoregional
tensions and mobilization in the immediate pre-independence period. Nkrumah’s strategies to
deal with these tensions and promote national integration have to some extent become
institutionalized, both formally and informally (Langer, 2009). An important aspect of Nkrumah’s
strategy to contain ethnoregional mobilization was the adoption of the Avoidance of
Discrimination Act in December 1957. Under this law, it became illegal to form political parties
along ethnic, regional, or religious lines. While the Avoidance of Discrimination Act was strongly
opposed by the opposition at the time, since then successive Ghanaian political elites have
recognized the centrifugal potential of ethnic, religious, and/or regional political parties.
Consequently, the 1969, 1979, and 1992 constitutions and the 2000 Political Parties Act all
contain provisions aimed at curbing ethnic electoral politics and ensuring that political parties
are national in character (Gyimah-Boadi and Asante, 2006). The Ghanaian body politic also
agreed in more informal ways to avoid using ethnicity as a means of gaining electoral support.
However, despite the formal and informal agreements and rules, as well as the existence of
strong norms against the use of ethnicity as a means of political action, both government and
opposition parties/politicians have occasionally played the ethnic card. Furthermore,
ethnoregional voting patterns (especially in the Ashanti and Volta regions) as well as survey
research suggest that ethnicity remains (or at least is perceived to be) an important factor in the
public/political sphere (Langer and Ukiwo, 2008).

Nkrumah also promoted a Ghanaian identity and culture, which he projected as an amalgam of
different ethnic cultures within Ghana (Hagan, 1992). Like Nkrumah, most of his successors
continued to promote the Ghanaian state’s cultural inclusiveness by undertaking a range of
measures in the legal/institutional, policy-oriented, and symbolic spheres. Thus, for instance,
most heads of state continued Nkrumah’s practice of alternating dress on public occasions.
Other examples of culturally inclusive practices and measures are the persistent refusal by
consecutive Ghanaian governments to promote a particular local language (in particular,
Twi/Akan) as the country’s national language; the active state support for the study and teaching
of the country’s major local languages; the incorporation by institutions such as the Ghana Dance
Ensemble of songs and dances from all major ethnic groups (Lentz and Nugent, 2000); the
conscious effort to ensure that radio and television programs are broadcast in all major
languages (Lentz and Nugent, 2000); and the custom that representatives from the government


                                                  52
attend the most important ethnic and/or traditional festivals and durbars throughout the
country on a regular basis. As discussed above, Nkrumah and his successors also attempted to
reduce the prevailing socioeconomic inequalities, in particular between the north and the south.
Notwithstanding these efforts, Ghana’s north-south divide remains severe, as shown above. Yet,
despite the limited success of the strategies of economic redistribution in closing the north-south
gap over the decades, the impact on reducing the political salience of the north-south divide
seems to have been much more substantial.

In addition to attempting to reduce the north-south inequalities and preserve the cultural and
religious “neutrality? of the state, an arguably even more important strategy was aimed at
maintaining certain ethnoregional balances in the political sphere. This has remained a largely
informal “policy? or convention among the country’s political elites. Thus, for example, although
the presidents have mostly come from the south or the east, by convention the vice president
has usually been a northerner since Ghana’s Fourth Republic emerged in 1993.

Northerners were generally included in government throughout the postindependence period.
While northerners were somewhat underrepresented in proportion to their relative
demographic size in the 1954–1979 period, they actually became slightly overrepresented when
Jerry Rawlings assumed power in 1981 (Langer, 2008). Under John Kufuor (2001–2009), they
again became somewhat underrepresented. However, Kufuor compensated the northern
underrepresentation among government ministers by appointing a more than proportionate
number of deputy ministers from the northern ethnic groups (Langer, 2008). In February 2005,
for instance, about 17 percent of all government ministers (including the deputy ministers) had a
northern background, which corresponded to a relative representation of about 0.75. The fact
that the position of vice president, the second most important position in Ghana’s 1992
constitution, was occupied by a northerner—Alhaji Aliu Mahama—further contributed to
reducing the political salience ministers of the northern underrepresentation among government
ministers. Since July 2012, following the death of President John Atta Mills, Ghana has another
president from the north, John Dramani Mahama.

Despite Ghana’s success at managing ethnic relations and horizontal inequalities at the national
level, there have serious ethnic tensions and violent conflicts in the country’s northern region
over issues of land ownership and different groups’ rights to assume certain chieftaincies. Major
episodes of interethnic violence occurred throughout the last century, but ethnic violence
became particularly intense and regular in the 1980–1996 period (Jönsson, 2009; Kaye and
Béland, 2009; Pul, 2003). The main ethnic conflicts have been between the Konkombas and the
Nanumbas (1980, 1994, and 1995) and between the Konkombas and the Dagombas (1994). The
worst violence took place in 1994–1995—an episode commonly referred to as the Guinea Fowl
War—and resulted in thousands of casualties, 200,000 internally displaced persons, and 441
destroyed villages (Assefa, 2001; Bogner, 2000; Kaye and Béland, 2009). Despite the large-scale
destruction and extensive violence in the northern regions in 1994–1995, the conflict was only
significant at the regional level and did not have any far-reaching consequences nationally
(Agyeman, 1998). Indeed, somewhat paradoxically, the ethnic violence in the north is an
additional reason why a collective northern identity and a consciousness of northern interests
did not develop and lead to northern mobilization.




                                                 53
While the “seemingly superficial appellations? (Pul, 2003, p. 42) (including, for example, the
Guinea Fowl War) may suggest otherwise, the issues at stake did not revolve around simple
everyday resources (Jönsson, 2009). Indeed, as Pul (2003) notes, “the fight was about citizenship
rights of whole ethnic groups (indigeneity and ethnic identity), recognition of the right of self-rule
and the creation of political space to allow participation of all ethnic groups in the traditional
institutions of governance (chieftancy), and the redefinition of the ownership of, and control
over the major productive resource for 95 percent of the population of the area (land)? (p. 42;
original emphasis). In particular, the Konkombas were especially aggrieved about the fact that
“they were compelled … to put in some days of free labour each year on the farms of Nanumba
chiefs; that the chiefs intermittently collected tribute in the form of foodstuff and livestock from
their Konkomba tenants … that it was compulsory to donate the hind leg of any big animal killed,
whether wild of domesticated, to Nanum chiefs during funerals … Perhaps the most problematic
aspect of the settler/host relationship was the fact that the Konkombas were not allowed to
settle disputes among themselves, including matrimonial and other interpersonal conflicts?
(Tsikata and Seini, 2004, p. 30). Brukum (1995) has strikingly described the violent uprisings of
the Konkombas against the Nanumbas and Dagombas as “wars of emancipation? (quoted in
Tsikata and Seini, 2004, p. 24).

The origins of the interethnic tensions and conflicts in the northern regions can be traced back to
the migration patterns of the 16th and 17th centuries, when several “centralized? or “cephalous?
ethnic groups, in particular the Dagombas, the Nanumbas, the Gonjas, and the Mamprusis
migrated to what is today Ghana’s northern region (Kaye and Béland, 2009). In contrast to the
cephalous “invader tribes? (Stride and Ifeka, 1971, p. 81), the northern region was already
inhabited by “noncentralized? or “acephalous? groups such as the Konkombas, Dagaras, and
Talensis. In contrast to the cephalous ethnic groups with their paramount chiefs, the acephalous
groups do not have a “recognizable apical head as the locus of political power for the entire
ethnic group? (Pul, 2003, p. 43). Drawing on Brubaker (2002), Jönsson (2009) notes that
“acephalous peoples are referred to as ‘minority’ ethnic groups and chiefly groups as ‘majority’
in Ghana today, although these terms are not used in their literal, demographic sense? (p. 509).
Indeed, the Konkomba “minority? group is numerically larger than three of the four chiefly or
“majority? groups (that is, the Nanumbas, Gonjas, and Mamprusis) (Jönsson, 2009, p. 509).

The oppressive relations between the minority/noncentralized groups and majority/centralized
groups developed during the time that the Asante ruled the north in the 18th and 19th centuries
(Kaye and Béland, 2009). During this time, the Dagombas used the noncentralized communities
as a “pool of manpower, which they raided in order to provide slaves for the Asante? (Kaye and
Béland, 2009, p. 182). Under British colonial rule, starting from 1874, the Konkombas were
formally placed under the administrative control of the Dagombas (Ladouceur, 1979) and hence
the British colonial administration “transformed the chieftancy institution by creating and
artificially bolstering chiefly authority? (Kaye and Béland, 2009, p. 183).

In the postindependence period, the power of chiefs has waxed and waned to a remarkable
extent with different regimes. While Nkrumah’s government was openly hostile to the chiefs (a
stance that was tacitly welcomed by acephalous groups in the north) and implemented several
laws in the 1960s that basically placed the stools under the control the state, in contrast, the
Busia regime essentially restored the power of the chiefs by promulgating the Chieftancy Act of


                                                  54
1971 (Pul, 2003). With the emergence of Flt. Lt. Rawlings in June 1979 and later during his
military rule in the 1980s, the power of the chiefs was once again seriously eroded and the right
to recognize or withdraw recognition from a chief was again vested in the Ghanaian state (Pul,
2003). Interestingly, however, despite Rawlings’ aversion to the chieftancy institution, the 1992
constitution (in particular Article 274) restored the power of the chiefs and “in effect restored
and legitimized the subjugation of the acephalous groups to the cephalous ones? (Pul, 2003, p.
49).

There is circumstantial evidence that the subjugation of the “minority? groups by the “majority?
groups in the northern regions (a clear political HI) has contributed to creating horizontal
inequalities in education and occupation (Jönsson, 2009). Moreover, as Julia Jönsson (2009)
further notes, “perceptions of horizontal inequalities in the fields of education, government
influence, resources and appointments, access to justice and cultural status are widespread and
contributed to mobilization through the spread of antagonistic narratives? (p. 512).

5.4 Mali’s Tuareg rebellion

Since its independence from France in 1960, Mali has experienced periodic rebellions in the
north by Tuaregs and Arabs, mainly driven by the Tuaregs located in the northeast. In pre-
colonial times, the Tuaregs held sway over a large area of the Sahara and countries to the south
(Cold-Ravnkilde, 2013). Indeed, when Mali became independent, the Tuaregs were shocked that
they were included as part of this country and not given their own state; as they put it, “they felt
‘colonized’ for the first time, when southerners took over the state and formed the bureaucracy
which ruled them. Our inclusion in the country was a mistake,? according to Nina Wallett, leader
of the Tuareg rebellion (quoted in Morgan, 2012).

In recent times, Mali has for years been viewed as a successful democracy. Democratic
structures were established in 1991–1992 as a result of popular protests, following the long
dictatorship of Moussa Traoré. However, northern rebellions continued, culminating in the 2012
events in which Islamists gained effective control of the north. The failure of the national army to
suppress the rebellion is regarded as the major cause of an army coup in March 2012, in which
the elected president, Amadou Toumani Touré, was overthrown. A French military intervention
soon followed that defeated the Islamists and recovered control of the north for the central
government.

The overriding objective of most of the recurrent rebellions is secession from Mali and
independence, as is clear from the name of the main movement—Mouvement National pour la
Liberation de l’Azawad (MLNA)—although in some peace negotiations the demand is for greater
autonomy rather than complete independence. For example, in the 2006 Algiers Accords, the
Tuareg demands included “greater autonomy for the Kidal region, greater recognition of the
Tamasheq language and culture in the national media and in education, the formation of special
security units staffed by local Tuaregs, economic development in the region, a functional airport
for Kidal and a special tax regime for the north to encourage investment? (Morgan, 2012).
However, northerners are not unanimous in these demands. Several types of division have
emerged. On the one hand, some of the black groups (the Songhai in particular) have supported
the Mali government against the paler Arabs and Tuaregs, and there have been racial attacks by



                                                 55
Songhai militia on the Tuaregs, Arabs, and Peul. The division between the Songhai and others is
not only racial, but also a matter of occupation; the Tuaregs and Arabs are predominantly
pastoralists, while the Songhai are agriculturalists. There are also clan and class distinctions
among the Tuaregs themselves. Furthermore, in recent years, a Salafi Islamic movement has
developed, including Ansar Dine, which has links to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and
the Mouvement Islamique d l’Azawad (MIA). These groups aim to achieve an Islamic state that
embodies Sharia law. In contrast, the Tuaregs are not traditionally fundamentalist and do not
follow strict Sharia law.15 However, there is not a clear-cut division between the Tuaregs and the
Islamists, who have fought together, and leaders and followers have shifted from one group to
the other. While the earlier Tuareg rebellions were put down fairly easily, as noted, the 2012
rebellion, initially led by the MNLA but then taken over by the Islamist movements and
reinforced by fighters (and arms) from Libya following the fall of Gaddafi, secured effective
control of the north and was only displaced as a result of the French intervention.

The underlying causes of these rebellions are complex; as one observer noted, “few claim to
understand its causes fully? (Cold-Ravnkilde, 2013, p. 11). Among the causes is the almost
complete absence of a state presence in the north. Representatives of the state in the north are
often corrupt and involved in illegal activities (Cold-Ravnkilde, 2013). Moreover, lawlessness in
the north has permitted an escalation of drug trafficking and other illegal endeavors. These in
turn feed the conflicts by providing resources for militias and fueling corruption of state
institutions, and thereby enhancing disaffection. It is also clear that perceived HIs have
constituted a long-standing set of grievances. We noted earlier the very limited educational and
health facilities in the north. Kidal has the fewest schools, and 73 percent of communes in Kidal
have no secondary schools, while only 24 percent of the people in Kidal have a health facility
within 5 km of their home (World Bank, 2013). Food aid in response to drought in the 1970s and
1980s was largely diverted to the southern elites (Benjaminsen, 2000). Poverty and
unemployment rates are also very high. Other causes of resentment include violations of Tuareg
land rights (World Bank, 2013), destruction of Tuareg and Arab property during the conflicts, and
a general lack of political control or influence. Pastoral groups “have been pushed out of the
sphere of political influence, among other things because of their aversion to the French school
system? (Cold-Ravnkilde, 2013, p. 29). Army atrocities against these groups aroused further
hostility toward the central government. The Tuaregs and Arabs differ from the southerners in
race, language, culture, and occupation. In each attempt to negotiate peace, they have
demanded cultural recognition and substantially more political autonomy as well as economic
development. Successive peace agreements have promised much in the way of greater
autonomy (via decentralization) and greater development. Yet there has been very little progress
in either dimension.

In principle, Mali was among the first African countries to undertake comprehensive
decentralization reforms, but in practice these have meant little (Lavigne Delville, 1999). As Cold-
Ravnkilde (2013) notes, “Decentralization did not fail because this dialogue [concerning greater
autonomy for the north] was fruitless, but because it was never completed or effectively
implemented? (p. 30). The central government’s authoritarian structures remained in place

15
  As one Tuareg noted, “For us Tuaregs, it’s rather strange to see women treated in this way, because the
Tamachek woman is very free? (World Bank, 2013, p. 19).


                                                    56
alongside local authorities. Central government recognition of traditional leaders and
incorporation in formal structures led to their co-option by the government, and reduced their
ability to act as northern negotiators. The new authorities enriched local elites but bypassed the
population as a whole. Not enough funding was transferred to the local authorities for them to
exercise their duties in full. Budgeted transfers in 2010, for example, were just 2.3 percent of the
total government budget, and a French report noted that the local authorities had only access to
0.5 percent of the total budget (World Bank, 2013, p. 37). A 2008 Afrobarometer survey found
that the majority felt local authorities were performing their main functions badly or very badly
(Coulibaly, et al., 2008).

Similarly, development efforts have had minimal success. The Algiers accord of 2006 included a
special fund to develop the north, but it achieved very little. Its headquarters were in Bamako,
not the north. “Instead of spearheading the development of public infrastructure in the north, it
seems to have been deployed by the authorities in Bamako primarily as a vehicle for the
clientelist co-option of segments of the northern elites … and much of its funding appears never
to have reached the north? (Van de Walle, 2012, p. 15). Two programs were announced in 2010:
“An Emergency Program for the Reduction of Insecurity and the Struggle against Terrorism in
Northern Mali? and “A Special Program for Peace, Security and Development.? Both further
weakened local autonomy by reintroducing southern-dominated state security machinery into
the north. Few funds went to development, relative to those for security, and the programs were
centrally controlled without consulting the local population.

Most analyses of the Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali attribute it to “decades of discrimination
and exclusion from political and economic processes by successive Bamako-based governments?
(Francis, 2013, p. 4). Yet, as shown earlier, their relative deprivation is not much greater than
that of some groups in the south. It appears that the difference is that the Tuaregs regard
themselves (and are regarded as) different; they view themselves as having a historic right to
govern rather than be governed, and perceive themselves as being discriminated against in many
spheres, while the recurrent wars accentuate their state of underdevelopment and their hostility
toward southerners.

5.5 Some concluding considerations on the relationship between horizontal
inequalities and conflict

We can draw a number of conclusions regarding the contribution of horizontal inequalities to
political instability and violent conflict in our four case study countries.

First, a particularly dangerous political situation is created where horizontal inequalities overlap.
The cases of Mali and Côte d’Ivoire in particular show that the presence of severe political and
economic horizontal inequalities, together with cultural status inequalities, form an extremely
explosive sociopolitical situation, because the excluded political elites not only have strong
incentives to mobilize their supporters for violent conflict along ethnoregional lines, but are also
likely readily to gain support among their ethnic constituencies, who are likely to feel
economically disadvantaged and culturally disenfranchised. One of the reasons why the north-
south divide in both Ghana and Nigeria has not escalated into a national conflict in recent




                                                  57
decades is that the relatively disadvantaged groups in both countries’ northern regions were
politically reasonably well included for most of the postcolonial period.

Second, what matters are not only economic and political issues and inequalities, but also
cultural status inequalities. Both in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire, discontent about the treatment and
recognition given by the state to the cultural and religious traditions and customs of the Tuaregs
and Muslims (the dominant religion in northern Côte d’Ivoire) complemented respectively the
existing and political grievances among these groups. Illustratively, in Côte d’Ivoire, Le Charte du
Grand Nord explicitly called for a fuller recognition of the Muslim religion. Similarly, in Mali, the
Tuaregs called for a greater recognition of their culture and language in the public sphere.
Conversely, in Ghana, successive regimes have actively aimed to promote norms and practices of
cultural neutrality and inclusiveness—a policy initiated by Ghana’s first postcolonial president,
Kwame Nkrumah.

Third, efforts to reduce horizontal inequalities and balance interests of different groups can help
reduce the political salience of HIs, even if their objective impact is relatively small. Both
Houphouët-Boigny and successive Ghanaian regimes were able to diffuse the salience of the
north-south cleavage by including northern politicians and interests in the main political
institutions and by undertaking economic redistribution toward the deprived northern regions.
Importantly, even when the actual redistribution effect of the implemented measures appears to
have been rather limited, the symbolic impact of these inequality-reducing measures and
policies was undoubtedly much more substantial.

Fourth, a country’s ethnoregional demography and geography is an important explanatory factor
for the observed mobilization and types of conflicts we observe in our case study countries. In
Mali, the Tuareg are a relatively small group that is concentrated in the Kidal region, in the east
of the country. Given that they were never happy to be included in Mali to begin with, it is
unsurprising that their mobilization took the form of secessionist rebellion. In Côte d’Ivoire, on
the other hand, the northern ethnic groups constitute a substantial proportion of the population
(30–40 percent) and while they are the dominant groups in the north, a majority of them
actually live in the southern regions. Consequently, as might have been expected, the northern
insurgency did not take on a secessionist form, but was rather aimed at dislodging the regime in
charge in the south and take control of the existing state. In Ghana, the northern population
constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total population (approximately 20 percent). The
northern population is further composed of quite a few smaller ethnic groups, between whom
serious tensions and violent conflicts have occasionally occurred. Compared to Côte d’Ivoire and
Nigeria, it also appears that Islam is less of a unifying factor. Leaving aside other measures and
policies undertaken by the Ghanaian government, these demographic factors make a north-
south mobilization as seen in Côte d’Ivoire considerably less likely in Ghana.

Fifth, badly managed democratic transitions can enhance tensions and political instability.
Although democracy is often argued to be a conflict-reducing institution, an increasing amount
of research has shown that the process of democratization may in itself foster violent conflict
(see for example Snyder, 2000). Côte d’Ivoire is an unfortunate case in point. A direct result of
the introduction of competitive elections in 1990 was the emergence of ethnonationalism and
xenophobia in the political arena. Moreover, in an electoral environment characterized by new



                                                  58
players and “democratic? rules, the prevailing political and economic horizontal inequalities,
injustices, and grievances in Côte d’Ivoire became increasingly politicized. The case of Ghana,
however, shows that once the initial democratization phase is successfully mastered, a
flourishing democracy can be established in a poor developing country.

6. Conclusions and policy recommendations
The paper has identified significant HIs in in Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, and Côte d’Ivoire, as well as
discussed the way these countries have attempted to manage these inequalities. The analysis
shows that there have only been minor attempts to introduce policies to correct them, except in
the case of Ghana (and at times in Côte d’Ivoire). In Mali there have been periodic attempts to
develop the north, but these have generally been ineffective, and many of the benefits from
investments in security and construction in the north have gone to southerners.

While we have focused on four countries, similar dynamics are apparent in other West African
nations. These countries are also ethnically heterogeneous, though in several countries one
group is dominant (such as in Senegal, the Gambia, and Guinea). The other countries in West
Africa also show considerable regional and ethnic inequalities (see Figure 22). As in our other
cases, the objective HIs appear to be largely reflected in perceptions of unfair treatment (see
Figure 23). In several cases, a major division is not north-south but between the coastal region
and inland areas (the Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia), while in Sierra Leone and
Liberia there exists an important cultural division and inequality between the Krio (emancipated
slaves and their descendants), sometimes in alliance with local groups, and the indigenous
population. For these two countries, the Krio/other division appears to be an important factor
underlying the violence. In general, among the other West African countries, inequalities have
been accompanied by political HIs. In Togo, like Nigeria, however, the north-south economic
inequalities have been offset by political dominance of northerners; this, together with
government policies of suppression of resistance, has helped to avoid large-scale violence at the
national level. Elsewhere, groups that have been marginalized in economic and political terms
have mounted violent protests, such as in Senegal’s Casamance region.

The existence of such significant HIs in these West African countries represents a serious threat
to their political stability. The past (and ongoing) conflicts are a clear sign of this, and constitute a
warning for the future. Moreover, while governments are beginning to acknowledge regional
imbalances, only Ghana is making a serious attempt to correct them. Policies to reduce HIs need
to be on the agenda. In this section we suggest some possible policies that would contribute to
this end. In fragile environments, there is a tendency for governments and the international
community to emphasize enhancement of security, governance, and macroeconomic stability,
and to neglect inequalities (Langer et al., 2012). This approach, however, threatens long-term
stability. Moreover, a commitment to reducing HIs has a symbolic value that contributes to
peacebuilding, even before the policies take effect.

If HIs are to be taken seriously, the first requirement is that they be systematically monitored.
This will enable governments to identify which type of HI is most serious
(regional/ethnic/religious); whether policies toward one will in fact improve others (for example,
whether regional location of different groups means that regional policies can be used to correct
other group inequalities), and in which dimension; in which particular element of each
dimension major inequalities arise (for example, whether the most serious inequalities exist in
the political or cultural dimensions); and within a dimension, whether inequalities are most
severe in health, education, incomes, access to land, or economic infrastructure. The answer
may be—as suggested by much of our data—that inequalities exist in each dimension and in
many of the elements, so comprehensive corrective policies are needed.

We can differentiate between direct and indirect policies to reduce HIs. Direct policies target
particular groups for inclusion or exclusion in access to resources; for example, affirmative action
in education or appointments. Such policies are often adopted to reduce gender inequalities as
well as those of other identity groups. Direct policies tend to be effective, but may provoke
opposition from the unfavored groups and can be difficult (politically) to terminate, while they
tend to arouse increasing opposition if sustained over decades (such as in Malaysia and the U.S.).
However, in circumstances where visible inequalities are provoking (or have provoked) violent
protest, direct policies are helpful—policies of this kind have been effective in reducing
inequalities and associated tensions in the case of blacks in the U.S. and South Africa,
Bumiputeras in Malaysia, Catholics in Northern Ireland, and lower caste peoples in India. In each
case policies have helped avoid conflict and effectively reduced HIs without loss in economic
growth,16 though eventually they tend to generate political opposition. Sometimes such policies
increase intragroup inequalities, but this depends on the design of the policies (Badgett et al.,
1997; Brown et al., 2012). Direct policies are most appropriate where group boundaries are very
clear, and a particular group (or groups) has clearly been historically disadvantaged.

Direct policies can feature giving special privileges to particular groups (scholarships, or
preference in appointments, contracts, or credit), or restricting privileged groups’ access to
these. Although in practice they may amount to much the same thing, providing special
privileges is less provocative than restricting access. Direct policies are also sometimes applied to


16
  In Malaysia, the policies were accompanied by a growth rate of 6 percent per annum sustained over
decades. Assessments of American affirmative action programs have not established efficiency costs (see
Holzer and Neumark, 2000).


                                                    62
political representation, such as in Nigeria. There are a variety of ways this can be achieved,
sometimes via formal rules, sometimes informal.

Indirect policies are those that are universally applicable without respect to group identity, but
as a result of their design they can reduce HIs. Universal provision of services is an example of an
indirect policy, and this seems to be an approach taken by most West African countries.
Progressive taxation or social protection are also indirect policies that reduce HIs. Where
discrimination is a significant cause of inequality, effectively outlawing discrimination can make a
significant contribution to reducing HIs, as in Northern Ireland (McCrudden et al., 2004; Todd
and Ruane, 2012). Indirect policies may provoke less opposition (though measures such as
progressive taxation do clearly generate opposition), but they tend to work more slowly and,
because they are less visible, may have less effect on conflict prevention in the short-term. In
general, where HIs are serious and threaten conflict, a combination of direct and indirect
measures may be best, as was adopted for example in Northern Ireland and South Africa.

In addition to direct and indirect policies, integrationist policies are needed in many countries
that are home to multiple identities, to reduce conflict potential and to help form a national
identity. Although this is not our concern here, integrationist policies and the main types of
direct and indirect policies are indicated in Table 14.

Returning to the four cases covered in this paper, one direct policy that is clearly recommended
is preferential distribution of public resources to deprived regions—including economic and
social infrastructure, employment programs, and support for teachers and health workers (who
may need to be paid more to work in these difficult environments). Public contracts may also
give preference to the north (McCrudden, 2007). In addition, there is a case to create economic
incentives to make private investments in deprived regions, such as the special development
corridor adopted by Ghana. In each of our cases, it is the country’s north, broadly defined, that
warrants preferential treatment. There is also a case for extending scholarships to northerners to
attend secondary schools and universities. The Tuaregs in northern Mali stand out as warranting
special preferences for employment as well as education.

In relation to indirect policies, the long-term objective should be universal access to good quality
education, health services, economic infrastructure, electricity, and so on. If achieved, these
universal services would make a major contribution to reducing HIs. However, starting from a
situation which is far from this ideal, progress toward this objective may actually worsen HIs, as
the more privileged regions, which are often easier to reach and have more political clout, are
covered first. Consequently, the aim of universal provision needs to be accompanied by the aim
to reduce inequalities, and this will almost certainly require preferential access for some areas.
In both Ghana and Nigeria, there has been some attempt to steer universities to the north, for
example.

Decentralization of resources and government functions is, nominally at least, a central aspect of
most country plans. The implication, generally not overtly stated, is that this would help correct
regional inequalities in both political and dimensions if properly designed and executed. But
whether it contributes to reducing inequalities and making conflict less likely depends on
whether resources and functions are truly devolved, and whether power over them is
transferred to local actors or is retained by centrally controlled agents. In the three nonfederal


                                                 63
countries, it seems that only limited powers and resources have been transferred,17 and that in
some cases (such as Mali), local people do not acquire power, but rather power is exercised
largely by appointees from the center (Crawford, 2004; Crawford, 2005; Armstrong, 2013).18 A
2002 stocktaking exercise showed Ghana with an aggregate composite index of decentralization
of 2.55 (10 is the maximum); 2.5 for Nigeria; 2.2 for Côte d’Ivoire; and 1.7 for Mali (Ndegwa,
2002).19 Figure 24 illustrates measures of different dimensions of decentralization. Moreover,
decentralization can be disequalizing unless there is a strong redistributionary element in
resource transfers from the center, as richer localities can raise more from local tariffs. A federal
system tends to be more effective in redistributing power and positions, but as noted, the
formula for transferring federal revenue in reality favors richer states, while many argue that
Nigeria, in practice, is highly centralized (Solomon, 2005; Amundesen, 2012). In brief, neither
federalism nor decentralization is a panacea; both probably generally reduce political HIs, but
they can and often do increase them, and they may also widen economic HIs.

Because of the strong forces perpetuating group inequalities, the need for comprehensive
policies must be emphasized. These must take a broad approach that encompasses inequalities
in economic opportunities and in different types of capital, as well as in social services. Generally
speaking, governments in the region have taken some action toward extending services
throughout their countries, but have done very little (or been ineffective) in terms of economic
development.

Formulating appropriate policies depends on country context, including the political situation
and the constraints this imposes on policy choice. It is essential that a government be committed


17
   Ghana has probably gone furthest in democratic decentralization, but the Chief Executive Officer and 30
percent of Assembly members are appointed from the center. In addition, powers and finance transferred
are limited (at 6 percent of total government expenditure in 2005) (Crawford, 2004); and in practice
decentralization is weaker than the constitutional provisions (Crawford, 2005).
18
   The National Pact peace accord with Tuareg rebels in 1992 included decentralization as an important
element. “But lack of resources, and state appointed administrators meant little changed: ‘In reality power
stayed as it had before,’? according to Ibrahim ag Youssouf, a Tuareg professor (Armstrong, 2013, p. 2).
19
   Further decentralization measures have been adopted in most of the countries since then, so an
updated stock-taking exercise is needed.


                                                     64
to reducing HIs, such as was broadly the case in Ghana and at times in Côte d’Ivoire, but has
been noticeably absent in the other countries. The MDGs were formulated as universal targets,
and as such neglected inequalities. It is apparent from a review of these countries’ PRSPs that
achieving progress on the MDGs took priority. Post-2015 goals need to incorporate HIs and
vertical inequality to encourage governments to take them seriously when formulating
objectives, developing policies, and monitoring progress.

The international development agencies also have a responsibility here in measuring,
monitoring, analyzing, and making policy recommendations. Global reviews of policies show that
quite a few national governments in multiethnic societies have initiated policies in this area, but
these have rarely been a consideration of international agents. For example, the World
Development Indicators data set (and that of the HDRO, UNDP; World Bank, 2014b) provide
indicators of gender and rural/urban inequalities, but not of ethnic, religious, or regional ones;
these are likewise neglected in policy advice.

A.      Strategic relevance and technical soundness of the proposed Program

A.1     Strategic relevance

1.     Over the last 10 years, in Tanzania, progress has been made in reducing death rates in
younger age groups and improving coverage of selected high impact interventions. Especially,
Tanzania has made significant strides in improving immunization coverage and surpassing the
Millennium Development Goals for reducing child mortality. Between 1999 and 2010, infant
mortality fell from 99 per 1,000 live births to 51 per 1,000 live births respectively, while under-5
mortality declined from 147 to 81 per 1,000 live births (Tanzania Demographic Health Survey
(TDHS), 2010). A 2008 Lancet article on child survival gains in Tanzania1 attributed a large
proportion of these improvements to investments in health systems and scaling up specific
interventions through a decentralized approach. These include an increased proportion of
children under five years of age sleeping under bed nets (from 36.3 percent in 2007/8 to 72.6
percent in 2009/10), increased vaccination coverage, vitamin A supplementation, and improved
functioning of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) at the facility and
community levels.

2.      However, the progress in reduction of maternal mortality and neonatal mortality has been
slow. Maternal mortality ratio remains high at 423 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2012
(Census 2012) against a backdrop of low facility deliveries and family planning coverage while
neonatal mortality rates are 26 per 1,000 live births (TDHS, 2010). There is also a persistent high
level of stunting (42 percent among children under five years of age), affecting over 3 million
children. Overall, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the major
burden of mortality and illness for the population (Table 1).

3.     Without effectively improving health of the nation, Tanzania will not be able to
materialize the aspirations of Tanzanian Development Vision 2025 and reduce health-related
economic costs. Currently, US$431 million is being spent on treatment every year; and an
estimated GDP loss of US$272.6 million occurs annually due to the common diseases affecting
the working population alone. Such numbers are expected to rise.

4.     In this context, there is a consensus that health is important to economic development and
poverty reduction in Tanzania. It has been identified as a priority in (i) the Government’s
Tanzania Development Vision 2025 (launched in 1999), (ii) the National Strategy for Growth
and Poverty Reduction 2010-2015 (MKUKUTA II); and (iii) the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy 2012-2015.

A.2 Technical soundness

The Program’s focus on quality of PHC in general and RMNCH in particular is appropriate

5.       A large share of health challenges in Tanzania, including RMNCH, can be effectively
prevented and managed at the PHC level, using a well-known package of evidence-based cost-
effective interventions.2 In Tanzania, access to a health care has sharply improved in recent year
with more people being within 2 hours of a health facility. Moreover, 3 out of 4 (74.9 percent)
facilities offer services for women to give birth which is a critical need in a high fertility
environment.

6.      However, the challenge is the quality of PHC in general and RMNCH in particular. For
example, the quality of basic and comprehensive obstetric care is low. A mere 7.5 percent of
PHC facilities can be deemed compliant with BEmOC requirements. Only a dismal 2.6 percent
of dispensaries offer the full BEmOC package. This proportion increases only to 18 percent for
health centers and a paltry 44 percent for first level hospitals (Service Delivery Indicators, 2014).
As the result, the RMNCH continuum is weak in Tanzania. More than half of health workers are
either absent or late during work hours. According to SDI (2014), although on average 14.3
percent of health providers in surveyed facilities were absent from the facility, absence was more
prevalent in Dar es Salaam where 1 out of 5 (20.7 percent) were in fact found in the facility.
Moreover, doctors especially those in urban areas are the most likely to be absent and their
absence is more likely to not have been approved. There is limited adherence to good clinical
practices. A review of clinicians’ ability to manage maternal and neonatal complications under
the SDI 2014 showed that providers surveyed adhered to only 30.4 percent of the clinical
guidelines for managing maternal and newborn complications. There was no significant
difference between the performance of public and private (for- and not-for-profit) providers.
Doctors are again more likely to adhere more closely although they would follow only about
35.7 percent of guidelines. Further, essential drugs are frequently out of stock, and facilities are
in poor conditions.

7.       Poor quality of PHC results in low utilization despite relatively good access. For instance,
studies show that community perceptions of the quality of the local health system influence
women's decisions to deliver in a clinic. Improving quality of PHC services and communicating
this to communities therefore will assist efforts to increase facility delivery in Tanzania.3

Key bottlenecks to quality of PHC and RMNCH have been clearly identified under the Program

8.     Under the overall BRN initiative by the Office of the President, the BRN in Health was
developed through an intensive six-week “Health Lab? process (22 Sep – 31 Oct 2014). It

rural Tanzania: a multilevel analysis. Health Policy. 2010 Oct;97(2-3):209-16.
involved 138 representatives from 65 agencies representing key stakeholders in the sector
(including academia, government officials, development partners, CSOs, private sector
representatives and others). A total of 32,000 man hours was devoted to the development of
BRN. The BRN process identified the following bottlenecks to quality of PHC in Tanzania on
the supply side.

9.      First, human resource for health (HRH) is a major constraint to PHC service delivery.
Nation-wide, there are 554 dispensaries without skilled health workers; of which 135 (25%) are
in the 9 regions with critical HRH shortage (HMIS 2014). Instead, they are staffed by medical
attendants who are not qualified to manage patients by themselves. The national average ratio of
clinicians and nurses per 10,000 population is low at 7.74 (compared to 22.8 as per WHO
recommendations). HRH is unevenly distributed across regions, districts and health facilities:
74% of doctors are found in urban settings, resulting in a doctor to population ratio 17 times
higher in urban than rural areas. Kilimanjaro, Dar es Salaam and Mwanza have 75% of all skilled
HRH (HRH Profile 2014). The current HRH planning process relies on LGAs to identify their
HRH needs and then submit them to POPSM for approval. The process often does not take into
account the existing distribution of skilled HRH workforce in the country.

10.     Second, decentralization in the health sector has not fully materialized, hindering the
operations of facilities. Health facilities have limited financial autonomy to utilize their own
funds. Most PHC facilities do not even have a bank account. Funding for PHC is channeled to
LGAs which unfortunately represent a major bottleneck preventing resources to reach lower
levels. Without adequate resources, PHC facilities at the frontline do not have the basic inputs to
ensure structural quality of care.

11.    Third, there is a poor accountability for results at all levels, including between (i) central
government and Local Government Authorities (LGA), (ii) LGA and facilities and (iii) facilities
and communities. More than half of health workers are either absent or late during work hours.
There is no systematic effort to monitor quality of care, provide accreditation or conduct
continuous quality improvement in PHC.

12.    Fourth, poor supply chain management leads to frequent stock-outs of essential drugs and
medical supplies in PHC facilities. Less than 50% of health facilities have updated stock cards.
The working capital of the Medial Store Department (MSD) has been depleted due to the growth
of debt. MSD’s capacity to deliver medicines is limited to around 65% of health facilities. The
remaining 35% needs to be provided by the private sector.

13.     Fifth, the RMNCH continuum is weak. While there are various Development Partners
funding CHW interventions in various parts of the country, CHWs have not been formalized as
part of the existing health care structure. Outreach services have not been fully established to
enable women and their families to receive selected RMNCH services in their communities.
Average readiness score for EmONC was found to be 53% for facilities (SARA 2012). Blood
Transfusion Services are located at zonal centres, far away from health facilities that conduct
CEmONC services, and thus access to blood is a concern.

The Program design has clear causal links between the challenges, interventions and expected
results
14.    On the basis of the identified challenges, under BRN in Health, the country has
developed interventions which correspond to each bottleneck under Program. Table 1 represents
a summary of key BRN interventions for each bottleneck and the results. Figure 1 explains the
conceptual framework of BRN in Health. RBF is seen as an activity within the BRN work
stream “Performance Management? to help incentivize facilities to improve.

Program interventions are technically sound

15.     The BRN in Health supports evidence-based, cost-effective interventions. Accreditation
has been shown to improve quality of care in both OECD and LMIC countries (although the
number of evaluations for LMIC is fewer). The same applies to quality improvement plans for
health facilities. Fiscal decentralization contributes to provider managerial autonomy, which in
turns facilitates service delivery. Social accountability is universally accepted as a mechanism to
hold providers accountable for results as per the WDR 2004 conceptual framework. HRH
represents a critical input for quality of care and, in fact, a dimension of structural quality. For
maternal and neonatal care, access to quality BEmONC and CEmONC are essential.

16.     Given the nutrition challenges, the Program incorporates nutrition specific and sensitive
interventions in the health sector to address under-nutrition including stunting.4 High impact
nutrition specific interventions in the Program include (i) growth monitoring/promotion among
children under-five, (ii) vitamin A supplementation for children between 6 and 59 months (to
support growth and help combat infections among children), (iii) iron and folic acid (IFA)
supplementation for pregnant women (to reduce the risk of low birth weight, maternal anemia
and iron deficiency); (iv) home visit to provide nutrition/health education by Community Health
Workers (CHW) during the first 1,000 days of life (from pregnancy to two years of age).
Appropriate incentives are built into the Program at the CHW, facilities, LGA and national levels
to stimulate performances related to such indicators.

17.     The government of the Republic of Tanzania is intending to take urgent measures5 to
improve the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system. The 2012 census revealed
that birth registration coverage in Tanzania is at 15% (among the lowest in Africa and in the
world) and a similar situation exists for death registration, while cause-of-death documentation6



4
  Nutrition is a multi-sectoral issue. While the health sector certainly has a role, interventions by many other sectors
is required, including education, social protection, agriculture, water and sanitation, etc.
5
  In line with the framework of the Commission for Information and Accountability of Women’s and Children’s Health (COIA)
and the ministerial declaration of the second conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration
6
  Although this was not assessed by the census
is far from satisfactory. As a first step, a comprehensive assessment7 of the CRVS was
undertaken to identify underlying bottlenecks. A strategic plan8 has also been drafted by
Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA) – the agency responsible for CRVS-
and the National Bureau for Statistics (NBS) with involvement of MOHSW and PMO-RALG
and other relevant stakeholders. The strategy intends to mainstream CRVS in Tanzania with a
specific focus on the role of the health sector given its close connection with birth and deaths.
UNICEF has already been supporting a pilot with registration at health facility level and is
planning to scale this up to 10 new regions (with 2 regions added per year). The Canadian
Department of Foreign Affairs Trade and Development (DFATD) is currently the main donor
providing assistance to improving CRVS in Tanzania through supporting a variety of agencies
such as the NBS9 and RITA10 as well as through WHO11 to support the development and
implementation of the abovementioned CRVS assessment and strategy.

18.     There is an emerging global body of evidence on the effectiveness of facility-level
performance based incentive schemes such as the RBF in improving coverage and quantity of
health services. The RBF also benefits from a wealth of practical RBF experiences generated by
other projects supported by HRITF in many Sub Saharan African countries. The list of payment
indicators in the RBF scheme balances pay-for-quantity vs. pay-for-quality to incentivize the
delivery of a set of cost-effective interventions with inputs supported by BRN in Health.

19.     Under the Program, the RBF activity will include incentives for Community Health
Workers (CHWs) and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) to escort pregnant women to deliver
in the health facility as well as to report any non-institutional maternal and perinatal death within
24 hours to the facility. In line with the upcoming national CRVS strategy, health facilities will
register any births and deaths (including cause of deaths) as part of the RBF program, in line
with the upcoming national CRVS strategy. Performance indicators for health facilities will be
developed to incentivized CRVS-related activities at the facility level.

20.      In summary, from the technical point of view, the proposed Program has many of the
critical building blocks required for delivering results. These include:
             Strong political commitment (including the Office of the President) to PHC and RMNCH;
             The focus on the key challenges faced by PHC in Tanzania;
             The incorporation of BRN in Health in HSSP IV and inclusion of RBF as a provider
              payment mechanism in the draft health care financing strategy;
             Technical soundness and alignment with international evidence and best practices; and,

            experiences.
B.     Expenditure framework

21.      In Tanzania, at the national level, documents such as the Tanzania Development Vision
(TDV) 2025, MKUKUTA II, FYDPI and currently the BRN initiative outline key policy
priorities and targets. At a sectoral level, Health Sector Strategic Plan IV, as well as National
Key Results Areas (NKRAs) of the BRN present policy priority objectives and targets to be
achieved over a certain period of time. Aligning financial resources through the budgets and
actual spending with the policy priorities at all levels is among the critical inputs for effective
implementation and achievement of intended results.

22.    Tanzania has a well-established structure of planning and budgeting, both at the central
and decentralized levels. In addition, there is an annual Public Expenditure Review (PER)
process that helps fiscal policy formulation and management. Under the PER process, a Rapid
Budget Analysis (RBA) is conducted each year to assess the consistency of the approved budget
and actual public expenditures and the government policy priority objectives. As such, a
comprehensive review of the expenditure framework of the Government’s program on primary
health care can be derived from the budget analysis of the BRN in Health, National Health
Accounts (NHA) for several years, annual PERs conducted by the MOHSW, RBA for 2014/15
and 2013/14 and Reports of the CAG for the sector.

23.      The medium term financial prospects of Tanzania appear to be sound with stable GDP
growth. The Tanzanian economy is projected to achieve a rate of growth of approximately 7
percent in the medium term. The main drivers of growth construction, communication and
transport sectors are accompanied by an increase in public investment, including through the
implementation of the BRN initiative. Domestic demand for communications, financial services,
retail trade and construction is expected to remain sustained through technological changes and
the rapid urbanization process. The rate of inflation is expected to remain steady at
approximately 5 percent. The estimated fiscal deficit for 2014/15 is 3.7 percent with this figure
declining to approximately 3 percent in future years. At these levels, the value of public debt
will stabilize at the equivalent of 31 percent of GDP.

24.     The share of 2014/15 budget allocated to priority sectors defined by MUKUTA II (which
includes health) is around two-third of public resources, which is about five percent lower than in
2013/14. This decline is principally explained by the
increase in the debt-service payment, which is anticipated to
absorb close to 10 percent of total expenditures. The
resulting limited fiscal space, due to the rapid growth in the
                                                                   100%

focused largely on reducing inefficiencies and wastage in the sector than raising additional
resources. As such, additional resources identified for BRN in Health over the 3 year period was
US$100 million, significantly lower than that planned in other BRN areas.

26.    Overall, Tanzania spends a significant share of GDP on health (7 percent). However, 48
percent of health spending is from external financing (70 percent of which is off-budget) while
household out of pocket spending is 27 percent and declining. Public sector share of total health
spending is low at about 21 percent while share of other private spending (private firms) is
marginal at 4 percent.

27.      The share of health in the budget has been declining over the years and fell to 8.1 percent
in 2014/15, down from 9.3 percent in 2013/14, despite increased local funding into the health
sector. The per capita health budget in 2014/15 is around Tsh. 31,132, which is equivalent to a
14 percent decline in real terms compared to 2013/14, and only one-third of the target
recommended by the WHO (US$ 54 per capita or TSh 91,800). A reversal in this trend is
expected in the near future with local contribution to the sector continuing to increase and
inclusion of Health in the Big Results Now (BRN) initiative. Through the support for the BRN
initiative, the government is committed to increasing resources for primary health care. The
government is also aiming to allocate about 80 percent of the resources under the BRN in Health
initiative through PMORALG to LGAs.

pool and includes: (i) part of OC allocations through external financing via MOHSW sent to
LGAs (HBF) and (ii) medicines allocations which are transferred as goods instead of cash from
MSD to LGAs. LGAs are therefore very reliant on the central level for key inputs that affect
primary care service delivery. LGAs also receive own-sources revenues through user fees and
other contributions such as CHF but given low enrollment in CHF program and high level of
exemptions, these are a small share.

32.     Figure 5 speaks strongly to the persistence of
highly unequal health block grant (OC and PE)
distribution amongst LGAs. Excluding Kibaha which
has an unusually high per capita budget of Tshs. 52,655, the top five districts - Mwanga, Mafia,
Kibaha and Kisarawe, and Siha average about 31,000 Tshs per Capita (3.25 times the national
average); while the bottom five –Nzega, Itilima, Kyerva, Uvinza, and Bariadi average about
3035 Tshs per capita (0.32 times the national average). On a population basis, those in the
privileged top 10 percent of the population get twice the national average; while the least
privileged 10 percent get 40 percent of the national average. While comparison with previous
year’s RBA is analysis is far from perfect given the incorporation of new districts and new
population figures, increasing standard deviation in per capita health block grant spending at the
LGA level (from 0.65 in 2013-14 to 0.68 in 2014-15) suggests that inequality in resource
distribution might be widening amongst LGAs. For 2014-15, the variation is significantly lower
in the OC than in PE (standard deviation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively).

33.    Given the huge variation in OC among LGAs, this PforR advocates for the government to
adopt a formula that favor underserviced areas using a combination of population, poverty and
health outputs similar to that of the HBF. Currently. MOFEA uses a population based formula to
allocate OC to LGAs. The Health Basket Fund (HBF) uses an equity based formula for the
allocation of HBF resources to LGAs. The HBF criteria include: population (70 percent of
weight), poverty (10 percent), health outputs (10 percent) and geographical constraints (10
percent)).

34.     Further, personnel distribution and retention has been a challenge in the country,
especially for lower level health facilities, and for rural areas, resulting in lack of availability of
qualified personnel at facilities. Through the BRN initiative, special attention is being provided
for a more equitable distribution of skilled personnel from the public sector, especially for
dispensaries and health centers. Additionally, through the public-private partnership, service
level agreements are being signed with nongovernment organizations to provide quality PHC
services in rural and underserved areas. Other measures planned include, settlement allowances
for staff retention, incentives through the results-based financing mechanism to motivate staff for
better performance at dispensary and health centers. Emphasis is also on preventive and early
care (incentives in RBF to support ANC visit within the first 12 weeks). Community workers are
also being incentivized to create the appropriate and timely referrals to health facilities.

35.      New directives under the BRN in Health suggest greater fiscal decentralization to health
facilities. While PE is directly allocated to staff bank accounts by MOFEA, decentralized OC
budgets are allocated to the providers (health facilities) through the LGAs. LGAs however use
their own discretion in allocating OC to health facilities and funds are not always for direct
facility use. This hinder innovative solutions to solve local problems and ability of facilities to
implement facility improvement plans. BRN in Health aims to strengthen fiscal decentralization
through empowering facilities to plan and manage funds. LGAs would be required to transfer
part of the resources (OC, HBF, council own source funds) directly to health facility bank
accounts for facility level use.

36.     Budget execution rate in the health sector in 2013/14 performed relatively well compared
to other sectors, even though arrears have grown substantially. Overall, the health sector budget
execution rate in 2013/14 declined to around 86 percent, down from 89 percent in 2012/13.
However, the recurrent budget performed far better than the development budget, at 91 percent
compared to 80 percent. With regards to the development budget, both foreign and local budget
were under executed in 2013/14. Nevertheless, the execution of the locally funded component of
the health budget was lower than the foreign funded component. Moreover, there is a buildup of
arrears with Medical Stores Department (MSD), estimated to be around US$50-60 million by the
end of 2013/14. Recognizing this, the Health Commodities work stream of the BRN focuses on
improving governance, accountability, and sense of ownership of health commodities supply
chain while strengthening management of MSD working capital for sustainable availability of
medicines and medical supplies.
C.     Program’s results framework and monitoring

37.     The DLIs have been chosen to address the bottlenecks along the results chain that require
incentivizing, with both ambition (“stretch?) and feasibility (“realism?) taken into account. All
PDO and the Intermediate Results Indicators were selected as DLI because of their ability to
measure and incentivize key intended changes in the health sector.
38.     A set of specific, measurable and relevant indicators was agreed with the GOT to monitor
the Program. As part of the M&E harmonization agenda under SWAP, the vast majority of
Program indicators are extracted from the Government’s M&E framework (e.g. HSSP IV and
BRN in Health indicators). This aims to increase the Government’s ownership in Program results
and reduce fragmentations in M&E. As discussed in the M&E section above, Program results
will be monitored through the routine health management information system or administrative
data systems of MOHSW and PMO-RALG. This is a deliberate choice to (i) align Program’s
monitoring methodology with that of the Government; (ii) reduce the country’s reliance on
surveys to generate data; (iii) maximize the use of routine information platforms; and (iv) help
further strengthen the country’s information systems.

39.    The cornerstone of PHC information system is the District Health Information System 2
(DHIS 2). Tanzania completed its country wide rollout of DHIS 2 in 2013 after deploying a
revised health management information system tool national wide. Data from all PHC facilities
in the country are now entered monthly in the National Data Warehouse through internet
connections.

40.    As part of monitoring progress towards the PDO, the Bank team will conduct regular
implementation support missions based on the detailed Implementation Support Plan (Annex 9),
whose focus would be on timely implementation of the agreed Program Action Plan (Annex 8),
provision of necessary technical support, conduct of fiduciary reviews, and monitoring
adherence to verification protocols, where appropriate.

D.     Governance structure and institutional arrangements

41.    An adequate governance structure and coordination arrangements are in place to
implement the Program. Coordination mechanisms for the MOHSW and PMORALG to
collaborate with each other as well as to coordinate with country stakeholders and external
development partners are well established. In order to implement this Program, a Steering
Committee will be established between the key implementing agencies that will meet biannually.

42.      In addition, as part of BRN, there are various mechanisms put in place by the GoT to
ensure the Program’s success results by holding various actors accountable for results at all
levels along the hierarchy, from front-line providers to the office of the President. First, in BRN,
there will be governance and delivery structures at different levels (e.g. Ministerial Delivery
Unit, NKRA Steering Committee). Second, the proposed restructuring of the HBF will help
foster the accountability of LGAs as discussed above. Third, RBF will introduce performance-
based contracts with PHC facilities to hold them accountable for service delivery. Fourth,
various social accountability mechanisms will be used in both BRN and RBF (e.g. Health
Facility Committees, use of CSO for verification of results). Last but not least, very high level of
country ownership in these two initiatives is a major enabling factor for the future Program
results.

E.     Economic analysis of the Program

43.     The Program supports strengthening of the primary health care delivery system
particularly maternal and neonatal child health services nationwide. Primary Health Care in
Tanzania is provided at the community level (households and communities) and in health
facilities (dispensaries, health centres and the district hospital). While a range of services are
provided at the PHC level, services targeted towards women of reproductive age and children
constitute the largest share. These include Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses
(IMCI), malaria, tuberculosis, HIV prevention and control, Sexually Transmitted Infections
(STIs), Reproductive Maternal and Child Health (RMCH) and Prevention of Mother to Child
Transmission (PMTCT). Over the period 2009 to 2014, the number of health facilities and the
number of health workers deployed have increased, but per capita utilisation of health services
did not increase significantly primarily due to low perceived quality of care.

44.     Quality improvement of primary health care is therefore a major focus of HSSP IV,
propelled by the BRN in Health activities. The development of a certification and accreditation
system for facilities will underscore this. Quality is also expected to improve through adequate
supply of medicines and health products. Performance management systems (including provision
of incentives for improved PHC quality especially at the local government and facility level) will
further enhance quality as well as accountability of health workers.

45.     This economic analysis covers (i) the rationale for public investment, (ii) the summary of
costs and benefits and (iii) risk-sensitivity analysis.

46.      Rationale for public investment. Government intervention in the health sector at the
primary care level is strongly justified in Tanzania on the ground of improving equity, as well as
positive externalities and public goods. The poor are highly dependent on the public sector for
services, especially in the rural areas where choices are limited. However, quality of care in
PHC facilities is low. Public subsidy is thus called for to improve quality of PHC care where the
poor access services. Improved quality of care also means improved technical efficiency. It
should therefore help reduce overall costs in the medium to long-term. The BRN in Health and
the Program with an emphasis on increased resources to primary care encourages domestic
funding to focus on areas where there is a clear role for government. Further under the health
facility based incentives, facilities are incentivized for providing services to the extreme poor as
identified by the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT under PSSN) program thus directly targeting
those most in need. Additionally, as geographic inequality in health block grant distribution
amongst LGAs remains substantial and continues to widen, the Program emphasizes the
allocation of resources in a more equitable manner including the promoting the use an equity
formula for distribution of resources to LGAs.

47.      The Program supports strengthening fiscal decentralization to the level of the health
facilities to foster innovation and cost-effective local solutions. Decentralization of service
delivery in Tanzania is still incomplete with local governments still reliant on central levels for
key inputs (medicines, part of operating cost funding etc.). The introduction of bank accounts at
the facility level with clear financial management guidelines supported and incentivized by the
Program brings resources closer to where services are delivered and helps foster local solutions
to shortages in health personnel and medicines.

48.    Key beneficiaries of the Program are women of reproductive age and children under the
ages of five and key program indicators will be monitored by gender. The BRN in Health
supported by the Program prioritizes regions with highest burden of maternal, neonatal, and child
mortality. In addition, it aims to target and expand coverage of selected evidence-based
interventions in RMNCH that will have the greatest impact on lives saved through strong district
level support in decision-making and implementation.

49.      Widespread shortages of qualified health workers especially in rural and poor districts
result in the delivery low quality of primary care services to those most in need. Redistribution of
skilled personnel especially at the dispensary level with a focus on regions with critical shortages
as planned under BRN HRH work stream and supported by the Program is expected to further
reduce inequities at the LGA level. The Program also supports and incentivizes the new
community health worker strategy bringing services closer to the population and promotes
efficiency and health worker performance management through incentives, contracts and
recognition, and provides opportunities for hiring of skilled HRH through PPP/Private sector
engagement.

Summary of Benefits and Costs

50.    There is considerable amount of literature that points to the efficacy of primary care
services. Primary care services is associated with improved control of routine illnesses that have
serious consequences if left untreated. Availability of such services close to where the
population reside improves patient satisfaction. Longitudinal care offered by primary care
services reduces use of ancillary and laboratory services, leads to shorter lengths of stay at
hospitals and improves patient compliance.

51.     While primary care services are largely associated with reducing burden of disease and at
a low cost, there are welfare benefits that accrue to a household as a result of prevention of
severe disease. Severe disease can limit the ability of patients and care givers to work and lead
to consumption of household assets in
purchasing of care. Through prevention and
early treatment, accessible primary care services
                                                                                 2004-5         2010
can thus reduce consequences of ill-health for
households, reduce absenteeism, and enhance            Table 4: Tanzania, Demographic and Health

result of the Program over the period 2015-2035.

54.    The economic analysis assumes that use of services will improve primarily due to
improvements in quality of care (less drug stock outs, access to qualified health personnel) and
with the presence of more motivated staff that perform better as a result of the results-based
financing and other interventions supported by the Program.

   Source: WHO, 2006, 2012.                       institutional deliveries as well as quality of
                                                  antenatal care increases. Additionally, reduction
                                                  in morbidity and increased use of appropriate
                                                  health services further reduces mortality among
infants. The analysis is run for three different sub-groups: (a) neonates, (b) post-neonates, and (c)
pregnant women.

58.      Between 2005 and 2010, the annual increase in institutional deliveries was 1%. To
calculate neonatal deaths averted, the model assumes that with improved quality of care,
institutional deliveries will increase by about 5% per year during the program period (2015-
2020). Following which, as a result of improved quality of care, institutional delivery will
increase by 2% per annum. The model starts with 52% institutional delivery in 2015 and reaches
88% institutional delivery by 2034.

Further it is assumed that the risk of a neonatal death varies by place of delivery. For instance, in
2014, based on trend data using the Demographic Health Survey, the risk of a neonatal death at a
health facility is 0.003. In comparison, the risk of a neonatal death at home is 0.04. As the quality
of health services improves, the risk of a neonatal death at a health facility reduces (from 0.003
in 2015 to 0.001 in 2020). In addition, services quality improvements will further result in an
increase in the share of institutional delivery thus having an exponential effect on the number of
neonatal deaths averted. Further as quality of antenatal care improves, the risk of a neonatal
death further reduces.

malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea/dehydration and HIV.

60.     A similar simulation was conducted to estimate the number of maternal deaths averted as
a result of the Program. Here, it is assumed that maternal deaths would be averted as more and
more women receive quality antenatal care, deliver at health facilities or assisted by skilled
attendants and receive quality postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery. Maternal morbidity
would also reduce as women seek treatment and comply with the treatment protocols (e.g. iron
supplementation for anemia). Subsequently, less women would need additional care, resulting in
savings in the cost of treatment and travel. Women’s productivity too would improve as their
health status improves.

program cost is allocated for improvements in child health. It is also estimated that the cost of
year of life gained (YLG) is US$6, and the cost per disability adjusted life years (DALY) is
US$10 during the program intervention period.

65.     Table 8 presents the costs and the measurable economic benefits that arise from the
implementation of the Program. It shows savings incurred due to death or morbidity averted. In
2011/12, the per capita health spending in Tanzania was US$ 45 (NHA). Assuming 3% inflation,
per capita health spending in future years is calculated. For women’s health, it is assumed that
US$100 is saved in health spending due to each case of mortality and morbidity averted.
Further, reductions in ill-health would reduce absenteeism and this result in productivity gains as
earning potential increases. GDP per capita is used as a proxy for earnings potential, while
inflation is assumed to be 3% per year. A five percent discount rate is assumed while estimating
future costs and benefits.

66.     By 2034, it is expected that as many as 1 million infant and neonatal deaths are averted,
as is 84,000 maternal deaths. While the analysis focuses on infant and maternal deaths, many of
these interventions would also reduce infant and maternal distress and morbidity. Consequently,

67.     The program reaches a positive net present value (NPV) by 2029 (or in its 14th year after
program effectiveness). The net benefits accruing to the country are maximized thereafter. We
find that the internal rate of return (IRR) is positive but reaches the discount rate level by 2030
(or at 15th years from program effectiveness) making the program an acceptable investment.

Risk-sensitivity analysis

68.     The above simulation has taken 3 scenarios: (a) scenario 1 - status quo, (b) scenario 2 -
reduced mortality rates as a result of increased institutional delivery by an annual increment of
5% reaching 66% institutional delivery by 2020, and (c) scenario 3 - reduced mortality rates as a
result of increased institutional delivery by an increment of 10% reaching 80% institutional
delivery by 2020. The sections above show the results of scenario 2 as compared to scenario 1.
When the model is re-run for scenario 3, we find a positive NPV by 2028 (13th year), and IRR is
positive and reaches the discount rate by 2029 (14th year).

69.     A sensitivity analysis was conducted using variable discount rates of 5% and 12%, and
variable institutional deliveries by 2020 of 66% and 80%. The results are shown in Table 9.

       Technical risks

70.      By and large, the Program designed by the GOT is technically sound and risk of non-
implementation of Program activities is low given the fact that detailed implementation plans
with time-bound actions, good division of labors, clear accountability and M&E mechanisms
have been developed for all work streams under BRN in Health. Some of the BRN in Health
activities are already under implementation such as the “Star Rating? initiative. Although the
limited capacity of Program implementers remains a concern, the Program’s annual capacity
building plans are expected to help address this issue.

71.    In summary, any residual risks related to technical design, implementation and M&E will
be mitigated through the use of DLIs, Program’s annual capacity building as well as TA to be
financed through parallel financing from development partners. These are summarized in Table
7.

Executive Summary


Senegal has implemented an area-based concession approach to rural electrification. Since
2008, six large concession areas have been competitively tendered, and four of them have
started serving customers. The implementation of these concessions has been significantly
delayed and the uptake in the concession areas has been lower than expected. The large
zonal PPER concessions have extended connections to 3,726 subscribers in four rural
concessions in operation.
History: Senegal established an Agency for Rural Electrification (Agence Sénégalaise pour
l’Electrification Rurale - ASER) in 1999. The state-owned vertically-integrated power
company, SENELEC, was privatized using a concession contract in 2000, but reverted to
state control 18 months later. In 2002, the Government tried unsuccessfully to lease the
company to a private operator. In 2004, the Government developed a strategy to carve the
country into 10 large rural concession areas and competitively select private companies to
build and operate power infrastructure for 25-year terms. Concurrently, small village-level
operations would be tendered under a separate program. The first six large concession
contracts were signed between 2008 and 2011. These concession contracts become
operational between 2011 and 2015. Four of the six concessions are supplying electricity to
customers as of October 2015.
Large Area Concessions: ASER implemented a “top-down? approach for rural
electrification. SENEGAL was divided into 10 concession territories that would see their
electricity development and operation entrusted to the private sector. Each concession
agreement was based on a priority investment program called PPER (Programmes
Prioritaires d’Electrification Rurale). These concessions currently have around 3,726
customers.
Bottom-Up Concessions: ASER also implemented a bottom-up approach, ERIL (Projets
d’Electrification Rurale d’Initiative Locale). In those areas that did not yet have a top -down
concession, ASER was supposed to encourage village-level concessions by communities,
consumer groups or private operators.
Concurrent Efforts: Since 2004, the Government has been financing its own emergency
rural electrification programs, deploying diesel-fired generators in the concessionaires’
service areas. The majority of these generators are now out of order due to disrepair or to
users’ inability to pay for the fuel and operation of the equipment. Meanwhile, the state -
owned national utility SENELEC has been making significant investments in distribution
infrastructure, adding hundreds of thousands of customers since 2004, many of them rural.
SENELEC has generally undercut the efforts of private concessionaires in the country.
Key Lessons: The PPER projects illustrate lessons for governments considering using a
concession approach to rural electrification:
        The state-owned national utility can be an obstacle to achieving the
         Government’s private-sector rural electricity objectives. SENELEC has made
         things difficult for private-sector rural electrification efforts. For example, by
         failing to agree on power purchase agreements with GTDs and not cooperating


                                               i
  until recently in contemplating a harmonization of tariffs. It took 4 years to agree
  on a convention between SENELEC and the PPER concessionaires.
 Setting up robust organizational, legal and regulatory processes takes time.
  A significant part of the delays in implementing the PPER concessions were due
  to capacity development at key agencies or to long stakeholder consultations.
 Separating the regulator and rural electrification agency can complicate
  rural electrification efforts. The regulator’s goals may differ from the REA’s
  goals.
 Political support for private concessions fluctuates. In Senegal, this wavering
  political support has been a hindrance to the development of the concessions.

1      Introduction
The purpose of this report is to review Senegal’s experience with rural electrification
concessions. This case study is one of six detailed case studies that form a body of evidence
on the experience and successes of rural electrification concessions across sub-Saharan
Africa.
Background on the Senegal power system is presented in Section 0. The large zonal
concessions implemented under the priority investment program, PPER (Programmes
Prioritaires d’Electrification Rurale), are reviewed in detail in Section 3. The small
concessions under the ERIL program (Projets d’Electrification Rurale d’Initiative Locale) are
briefly reviewed in Section 4. The report concludes with an assessment of the success of
these concessions, in Section 5.

Economy and demographics
Senegal is a country of 14.6 million people and GDP per capita at US$1,071. Between 2004
and 2014 the population grew at 2.82 percent per year, while GDP per capita (in real PPP
terms) grew at 0.95 percent per year. The majority of people in Senegal (56.5 percent) live in
the countryside.
Politics and governance
Senegal was a colony of France until 1960, when it gained independence as part of the short-
lived Mali Federation and then as a wholly sovereign state.1 The country was ruled by
Leopold Sedar Senghor and his Senegalese Progressive Union party (later known as the
Socialist Party) until 1980. Two opposition parties were allowed starting in 1976. Senegal
formed the confederation of Senegambia by joining The Gambia in 1982, but integration of
the two countries was never implemented and was cancelled in 1989.
Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index ranks Senegal tenth best in sub-
Saharan Africa and at 69 out of 175 countries globally.2 The legal system is based on French
civil law, and the highest court is the Supreme Court (Cour suprême du Sénégal).3
The legislative branch is made up of a National Assembly. A second legislative body, the
Senate, was twice created and abolished: in 1999-2001 and then again in 2007-2012.4
Infrastructure and energy sector reforms in Senegal have been encouraged by the IMF and
World Bank.5
The security and humanitarian situation in Senegal has been relatively stable. Senegal has not
been considered a fragile or conflict-affected state by the World Bank.
2.1        Power Market Structure and Evolution
The current structure and legal framework of the electricity in Senegal result from an
institutional reform undertaken in accordance with the Electricity Law no. 98-29 dated 14
April 1998. According to the Electricity Law, concessions and licenses may be granted as
follows:
            Distribution Concession: 25 years
            Production License: 15 years
            Sales License: 15 years.
The structure of the power market in Senegal is presented in Figure 2.1.

SENELEC
SENELEC is the national government-owned electric utility that handles the generation,
transmission and distribution for the majority of Senegal’s electricity sector. Between 1999
and 2001, SENELEC was partially privatized and a concession agreement was signed with
the Government of Senegal for the lease and operation of the assets. The motivation for the
concession was the poor performance of SENELEC, and SENELEC’s fiscal burden on the
state. Privatization of the electricity sector and other state-owned enterprises became
conditions for lending by the World Bank and IMF.6
Hydro-Québec (Canada) and Elyo (France) formed a consortium which acquired a 34
percent stake in SENELEC. A 10 percent stake was set aside for purchase by employees,
and the remaining 15 percent was traded on the regional stock exchange, the Bourse
Régionale des Valeurs Mobilieres (BRVM).7 The government’s stake was reduced to 41
percent of the shares.
SENELEC’s customers and grid were almost entirely located in urban areas. However, the
concession agreement included an obligation to extend the grid to specified rural areas and
target numbers of new connections and electrification rates in those areas.8 SENELEC had a

in rural areas by 2004.9
SENELEC’s partial privatization lasted only eighteen months. The concession contract was
hindered by disagreements between the Government and the consortium over questions of
investment and pricing.10 In September 2000, the new government announced that it would
re-purchase HQI/Elyo’s shares. The cancellation was abrupt, and one cited reason for the
cancellation is that the newly elected Government (of Abdoulaye Wade) was dissatisfied with
the progress made in reducing power cuts.11 In 2001, the Government of Senegal tried to re-
privatize SENELEC using a lease model. An initial group of five potential bidders formed
into two consortia. Discussions with both consortia were unsuccessful, and that privatization
process was cancelled in July 2002.12
The steady growth in connections continued throughout this period. The percentage of rural
households with electricity connections grew during the 18-month long concession.
However, it is difficult to attribute this to the concession as the electrification rate during the
1996 to 2004 grew at a steady pace during this time and the majority of the investment took
place while the Government ran SENELEC.
SENELEC operates most of the generation premises. However three independent power
producers (IPPs) supply SENELEC with electricity: GTI-Dakar, Eskom-Energie-Manantali
(EEM - a subsidiary of Eskom South Africa) and Kounoune Power SA.

squares show the location of regional-grid generation plants, and red and green lines show
the high-voltage and medium-voltage transmission lines respectively.

Other Electricity Sector Actors
The Ministry of Energy and Renewable Energy Development (MEDER - Ministère de
l’Energie et du Développement des Energies Renouvelables) has overall responsibility for
developing and implementing the government’s energy policies. Within MEDER, the
Electricity Division (DEL-Direction de l’Electricité) is responsible for electricity.
Responsibility for rural electrification in the country lies with Agence Sénégalaise
d’Electrification Rurale (ASER).13 ASER has a rural electrification fund, the Fonds
d’Electrification Rurale (FER).14
Electricity sector regulation is done by Commission de Régulation du Secteur de l’Electricité
(CRSE-Electricity Sector Regulator).15
MEDER recently established an interministerial committee for rural electrification (CISPER-
Comité Interministériel de Suivi du Programme d’Electrification Rurale). CISPER aims to
remedy some of the rural electricity sector problems that the sector regulator, CRSE, has

         Minister of the Maritime Economy (including the Port of Dakar)
         Ministry of Energy (including notably ASER and SENELEC).
In addition to the World Bank, some of the donors active in Senegal’s rural electrification
concessions include: Agence Française de Développement (AFD-French Development
Agency); Africa Development Bank (AfDB); German International Development Agency
(GIZ); German Development Bank (KFW-Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbau); and the
European Union.
Electrification Rate
In 2012, the electrification rate in the country was 57 percent and the rural electrification rate
was 26.6 percent. The change in the electrification rate between 1990 and 2012 is presented

2.2          Rural Electrification Approach
The Electricity law of 1998 has provided for the creation of a Senegalese Agency for Rural
Electrification (Agence Sénégalaise pour l’Electrification Rurale-ASER), as an independent
agency responsible for:
              Granting technical and financial assistance to support initiatives for rural
               electrification to the electricity sector companies
              For that purpose developing electrification programs decided on the basis of the
               rural electrification planning defined by the Minister of Energy
              Organizing annual tenders for the granting of new rural electricity distribution
               concessions in rural areas
              Inviting and encouraging the submission of electrification projects by private
               operators.
ASER was established in December 1999 and started implementing programs to deploy
small diesel generators or solar home systems.
Since 2003, concessions have been expected to become an important approach in Senegal
for electrifying rural areas, but the primary means of electrifying rural areas has been through
grid extension by the state-owned utility SENELEC. These grid extension projects are
largely financed by the government.16


16   CRSE, “Bilan des Activites SENELEC 2011-2013.?
In 2003, Senegal developed a Rural Electrification Program with the assistance of the World
Bank to electrify rural areas using a concession approach. In that year, the rural electrification
rate was between eight percent and 12 percent.17
The development policy of rural electrification was set out in a document (Lettre de Politique
de development de l’électrification rurale) from the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry
of Economy and Finances dated 23 July 2004. This policy set forth the guidelines for
expanding access to electricity in the country. The Letter provides for a dual approach to
rural electrification:
            1. A “top-down? approach for dividing the country into 18 concession territories
               that would see their development and operation entrusted to the private sector. 18
               Each concession agreement was based on a priority investment program called
               PPER (Programmes Prioritaires d’Electrification Rurale) that would be
               updated regularly. The number of concession territories was eventually reduced to
               10
            2. A bottom-up approach, ERIL (Projets d’Electrification Rurale d’Initiative
               Locale). In those areas that did not yet have a top-down concession, ASER was
               supposed to encourage spontaneous village-level concessions by communities,
               consumer groups or private operators.
Once a PPER concession is awarded, it is possible for a private developer to obtain an ERIL
concession in the same geographic area, provided it meets certain conditions. If a PPER
concession is awarded, ASER can also bring in Transitional Delegated Managers
(Gestionnaires Délégués Transitoires–GTD) to operate rural electrification projects.
Other ASER efforts
While the PPER and ERIL concessions were being implemented and procured, ASER
implemented other large-scale rural electrification programs that bypassed the
concessionaires. Implementation of such programs was continued in parallel with the
concessions. Diesel-fired generators and solar home systems were deployed using
“emergency rural electrification programs?. Most of these generators, which were put at the
disposal of villages and were not operated by professionals, are now out of order.
The coordination of these ASER programs appears to have been not thoroughly considered.
Specifically, the purchasing new equipment and the existing concessions, their perimeter, and
the modalities for transferring new equipment to the concessionaires were poorly planned. A
new emergency program is currently under discussions between the Government and
Lenders.
SENELEC
In addition, SENELEC is authorized to establish a subsidiary whose purpose is to carry on
activities in the rural electrification sector including bidding in view of obtaining a PER
Concession. This company, called Société Sénégalaise d’Electrification Rurale (SSER) (Senegalese
company for rural electrification).SA has been incorporated in October 2004.

SENELEC has been relatively rapidly extending the grid, sometimes in rural areas.
SENELEC added over 90,000 customers between 2011 and 2013.19 However, the extent to
which SENELEC’s customers are officially considered rural customers is unknown.
Transitional Delegated Managers (Gestion Transitoire Deleguee – GDT)
Because the PPER concessions took several years to be implemented and ERIL was virtually
unused, an alternative program was developed. ASER implemented a Transitional Delegated
Managers’ program (Gestion Transitoire Deleguee – GDT). A public tender was launched
and several private operators were recruited to manage power assets in certain pre-
determined lots, including generators and grid extension. These contracts were 25-year
affermage contracts that didn’t require the private operators to investment in grid extension.
A first competitive procurement took place for the Fatick zone. The date of this
procurement is unknown. A second competitive procurement took place in January 2005 for
six lots. The bidders included: SS2E, SENELEC, CSI (MATFORCE) and
GSERM/SODIDA. SSER won three of the lots, SS2E won one of the lots, and GSERM
won a single lot. The winning bidders were selected on the basis of multiple bid parameters,
including their technical capability, experience, and financial offer. SSER was disqualified
from some of the lots because it was a subsidiary of SENELEC.
The delegated manager is compensated with 40 percent of the energy billed (pre-tax) plus 40
percent of what subscribers pay for new connections (to compensate for marketing costs).20
Concessions were granted for 25 years and included a commitment of the concessionaire to
transfer it to the PPER concessionaire being granted a concession including this region upon
his request.
SENELEC did not sign power purchase agreement with two of the GTDs (SS2E and
EQUIP PLUS) and this issue was only solved in January 2015. As result these operators
could not serve clients from grid extensions.

3      The “Top-Down? PPER Concessions
The PPER concessions are the “top-down? rural electrification concessions for ten regions
of the country. The original planned 18 concession territories. The number of concession
territories was eventually reduced to ten, as shown in Figure 2.2

The main characteristics of the six concessions already granted for 25 years periods in
accordance with the Electricity Law are shown in Table 3.1. Studies and preparations are
currently ongoing for four additional PPER concessions:
        Concession 7 - Matam- Kanel-Ranérou-Bakel;
        Concession 8 - Rufisque- Thiés- Tivaouane-Bambey- Diourbel- Mbacké;
        Concession 9 - Foundiougne; and
        Concession 10 - Ziguinchor-Oussouye-Bignona-Sédhiou.
Studies for the local planning for electrification have been achieved and a search for
investment financing has begun for Concessions 9 and 10.

3.1         Stages of Development
In 1998, Senegal passed a law creating a rural electrification agency, l’Agence Sénégalaise
d’Électrification Rurale (ASER), with the objective of promoting rural electrification using a
concession approach.27 In 2003, Senegal developed a Rural Electrification Program with the
assistance of the World Bank to electrify rural areas using a concession approach.
The first concession area, Dagana-Podor-Saint-Louis, was bid out in 2008. The second and
third concessions were in 2009 and 2010. The size of the concession areas was set at around
10,000 to 30,000 customers as this was believed to be the minimum size necessary to attract
significant commercial interest from international or large companies.28
Implementation of the PPER concessions has been slow to several factors, including29:
             A high amount of procedural, institutional and regulatory capacity building
             A high number of stakeholders
             Overly elaborate stakeholder consultations
             Wavering political commitment from the Government, especially the Ministry of
              Energy
             Tensions between SENELEC and ASER
             Disagreements between ASER and the regulator CRSE
             A focus at ASER on short-term government-funded emergency rural
              electrification programs, rather than on development of the concessions
             A lack of management capacity at ASER
             Generally slow decision-making.


27   Loi n 98-29 no 98-29 dated 14 April 1998

29   Many of these factors are drawn from: Rebecca Mawhood and Robert Gross, “Institutional barriers to a ‘perfect’ policy:
     A case study of the Senegalese Rural Electrification Plan ,? Energy Policy (2014, volume 73). Others are drawn from the
     results of a World Bank Implementation and Completion Results report mission in 2012.
A timeline showing the major stages of development leading up to the concession is
presented in Table 3.8.

3.2         Operations and Management
The concessionaires have adequate skills, resources and management.
The extent to which international partners are involved in operations and management is
substantial. All the PPER concessionaires are backed by international companies.
Pre-paid meters
COMASEL and SCL Energie Solutions use pre-paid meters for their grid-connected
clients.30 PERACOD and ERA do not use pre-paid meters for their grid connected clients.
No private operator uses pre-paid meters for use in solar home systems.31
3.3         Financing Arrangements
The PPER concessionaires receive a subsidy from ASER for a portion of their initial
investment cost. They do not receive a subsidy on their ongoing operations and maintenance
costs.
The subsidy amount at the outset is determined during the negotiations following from a
competitive public tender process. The share of private financing ranges from 22.49 percent
to 67.80 percent of the total financing. In practice, ASER has pledged subsidies of between

 3.4     Contractual Arrangements
 The private operators enter into contracts with ASER as well as with the Ministry of Energy,
 MEDER.
 The type of contract is a 25-year concession contract.
 The concessionaire undertakes in particular to:
          Design and built the installations, maintain and renew the equipment;
          Provide inside electrical installation for the subscribers;
          Provide services during at least six hours per day (7 pm to 1 am);
          Recover the tariffs from users
          Pay the royalty regulation of public procurement at the rate of 0.1 percent of
           turnover (for other taxes, exemption shall apply in accordance with the Master
           Agreement No. 03035 of 24 July 2003 between the Government of the Republic
           of Senegal and ASER); and
          Comply with the applicable law and specifications for the concession contract and
           license (Cahier des Charges de Contrat de Concession et de Licence).
3.5         Technological Approach
Distribution in the concessions is done through a variety of technological approaches. ASER
based its strategy on “technology neutrality,? leaving the private operators free to decide on
the choice of technology, within the constraints of the technical standards defined by ASER.
The technologies used on the four PPER concessions are a mix of technological approaches.

Some of the donor financing was partly conditional on the use of certain technologies. This
resulted in case-by-case negotiations that increased delays and construction costs.33
Grid Extension
The concessionaire SCL Energie Solutions is installing single phase grid extensions.34
The concessionaire ERA is extending the grid using cement poles. ERA is refusing to
integrate other poles into their distribution network that haven’t been built according to their
standards. The other poles exceed the minimum technical standards established by ASER
but ERA claims that poles that meet these other poles would not be economically viable for
the 25-year duration of the concession.35
ERA estimates that in its concession area, grid extension costs twice as much as solar home
system installations. Because the electricity uptake rate is much lower than expected (20
percent in the targeted villages instead of the forecast 70 percent), the actual cost of a grid
connection per user is eight times more than a solar home system.36

Mini-Grids
Some diesel-gensets directly supplied outside PPER concessions implementation were
deployed. The majority of diesel generators are out of order due to disrepair or because the
costs of operating them are too high.37
Solar Home Systems
Senegal has invested substantially in solar home systems with the support of a German solar
energy program between 1989 and 2005. 65,000 solar home systems are expected to have
been installed or be in the process of installation. As shown in table 2.2 to 2.7, solar home
systems are expected to be deployed in 581 villages within the 6 PPER concessions. Two
PPER concessionaires, COMASEL and ERA, which are operating the three most advanced
concessions, are expected to deploy solar home systems in over 10,000 rural households As
of today the concessionaires have obtained around 4,000 solar home systems (1,500 by ERA
and 2,500 by COMASEL).38 Around 2,500 have been installed.
Technology Neutrality
Some rural electrification actors have suggested that the “technology neutrality? policy
should be reconsidered. Rather than leaving concessionaires free to choose technologies, a
comprehensive least-cost electrification plan should form the basis of a national
electrification strategy.39 They suggest that the current concessionaires don’t sufficiently take
into account the cost of service for users is higher than expected and that an eventual
harmonization of tariffs between SENELEC and the concessionaires would be too costly
for the state. ASER could play a more active role in directing investments to better meet
demand.
3.6         Regulatory Arrangements
The concessions are regulated by the electricity sector regulator, the Commission de
Régulation du Secteur de l’Electricité (CRSE) pursuant to Article 28 of the Law no. 98-29.
The tariffs, service standards and also their duration are defined in the concession
specifications (Cahier de charges de la concession). The tariffs databases are subject to a 5-
year and/or extraordinary revision if a significant change in the financial conditions was
observed, an unforeseeable event beyond the control of the concessionaire or over-costs
which made the tariffs inappropriate.
When concessionaires purchase electricity from SENELEC, the applicable tariff is the
general medium voltage (MV) tariff, minus 20 percent. This assumes a load factor of 25
percent, 30 percent of the energy consumed during peak periods and 70 percent consumed
off-peak.
A royalty is provided in order to develop the electricity sector in accordance with the law no.
2006-18 dated 30 June 2006 creating the rural electrification royalty and the ministerial order
no. 8442 MEM-MEF dated 18 December 2006. This royalty is collected by SENELEC to be

repaid to FER. The royalty is set at FCFA 0.7 (pre-tax) on customers with a meter and 2.5
percent on the energy component for customers without a meter.
According to the tariff system agreed by the CRSE:
        For small residential subscribers, the tariff is fixed depending on a certain number
         of lighting and power outlets points. Three package levels are offered.
        For all subscribers (whether residential or not) who require more power, billing
         will be done according to measured consumption
        The refund of all the connection and installation costs is integrated in a lump sum.
However, in order to ensure applicant’s willingness and ability to pay for connection, non-
refundable connection royalty and an advance on consumption (refundable payment
guarantee of contract) are required.
The tariffs and service standards by concession are indicated in Table 3.11.

Rules on determining and changing the tariff are included in the concession agreement.
Tariffs can be unilaterally changed in the case where the concessionaire chooses a new
service offering. For instance, a special tariff could be made available if a customers use only
three lamps instead of 5 provided in the subscription agreement.
The S1-S3 tariffs are flat or fixed monthly tariffs. These are tariffs based on the customer’s
peak power (watts) used rather than energy (kWh) consumed. The existence of both fixed
tariffs (S1-S3) and a kWh tariff (S4) in a village served by a PPER concessionaire can create
problems if the kWh tariff is capped at SENELEC’s kWh tariff. The reason is that the flat
rate tariff may have an implicit kWh charge that is considerably higher than the S4 kWh
tariff. Therefore the concessionnaire’s S1-S3 customers will want to move to the S4 tariff to

get a lower kWh charge. But if the concessionaire allows this migration, it will reduce its
overall revenues.44
The CRSE has broad investigation powers on the sector. Its decisions and recommendations
are published in the Official Bulletin of the Commission. The Commission decisions may be

Discrepancies exist between the tariffs of the PPER concessions and the SENELEC tariff.
The PPER tariffs are generally higher. This creates frustration for customers in PPER
concessions who live in villages near other villages served by SENELEC and supplied under
the lower prices of the SENELEC residential tariff.
In this respect a study on harmonization of tariff has been recently launched by the CRSE.




44   See Tenenbaum et. al., From The Bottom Up: How Small Power Producers and Mini-Grids Can Deliver Electrification and Renewable
     Energy in Africa, World Bank, Directions in Development, 2014, p. 266-267.
4           The ERIL Concessions
The ERIL concessions were the bottom-up concessions. They have around 500 customers.
Small bottom-up concessions were intended to be procured using a competitive tender twice
a year, in accordance with a detailed procedure set by the Ministry of Energy.45 This
procedure provides for detailed assessment criteria and includes various supporting tools,
such as the allocation of subsidies, the selection of engineering consulting firms to advise
private operators in preparing their projects, the collective purchase of equipment and the
selection of installers by ASER. However, it appears that the competitive procedure was
organized by ASER only twice.
The ERIL concessions are not well-documented. However, they appear to include:
             Three concessions following a call for proposals in 2006: won by COSEER, SUD
              SOLAR and ENERGIE-R. COSEER could not start its projects due to a number
              of requirements from ASER, in particular on its relocation. SUD SOLAR is
              established in Casamance and operates a minigrid with 21 hybrid power stations
              in the Sedhiou region. It serves 457 users (an average of 20 subscribers per plant,
              with a maximum of 50). Level 4 Subscribers (professional users mainly) represent
              on average 20 percent of its subscribers (but over 30 percent in one third of
              villages).
             ERSEN-1 (Rural Electrification Senegal (ERSEN) Project): funded by KFW,
              GIZ and the Dutch government.
             ERSEN-2: second phase of the ERSEN project. Details unknown.
             PASES (Projet d'accès aux services électriques des localités de petites tailles de la
              Région de Sédhiou): a project financed by the European Union. Details unknown.
According to ASER, another call for bids under ERIL is under preparation.




45   This is quite different from the approach used in Mali and Tanzania where bottom up proposals are spontaneous. In
     Mali and Tanzania, rural project proposals below a certain size can be initiated by private developers and are not subject
     to a competitive procurement process.
5           Assessment of Concession
We evaluate Senegal’s concession approach to rural electrification against its targets, analyze
the reasons for the results, and present lessons for future concessions.
5.1         Evaluating Success of Concession
The Senegal concessions have succeeded at extending 3,726 connections to rural households.
This achievement, however, is significantly short of the Government’s objectives.
5.1.1 Access
The concessions have increased access to electricity in rural areas. Specifically, the PPER
concessions have extended connections to 3,726 subscribers identified in four rural
concessions in operation.
In comparison, in 2012 and 2013, SENELEC added over 95,000 connections (rural and
urban combined), increasing their total connections from 901,515 to 998,423 connections.46
The concessions have failed to achieve the objectives set out in their contracts, the
Government’s goals and the objectives of the World Bank’s interventions in Senegal.
Access objectives in concession contracts
The concessions aim to connect 106,601 rural households. Due to delays in starting the
concessions, two of the six concessions have not yet connected any customers.
Access objectives of Government of Senegal
The concessions have failed to achieve the Government’s stated goals.
The Government has made repeated commitments to ambitious, highly-publicized rural
electrification targets, which have been unrealistic.47
Access objectives of World Bank interventions
In 2004, the objective of the World Bank’s Electricity Services for Rural Areas Project in Senegal
was an increase of 35,000 households benefiting directly from electricity by 31 December
2012. The actual number of new connections achieved through World Bank interventions by
that date was 20,386.48 However, the majority of these connections were the result of
emergency rural electrification programs outside of the World Bank. 1,634 of the
connections were through small-scale ERIL concessions funded by KFW/GIZ and the
Netherlands. Twenty-four of the connections were the result of solar home system tests in
one of the PPER concessions financed by the French development agency AFD.
5.1.2 Quality of service
The quality of service from the concessions depends on the electricity supply technology.
The minimum service levels are presented in Table 5.1.

The concessionaires try to strictly respect these minimum service standards. However, this
demand pattern favors demand for the “social users? who mostly use electricity for lighting,
at the expense of professional users, who would prefer to have access during the day.
Basic electricity supply technical studies were conducted in three concessions: RTTBM,
Foundiougne and ZOBS. The studies found that the concessions in Foundiougne and
ZOBS experience voltage dips significantly greater than the authorized 7.5 percent.49 The
studies also found that the existing network in the RTTBM concession is likely to reach
maximum capacity in the next five years.
The concessionaires have criticized the quality of the construction arranged by ASER in the
context of emergency rural electrification programs. This construction respects the technical
standards of ASER. However, the concessionaires assess the quality of the construction to
be below their standards and below international standards. As a result, they have refused to
take over certain newly electrified villages. Instead, operation has been delegated to GDT
operators or to SENELEC.50
Solar Home Systems
Opinions on the quality of solar home systems are mixed among both concessionaires and
consumers. They remain the “least-good-option? for some people but a good transitional
step in specific cases for others.
Some concessionaires have limited the hours of operation of solar home systems to put
electricity availability on equal footing with the electricity coming from other sources (such
as mini-grids). ERA has installed systems to limit the possible operating hours of solar home
systems (SHS) in order to harmonize the SHS access conditions with their other non-SHS
customers.51 Therefore consumption is limited for these customers. Most solar home system
customers consume less than their systems produce.52 Removing these consumption limits
would improve the attractiveness and service quality of solar home systems.

In the Foundiougne concession, 10,000 households have been equipped with 50W solar
home systems between 2005 and 2014. Studies performed before and after the deployment
of the solar home concessions show that most rural households cannot meet their
household energy needs using solar home systems.53 For example, many households with
solar home systems still use rechargeable lamps or flashlights to light their homes. Homes
that have solar home systems limited to evening hours cannot charge their phones during the
day, use fans, or listen to the radio.
 The accessibility of solar home systems is generally considered good in areas where SHS
hours of operation are not limited. But the available peak power produced is usually deemed
to be very insufficient.
5.1.3 Sustainability
At this early stage, it is difficult to tell how financially sustainable the arrangement is for
concessionaires. Though we were not able to review the financials of any concessionaire, it is
our understanding that the concessionaires have made capital investments, and that they are
not yet recovering their investments.
5.1.4 Efficiency
ASER believed that’s its technology-neutral approach would encourage least-cost expansion
by technico-economic optimization.54
It appears that some technologies are not adapted to specific needs of users. For example:
solutions for the supply of solar energy to run mills, power supply pumping systems with
photovoltaic or hybrid generators of greater power. A study of technical solutions that
would accord to different regional contexts might be conducted and be used to guide
candidates to future concessions in their choice of technologies.
5.2         Arrangements that Could Have Delivered Better Results
Ex-post, we can say that alternative arrangements would have delivered better results. We
would improve this arrangement by doing the following:
             Allowing local companies to compete. The criteria in the original PPER
              concession tenders effectively precluded any Senegalese company from qualifying.
             Giving ASER some institutional autonomy. ASER’s Managing Director is
              appointed by the Ministry of Energy, who are also invested in state-owned
              SENELEC. When the priorities of SENELEC and ASER have diverged, the
              Ministry of Energy either delayed or acted in SENELEC’s interests.
5.3         Reasons for Results
From the World Bank’s perspective, there were a number of problems in the
implementation of the project:
             The regulator was uncooperative. The electricity sector regulator, the
              Commission de Régulation du Secteur de l’Electricité (CRSE), sought to regulate

     Experience,? 11 June 2009, Presentation in Maputo
                concessionaires with the same kind of rules as they regulated the national utility
                SENELEC. They were not flexible around designing the tariff. Following the
                award of the bids, concessionaires were asked to agree to changes in the
                concession model. It therefore took quite a long time for investors to start the
                projects.55 Senegal needed a pragmatic regulator.56
             There was competition and lack of cooperation from SENELEC. The
              concessionaires were expected to buy some of their power from SENELEC, who
              were under the impression that this new model of rural electrification was against
              them.57 According to the ICR: “SENELEC did not react well to the end of its monopoly
              in rural areas, making it reluctant to engage in the rural electrification project. Not accounting
              for SENELEC’s engagement risk contributed to implementation delays?.58
             ASER (Senegal REA) quite quickly became a political entity. The institution
              tried to influence rural actors by promising to electrify certain areas in exchange
              for votes.59 The World Bank reported having difficulty focusing their attention on
              the broader missions of the project. ASER was created in 2000, with 10 people,
              and has grown to have around 85 civil servants.60
             Other internal and external factors that also contributed to the results include: the
              2 year delay to agree on the legal framework; the focus on “emergency? programs
              between 2007 and 2010, at the expense of the rural concessions; the lack of
              bidding documents for this specific type of rural concession; and the high number
              of stakeholders.61
5.4         Replicability of Experience and Success
The concession model used in this country can be replicated elsewhere. Senegal has invested
a significant amount of time and political capital in the rural electrification concessions.
However, the concessions have not met the expectations set for them so far.
5.5         Lessons for Future Concessions
The concession illustrates lessons for governments considering using a concession approach
to rural electrification:
             The state-owned national utility can be an obstacle to achieving the
              Government’s private-sector rural electricity objectives. SENELEC has made
              things difficult for private-sector rural electrification efforts. For example, by
              failing to agree on power purchase agreements with GTDs and not cooperating

  until recently in contemplating a harmonization of tariffs. It took 4 years to agree
  on a convention between SENELEC and the PPER concessionaires.
 Setting up robust organizational, legal and regulatory processes takes time.
  A significant part of the delays in implementing the PPER concessions were due
  to capacity development at key agencies or to long stakeholder consultations.
 Separating the regulator and rural electrification agency can complicate
  rural electrification efforts. The regulator’s goals may differ from the REA’s
  goals.
 Political support for private concessions fluctuates. In Senegal, this wavering
  political support has been a hindrance to the development of the concessions.

1. Introduction and methodology2
We use the newly developed World Bank dataset on the labor content of exports (LACEX) to explore the
possible implications of exports for shared prosperity in South Africa.

The LACEX dataset has been recently assembled to compute the (direct and indirect) value of the
compensation of employees linked to exports for each sector/country/year (Calì et al., 2015). The data has
been computed on the basis of a panel of global input-output data spanning intermittent years from 1995
to 2007 from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). This represents a form of social accounting data - a
variation on the social accounting matrix (SAM) where incomes are shown in the rows of the SAM while
expenditures are shown in the columns (See Hertel 2013, McDougal 2001).

The structure of the data provides a comprehensive and consistent record of national income accounting
relationships between different sectors and regions, including intermediate and final demand linkages. This
structure of the dataset allows one to obtain the value added content of final output and exports, including
its compensation of employees’ component. That includes both the direct and indirect compensation, based
on the backward linkages of each sector with the rest of the economy. In order to obtain these labor value
added measures, two intermediate multiplier matrixes need to be calculated (see Appendix 1 for more
details on these calculations). The first is the Leontief inverse matrix, which measures the inputs contained
in a unit of final output. This matrix contains both direct and indirect inputs. Next, one needs to calculate a
matrix which has the compensation of employees’ shares of total output. Using these two matrixes as
multipliers one can obtain the compensation of employees’ shares of exports and final outputs. These shares
are also split between skilled and unskilled workers.

The data are then matched with the UNIDO industrial statistics, which contains data for a number of
countries, including South Africa, on employment at the 4-digit ISIC sector. This allows isolating the jobs
(JOCEX) component of LACEX

             2. South Africa
             The LACEX data shows that in South Africa the labor value added (in nominal terms) directly contained in
             exports (i.e. the wages paid to produce the exports directly) has been increasing robustly since 2001 (
             Figure 1) (the CAGR between 2001 and 2011 was 7.68 percent). The growth in the total labor value added in
             exports (i.e. all the wages paid to produce exports including those for the domestic inputs of exports) has
             been more rapid (the CAGR between 2001 and 2011 was 7.89 percent), reaching $ 35 billion in 2011.

             This growth is not reflected in the growth of the share of total labor content in gross exports (




             Figure 2), which has in fact declined since 2011 (figure 2). In 2001 each $ 100 of exports generated $41 of
             domestic wages, while by 2011 this figure had reduced to $33 (of which $14.5 directly and $18 via backward
             linkages). This $33 is well below that of China and Brazil and it is in line with India (which has followed a
             similar trajectory to that of South Africa). The only BRICS country with a share below that of South Africa is
             Russia. On the other hand South Africa has a higher labor content than other middle-income countries,
             including Colombia, Chile, Thailand and Turkey, while Peru has a higher content. However, the labor value
             added in exports has increased in these countries (except Colombia) relatively to that of South Africa, which
             may be a sign of concern going forward. Table A1 at the end reports also the split of the total labor value
             added by skilled and unskilled labor. The latter dominates in these countries to a larger extent than in the
             rest of the world, although South Africa has a slightly higher share of skilled labor in exports than its
             comparators.

             Not only has the labor contained in exports been declining relative to gross exports, but it has also declined
             relative to the total domestic labor value added (Figure 3). The slow growth in the labor content of exports
             is mainly due to the fact that the export sector has been slowly shedding jobs both directly and indirectly.
             The total number of jobs associated to exports was just below 3 million in 2011 (of which 1 million are the
             direct jobs) from just above 3 million in 2004.

             This trend has translated into a reduction of the jobs contained in exports both directly and total (Figure 4).
             South Africa moved from having 22 jobs per $ million exports in 2004 to around 17 in 2011. While this is a
             sizable reduction, it is less dramatic than most other comparator countries. This generalized decrease in the
             number of jobs in exports is consistent with labor saving technological changes across developing countries.

             Despite this smaller drop in jobs content, South Africa remains one of the middle income countries in the
             sample with the lowest number of jobs associated with exports. That is partly a composition effect as South
             African exports are dominated by capital intensive mining sector. We will control for this effect in the analysis
             below by comparing similar sectors across countries.

On the other hand South Africa has a higher share of jobs contained in exports in total employment than any
other comparator countries barred Thailand (
Figure 5). That is despite the reduction in this share. While in 2004 more than 1 in 4 jobs was directly or
indirectly associated with exports, by 2011 this ratio declined to just above 1 in 5 jobs (
Figure 5).

What sectors explain these results? Figure 6 shows that in 2011 the leading export sectors in terms of labor
content were minerals, metals, machinery and ferrous metals. With over $ 6 billion minerals is by far the
largest contributor to wages among export sectors, reflecting the large value of gross exports and a relatively
high labor content in exports (more on this below). However the other main sectors all have a higher share
of labor content explained by domestic backward linkages than the mineral sector, suggesting higher extent
of interconnectedness with domestic suppliers. For example around three quarter of the total labor
contained in exports of machinery and equipment is due to labor used in domestic suppliers of this sector.
In the case of minerals that share is less than one third.




                                                                                                             6
Figure 6 also shows how the labor intensity of exports varies also across both directly and indirectly. For
example each $100 of wearing apparel exports generates $43 of wages, of which $18 go the workers directly
producing these services. At the lower end of the spectrum $100 of metal exports generate only $21 in labor
value added, split equally between direct and indirect content.

In Figure 8 we split the total labor content of exports for 2011 into skilled and unskilled labor. While the
unskilled component is larger in most sectors, there is some cross-sectoral variation. In public administration,
defense, health and education and in other private services exports the split is even or almost even (either
when considering total value added computed through the backward or forward linkages method). At the
other extreme agriculture, forestry and fishing have the lowest shares of skilled labor contained in total
exports.

Figure 7 shows the counterpart of these numbers, i.e. how much the labor in each sector is used by the other
exporting sectors (i.e. the forward linkages). The picture is very different here, highlighting an asymmetry
that is typical of many economies. The services sectors, while being relatively small contributors to the direct
labor content of exports, are the most important contributor of labor to exports when accounting also for
the forward linkages. Trade and transport services as well as other private services pay for over $8 and $7
billion in wages mostly for supplying services to export sectors. On the other hand labor in neither minerals
nor metals is employed to produce inputs for other exporting sectors suggesting very limited downstream
connectivity with the rest of the economy. Perhaps surprising also labor in machinery and equipment is not
involved in the production to supply other exporting sectors. The majority of its wages are paid to employees
producing equipment to be directly exported.

In Figure 8 we split the total labor content of exports for 2011 into skilled and unskilled labor.3 While the
unskilled component is larger in most sectors, there is some cross-sectoral variation. In public administration,
defense, health and education and in other private services exports the split is even or almost even (either
when considering total value added computed through the backward or forward linkages method). At the
other extreme agriculture, forestry and fishing have the lowest shares of skilled labor contained in total
exports.

3   We use 2007 as the split for 2011 is not compatible with previous years.

                                                                                                              8
Figure 9 shows how these sectoral numbers compare to other comparators. In general South Africa has a
lower share of labor in exports than its BRIC comparators (first panel), while it has a generally higher share
across sectors relative to the other comparator countries. In Figure 10 we show this comparison across all
countries for the 3 largest South African exporters for 2001 and 2011. In machinery and equipment, South
Africa’s labor content as a share of exports declined relative to the average in the other countries, although
it remains still slightly above the level expected given its income per capita. In metals the country has moved
from being above to being below the expected share of labor share in export and in 2011 it was also below
most comparator countries. In minerals on the other hand South Africa’s position has improved and by 2011
it had the highest share of labor in exports among the comparator countries.

Finally Figure 11 shows the number of direct and indirect jobs in exports for the macro sectors of the
economy in 2011. Manufacturing dominates the ranking with almost two third of the jobs associated with
exports, the vast majority of them in sectors providing inputs to it.

As noted above, the low labor content of exports in South Africa relatively to other comparator countries
may be due to a composition effect. To check that, we compare a number of narrowly defined sectors across
countries. In particular we focus on the main Global Value Chain-oriented sectors in the country, i.e. wearing
apparel and motor vehicles, other food and electronic equipment (Figure 12). The labor contained in South
African exports of wearing apparel has increased only slightly over the 2000s, the product of a substantial
increase in the indirect content and a decrease in the direct content of exports. The increase brings South
African total content of exports ahead of most other comparator countries. In 2011 only Brazil and China
had a higher content. The direct labor content drives the large total content in Brazil apparel exports, while
it is the indirect content behind China’s labor intensity.

Not surprisingly the labor content is generally lower in motor vehicles exports. South Africa has experienced
a decrease between 2001 and 2011, when just below $30 of labor was contained in $100 of motor vehicle
exports. This figure is well below that of Brazil, China, where the labor content has increased and India, where
it has remained stable. The drop in South Africa is entirely explained by the direct content of exports, which
more than halved in a decade.

A similar picture applies to the ‘other food’ sector, where the labor value added in South African exports has
slightly declined in 2001-2011 and it lags behind Brazil, China and India. While most of the value added is
indirect across countries, most comparator countries have a higher indirect content per $100 of exports than
South Africa.

Finally the labor contained in electronic equipment exports has dropped substantially in South Africa
between 2001 and 2011, with a dramatic drop in the direct content and an increase in indirect content.
Despite this drop South African labor content of electronic exports remain relatively high and behind only
Peru and Brazil.

This analysis suggests that the relatively low labor content of South African exports seems to be due not only
to a composition effect, but also to a generally low use of domestic labor in production.

In
Figure 13, we replicate the same graphs but with the skilled-unskilled instead of the direct-indirect split. The
share of skilled workers appears to be generally higher in South Africa than in most other comparators in all
4 sectors except motor vehicles. However this share is somewhat declined in electronic exports, while it has
increased in wearing apparel.

          3. Botswana
          We first focus on the total labor value added contained in exports, i.e. the wages paid to produce the exports
          directly as well as the wages paid to produce the domestic inputs used by the exports. Our data shows that
          this has been increasing in the late 1990s through 2001 but it has grown very little since then, hovering
          around US$ 1.5 billion (Figure 14).4 Most of this evolution is determined by that of the direct labor value
          added in exports (the wages to directly produce the exported goods), which now comprise over 90% of the
          total labor value added. This suggests that backward linkages are very weak in Botswana.

          This growth through peaks and troughs is accentuated when looking at the evolution of the share of total
          labor content in gross exports (Figure 15). At the end of the 1990s it grew rapidly to reach 43% in 2001 (i.e.
          each $ 100 of exports generate $43 in domestic wages), the highest share among the set of comparator
          middle-income countries that we use.5 The labor share in gross exports eventually declined equally rapidly
          and by 2011 it was at 23%, the lowest share among all comparator countries but Costa Rica. Table A1 at the
          end reports also the split of the total labor value added by skilled and unskilled labor. The latter dominates
          in the set of countries we consider to a larger extent than in the rest of the world for which we have data.
          That is unsurprising as the coverage of countries in the dataset is skewed against low income countries, thus
          middle income countries are at the lower end of the income distribution in this sample. Botswana has a
          lower skilled share in labor value added of exports vis-à-vis all the comparator countries except Namibia.

          The growth in the total labor value added in exports is considerably less sustained than the overall growth
          in labor value added (Figure 16). Thus the share of labor value added explained by exports has been declining
          especially since 2001.




          4 The CAGR between 1997 and 2011 for direct VA is: 13.25 percent. The CAGR between 1997 and 2011 for total VA is: 11.96 percent.
          The CAGR between 2001 and 2011 for direct VA is: 2.12 percent. The CAGR between 2001 and 2011 for total VA is: -0.15 percent.
          5 This includes South Africa, Namibia, Chile, Costa Rica, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Mauritius.

 What sectors drive these results? Figure 17 shows that in 2011 the leading export sectors in terms of total
 labor content (computed on the basis of the direct content and backward linkages) were minerals and metals
 (at around US$ 370 million). While they both have a similar total labor value added in exports, minerals
 stimulate a larger labor value added among domestic suppliers. Metals have virtually no domestic backward
 linkages. The third largest contributor to labor content in export is manufacturing, with half of its
 contribution coming from backward linkages. This makes manufacturing a more important sector in terms
 of overall labor value added in exports despite having smaller direct labor content of exports than private
 services exports.




                                                                                                              15
Figure 17 also shows that the labor intensity of exports varies also across sectors both directly and indirectly.
Each $100 of paper product exports generate close to $45 of labor value added.6 At the other end of the
spectrum minerals generate very little value added, less than $10 every $100 of exports. The median and
average value of labor share in export across export sectors are around 40%. That is well below the overall
share of labor in exports in 2011 (23%) as that is brought down by the low share of the largest export, i.e.
minerals.

In Figure 18 we re-compute the total labor value added in exports on the basis of forward linkages, i.e. how
much labor in each sector is utilized in its own export and of those of other sectors. Metals and minerals are
again the largest contributors due to their relatively large direct labor content. However they are virtually
not used by other domestic exporters. Their entire production is just exported. On the other hand around
half of the labor value added of services, both other private and trade and transport, is contained in other
sectors’ exports (i.e. close to $ 100 million each).

Next in Figure 19 we show the split in skilled and unskilled labor. While unskilled labor dominates in all
sectors, the share of skilled labor in other private services is larger than that in the other sectors. Among the
large exporters, metals and minerals have similar split.




6   The large labor contained in metals is most likely due to an error in the data.

Figure 20 and Figure 21 show how these sectoral numbers compare to other countries. The first thing to
notice in Figure 20 is that Botswana has the lowest total labor value added per dollar of mineral exports.
That is partly due to the very low backward linkages of the sector relative to the other countries (Figure 21).
On the other hand manufacturing in Botswana has a larger domestic labor content in exports than all other
countries but Kazakhstan, and it has also the largest labor content in textiles, leather products and metals.
However by and large the total over the direct labor content of exports (an indication of the relative
importance of the backward linkages) in Botswana is lower than its comparators. This suggests little
interconnectedness between the exporters and the rest of the economy in all sectors.

Appendix 1 – calculating direct and indirect value added in exports
This section illustrates how to generate the (direct and indirect) value added associated with each sector-
country from Input-Output tables in GTAP (based on Francois et al., 2013). That forms the basis for the
computation of the compensation of employees. We begin by denoting a representation of intermediate
and final demands as follows:

Y = Z - AZ                        (1)

where the term Y denotes a final demand vector, Z denotes a gross output vector, and A denotes a matrix
of intermediate use coefficients. Equation (1) therefore defines final output with respect to intermediate
input requirements.

With some manipulation we arrive at the Leontief inverse matrix, also known as the multiplier matrix M.

Z = (I - A)-1 Y = MY              (2)

The multiplier matrix M measures the inputs contained in a unit of final output. If one assigns the sector
indexes i,j to the A and M matrices, then a representative element of the M matrix Mij gives the direct and
indirect inputs (and thus the sector i receipts) linked to each unit (for example each dollar) of sector j receipts
in the data. This implies real production activities measured by value of output. For our purposes, it provides
a means to trace, through these income flows, the flow of gross activity and value added from intermediate
to final goods and services, ostensibly across borders as well as sectors. Because linkages will vary by
industry, each industry will be characterized by different multipliers.

To focus on value added, we note first that in terms of gross output values Z, some share of this involves
value added within each sector. We define ̂ as the diagonal matrix indexed over i, j with diagonal elements
equal to the value added shares of output Z. We then use M to provide a breakdown of the flow of value
added across activities in the form of the matrix V.

Similar to the Leontief inverse matrix itself, the V matrix identifies the inputs of value added in each sector
related to a unit of final demand. If we multiply V by the diagonal matrix ̂ whose non-zero elements are the
vector of final outputs, the matrix yields a breakdown of economy-wide value added (the primary
component of Gross National Product on a source basis). Similarly, if we multiply V by the diagonal matrix  ̂
whose non-zero elements are the national export vector, we can recover the value added content of exports
X (both direct and indirect).

The G matrix and the H matrix give us the set of linkages, both direct and indirect, between value added
across sectors. We are interested in the compensation of employees’ part of the value added, which forms
the basis of the computation of LACEX.

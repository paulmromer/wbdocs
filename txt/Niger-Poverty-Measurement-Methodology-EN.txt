1.      Accurately measuring poverty and assessing trends in its incidence and severity are among
the most fundamental challenges in economic development. Without a credible means to monitor
poverty dynamics, the effectiveness of policies and programs cannot be reliably determined, and the
impact of both the government’s antipoverty strategies and the efforts of international agencies cannot be
gauged. The need for precise poverty measurement is most urgent in the world’s least -developed
countries, where poverty is pervasive, frequently extreme and driven by a constellation of interrelated
causes, yet in these countries accurate data on consumption and income are frequently limited or
inconsistent. Overcoming data limitations and reinforcing the validity of poverty statistics is fundamental
to achieving the objectives of both national policymakers and international development institutions.

2.      The issue of effective poverty measurement has been the subject of renewed interest since
the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. This ambitious and
widely influential set of targets included cutting poverty rates to half their 1990 levels by 2015. Niger
embraced this priority, developing and implementing two poverty reduction strategies during the 2000s.
The government’s recently adopted third strategy, the Economic and Social Development Plan
(Programme de Développement Economique et Social – PDES) focuses on five key areas, including at
least two that contribute directly to reducing poverty in a sustainable manner: (i) reinforcing food security
and accelerating agricultural development, and (ii) fostering a growth-oriented, private-sector-led
economy (Ministry of Planning, 2012). Assessing both progress toward the achievement of the MDGs’
headline antipoverty target or the effect of the government’s economic development strategies will
require careful monitoring of poverty indicators. However, doing so requires overcoming considerable
methodological obstacles.

3.       In Niger, as in many comparable countries worldwide, poverty data are collected through
household surveys of consumption patterns and living conditions. These data are then subjected to
statistical and econometric analysis in order to design an appropriate welfare indicator and a poverty line
or lines, which reflect a definition of poverty that is both locally suitable and internationally comparable.
Over the past two decades there have been major methodological breakthroughs on the analytical side.
Ravallion (1996) and Deaton & Zaidi (2002) have refined techniques for designing the welfare indicator
by proposing elegant solutions to delicate issues, such as the treatment of durable goods and local
differences in the cost of living, among others. Ravallion (1998) proposed a new and more robust method
for developing the poverty line known as the basic needs approach. This largely supplanted the nutritional
intake method, formerly the most common tool for determining poverty lines. Meanwhile, the survey
methodology used to collect consumption data has also been revised and improved, albeit more gradually.
In poverty measurement it is critical to bear in mind that both the survey methodology used for collecting
data and the analytical techniques through which those data are analyzed can have an equally profound
impact on the observed distribution of welfare and the estimation of poverty indicators (Lanjouw &
Lanjouw, 2001; Tarozzi, 2004).

4.       A number of methodological factors can affect the accuracy of consumption data during the
collection phase, especially the number of survey visits, the time of year during which the
                                                     5
questionnaire is administered, the recall period, and the composition of the consumption basket
defined in the survey. One particularly important issue is whether consumption information is collected
through the use of a diary or relies solely on the respondent’s memory. This involves a fairly clear
tradeoff between the cost of the survey and the reliability of the data; in general, the diary approach will
tend to be more accurate than the memory approach, though the diary also has its drawbacks.1 However,
the diary approach will also be more costly to implement. This tradeoff is magnified by the length of the
recall period (the span of time during which the respondent is asked to record or remember his or her
consumption). Ceteris paribus, longer recall periods will tend to yield more robust results, as the impact
of temporary consumption shocks will be diminished over a longer timeframe. However, asking
respondents to recall their consumption patterns over a longer period presents a risk to the accuracy of the
data, as it is more difficult for individuals to remember more distant events, especially routine matters like
the consumption of basic foodstuffs (Deaton & Grosh, 2000; Deaton, 2001).

5.       The timing of data collection may also influence the results of consumption surveys. This is
especially likely in a country where the economy is dominated by the agricultural sector. The
international experience has shown that consumption among the poor tends to be highest immediately
after the harvest season and then declines steadily until the next harvest. A nationwide study in Tanzania
(Beegle et al. 2010) compared eight different data-collection methods for household consumption,
including different recall periods, and highlighted the major differences in observed consumption
attributable to different methodologies. Demographic characteristics such as the education level of the
head-of-household may also impact the results, as the study’s findings revealed a particularly significant
underestimation of consumption in households with illiterate household heads. Finally, the composition
of the consumption basket used in the survey and the way different items are defined and recorded can
greatly impact the observed distribution. A recent analysis of household surveys in Mozambique (Alfani
et al. 2012) showed that relatively minor changes in the list of items included in the survey significantly
skewed the distribution of consumption, with particularly distortive effects on observed differences
between urban and rural households.

6.      Because of the influence that methodology exerts over the results of household consumption
surveys, methodological changes from one survey to the next can profoundly compromise the
measurement of poverty trends over time. Between 2005 and 2011 Niger conducted three national
household surveys designed to measure poverty levels, identify vulnerable populations and compile data
with which to assess the effectiveness of government policies. The first survey was carried out in 2005; it
indicated a national poverty rate of 62.1 percent (INS, 2005). The findings of this survey helped to
provide the analytical framework for an important revision of the national poverty reduction strategy in
2007. The second survey, conducted from 2007 to 2008, showed a modest decline in the poverty rate to
59.5 percent (INS, 2008). However, the third survey, conducted in 2011, gave a national poverty rate of

1
  In household consumption surveys conducted in Canada using the daily collection method, McWhinney &
Champion (1974) noted that consumption expenses were 8.3% higher, on average, during the first week of the
month than they were during the second. More recently, in a national survey conducted in Papua New Guinea daily
over a period of two weeks, Gibson (2012) showed that the volume of transactions dropped by an average of 3%
each day, and consequently the volume of transactions on the fourteenth day was just 62% of the first day, while
average spending on the last day was just 54% of that of the first day. Both studies surmised that the effect was due
to respondents spending a large share of wages and transfers immediately after receiving them, then moderating
their spending as their available cash diminished.

                                                         6
just 48.2 percent—suggesting that poverty fell by a remarkable 11 percentage points between 2008 and
2011. Yet this period was characterized by slow economic growth, and no alternative explanations for a
precipitous drop in poverty rates are readily apparent. As the same analytical techniques were used to
compute poverty lines based on the survey data, the dramatic change in the poverty rate suggests that
issues with the survey data itself may have contributed to some of the observed variation. Significant
changes in several major areas of the survey methodology may help to explain the apparent decline in
poverty rates.

7.      The methodology for collecting data on food consumption differed in each of Niger’s three
most recent surveys. The method of collection, period of reference, number of visits to households and
the number of tours for each visit all changed between 2005, 2007/08 and 2011. The 2007/08 survey
collected data over 7 consecutive days, whereas the 2005 and 2011 surveys relied on retrospective
interviews, asking respondents to recall their past food consumption. Moreover, the 2005 survey used a
12-month baseline period, whereas the baseline for the 2011 survey was just one week. Interviewers made
one visit to each respondent during the 2005 and 2007/08 surveys, whereas two visits were made during
the 2011 survey—one during the planting season and one during harvesting.

8.       In addition, the length and timing of data collection differed over each survey period. In
2005 data collection lasted 3 months (April-July 2005). But data collection in 2007/08 took a full year
(April 2007-April 2008). The 2011 survey took place over a period of 4 months, but in two separate
periods (July-September and November-December 2011). Finally, no data on prices were collected for
the 2005 and 2007/08 surveys, and the ageing of the sampling frame has diminished sampling quality in
all surveys.

9.      The purpose of this paper is to produce a robust analysis of poverty trends in Niger from
2005 to 2011 by using the 2011 survey as the basis for monitoring poverty and correcting for
methodological differences in earlier surveys. In order to make the survey data comparable across time,
this study will make backward revisions in national poverty estimates. This technique has been
successfully used in a number of other countries to address the issue of data comparability. In India the
poverty trends presented by the National Statistics Office at the beginning of the 1990s were challenged
by contradictory research findings, which eventually obliged the Office to revise its figures (Deaton,
2002; Deaton and Drèze, 2003; Tarozzi, 2004). Following a national survey in 2011 Senegal revised the
poverty figures from its 2006 and 2001 surveys (ANSD, 2012). In response to concerns regarding official
poverty statistics in Mozambique the World Bank produced a similar study revealing methodological
differences in data collection and presenting alternate poverty trends based on revised data (Alfani et al.,
2012). In Niger itself the World Bank’s 2011 poverty assessment revised the poverty estimates for 2005
and 2007/08 to make them more comparable with one another (World Bank, 2011), and this study builds
on those efforts.

10.     The decision to use the 2011 survey as the basis for establishing methodological consistency
is rooted in two factors. First, the large variations in poverty estimates obtained in different survey
periods are suspected to be due in part to changes in the survey methodology. Consequently, revisions are
required in order to establish reliable poverty trends. Second, the 2011 survey coincided with the adoption
of Niger’s current growth and poverty reduction strategy, the PDES. The indicators developed from the

                                                     7
2011 survey serve as a baseline for monitoring economic performance during the implementation of the
PDES. It is therefore critical that future surveys be based on the same methodology in order to preserve
comparability. Moreover, this methodology will be replicated in 2014, when a panel survey of the same
sample households will be conducted to assess further changes in poverty dynamics.

11.     The following section describes the 2011 survey methodology and the techniques used to
make the previous figures compatible with this methodology. The next section presents the revised
poverty figures and discusses their implications. The final section offers conclusions and
recommendations. In addition, it should be noted that while this study concentrates on methodological
issues, a more policy-focused analysis of trends in poverty, inequality and related dynamics is being
prepared concurrently based on the revised figures presented here.




12.     Measuring poverty levels and assessing trends over time require three tools. The first is a
household welfare indicator, which sums the aggregate consumption of a household, allowing it to be
compared with that of other households. The second is a poverty line, a threshold for the welfare indicator
below which a household is considered poor. The third are poverty indicators, statistical tools used for
determining the welfare level of each household and relating it to the poverty line. To obtain consistent
poverty indicators across different regions and time periods, the welfare indicator and poverty line must
be similar across the different surveys. Together, these factors are determined by the type and quality of
data produced by the survey process.

13.      Since 2005 three household surveys have been conducted by Niger’s National Institute of
Statistics (Institut National de la Statistique – INS). These were the 2005 Core Welfare Indicator
Questionnaire (Questionnaire des Indicateurs de Base du Bien-être – QUIBB), the 2007/08 National
Survey on Household Budgets and Consumption (Enquête Nationale sur le Budget et la Consommation
des Ménages – ENBC) and the 2011 National Survey on Household Living Conditions and Agriculture
(Enquête Nationale sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages et l’Agriculture – ECVMA). These surveys
covered 6690, 4000 and 3859 households, respectively. They were designed to collect similar types of
information, including the social and demographic characteristics of the household, the health, education
and employment status of its members, the physical characteristics of the house itself, the economic
activities of household members, their access to basic infrastructure, and their aggregate income and
consumption patterns. However, the three surveys differed significantly in terms of collection
methodology.

14.      The method used for comparing the results of these surveys over time involves two phases.
First, as the 2011 ECVMA is to be used as the new basis for measuring poverty, a welfare indicator and a
poverty line must be designed for 2011, and the 2011 poverty indicators are taken directly from the
survey. Second, re-estimations based on the 2011 model are applied to the 2007/08 and 2005 surveys.
This technique, called survey-to-survey imputation, was originally designed to estimate poverty indicators
in a country’s smallest administrative area, which in Niger is the local division or “canton?. The purpose

                                                    8
of this is to draw-up precise poverty maps that can illustrate the geographic distribution of poverty
indicators. In cases where poverty indicators are difficult to compare over time—for example, due to
changes in survey methodology—the technique can also be used to reestablish comparability
(Christiaensen et al., 2012).




15.      The welfare indicator is the key measure used to determine the overall wellbeing of each
surveyed household. It is typically determined by the household’s aggregate income or consumption
level. In this case the welfare indicator is per capita household consumption, the total consumption of the
household divided by the number of household members.2 Once per capita household consumption is
determined, it is standardized via a spatial deflator that takes into account differences in cost of living
from one area to another. These differences in basic living costs arise from variations in local food and
non-food prices, as well as transportation and other transaction costs that broadly influence consumer
prices.

16.     The 2011 ECVMA data were collected in two visits. The first was conducted from mid-July to
mid-September 2011, during the sowing and farm maintenance season; a second visit was then made in
November and December, during the harvest season. Three questionnaires were designed for each visit. A
“household questionnaire? was administered during the first visit, which focused on gathering basic
demographic information, as well as data on food consumption over the previous 7 days and non-food
consumption over the previous 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, depending on the
expected frequency with which household purchase different types of goods. An “agriculture
questionnaire? collected data on farming households, including access to land, types of crops grown, and
labor, equipment and other inputs used in production. Finally, a “community questionnaire? assessed
households’ access to basic facilities and consumer prices at local markets.

17.     The household questionnaire for the second visit was shorter than the first. It collected
demographic data on individuals who had joined the household since the first visit, and it assessed the
household’s food and non-food consumption over the previous 7 and 30 days, respectively. The second-
visit agriculture questionnaire focused on assessing the harvest and sale of farm produce, as well as
development in livestock ownership. Finally, the second-visit community questionnaire solely addressed
consumer prices.

18.     The consumption aggregate is designed to cover both food and non-food expenditures. Food
spending includes food purchased, food consumed from the household’s own production, and food
received as gifts, donations, or in-kind payment. Non-food spending includes non-durable consumer

2
  An income aggregate may also be used as a welfare indicator. For a discussion of the advantages and
disadvantages of different indicator types, see Deaton A. (2001).

                                                    9
goods and services, rent paid by tenants or imputed rent for owners, and an estimated utilization value for
durable goods. The consumption aggregate accounts for the unique specificities of the survey, and gives
proper consideration to items for which consumption data was collected during each of the two visits.

19.      During each visit, food-consumption data were collected retrospectively for the previous 7
days and then standardized according to a predetermined statistical procedure. The figures were
annualized by multiplying the data from each visit by the ratio 182.5/7. Due to regular seasonal
fluctuations food prices changed significantly between the two visits; to account for changing prices the
country was divided into 5 agro-ecological zones: (i) the capital city of Niamey, (ii) all other urban areas,
(iii) the farming-only rural zone, (iv) the combined farming-pastoralism rural zone, and (v) the
pastoralism-only rural zone. A price index measuring changes between July/September and
November/December was compiled for each region.3 The food-consumption aggregate from the second
visit was divided by this price index prior and then combined with the data from the first visit. By opting
to apply this temporal deflator to the consumption aggregate from the second visit, the collection period
of the first visit is implicitly retained as the baseline period of the survey.

20.     Determining the annual consumption of non-durable consumer goods and services involved
a less complicated process. This figure was obtained by multiplying the consumption observed by the
observation frequency, and prices were assumed to remain constant over the year. When consumption of
the same item was recorded during both visits, each visit was assumed to account for half the year.

21.     Housing was considered a capital good, and housing consumption was gauged according to
the housing unit’s market value as a rental property. In other words, an owner-occupied house was
regarded as providing a consumption value equal to its estimated rental price. The estimated rent was
determined based on a linear regression for non-home-owning households, with the dependent variable
being the logarithm of the rent amount and the independent variable being the characteristics of the
housing unit and the dichotomous variables of the region and place of residence.

22.      A different method was used to value the consumption of durable goods, such as means of
transportation, mechanical appliances, and furniture and other household items. Because durable
goods are purchased irregularly and typically last for several years, their use value of was estimated based
on the stock of goods inventoried in each household, their age, their acquisition price, and their
replacement price. A depreciation rate based on these factors was used to determine the annual value of
durable goods at the household level.

23.      Once the consumption aggregate for each household had been estimated it was divided by
the number of household members to yield consumption per capita. Finally consumption per capita
was standardized across different regions through the use of a spatial deflator for cost of living. The
spatial deflator was calculated by using the Niamey poverty line as the national benchmark, then fixing
the ratio of the poverty line for the agro-ecological zone to that of Niamey as the deflator. As a result, the
determination of these regional poverty lines is crucial to the validity of the assessment.


3
  The index is 1.060 for Niamey, 1.009 for the rest of the urban zone, 0.954 for the rural agricultural zone, 0.954 for
the rural agro-pastoral zone, and 1.075 for the rural pastoral zone.

                                                          10
24.     The poverty line is a fixed level of consumption below which a household is classified as
poor. The poverty line typically attempts to reflect the cost of satisfying an individual’s basic needs
(Ravallion, 1998). The first step in the “cost-of-basic-needs? approach is to determine a food-poverty line
equivalent to a minimum daily calorie intake and a second nonfood-poverty line for satisfying essential
nonfood needs such as clothing and shelter.

25.      In 2005 the food-poverty line was determined based on an international standard of 2400
calories per person per day; the same benchmark is used in the present analysis. There is no
common standard for determining the nonfood-poverty line, but Ravallion (1998) bases the construction
of a cost-of-basic-needs nonfood-poverty line on the premise that barely satisfying basic nonfood
consumption needs requires food-consumption sacrifices. The nonfood-poverty line can therefore be
established as the value of nonfood consumption per capita by households in which total per capita
consumption is just equal to the food-poverty line. This is used to represent the lower bound of the
nonfood-poverty line. An upper bound can be calculated by taking the value of nonfood consumption by
households for which food per capita consumption is just equal the food-poverty line. The latter is used in
the present analysis.

26.      At this point an important decision must be made as to whether to establish a single
national poverty line, or to use different lines for different regions or different location types. On the
one hand, a single poverty line has the advantage of simplicity and can facilitate information-sharing
between various organizations and agencies working on poverty-related issues. On the other hand,
multiple poverty lines could more accurately reflect local conditions, yielding a more precise national
estimate as well as more useful local definitions. The conventional solution would be to design several
poverty lines divided by region or location type, but also retain a single benchmark poverty line; the ratio
between each local poverty line and the national benchmark poverty line could then be used as the
deflator of the consumption aggregate.

27.      Niger is a vast country with limited transportation infrastructure; the high costs involved in
shipping goods from one places to another generates considerable variation in local prices. High
transaction costs can greatly increase consumer prices in areas far from a good’s production center or
importation point. These gaps are usually widest between the urban and the rural areas, but differences
between regions are also common. For example, in regions where pastoralism is common and farming is
rare, prices for meat and dairy products tend to be relatively low compared to vegetables and grains, while
in areas dominated by farming vegetables and grains, these items tend to be relatively inexpensive
compared to meat and dairy. The ideal solution would have been to set poverty lines for each region
divided by rural and urban location. However, for statistical estimates to be robust, a sufficient number of
observations are needed, and this level of geographic disaggregation would result in excessively small
sample sizes. In an effort to achieve a useful degree of regional specificity while retaining valid samples,
a single poverty line is used for each of the 5 agro-ecological zones described above.

28.      The design of the poverty lines is based on the foodstuff baskets used in the 2011 ECVMA
survey. A basket of 25 foodstuffs was used in the first visit, and a basket of 27 was used in the second
visit; together, these accounted for close to 90 percent of household food consumption (see Error!
Reference source not found.). These baskets were constructed based on national average consumption
and allow for the establishment of different poverty lines based solely on differences in cost of living. The
basket, which was originally set at roughly 2200 kilocalories, is adjusted to cover 2400 kilocalories.
Prices are based on the averages obtained from the price module of the survey combined with the average
unit values used in the consumption module of the survey. This technique allows for food-poverty lines to
be set for each of the two visits. The simple arithmetic mean of both poverty lines determines the final
poverty line for each agro-ecological zone.

29.      The nonfood-poverty line is obtained using the cost-of-basic-needs method described above.
The econometric model below is an Engel function of food demand for which the dependent variable is
the share of food consumption in overall consumption, and the independent variables are, respectively,
the ratio of the household per capita consumption logarithm to the food-poverty line and its square.

30.     A minimum poverty line is obtained using the formula: Zinf=ZA*(2-?), and an
approximation of the maximum threshold obtained using Zsup=ZA/(?+? )/(1+? ). The maximum
poverty line is retained.


31.     A single national poverty line is useful for facilitating dialogue and coordinating antipoverty
policies and programs, and the Niamey threshold is most appropriate to serve as a national poverty
line. Consequently, poverty comparisons are performed by relating the consumption aggregate for each
household to the cost of living in Niamey. This means dividing the aggregate per capita consumption by
the deflator, calculated as the ratio of the poverty line for each agro-ecological zone to the Niamey
poverty line.

The 2005 And 2007/08 Methodologies

32.     The INS and the World Bank analyzed Niger’s 2005 and 2007/08 surveys. These studies,
World Bank (2006) and INS (2008), provided important conclusions that were highly useful at the time,
but as noted in the introduction their findings are not comparable with those obtained in the 2011 survey.
Instead of recalculating the poverty line, as proposed above, one could obtain poverty trends by simply
updating the 2007/08 threshold using the consumption price index. However, this approach yields a
poverty rate of roughly 45 percent, which is unrealistic given Niger’s recent economic performance, and
the observed trend would in fact be the result of differences in methodology rather than evidence of a
substantial decline in poverty. It is therefore necessary to adjust the 2005 and 2007/08 estimates to obtain
a coherent picture of poverty trends over the entire period. This adjustment is performed in two phases, as
described above, to recalculate welfare indicators for 2005 and 2007/08 and establish a revised set of
poverty lines that allow for valid comparisons between surveys.




33.     To achieve comparability with the 2011 poverty estimates the indicators for 2005 and
2007/08 must be revised. Christiaensen et al. (2012) propose a methodology derived from the work of
Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2002, 2003) for creating poverty maps from revised estimates. Himelein
(2014) applied this survey-to-survey imputation methodology to predict 2011 poverty number in

                                                     14
Cameroon using the 2011 DHS survey and the 2007 and 2001 poverty surveys. On this paper, we follow
Himelein methodology which is described below. The procedure involves using an econometric model
based on data from the benchmark survey—in this case the 2011 survey—to assign a welfare indicator to
the previous 2005 and 2007/08 surveys. The new welfare indicator is then used to determine poverty
trends in place of the consumption aggregate obtained directly from the survey.

34.     This process involves three phases. The first is to establish a set of variables common to all
three surveys and bearing the same definition. The potential independent variables includes geographic
location (rural/urban location, region, etc.); demographic characteristics of the household and its head
(household size, number of rooms per person in the house, gender and marital status of household head,
etc.); household human capital (education levels, employment status, formal/informal sector, etc.);
housing quality (electricity, running water, etc.). Those variables are grouped into categories (see the list
of variables on the annex A3).

35.      The second step consists on building the model. The basic model is estimated for 2011; it is a
regression for log per capita consumption with independent variables common to all three surveys on the
right-hand side. In order to define a parsimonious model, variables are included group by group and then
tested4. If a group of variables is jointly significant at the 95 percent level, this group remains in the
model. Groups which are not are removed from the model. Following the joint significance tests,
individual variables are subject to the same procedure. At the end of the process, the explanatory variables
of the model are those having a statistically significant relationship with log per capita consumption.
There is an issue to estimate the model at the national level, at the urban rural/level or at the regional
level. The last solution is excluded because the sample of the 2011 survey was not designed to produce
poverty indicators at the regional level. The national model performs well, with R-square equal 0.586
(The results of the models are shown in Table A1, in the annex). The urban model is even better (R-
square equal 0.755) and we might be tempted to use the urban/rural model. But the prediction of poverty
indicators using this model shows huge poverty decline, likely because the model is less stable due to
some variables like mobile phone which has seen big changes. For this reason, we use the national model,
but we do imputation in each area of residence.

36.      The third step is to validate the model and predict the welfare indicator. The imputation is
done in Stata using the ‘‘multiple imputation’’ commands with the predictive means matching options
which performs well. Himelein (2014) states that to more accurately approximate the variance of the
distribution, the ‘‘multiple imputation’’ procedure requires a number of imputations to be added to the
model and that the usual is to use ten, which we follow. The model needs to be validated before being
used for poverty analysis. This validation is done by assessing the predictive performance of the model.
For validation, the sample is randomly split into two sub-samples, the first one with even household id,
and the second one with uneven household id5. The model is applied to the first sub-sample and
imputation done on the second sub-sample and then we do the reverse. The poverty headcount for the
overall sample is 48.2 percent in 2011. When calculating this indicator in each of the two sub-samples, we
get 48.7 and 47.8 respectively for sub-samples one and two. The estimated value of sub-sample two when

  During the survey, households were numbered in each urban PSU from 1 to 12 and in each rural PSU from 1 to 18.

applying the model in sub-sample one is 51 percent, with a standard error of 2.77. The confidence interval
of this estimation encompasses both the poverty headcount computed for the overall sample and the real
value of sub-sample two, which it is estimating. By applying the model on sub-sample two gives even
more precise result. What is true for poverty headcount works for the other poverty indicators, namely the
poverty gap and the squared poverty gap (see Table A2 in annex).




37.     There is a need to construct specific poverty lines for 2005 and 2007/08 if the welfare
indicator (per capita annual consumption) is imputed in nominal value. With the methodology used
on this paper, the per capita annual consumption imputed for 2005 and 2007/08 is done in 2011 West
African CFA Francs (CFAF) per capita. So the 2011 poverty line, which stands at 182,635 FCFA is used.

Poverty trends: 2005-2011




38.      Niger is a vast country with a great diversity of livelihoods and economic circumstances. It
borders a number of different countries, including other landlocked Sahelian nations such as Burkina
Faso, Chad and Mali, West African coastal countries like Nigeria and Benin, and North African countries
like Algeria and Libya, all of which maintain economic ties with Niger. As a result, opportunities for a
farmer in the remote Tahoua region, who has limited access to communication and transportation
infrastructure, are more constrained than those of a trader in the southern Diffa region, who can easily
access the booming economy of neighboring Nigeria. This diversity of experience complicates the
analysis of poverty in Niger. This difficulty is compounded by the limited statistical and analytical
capacity of public agencies, and by the fact that reliable data rarely extend back more than a few years.
While this report focuses only on poverty trends from 2005-2011, based on the three household surveys
conducted during the period, understanding the long-term evolution of poverty in Niger would require
evaluating data beginning in the 1990s. However, in the absence of reliable long-term information this
study attempts to develop an accurate picture of Niger’s recent experience with poverty and inequality. It
is hoped that the analysis presented here may be used not only to inform successful antipoverty policies,
but also to promote more effective statistical research techniques in the future.

39.      It is important to emphasize at the outset that individual welfare is primarily assessed
through the annual per capita consumption of the household. This aggregate is obtained directly using
2011 data, which is then compared to estimates from the 2005 and 2007/08 surveys revised according to
the model described in the previous section. The 2011 poverty line is CFAF 182,635, or a consumption
level equivalent to CFAF 500 per person per day. The same poverty line is used for 2005 and 2007/08
since the welfare aggregate imputed for those years are expressed in 2011 value.

40.     Between 2005 and 2011 poverty incidence gradually declined. The share of Nigeriens living
below the poverty line dropped from 53.7 percent in 2005 to 52.6 percent in 2007/08, reaching 48.2 in
2011. If the decrease of poverty between 2005 and 2007/08 is small and not statistically significant, the
decline in poverty on the overall period 2005-2011 is, with the poverty rate falling by just over one

                                                   16
percentage point per year. However, the poverty headcount only tells part of the story. It does not, for
example, measure changes in the depth or severity of poverty. In other words, if the situation of a poor
household improves without the household reaching the poverty line, the poverty rate remains unchanged.
Likewise, when households that are already poor fall into even more desperate circumstances, no impact
is registered on the poverty headcount. Consequently, to develop a more comprehensive picture of
poverty trends is necessary to consider other indicators. Two of the most important are the depth of
poverty, which measures how far the average income of the poor falls below the poverty line, and the
severity of poverty, which measures the degree of consumption inequality among the poor.

41.      Measures of the depth and severity of poverty reveal a more ambiguous trend. Both
indicators are stable between 2005 and 2007/08. This means that while the poverty incidence dropped by
1.1 percentage points during the period, the depth and severity of poverty remain unchanged. In other
words, even as some Nigeriens were escaping poverty, the circumstances of those who remained below
the poverty line tended to become increasingly dire. After 2007/08 the depth and severity trends show
better improvement, with the difference between 2005 and 2011 being statistically significant. A question
that deserves close attention is the extent to which poverty trends between 2007/08 and 2011 are affected
by a poor 2011 farming season. This issue is examined in detail in the next section, but at this point two
observations should be made. First, the 2011 data primarily reflect the outcome of the 2010 farming
season, which was rather good, while the 2011 season has a greater impact on consumption in the
following year, 2012. Secondly, the results cover the entire 2007/08-2011 period, not the last year only.

42.      The combination of a general decline in poverty indicators on the overall period 2005-2011
with conflicting fluctuations in the direction of poverty indicators on the sub-period are cause to
scrutinize the underlying assumptions of the analysis, especially those related to determining the
poverty line. For instance, the poverty line developed from the 2011 survey data was based on the
consumption of 2400 calories per person per day plus nonfood expenditures equivalent to the average
nonfood spending of households in which per capita food consumption was just equal to the food-poverty
line. In order to test the robustness of the results it is necessary to alter these assumptions, one method for



                                                           17
which is the dominance technique for poverty comparisons described in Box 1: The Dominance Technique,
below.
                                       Box 1: The Dominance Technique
This approach consists of establishing distribution functions for per capita consumption for each year. In
the resulting curve per capita consumption is plotted on the y-axis, and the percentage of people living in
households with per capita consumption below that level is plotted on the x-axis. Consequently, once a
poverty line is set on the y-axis, the related poverty rate is obtained on the x-axis. When a curve A is
below a curve B, the poverty levels related to curve A are systematically less than those for curve B, or,
in other words, the distribution of A dominates the distribution of B.

43.     The dominance technique does not confirm the decline in poverty over each sub-period, and
the assumptions on which the poverty line is based clearly influence the observed trend. As shown in
Error! Reference source not found., below, using any poverty line that puts the poverty rate above 50
percent causes the rate to drop consistently in both periods. For poverty lines that produce a rate of less
than 50 percent the curves intersect at several points. In particular, the welfare of the poorest appears to be
higher in 2005 than it is in 2007/08, but there is still a decline between 2007/08 and 2011. This indicates
that the decline in poverty observed over the 2005-2011 happened between the second sub-period
(2007/08-2011) while poverty indicators between 2005 and 2007/08 are very close.

44.    The objective of Niger’s development strategy is not only to decrease the poverty rate, but
also to reduce the absolute number of people living in poverty; unfortunately, while limited
progress has been made on the former objective, rapid population growth continuously undermines

                                                      18
the latter. In 2005 the total population living below the poverty line was estimated at 6.7 million, but
despite the decline in the poverty rate, by 2011 this number had risen to approximately 8 million, a
growth rate of 18.5 percent during a period in which overall population growth was only 13.1 percent.
This steep rise in the number of persons living in poverty is disturbing, and Niger’s extremely high
fertility rate—at 7.6 children per woman in 2011—has major implications for the evolution of poverty.

45.      At its current pace Niger will not be able to achieve its MDG objective of cutting the
poverty rate to half its 1990 level by 2015. As noted above, Niger’s 1990 benchmark poverty rate is 63
percent, determined using the ENBC data from 1989/90 in urban areas and data from 1992/93 in rural
areas. This rate cannot be compared directly with the rates obtained from more recent surveys, due to
differences in methodology. However, when the poverty growth elasticity calculated from recent surveys
is applied to the 1990 data, it yields a poverty rate similar to that observed in 2005. Nevertheless, even if
the original benchmark rate of 63 percent were retained, the target rate for 2015 would be 32 percent;
with an estimated poverty rate of more than 48 percent in 2011 this target is no longer realistic.

46.     Rural-urban poverty dynamics also reveal divergent trends. Poverty rates fell consistently in
both urban and rural areas from 2007/08 to 2011, but between 2005 and 2007/08, the decline has been
more in urban centers while stagnated in rural areas. Rural poverty incidence dropped by a modest 0.3
percentage points in rural areas between 2005 and 2007/08, while urban poverty slid by roughly 7
percentage points. The decline in both areas is nearly 4 percentage points from 2007/08 to 2011. The
reasons for these trends are complex, and the purpose of this study is not to conduct an in-depth
assessment of the issue.6 However, a number of observations are relevant to poverty-measurement
methodology and deserve to be explored in greater detail.

47.      The first element to consider is the erratic performance of Niger’s agricultural sector. In
2011 more than 8 in 10 Nigeriens lived in rural areas, where the vast majority relied primarily on
agriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture represents a quarter of Niger’s economy, and it exerts
enormous influence over employment, income, poverty and general welfare. Due to its geography Niger
suffers from frequent droughts, occurring roughly once every three years over the last decade. Due to the
general absence of irrigation systems fluctuations in rainfall tend to create a succession of good harvests
and poor harvests.

48.      Per capita agricultural production grew by more than 25 percent between 2007 and 2008,
and then dropped by 38 between 2008 and 2009. The sector’s volatility has a deeply negative impact
on poverty, as it leaves rural households persistently vulnerable to adverse shocks. Furthermore, Nigerien
agriculture tends to favor extensive over intensive cultivation. As shown in Error! Reference source not
found., below, even in good years per-hectare yields typically do not improve, and increases in
production require an expansion of farming areas. The World Bank’s latest Niger poverty assessment
(World Bank, 2011) indicates a pressing need to modernize agricultural practices and build rural
infrastructure in order to achieve sustainable, broad-based poverty reduction.

 An analysis of the nature and causes of Niger’s observed poverty trends, and their implications for development
policy, is being prepared and is expected to be published concurrently with the present study.

49.     A second, related cause of persistently high poverty levels is the pervasive lack of economic
diversification. Employment, productivity and exports are overwhelmingly concentrated in subsistence
farming, livestock, and uranium mining. The concentration of economic activity in the primary sector can
be observed in the employment structure recorded in the 2005 and 2011 surveys.7

50.      In 2001 roughly three out of four Nigerien workers were engaged in agriculture as their
permanent occupation. Furthermore, even the agriculture sector itself is undiversified. In other Sahelian
countries (Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso) the cotton industry provides jobs outside of agriculture (ginning,
textile production, etc.); yet this type of value-addition is unusual in Niger, and most agricultural goods
are either consumed or sold as unprocessed commodities. Comparing the employment structures for 2005
and 2011 suggests that the unemployment rate doubles between the farming season and the off season.
Most farmers are underemployed during this period, although some have recourse to other activities,
especially petty trading, which become more popular during the off season.

  Several methodological issues should be noted. In 2005, only the respondent’s current job was recorded (i.e. the
job held during the 7 days prior to the survey visit), but in 2011 the survey instead focused on the respondent’s long -
term job (i.e. the job held during the last 12 months prior to the survey visit). As the 2005 survey was mainly
conducted outside the farming season, this factor accounts for some of the structural differences in employment
sector. Nevertheless, the difference in methodology has the advantage of providing important information on
employment outside of the farming season. The employment module of the 2007/08 survey is not considered in this
study as it is insufficiently comparable to that of the other two surveys.

                                                          20
51.      The employment structure in each professional category highlights the overall shortage of
wage-based employment. In Niger just 1 job in 10 comes with a regular wage or salary. Most workers
are self-employed or work in a family business—most often in the primary sector—in an environment
characterized by limited access to credit and few opportunities for human-capital development. It is
therefore likely that many workers find themselves locked in a self-reinforcing trap of low productivity
and persistent economic insecurity.

52.      Another factor in the evolution of poverty trends could have been rural-urban migration.
The urban population accounted for 16.8 percent of the total population in 2005 and 17.3 percent in
20118. The urban informal sector appears to be attracting a small share of rural workers; though average
incomes in the sector are low, informal employment in the urban economy tends to offer higher and more
consistent returns than agriculture. But a breakdown of poverty trends between 2005 and 2011 shows that
of the roughly 5.4 point decrease in poverty incidence, nearly the total of this decline is an internal decline
in either urban or rural areas, just 0.5 percent of the decline is attributable to rural-urban migration. Rural-
urban migration is also associated with a very small reduction in the depth and severity of poverty
(around 0.8 percent of the total poverty reduction). It is interesting to note that although the rural-urban
migration appears to be negligible in terms of poverty reduction, seasonal migrations, which are also
related to mobility in the labor market can contribute more substantially; but the question is to dig.

  Although the 17.3% rate is correct since the 2011 survey results were aligned to population figures for 2012
directly estimated from the population and housing census (RGPH), those of 2005 are less accurate since the
sampling basis used for the survey (2001 RGPH) was already slightly outdated and the population figures were
aligned to estimates that tended to slightly overestimate the urban population.

                                                                    21
Nonmonetary Poverty Indicators

53.      Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, and income is not the only valid indicator by
which to evaluate it. Although income is a critically important metric, it is far from a comprehensive
measure of welfare. The quality and availability of public goods and services have a major impact on the
living conditions of households, and are especially crucial to the wellbeing of the poor, who tend to rely
most heavily on the effectiveness of the public administration. Housing conditions and asset ownership
are also highly important indicators of relative wealth or poverty, but are not adequately captured by
income level. In addition, in order to ensure the consistency of poverty indicators over time, and identify
threats to the robustness of future analyses, it is important to examine how other dimensions of poverty
evolve.

54.      One methodology for calculating a nonmonetary welfare indicator and associated poverty
line is to determine the aggregate value of durable goods owned by the household and the quality of
its housing. A variable is created for each durable good and housing-quality indicator; this variable is
assigned a value of 1 when the household owns the good and 0 when it does not. Statistical weights are
created for each household, and the welfare indicator is a linear combination of durable-goods-and-
housing-quality variables based on those weights (see Box 2: Methodology for Analyzing Poverty in
Terms of Living Conditions
55.      , below). The present study uses dichotomous variables for ownership of a car, a motorbike, a
bicycle, a television set, a fan, an electric or gas cooker, a DVD player, a refrigerator, a parabolic antenna,
and a sewing machine, along with residence in a house with cement walls, a sheet-metal, tile or concrete
roof, running water, electricity, flush toilets, and finally the number of rooms per person in the house.9
After calculating the welfare indicator the poverty line is determined in a manner that obtains roughly the
same poverty rates as those derived from the income poverty analysis, in 2011, for each location type: 18
percent in urban areas and 54 percent in rural areas.

56.     In Niger, asset-based poverty shows less change over time than income poverty. Both forms
of poverty declined between 2005 and 2007/08, income poverty falling by 1.1 percentage point and asset-

  Cars and toilets are almost exclusively used in urban areas. In addition, ownership of a telephone is not included in
the analysis. With the advent of mobile phones, telephone ownership boomed between 2005 and 2011, and
consequently including this indicator would weaken the robustness of the poverty trend.

based poverty dropping by 1.3 point. Moreover, whereas income poverty continued to decline between
2007/08 and 2011, asset poverty remained virtually unchanged. Like income poverty asset-based poverty
can be evaluated not only in terms of incidence, but also depth and severity. These indicators show the
same trends as poverty incidence: i.e., a slight decline between 2005 and 2007/08 followed by stagnation
between 2007/08 and 2011.

57.     However, the evolution of non-income poverty reveals sharper contrasts between urban
areas and rural areas. Urban living conditions appear to be improving quite rapidly, with asset-based
urban poverty dropping from over 29 percent in 2005 to less than 18 percent in 2011. By contrast, rural
living conditions improved far more modestly; the asset-based rural poverty rate in 2011 was just 0.9
percentage points lower than in 2005 and in fact slightly higher than in 2007/08. As a result, the number
of rural people affected by asset-based poverty rose even faster than the number affected by income
poverty, with the asset-based poor population increasing by 25 percent between 2005 and 2011, from
fewer than 6 million to more than 7.5 million. Due to a combination of higher poverty rates and a larger
population share a full 94 percent of Niger’s poor live in rural areas.

58.      The stagnation of asset-based poverty and the slight decline in income poverty once more
highlight the modest and unstable improvement in poverty indicators in Niger. In particular, these
trends reflect the vulnerability of the average household, as low income levels inhibit investment in
housing quality and durable goods. Nevertheless, some housing conditions do show modest improvement.
The percentage of the population living in houses with cement or cement-block walls rose from 4.2
percent in 2005 to 7 percent in 2011, while the percentage living in houses with roofing made of sheet-
metal, tile or cement increased from 7.8 percent to 11.4 percent.

59.       Troublingly, two housing conditions that have a strong impact on public health—sanitation
and waste disposal—show little or no improvement. 21 percent of households used flush toilets or
improved latrines in 2005; in 2007/08 that number fell to less than 20 percent and then rose marginally to
23 percent in 2011. Taking toilets with flushing systems only, these are used by less than 2% of the
population. These trends appear to indicate that the quality of new houses is essentially in line with the
average for the current stock. The same is true for household waste disposal. In 2007/08 7.6 percent of
households disposed of their household waste using public facilities or private services, though even
private services often rely on public dumps. This share actually declined to 5.8 percent in 2011,
illustrating the difficulty municipalities face in meeting the infrastructure needs of rising urban
populations.

60.      Access to electricity has rapidly expanded, albeit from a low initial level, but the availability
of potable water remains limited. Electrification has increased dramatically, with the percentage of
people living in households where electricity is the main source of lighting doubling between 2005 and
2011. Nevertheless, the 2011 electrification rate remained low in absolute terms at 14.4 percent. Access to
potable water has stagnated at around 50 percent since 2005. The issue of water access deserves further
attention, as this percentage refers to households with access to a potentially potable water source, yet the
actual water quality is not verified. Moreover, “access? in this context does not mean running water in the
home, but rather that potable water is locally obtainable. If the time and distance required to obtain this
water were considered, the actual level of household access to potable water would be much lower.

                                                     23
61.      A more encouraging trend is reflected in the observed increase in home ownership.
Furthermore, the percentage of households that possessed a formal land title grew from 9 percent in
2007/08 to 12.7 percent in 2011. Home and property ownership can help to mitigate the impact of
negative shocks, such as loss of employment or some other temporary decrease in income, and this type
of resilience is especially important to the poor.

62.     Another dimension of asset-based poverty is ownership of durable goods. Improvements
have been registered in asset ownership, but most have occurred in urban areas. In 2011 more urban
households reported owning a means of transportation (i.e. car or motorcycle); meanwhile, rural
households have witnessed a decline in car ownership and a rise in the ownership of motorcycles. A
greater number of people live now in homes with a television set, a DVD player, a fan and a refrigerator,
but these improvements are also occurring largely in urban areas.

                       Box 2: Methodology for Analyzing Poverty in Terms of Living Conditions

Like income poverty, asset-based poverty requires a welfare indicator and a poverty line. The welfare
indicator is designed based on the durable goods owned by the household and a set of housing
characteristics. Formally, let us assume that the assessment is conducted based on K goods, listed as b1i,
b2i, …bki for household i. These are binary variables with a value of 1 or 0 reflecting whether the
household owns that good or not.

The welfare indicator for household i will be:                                    , where wj is the weight
assigned to each of the goods j, j=1,…, k. Designing a welfare indicator therefore requires resolving two
problems: selecting the variables bj and selecting their weights. As noted above, the variables bj are
chosen from among a set of durable goods and housing characteristics. These variables are assumed to
reflect the living standard of the household; the more goods a household owns, the wealthier it is.
Similarly, households living in houses with better facilities (improved building materials, electricity,
running water, etc.) are assumed to enjoy a higher welfare standard than those living in houses with
inferior amenities. However, one significant weakness of this approach is that the relative quality of these
goods is not systematically accounted for, which may obscure actual inequalities in living standards.

Another major question involves how the variables are weighted. A conventional approach is to perform a
factorial analysis (e.g. analysis by major component), which consists of a projection of space with size K
into a space with a smaller size (generally 1), retaining the coefficients of the projection as the weights.
This approach has often been used to analyze poverty over a given period, for example to assess the
impact of a poverty-related program in the absence of consumption aggregate. Since the purpose of this
study is to analyze poverty trends it is important to maintain consistent weights, so that the difference in
the welfare indicator solely reflects the differences in asset ownership. Therefore the weights retained will
be one divided by the number of households that owned the asset in 2011.

63.     This brief overview of poverty trends in Niger indicates that although household living
conditions did not deteriorate, they only improved slightly over the 2005-2011 period; two major
methodological conclusions emerge from the exercise. First, trends revealed by the analysis of asset-
based poverty are slightly different to those reflected in the income-poverty indicators. Second, many of
the indicators show mixed trends, and where improvements are observed they are frequently marginal.
This underscores the difficulty faced by Nigerien policymakers in achieving both the MDGs and the more
modest goals of the country’s national development strategy.

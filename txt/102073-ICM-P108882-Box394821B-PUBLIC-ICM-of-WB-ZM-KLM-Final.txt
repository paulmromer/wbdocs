B. DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1. Original (and Revised) Development Objectives

   1. The original Medium-Size Project (MSP) document defined as Project
      Development Objective:
      To improve sustainable conservation management of Lavushi Manda and
      Kasanka National Parks to uplift their ecological value as part of the greater
      Bangweulu ecosystem.
      This remained unchanged throughout the implementation.

2. Original (and Revised) Activities/Components

   2. The project was designed to improve the sustainable conservation management of
      the Lavushi Manda National Park (LMNP) and the Kasanka National Park (KNP),
      to uplift their ecological value as part of the greater Bangweulu ecosystem. The
      project would develop and implement an effective PA management system based
      on the existing and successful Public-Private Partnership approach (PPP) in KNP
      with ZAWA, the state Zambian Wildlife Authority.

   3. The original MSP document included the following three components:

       Component                                     Total (US$)       GEF (US$)
       Conservation systems                          805,000           340,000
       Stakeholder involvement                       220,000           111,000
       Management capacity building                  957,000           385,000

   4. Some changes at component and activity level were introduced during the mid-
      term review process (MTR, June 2012), discussed and validated by the Recipient
      and the World Bank Group team. These are described below, and were
      documented in progress reports and aide-memoires.

   5. Component 1: Conservation Systems. This core component aimed to put in
      place systems and infrastructure for sustainable conservation management in
      LMNP and to improve the same in KNP. The key feature of the approach was to
      introduce management and law enforcement staff to operate in LMNP for
      operating park management activities such as anti-poaching patrols, fire and
      hydrological management, and mammal road. The component aimed further to
      develop two general park management plans, one for each park. Other activities
      included training and equipping of scouts, design of a law enforcement strategy,
      opening bush tracks, design of an airstrip and demarcation of park boundaries.

   6. Key revisions: there were no revisions to the proposed activities. The only
      revision that was made, already in the first year, was to the proposed actions: the
      development of an airstrip was cancelled. KTL management decided it was not


                                                                                       3
         relevant at this stage, with two other airstrips already close to the park and no
         funding to do aerial surveys.

     7. A summary of all activities for component 1 is provided in table 1:

       9. Component 2: Community participation. This component was aimed at
          increasing community support for the conservation of the Kasanka and Lavushi
          Manda National Parks. Activities focused on engaging stakeholders and
          community representatives of LMNP through a Park Management Committee and

                                                                                                  5
         have stakeholder communities making use of the KTL education and community
         programs.

     10. Key revisions: During the MTR a discussion on the support from communities for
         conservation - the question was whether the increase in snaring in KNP means
         that there is little or no results from the community support around KNP - lead to
         a proposal to discontinue livelihood support around LMNP for now and
         concentrate on the creation of a new GMA and support to school clubs. This
         resulted in one new activity, see table below.

3. Outcome Indicators

    17. Table 7 below provides an overview of the original outcome indicators related to
        the development and global environmental objectives as stated in the MSP
        document and of the revised outcome indicators as agreed during the mid-term
        review (MTR) in 2012; some of the targets were adjusted during the MTR
        because by the end of year one, some had already been reached and other proved
        over-ambitious. At the time, the analysis of the indicator performance showed
        that, on average, the “Intermediary Outcomes? were 102% delivered while
        “Outcome Indicators? were 139% delivered.

4. Other Significant Changes in Design

    18. The project's closing date was extended to 30 June 2014 from the original closing
        date of July 30, 2013. The proposed extension was necessary to ensure that the
        project outcomes and activities would be duly completed. Even though the project
        at MTR rated satisfactory, there was a delay in achieving these outcomes as result
        of a 6 month delay in effectiveness and initially slow procurement.

       system based on Public-Private Partnership approach with ZAWA, from KNP to
       LMNP. The Development Objective addressed the improvement of sustainable
       conservation management of Lavushi Manda and Kasanka National Parks to
       uplift their ecological value as part of the greater Bangweulu ecosystem.

   20. The Project design, including its Project Development Objective, the Intermediate
       Outcomes and the mode of project implementation addressed several core
       concerns in the Zambian natural resources management sector. Important among
       these were the need to:
           - extend credible wildlife management and increase the public relevance of
              the protected wildlife estate
           - reduce the increasing threat to wildlife and other natural resources from
              illegal hunting and harvesting;
           - strengthen the positive cooperative involvement of neighboring
              communities in sustainable ecosystems management in national parks and
              game management areas.
       These objectives remained relevant to the end of the project.

   21. The Project elements also share components and intended outcomes with other
       stakeholder projects around the Kasanka and Lavushi Manda National Parks,
       especially improving the sustainability of wildlife conservation management in
       the Bangweulu and middle Luapula ecosystem. In support of this cooperation this
       Project delivered an important management restoration function in the Lavushi
       Manda National Park that had hitherto been neglected to the extent that
       encroachment and land degradation had started within that protected area. It now
       forms a contiguous part of natural resources management activities in the area and
       contributes an important biodiversity support function.

   22. Design: the initial component structure of the project remained relevant to the end
       of the project.


2. Achievement of TF Development Objective

   23. The main sources of information for this assessment are: the initial project
       document approved by WB/GEF, the MTR Aide memoire, the project completion
       mission Aid memoire, the M&E report and KTL’s own completion report.

   24. Outcomes: Table 8 below shows the achievements of the project objectives
       through its outcome indicators. The assessment is positive. Per component:

                                                                                       11
25. Project overall: The Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool carried out by
    KTL, ZAWA and WB shows a clear increase both in KNP and LMNP at project
    end. In LMNP on most of the questions a higher scores was received compared to
    the baseline in 2009, among others for the controlling of illegal land use activities
    and law enforcement, for protected area objectives and design, for resource
    management, for availability of staff and equipment and for stakeholder
    communication and involvement. For KNP progress was made especially on
    stakeholder communication and involvement. For the Kasanka Trust on
    institutional capacity such as the availability of work plans and management of
    budget.

26. The increase in mammal sightings, measured during the annual road counts, are
    positive - see also report attached to the client’s closing report. The EOP score for
    LMNP seems high; this is believed to be a combination of an actual increase in
    numbers (inclusive perhaps of immigration), improved sighting chances (reduced
    shyness), and possibly other factors, as well as matters of chance.

27. Component 1: Conservation systems. The progress on various activities under
    Component 1 is good. The extremely high poaching pressure at Kasanka National
    Park (with over 6000 snares having been removed in 2013) continues. Species
    that occur in habitats more typical of well-protected areas in the center of the park
    are generally stable while others that are more typical of peripheral habitats
    continue to decline in numbers. Numbers of animals in Lavushi Manda National
    Park show encouraging increases, rebounding immediately as soon as anti-
    poaching efforts were begun at the beginning of the project. See the detailed
    report for mammal counts submitted by KTL as part of their closing report.

28. A final draft of the General Management Plan (GMP) for Kasanka National Park
    has been prepared, and reviewed and consulted in three workshops. It was
    submitted to ZAWA early 2014: to ZAWA’s Operations Committee and then to
    its Board.

29. The GMP of LMNP: In early 2014, ZAWA asserted ownership of the GMP
    process. They organized a field visit of experts and managed much of the process,
    supporting a consultant who prepared the draft report. After the June 2014
    workshop the consultant updated the document and circulated the zero draft to all
    stakeholders for review and approval. As of the end of 2014, the report was
    pending final approval from ZAWA.

30. ZAWA employs 20 scouts in LMNP but no ranger had taken up a post there
    during the project period. Three had been assigned during the project period but
    for various reasons never taken up duties in the park. ZAWA noted they are
    understaffed and are prioritizing parks with elephant and rhino populations due to
    the poaching pressure faced by these species. Note that subsequent to end of the
    project, in September 2014, a ranger moved to Fibishi camp and started duties.

                                                                                      12
    31. Status of Component 2: Stakeholder involvement. In both parks the project
        continued to support meetings of the Park Management Committees (PMCs) as
        well as a range of outreach programs with local communities (details are reported
        in the quarterly reports).

    32. No additional encroachment has occurring in LMNP beyond that which had
        already taken place by the project start-up. With the support of the local chief,
        four (of nine) villages have voluntarily resettled outside of the park. ZAWA
        stressed that no person from these villages has been involuntarily displaced from
        the park.

    33. The GMA creation in Mpumba Chiefdom has been a success. The Mpika Council
        requested verification of the process and of the support by the community before
        agreeing to its creation. This was given after consultative meetings throughout the
        Mpumba Chiefdom showing that the communities were positive to the formation
        of a GMA in Mpumba Chiefdom. At project end, the final decision and next steps
        were in the hands of ZAWA.

    34. Status of Component 3: Management capacity building. Activities under
        Component 3 proceeded satisfactorily, such as preparation of the audits, project
        management, fundraising activities, and implementation of the tourist plans for
        the two parks.

    35. The extension of the MoU between ZAWA and KTL, which expired in May
        2012, was not resolved by the end of the project. ZAWA had no known objection
        to extending the MoU, as confirmed by its Director in meetings with the World
        Bank. Although regrettable, the lack of an unambiguous legal standing of KTL
        did not have any perceptible influence on the project or the project.

        achievement of the project development objective.

    37. An executive summary of the indicator results with graphs, maps, and pictures
        was prepared (see attachment to Recipient’s closing report).

    38. Implementation status of safeguard policies: Three World Bank Safeguards
        Operational Policies (OPs) were listed for this project (1) Environmental
        Assessment (OP 4.01), (2) Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and (3) Involuntary
        Resettlement (OP 4.12). There was limited illegal settlement within the park but
        there has been no involuntary displacement or resettlement. Existing settlements
        were advised of their illegal status, and the requirement that there will be no
        further encroachment or settlement. New tracks and access for management and
        tourism purposes has locally created minor ecosystem disturbance but the
        approved mitigating actions were applied. See attachment to Client’s closing

    39. Project management efficiency: there was a highly committed management team
        in the field of which some members were already involved in the preparation
        phase and throughout implementation. The manager in Lavushi Manda changed
        once, both have been very committed.


                                                                                         15
  40. Institutional efficiency: One of the risks listed in the MSP was "Kasanka Trust
      current management structure is inadequate to absorb the extension to LMNP and
      to address defined administrative and managerial gaps during preparation". The
      preparation phase resulted in detailed reviews of the financial, procurement and
      administrative weaknesses and strengths. The action plan that was consequently
      developed to uplift KTL governance and administrative capacity to an adequate
      level was included in the project’s work plan, and the activities and improvements
      were executed. For example: Board meetings have been held every quarter and
      approved annual work plans and budgets, an administrator was appointed based in
      Kasanka with a Lusaka-based accountant, backlog of annual audits was solved
      and annual audits were carried out, and additional charitable funds were raised.

  41. Another risk was that listed at Institutional level was "ZAWA does not
      satisfactorily participate and support defined implementation arrangements related
      to law enforcement in LMNP and KNP. Effective joint management, legal
      authority and coordination does not take place." World Bank supervision missions
      included ZAWA members from local and headquarters, and bi-annual Park
      Management Committee meetings included ZAWA regional. Effective joint
      management, legal authority and coordination could have been better: the project
      closed with an expired Memorandum of Understanding for both parks.

  42. Financial management performance and audits: Annual audits were produced and
      the one for January - June 2014 was submitted (late) on 12 May 2015. As of the
      time of writing (August 2015), the Bank has not yet completed its review of the
      audit. The financial management arrangements for the project have been
      Satisfactory. It was downgraded in 2013 to Moderately Satisfactory due to late
      submission of audited financial statements and late submission of the
      management letter for the year 2013. The World Bank concluded however that
      the project has been up to date with its reporting obligations (quarterly FMRs), the
      designated account has been kept active and disbursements are fully done. There
      were some difficulties in submitting electronic withdrawal applications due to
      connectivity problems from the field and the challenge of working with the Client
      Connection system of the Bank. The project continued using external accountants
      for the maintenance of its accounting records and this arrangement has proved
      satisfactory to the project. The project has been producing the UIFRs (unaudited
      interim financial reports) on time.

  43. Procurement: annual procurement plans were submitted and approved. The post-
      procurement reviews all have been positive.

  44. Expenditure: the table below show total expenditure per component and per
      expenditure category for the sum of the GEF funds. Disbursement is 100%.

   45. Cost efficiency. For such a small grant, the impressive results of the project
       indicate good cost efficiency. This however is difficult to quantify.

   46. The project leveraged more co-financing than anticipated at project design stage,
       see Cost and Financing table at the beginning of this report: $1,735,787 instead of
       $837,000. Funders such as Civil Society Environmental Fund were keen to
       support KTL because of the approved GEF funds. The MSP document was used
       as a fundraising tool, as KTL's Strategic Plan. Table 10 presents the details of
       actual co-financing.

    48. Implementation rating: By project closure the procurement plan execution was
        rated satisfactory, the GEF budget was 100% executed, planned activities were
        95% completed (pending activities were primarily the completion of the GMP for
        LMNP and creation of the new GMA in Mpunda Chiefdom; in both cases further
        decisions and actions were needed from ZAWA and were beyond the control of
        the Project) and the financial and procurement performance was rated
        satisfactory. Quarterly reports and completion reports were delivered in time. The
        monitoring and evaluation performance is rated Satisfactory. Safeguards
        implementation was considered satisfactory. Consequently the Implementation
        Performance is rated Satisfactory.


3. Efficiency
No major delays or problems with disbursements were encountered. The project was
implemented according to budget and workplan. See also the above points (paragraphs 45
and 46) on cost efficiency, which supports the incremental reasoning for the project.
Although a small grant, the GEF resources allowed leverage of other co-financing to
meet the objectives of the project.

4. Development Impacts, including those that are Unintended/Unrelated to TF Objectives

    49. In pursuit of the Project Objective and Outcomes, KTL has achieved a useful
        other outcome through exploring opportunities for more holistic management of
        natural resources in the eastern catchments of the Chambeshi/Luapula system. Of
        special importance was the need for timely investments in support of viable
        biological corridors linking elements of the Bangweulu-Kasanka protected area
        complex and adjacent protected areas.

    50. Unintended outcomes have included:
           - realization of the need for further definition of the most appropriate
               mechanisms for public-private partnerships within the wildlife sector that


                                                                                       20
              will improve the allocation of clear roles and responsibilities and
              therefore, also operating efficiencies and successes;
          -   identification of the need for more successful approaches to involve
              neighboring communities to leverage the real worth of national parks as
              economic and ecological contributors;
          -   further confirmation of the high biodiversity status of the Kasanka-
              Lavushi Manda protected area system and the need for additional work to
              increase biodiversity knowledge, especially in the Lavushi Manda
              National Park and environments.


5. Overall TF Outcome
The overall outcome rating, taking into account the project's relevance, achievement of
development objectives, efficiency and development impact, is Satisfactory.




                                                                                    21
D. Risk to Development Outcome


1. Follow-On Results and/or Investment Activities

Activity/Investment:
_____ Recipient/Other Investment; _____ Grant Project/Program; _____ Bank Project;
_____ IFC Financial Project/Activity. The Recipient (KTL) continues to manage the two
parks with a range of funding support from various donors as well as own-generated
funds.

   51. KTL's strengthened administration and financial management systems are being
       used to manage follow-on funding streams such as World Land Trust funding to
       investigate options for land acquisition between the two parks (corridors /
       community conservancies).

2. Replicability

   52. The most useful lessons have been firstly, the realization that initial successes in
       depleted wildlife protected areas introduce the need for significant and initially
       unforeseen scaling up of funding before sustainable management conditions and
       economies of scale are achieved.

   53. Secondly the timeframe for achieving sustainable management systems is well
       beyond that of the GEF medium-sized project cycle.

   54. The methodology applied by the Project proved very successful but demonstrated
       clearly the need for a specific project component targeting capacity development.
       This is critical to the subsequent sustainability of management standards and
       targets in similar projects.



3. Overall Risk to Development Outcome

   55. The overall risk for the project's long-term sustainability is Significant mainly due
       to income generation.

   56. A summary of the risk is presented in table 12




                                                                                         22

E. PERFORMANCE

1. Bank

   57. The project task team leaders (the TTL changed at the Mid-term Review) were
       both senior specialists with the necessary needed technical qualification and
       experiences.

   58. As based on feedback from KTL to the Bank, he World Bank’s task team was
       effective in guiding the implementation team throughout implementation.
       Feedback on implementation was provided in a timely and constructive way.
       Annual missions to the project were carried out. Procurement and financial
       management specialists handled requests in a timely fashion and approvals were
       granted without undue delays.

   59. Overall, Bank’s performance is considered Satisfactory (S).

2. Recipient

   60. The project team implemented this project, its first World Bank/GEF project,
       fully committed, professionally, in a consultative manner and to a high standard
       according to the project document and legal agreement. The changes made by the
       recipient such as refocus on the GMA creation helped to strengthen the project’s
       impact. The team leveraged more than expected co-financing and followed a cost-
       effective approach across all components.

   61. The team struggled with some of the bank reporting requirements but managed to
       comply, with assistance of the Bank’s task team.

   62. Overall, the recipient’s performance is considered here Satisfactory (S).




                                                                                    24
F. LESSONS LEARNED / RECOMMENDATIONS

The Project to extend the Kasanka management system to Lavushi Manda National Park
produced several useful lessons.

   63. Positive Lessons: The key positive lesson was that improved management inputs,
       coupled with relatively limited funding, can have a profound impact on turning
       around depleted and marginalized protected areas.

   64. Negative Lessons: The key negative lesson was that implementation successes
       and subsequent sustainability of the Project could have been enhanced by formal
       inclusion of KTL in the Bangweulu wetlands management structures; clearer
       definition of the specific roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties
       (KTL and ZAWA) and of the neighboring stakeholders (BWMB and APN).
       Additional benefits realized may have included improved efficiency and
       effectiveness of management input applied; wider constructive participation from
       neighboring communities; and improved law enforcement results.

   65. Others lessons:
        Administrative costs of such a project are quite high and need to be phased in
          and out to avoid problems at project end. This would need more attention in
          the future, including working on follow up funding.
        The fact that the funds were made available to one implementing partner and
          that the funds could be implemented without third parties was crucial for
          speed and effect of the project.
        The approach taken to focus on planning and implementing systems instead of
          concentrating on investments proved worthwhile and effective. On the other
          hand, we maybe should have prioritized some more investments for
          sustainability halfway the project.
        The GMP process for LMNP was delayed by recentralisation of planning
          activities resulting in unnecessary duplications and time loss. Future
          operations would benefit of decentralization of responsibilities from ZAWA
          HQ to the local offices.
        There are mechanisms to market a park with few wildlife sightings (outdoor
          activities).

Chapter 1 Overview

    1.1 Introduction

For more than a decade, Africa has enjoyed a mineral boom1. This has fueled exports,
government finances and hope for a sustainable growth trajectory (figure 1.1). During
2001-12 extractive industries (including oil) comprised three-quarters of exports—with
metals and minerals alone accounting for 60 percent. This gain in export share, and by
consequence government revenues, went to some (but not all) countries, which explains
partly why resource-abundant countries have grown faster than non-resource rich
countries.2 And although there has been a recent slowdown in exploration due to the
weakness in the global economy, natural resource extraction, is expected to contribute
significant shares of exports and public finance in all but five of the region’s countries in
the years ahead (Devarajan and Fengler 2013).

In general, African countries do not collect sub-national economic data. Therefore, it is
often difficult to assess how much of the growth that is reported is happening at the local

  The FDI inflow that is driving this boom has been dubbed “The Second Scramble for Africa,” after the first
scramble, also attracted by natural resource, which preceded European colonialism. The recent sharp drop in
commodity prices is believed to have reined in this boom, but the slowdown is expected to be temporary.

level. In particular, is the growth mostly happening in isolated places, sectors and periods?
We use geo-referenced data collected by satellite to estimate local economic activity, using
nighttime lights and vegetation index as proxies for economic activities. Since these
satellite data can be collected at very small geographic areas, we can aggregate them to any
administrative level and measure progress. We find that local-level economic activity
confirms the observed growth in aggregate economic output (figure 1.2).

Although Africa’s resource boom has spurred growth, questions remain whether it has
also improved living standards. The conversion of growth into poverty reduction is
considered to be much lower in Africa than in the rest of the developing world
(Christiaensen, Chuhan-Pole, and Sanoh 2014), and the low growth elasticity of poverty
is attributed to natural-resource-led growth, a factor that underlies the disappointment that
is often felt following a natural-resource-led boom. The disappointment is all too familiar
at the national level, but increasingly there is a growing interest in understanding whether
local mining communities benefit from the resource boom and, if they do not, what the
possible reasons are that might explain it.
The focus on local impacts of this study is motivated by the observation that, in general,
the socioeconomic effects of large-scale mining are not well understood. In fact, to the
extent that there is a public opinion on impacts of gold mining on local communities, it is
likely to be unfavorable. This is partly because, despite contributing substantially to


                                             3
countries’ gross domestic product (GDP) and export revenue, the total employment
numbers generated country-wide by mines are generally modest. For instance, in Mali,
large-scale mining activity accounted for about 7 percent of GDP in 2013, but less than 1
percent of the population was employed by the industry (Sanoh and Coulibaly 2015).
Adding to the negative perception of the sector is the concern that the industry also brings
with it negative environmental and health impacts, which the community feels is not
adequately compensated. Furthermore, mining and oil companies want government
concessions and often require government cooperation. They will, therefore, have a
tendency to exaggerate (or hype) the local and national benefits. To navigate divergent,
and sometimes motivated thinking, this study develops a simple framework to evaluate
the welfare impacts of large-scale gold mining on local communities in three African
countries—Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania.
The approach adopted in this study is two-pronged. First, through case studies, including
the results of fieldwork, mining’s impacts are examined in a country-specific context for
each of three countries, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania; and second, a statistical analysis is
used to test whether the indicators of welfare improve with proximity to a mine.


 1.2 Analytical framework

The avenues for extractive industries to impact local communities and regions are
somewhat restricted in developing countries. In most of these countries, local residents and
landowners do not have property rights to subsurface minerals. These are “owned” by the
country and all its citizens, and the national government is the guardian of this wealth on
their behalf. With this in mind, Chapter 2 of this report provides a framework for
understanding how the benefits from the mineral sector are captured by local communities.
Drawing on Aragón, Chuhan-Pole and land (2015), it delineates three broad channels
through which the local areas and regions may be affected:
      Income, employment, and linkages. Extractive industries employ local workers
       and purchase some goods and services locally and regionally. This should raise
       nominal wages and other incomes and increase non-mine employment
       opportunities and generally improve local welfare and reduce poverty. There could,
       however, also be some negative spillovers from this. Often, the start of an extractive
       industry, say, the opening of a mine, will attract workers from other districts. This
       could temper the rise in wages, put a strain on local services such as health and
       education, and raise the price of nontradable goods and services such as housing
       rents and, therefore, actually reduce the real incomes of some local residents. Figure
       1.3 presents an analytical framework of market-based transmission channels and
       possible outcomes of a natural resource boom.


                                             4
       Government as the owner of the resources on behalf of the people, and collector
        of public revenues from resources, is the conduit of the benefits to the rest of the
        economy (via public spending). The benefits from a natural resource will depend
        to a large extent on whether the revenues received are put to good use. A fiscal
        revenue windfall eases the hard budget constraint of local governments, and
        supports higher public spending. If history is a guide, there is ample reason to be
        cautious. In particular, the areas where mines are located have no property rights to
        the minerals and may feel deprived of the benefits while bearing the bulk of the
        costs. In all three cases, the central government owns the resources and therefore
        the revenues. The fiscal arrangements between the central and local governments
        at various levels will therefore determine how much of the benefits from mining
        find their way back to the mining areas. Among the case studies, Mali had the
        highest degree of fiscal decentralization and, therefore, the local authorities
        received the largest proportion of the revenues compared to the other two. Ghana
        is in the middle of the three in this regard, but its decentralization efforts are
        relatively new, so it may be premature to evaluate them. Tanzania has a rather rigid
        centralized mechanism. All revenues are garnered by the central government.
        Transfers from the central budget fund 90 percent of local government. The funds
        are allocated according to criteria and priorities unrelated to the location of mines
        or the source of the funds.
        In so far as the windfall is used to improve the quantity or quality of local public
        goods and services, there would be the potential to improve human welfare, such
        as health and education outcomes. Moreover, to the extent that public goods are
        productive inputs, or create positive spillovers, as in the case of transport
        infrastructure, a resource boom could also increase local income and growth. The
        positive effect of revenue windfalls is underpinned by several assumptions: namely,
        local politicians are responsive to the broad population, which requires well-
        functioning local institutions and a healthy degree of political competition3; and
        local bureaucracies have the technical capacity to provide those public goods and
        services. Therefore, the general competence, honesty, and, overall implementation
        capacity of the local-level government will be key to enhancing welfare and
        development. Lacking these, may undermine the positive effect of revenue
        windfalls on public good provision and local living conditions.4 Hence, both
        nationally and locally, the quality of governance and the influence on it of resource
        revenues will be a key determinant of the welfare impacts of resource exploitation.


3
  In the absence of good democratic checks and balances, the revenue windfall can fail to significantly
improve public good provision (Caselli and Michaels, 2013) and lead instead to corruption and worsening of
political selection (Brollo et al. 2013). Also see Besley and Burgess 2002.
4
  The “rapacity” and “opportunity cost” effects discussed in the country-level literature on conflict, may
also explain a failure of resource windfalls to be converted into welfare gains at the local level.

             revenue windfall would impact local welfare.
            Externalities. There may be positive spillovers from the extractive industry in
             addition to the wage and linkage effects noted above. These could include
             improvements to productivity through worker training and education, which often
             spread beyond the mine or oil field. Also, there may be improvement to public
             goods through investment in roads, bridges, ports, and similar facilities, which are
             required by the extractive industry. However, there are always some negative
             externalities, such as pollution, congestion, pressure on other scarce natural
             resources, and social dislocation. Environmental and health issues are a big concern
             (see box 1.1).

Box 1.1 Environmental and health issues in gold mining areas
Like many other industries, gold mining (both industrial and artisanal) is associated with
environmental degradation and pollution which have severe health implications. The
environmental degradation is manifest through effects on landscape and land use, spread of
gold ore-related heavy metals such as arsenic and lead to nature, discharge of cyanide to
nature, spread of mercury from artisanal mining, or air pollution. In Ghana, air pollution
around industrial gold mine has been linked to increased cough incidence (Aragon and
Rud, 2013a). Similarly, pollution from heavy metals contamination has been shown to
have detrimental health impacts. For example, von der Goltz and Barnwal (2014) in their
study of 800 mines in 44 developing countries found that lead and other heavy metal
pollution are linked to a 3 to 10 percentage points increase in anemia incidence among
women living in mining communities. In addition, children of the same communities
experience a 5 percentage point increase in the incidence of stunting. In general, there are
controversies surrounding studies linking environmental degradation around mines to
health outcomes due to the possibility of omitted variable bias where exposure to these
pollutions may be linked to individual lifestyles habits (Tolonen, 2014).
In 2008, a Ghanaian environmental impact assessment of 61 major mines and several
smaller-scale operations sites found that mining areas have higher concentration of arsenic
particularly within the areas of old, large mines like Obuasi, Bibiani and Prestea. For
example, in the influence area of Obuasi mine, the mean arsenic concentration over one
year of sampling is 525 μg/l, which is more than 50 times the WHO guideline for drinking
water. High concentration of cyanide is infrequent in Ghana because the great majority of
companies stick to stringent procedures.

Environmental and health issues for artisanal scale miners are concerned with the use of
mercury to cheaply separate gold from other minerals. Mercury usage tends to always
exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) limit for public exposure of 1.0 μg/m3. In
southwest Ghana, artisanal and small-scale gold miners have a significantly higher burden
of mercury than other residents who live or work in mining areas (Kwaansa-Ansah et al.,
2014). In Tanzania, a review of several studies points to the existence of major health and
safety risks for mining communities (World Bank, 2015). In the artisanal mining areas of
Matundasi and Makongolosi, mean mercury level in hair samples among miners is 2.7-
times higher than the 4-5 μg/L reference limit of the U.S. EPA. Approximately two-thirds
of the hair samples exceeded this reference limit. In addition, another study in Tanzania
looked at mercury levels in breast milk of mothers living at ASGM sites and found that 22
of the 46 children from these mothers had a higher total mercury intake.

Local impact of gold mining
The mineral sector in Sub-Saharan Africa is large and diverse. The aim of the research is
to apply the above framework (from Chapter 2) to a single mineral. The choice of gold for
this study was predicated on the following important factors:
      Gold mining is now an important industry in several countries in Africa, and is
       behind only crude oil as a top export earner for the region. In 2013, four African
       countries—Ghana, Mali, South Africa, and Tanzania—were among the top 20
       gold-producing countries in the world.
      Since the aim of the research is to assess the socioeconomic impact of the mining
       activity on local communities, it is relevant to select an activity that can have a
       potentially important local footprint. Gold mining is onshore, unlike oil drilling,
       which is often offshore, so it can be expected to have an impact on local
       populations.

Three countries were selected for study: Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania. Gold mining in each
of the three countries has a number of common characteristics that make them suitable for
this study. While industrial gold mining has a long history in Africa (especially for Ghana),
there has been a sharp acceleration in gold production in the last two decades in each of
these countries (figure 1.3), which makes a study of its impact timely. It also lends itself to
the “before” and “after” type of analysis reported in Chapter 4.


 1.3 Case Studies

Every country is a special case
As noted above, gold mining activity in the three case study countries has accelerated in
recent years. Overall, these three countries are among the top gold-producing countries in
the region, collectively accounting for about 35 percent of the region’s gold production in
2015. In addition, gold is a large component of export earnings in all three countries. Along
with an increase in gold production, government revenue from gold has been on an upward
trend (figure 1.4). Gold production is an important contributor to government revenue,
particularly in Mali, and its share is rising in Ghana and Tanzania. However, these elements
are national and do not directly impact local communities. A key channel for transmitting
benefits to the local community is through direct employment by the mining companies
and also the indirect effects through linkages with other sectors and increased expenditure
due to higher wages (these are sometimes called multipliers). However, gold mining is
capital-intensive and the country studies show that the linkages are likely to be quite small.
Direct employment in gold mining in Tanzania, for example, was around 7,000 in 2013.
The direct employment figures are likewise low for Ghana (about 17,100 in 2014) and Mali

                                              8
(averaging about 3,635 during 2008–13). If the “multiplier” is 2 (and it is probably lower),
then the total number of jobs supported by mines would be 14,000 in Tanzania, which is
trivial in a workforce with 70,000 new entrants per year. So, other than the immediate
vicinity of the gold mine, it is not likely to be a large employment generator.5

 The absolute size of employment is also important. In South Africa, the mining linkages are thought to be
minor, that is, they have low multipliers. But half a million workers are employed in gold mining, so any
shock, positive or negative, will have a significant impact on income and employment in the country. In
Tanzania, Ghana, and, perhaps, Mali, the absolute numbers are not (yet) that significant.

The multiplier effects are limited partly because of the capital intensity of the industry, but
mostly because of the lack of local cost-effective procurement opportunities. This could
change over time as the companies become better acquainted with local markets and
suppliers, and also as local entrepreneurs learn to take advantage of the relatively new
developments. In Tanzania, efforts have been made to improve the potential for local
procurement, including in services such as catering, vehicle repair, machine shop services,
welding, metal work, electrical work, and plumbing (Smith and Kinyondo 2015). However,
the proportions of inputs sourced locally remain low, a situation mirrored in Ghana and
Mali.
Being capital-intensive and in the absence of strong backward linkages, the key benefits
from gold mining will lie in its contribution to exports and government revenues. The
central government is the key local recipient of the rents. During 2005–13, gold mining
provided the government with US$362 million per year on average in Mali, compared to
US$300 million per year in Ghana and US$137 million per year in Tanzania. Therefore,
much of the local benefit from the industry will depend on how much of this revenue finds
its way back into the local community, and also on the quality of public sector expenditure.
Thus, fiscal arrangements for transfers—specifically, redistribution of resource revenues—
are important in understanding the local impact of mining activity.
The fiscal arrangements differ in all three countries. Tanzania and Ghana tend to be more
centralized, while Mali is more decentralized. However, in Ghana, the government has
mandated that 10 percent of revenues (mining royalties) be returned to the local
government in the areas of the mines. In Tanzania, all revenue accrues to the central
government (with the exception of recent annual payments of US$200,000 per mine), and
there is no link between government transfers to the local authorities and the revenues

                                                               10
raised from mining in those areas: Funds are allocated according to criteria and priorities
unrelated to the location of mines or the source of the funds. In Mali, the fiscal system is
decentralized, so fixed percentages (ranging from 60 percent to 15 percent on various taxes
and licensing fees) are transferred back to the local area governments. There may be some
payoff from this in Mali, since school enrollment rates in mining areas exceed those of
nonmining areas.6
Positive externalities are also few and far between. Corporate social responsibility
spending by mining companies has had limited impact, according to the data examined.
The case studies show that while investment in schools and public health facilities has
occurred, the results have been disappointing.7 The effect of mining on investment in local
roads and bridges, while not zero, has not had a large impact in any of the countries. The
mines tend to build infrastructure just sufficient for their needs, and the case studies show
that these are rather limited.
Negative externalities are always present in mining, including pollution, particularly from
cyanide, and other environmental and social risks.8 Corporate responsibility and regulatory
vigilance are important to ensure that these costs, borne entirely by local communities, are
minimized.9
The case studies do not note any evidence of local Dutch disease symptoms, however. For
example, in Tanzania, there was a slight increase in manufacturing employment in mining
areas. While this shows only minor linkages from mining to manufacturing, the fact that
manufacturing did not decline reveals an absence of Dutch disease affects.
The country studies suggest that overall, the effects of mining are not likely to be harmful
to the local areas (although pollution is always a danger that needs monitoring). Mining is
also likely to be somewhat transformative in terms of the quality and quantity of
employment in mining areas. However, these effects are quite limited. The key beneficiary
of mining is the government, which therefore is the conduit of benefits to the country as a
whole, and to the local communities as well. Transparency of governance and extractive
industry revenue collection is therefore fundamental to guarding against the governance
curse that so often accompanies resource-based economies.
An important caveat is that the focus of the study is on large-scale “industrial” gold
mining and not artisanal and small-scale gold mining that often takes place in proximity
to large-scale mining. The data cannot be disaggregated to distinguish between these two

  von der Goltz and Barnwal 2014 found that negative pollution impacts were likely to be
disproportionately borne by households close to the mine implying that net benefits could vary
significantly between the average household in a local community and the particular impacted
households.

classes of mining, nevertheless, large-scale mining, in all but a few mining areas,
accounts for a very high percentage of the volume and value of gold produced in such
areas.


 1.4 Empirical methodology

Measuring local effects of mining: Proximity of mines
The aim of the research is to assess whether local communities benefit from mining activity
or not. The empirical approach builds on the earlier studies that used quasi-experimental
events to estimate the impact of localized shocks on economic outcomes (Card and Krueger
1994). The identification strategy in these approaches is based on comparing outcomes in
local units of observation (districts, municipalities, regions, and so forth) affected by a
particular event or intervention to units where such events or interventions are absent. The
empirical approach adopted treats industrial gold mining as a quasi-experiment similar to
a clinical trial. The vicinity of the mine can be thought of as the “treatment area,” and areas
outside of this as nontreatment areas. In addition, since the areas chosen represent relatively
recent gold mine starts (or restarts), it is also possible to compare outcomes “before
treatment”’ and “after treatment,” the “treatment,” of course, being the start or existence of
a mine. The object of the exercise is to discern differences in the outcomes of those in
mining and non-mining areas.
Specifically, regression analysis is used to test whether indicators of welfare show
improvement with proximity to a mine. This is done on different levels. First, the size of
the treatment area—that is, the area in the vicinity of a mine—has to be determined. How
large the mine’s influence extends is an empirical exercise. The analysis includes
households within 100 kilometers (km) of a mine location, with the baseline treatment
distance being 20 km from a mine (figure 1.5). In order to allow for nonlinear effects with
distance, the analysis also employs a spatial lag model. The spatial lag model divides the
area around a mine into small concentric distances (or bins), such as 0–10 km, 10–20 km,
20–30 km and so on, up to within 100 km of a mine.10
As argued earlier, mining can have additional impacts beyond the neighborhood of the
mine if mining royalties and revenues are spent on populations living in districts where the
mine is located. Injection of additional expenditures into the district could increase
spending on welfare-enhancing services, such as schooling or health care. Thus, a second
level of analysis is done with the treatment area as the district in which the mine is located.
District refers to political or administrative units that have spending authority. For some of

10
  In the regression specification, each distance bin can have its own coefficient. The model thus allows for
nonlinear effects with distance. Moreover, it allows us to understand whether there are spillovers from
large-scale gold mining farther away than the baseline treatment distance.

                                                     12
the selected countries, the district has authority to raise revenue and spend it. In some, it
has no taxing authority but instead implements projects on behalf of the central government
as part of devolved functions. Districts themselves are relatively arbitrary, and looking for
impacts in only the districts that have a mine could miss the potential spillovers that result
from mining. So spillover effects across districts are also considered, and the analysis
compares outcomes in mining districts, neighboring districts, and non-mining districts.
Thus, the study identifies both local- and district-level effects of large-scale gold mining
in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania.
As with clinical trials, it is important to be able to choose a control group (in this case, the
non-mining group) that is as similar as possible in all other characteristics to the control
group (in this case, to the group in the mining area). Only then can the researcher
reasonably attribute any statistical difference between the two groups to the “treatment,”
in this case the mine. The control group is chosen by the characteristics of the individuals
so as to maximize their similarity to those of the treatment group. The groups chosen in
this way are called “synthetic.”11 The synthetic control group is one of the methods used
in the study to define a comparison group.

     The method of constructing the synthetic group is described in Chapter 3 and the references therein.

A difference-in-differences estimation strategy is used,12 which compares districts with and
without gold mines (or groups based on their distance), before and after the mines started
producing. The method allows for initial differences across districts. However, it makes a
crucial assumption—called the parallel trends assumption—which is the idea that these
initial differences will not affect estimates of outcomes that will be due to the presence of
a mine, as long as the trends of the socioeconomic development in the districts were similar
before the extraction from the mines began. Under this assumption, it can be deduced that
the change that happened in mining districts at the same time as the mine opening is in fact
a result of the mine (assuming that no other confounding changes happened at the same
time). The regression shows the change in the chosen indicators as a function of proximity
to a mine.




Mining and household data
The analysis combines mine-specific information and a rich dataset collected from various
sources (household surveys). Mine-level data on first year of production and production
volumes are from the Raw Materials Database of IntierraRMG; mine location information
(GPS coordinates) is obtained from online sources such as mine-atlas.com and
google.maps, and IntierraRMG for Ghana.
Data on households and/or individuals are from the following main sources: Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS), Household Budget Surveys (HBS), Living Standard Surveys
(LSS), and Censuses of Population.13 Some of the surveys, especially the DHS and LSS,
are geocoded. Since the mines are also georeferenced, it is easy to determine how far a
household observed in such surveys is from the mine. The estimation strategy that uses
individuals and households makes use of this information to identify the impacts of the
mines. Table 1.1 shows the survey years that were used.

 1.5 Results

The purpose of the analysis, as noted above, is to test for improvement or deterioration in
welfare in areas close to a mine. Four areas are considered as indicative of welfare:
      Occupation indicators for both men and woman. Whether there is expansion of
       employment opportunities and increases in incomes.
      Asset accumulation. If there is a discernable increase in family asset accumulation
       (for example, a radio, bicycle, car, or toilet) with proximity to a mine, then one
       could conclude that the mine, at least in this respect, is welfare enhancing.
      Child health outcomes. Again, the analysis tries to determine whether there are
       improvements in key indicators of child health. The key indicators here are infant
       mortality, fever, cough persistence, and diarrhea in children under age 5.
      Access to infrastructure. The key variables here are access to electricity and water,
       which is indicative of provision of services by local governments.
In short, the study takes a close look at the impacts of mines on individuals’ employment
prospects and wages, asset accumulation, child health outcomes, and access to
infrastructure when they live closer to a mine or in a mining district.


Occupation – Is local structural transformation occurring?
Using the methods outlined above, the study analyzes how gold mining has changed the
livelihoods of people (in mining areas) in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania. The econometric
results from the spatial lag model, which allows for nonlinear effects with distance, shows
service sector employment for women is significantly higher close to active mines (figure
1.6). In fact, the effects are stronger 0 to 10 km from a mine than 10 to 20 km from a mine.
In Mali, the probability that a woman works in services and sales increases by 30
percentage points, and in Ghana by 17 percentage points, in the very closest distance. For
Ghana and Mali, agricultural participation drops close to mines, at roughly 20 to 10
percentage points, respectively. In Tanzania, there is no evidence of a clear change either
in services and sales or in agricultural employment.
For Ghana, where data are available on mining employment from the Ghana Living
Standards Survey (GLSS) dataset, the results show that there is a 10-percentage-point
increase in the likelihood that a man living close to a mine works in mining (figure 1.7).
This contrasts with the findings for women, who are not benefiting (or benefiting very




                                            15
little) from direct employment in mining.14 The GLSS data also show that men have
(marginally) significantly higher wages. The DHS data for Ghana and Mali reveal that men
are less likely to work in agriculture if they live within 10 km of a mine (statistically
significant in Mali). There is a pattern in the data that indicates that there might be a
geographic displacement of farming activities from very close to a mine to slightly farther
away (20 to 30 km), especially in Ghana. Results also show that men are not more likely
to work in manual labor in Ghana or in Mali.

agricultural sector employment




District-level analysis, which compares outcomes between mining and nonmining districts,
for all three countries confirms the above finding that agricultural employment decreases
in mining districts. For Ghana, the results indicate that agricultural employment decreases
in mining districts relative to nonmining districts, by 5.2 percentage points for men and 8.5
percentage points for women. In addition, the probability of a woman working all year
increases by 5.4 percentage points, as does the probability of working in manual work.

14
  Chuhan-Pole et al. (2015) find that, using GLSS data, women are 7.4 to 10.4 percentage points more likely
to work in services or sales if they live close to a mine, and 2.5 to 2.6 percentage points more likely to work
in mining.

                                                      16
There are no such significant increases in employment in other sectors for men (the DHS
does not have information on employment in mining for men).15
          Figure 1.7 Agriculture, manual labor, mining, and wage earnings for men




15
  However, the insignificant point estimates indicate that men might be shifting toward service sector
employment and manual work.

                                                 17
Results from a district analysis for Tanzania and Mali show that there are significant
increases in the likelihood of mining employment. In Mali, men are almost 10 percentage
points more likely to work as miners, and women 2.3 percentage points more likely to work
as miners, compared with before. Note, however, that these changes can also be due to
increases in small-scale mining in these districts over the same time period. Overall, men’s
and women’s agricultural employment decreases insignificantly. For Tanzania, there is no
recorded information on mining employment, but as in Mali, we see a decrease in
agricultural employment—8 percentage points for men and 11 percentage points for
women—but these estimates are not statistically significant.
The empirical evidence provides signs of an incipient structural transformation around
mines. Essentially, there are some visible shifts in the structure of employment of the local
economy away from “traditional” farming—defined by low inputs and low capital per
worker—to mining, services, and other activities.16 The increase in service sector
employment as well as other sectors can be understood as “local multipliers” (Moretti
2011), where for each job created directly in mining, there are additional jobs created in
the tradable or nontradable sector. The size of the multiplier will depend on total mine
employment, miners’ wages and spending habits, and how the mining company sources
inputs (such as food, electricity, and housing for its workers). Companies can try to boost
the multiplier, for example, by ensuring that it sources inputs from local suppliers. In
addition, there are local fiscal multipliers. A mine may result in local tax contributions
which, when spent by the local government, can help stimulate the local economy.
The study provides another perspective on the impact of resource extraction on agriculture
by using remote sensing data to estimate levels and changes in agricultural production in
mining and non-mining localities in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania (chapter 5).
It investigates the spatial relationship between mining activities and local agricultural
development by using a vegetation index (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as
a proxy for agricultural production. The issue of interest is whether the opening of mines
has spillover effects on the agricultural sector.
Agricultural production could be affected by mining activities in several ways. Mining
could lead to a rise in local wages, reduce profit margins in agriculture, and lead to the exit
of many families from farming—something akin to a localized Dutch disease problem.
Negative environmental spillovers such as pollution (as found by Aragón and Rud 2015)
or local health problems could also dampen productivity of the land and of the farmers,
and thereby reduce the viability of farming. Alternatively, mining could create a mini-
boom in the local economy through higher employment and higher wages that can lead to
an increase in local area aggregate demand, including for regional food crops.

16
   Results show that in some countries, women shift from agriculture to service sector employment in the
close vicinity of mines. These results have previously been confirmed for different minerals and in more
countries (see Kotsadam and Tolonen 2013, and Tolonen 2015).

                                                  18
Figure 1.8 explores the change in the different distances from the mine, over the lifetime
of the mine. On the horizontal axis is the mine year, counting from 10 years before mine
opening, highlighted by the red vertical line, to 10 years after mine opening. The figures
are based on summary statistics, and do not control for any systematic differences across
the mines. Overall, it seems like areas very close to mines are on a steeper trend in
nightlights than are areas farther away, especially as one gets closer to the mine opening
year, which is highlighted by the red vertical line. One interpretation of this pattern is that
from a few years before the mine starts extracting gold, economic activity that emits
nightlight increases in these areas. One reason why this happens before the actual mine
opening year is because mines are capital-intensive and the local economy is stimulated
during this investment phase, a pattern confirmed in previously mentioned econometric
studies. For NDVI, no big difference in patterns is observed across the areas. Although
both areas seem to be on an upward sloping trend, this needs to be interpreted with caution,
because it can be driven by the unbalanced sample17. If anything, we detect that areas close
to mines are getting relatively greener over time compared with areas further away.
Figure 1.8 Nightlight and vegetation index over mine lifetime




Note: Nonparametric (local polynomial smooth) measures of nightlight and NDVI close to mines. Years
since mine opening on the x-axis counts the number of years from mine opening, with before the opening
on the left of the 0, and years after mine opening to the right of the 0. Nightlights and NDVI are measured
as averages across limited geographic areas, varying from within 10 km from the mine center point, to 20
km, 30 km, 50 km, and 100 km.


17
  The sample is unbalanced as the data on nighlights start in 2002, but mines may have opened long before
2002, as well as after. If the mines opened before 2002, we will have night lights data only during the
active period of the mine. Such mines would then add to the estimates of night lights on the right side of the
red line, but not to the left. There are too few mines for which we have night lights the whole 20-year
period to do these figures on a perfectly balanced subsample.

                                                     19
The difference-in-differences analysis for 32 mines across four countries does not find a
robust decrease in NDVI in mining communities (20 km) compared with farther away (20
to 100 km). The treatment coefficient active_close (table 1.2) is negative but not
statistically significant, meaning that there was no major difference in agricultural output
per area between areas near the mines and those further away (the control areas).
In light of the finding from the spatial lag model where we saw workers exiting agriculture,
the finding that mining has had no impact on agriculture when using NDVI may seem
contradictory. However, there are two things to keep in mind. One, the results from the
spatial lag model are about employment on the extensive margin—that is, the fraction of
workers in agriculture. By contrast, the results from the remote sensing data are about
yields (production—proxied by NDVI —per area). It is possible to have a net exit of
workers without lowering agricultural yields if the productivity of the entrants is
marginally higher than those who are exiting. A similar result will obtain if there is now
more land per worker, and the marginal productivity is higher. Therefore, these two results
actually are consistent with a story of nascent structural transformation.


Income, wages, and expenditure in mining communities in Ghana
While there are signs that there is a shift out of nonfarm activities, is there similar evidence
available for wages? The available household surveys listed above have two drawbacks for
understanding wages and mining. First, they are not geocoded, so the workers cannot be
linked to a mine. Second, most have no wage data. The exception is Ghana, where
household data have geocoordinates. Therefore, how wages, income, and expenditure
evolve in mining communities can be mapped. The analysis shows that household total
wages increase, as do women’s wages (table 1.2). Men’s wages increase too, but the
increase is not precisely estimated. (Note wage earnings are only recorded for those who
are engaging in wage labor; in fact, only 13.3 percent of people in the GLSS sample for
Ghana have recorded wage earnings.)
The data also show that regional food prices are higher in mining areas, which is similar to
the findings in Peru (Aragón and Rud 2013), but regionally deflated food expenditures do
not increase, nor does the share of food in total household expenditure (column 6). By
contrast, total household expenditure on housing increases by 31.6 percent (not regionally
deflated prices) with the onset of mining, as does the share of this component in total
expenditure. The same is true for energy costs, such as electricity and gas, which rise by
29.7 percent with the onset of mining. This might be due to the rise in electrification that
is noted below.

Asset accumulation
How does the opening of a mine close to a community affect the household’s probability
of having access to assets such as a cement floor, radios, and cars? The regression results
using the baseline specification show that households in Mali are 30 percentage points
more likely to have floors made of cement, tile, wood, or materials other than earth, sand,
or dung, and 5 percentage points more likely to own a car (but 11 percentage points less
likely to own a bicycle, at a 90 percent confidence level) (table 1.3). Households in Ghana
are 14 percentage points more likely to own a radio. In some cases, there are differences
for migrants and never-movers in the same communities. For example, in Mali, the positive
effects on household assets seem to be driven by migrant households. In Tanzania,
decomposition by migrant status shows that radio ownership in fact increased among
nonmigrant households. In Ghana, on the other hand, radio ownership increases for both
migrant women and nonmigrant women.

Child health outcomes
Large-scale gold mining can affect child health in different ways. First, it could change
household income. Higher income enables the household to buy better or more nutritious
food. Second, it could affect child health through changing the environment where the child
lives. Higher income could improve child (and household) health by reducing the disease
environment through making it possible for the household to buy better-quality housing—
with proper sanitation and clean water. Higher incomes can also directly buy better health

                                                 22
care. However, if large-scale gold mining decreases local agriculture, it could increase food
insecurity among households in the vicinity. Finally, if it leads to environmental
degradation and pollution that is harmful for humans, the effects on child health could be
negative.18 Therefore, a priori, how a mine affects child health remains theoretically
ambiguous.
Child health improves in Mali
In Mali, the study finds positive effects of mine opening on access to health care and health
outcomes (table 1.4, column 2). Pregnant mothers receive many more prenatal health visits.
Infant mortality decreases by 5.3 percentage points (although it is not significantly
estimated), and stunting decreases by 27 percentage points, which is equivalent to a 45
percent decrease in the prevalence from the pre-mine average rate of stunting. Stunting is
an indicator of chronic malnutrition, which affects children’s growth pattern and thus
makes them short for their age. By contrast, wasting measures acute malnutrition. Wasting
can be a life-threatening condition if the child rapidly loses weight and becomes severely
malnourished. For Mali, the estimated effect is negative but insignificant for wasting, but
negative and significant for underweight, which is a composite measure of acute and
chronic malnourishment.

  A recent study focusing on different types of mineral mines across developing countries finds that mines
associated with lead pollution lead to increased rates of anemia in women and stunting in children (von der
Goltz and Barnwal 2014), in very close proximity to large mines (<5 km).

Furthermore, the results show that the prevalence of cough, fever, and diarrhea decrease,
although all but fever are only marginally statistically significant. The significant drop in
diarrheal incidence of children in mining communities in Mali is a welcome development,
since diarrhea remains a serious threat to children in developing countries, even though it
is a disease that is easy to cure and prevent. Access to safe water and sanitation are
important in fighting diarrheal diseases, and this could be a way in which a mine affects
diarrheal incidence in Mali.
By contrast to Mali, the effects on child health are ambiguous in Ghana and Tanzania. The
likelihood that a child is stunted increases by 12.3 percentage points in Tanzania, and
underweight increases in mining communities in both Ghana and Tanzania. However, there
are some positive effects of mine openings. For instance, in Ghana, there is a large decline
in infant mortality and a marginally significant decrease in cough prevalence. The effect of
the mine on diarrheal incidence in Ghana is positive but insignificant. When this outcome
is disaggregated by groups, it reveals that migrants experience higher rates of diarrhea and
never-movers lower rates.
There are some positive effects on access to health services for children in Ghanaian gold-
mining districts. District-level analysis for five measures of child health care access show
that mothers in gold-mining districts have 0.759 more prenatal visits per child, and they
are 12.5 percentage points more likely to be attended by a trained midwife (table 1.5).
Moreover, infant mortality is 8.5 percentage points lower in active mining communities.
District-level results for Malaria and Tanzania show improvements in children’s nutrition
status in mining and neighboring districts compared to control districts (using a synthetic
control method).

To summarize, the results for children’s health are somewhat ambiguous. For instance,
there are improvements in important areas of child health, such as the observation that
infant mortality declines in all regions with proximity to the mine. But there are also some
notable exceptions. Thus, it is not clear why stunting and wasting increases in mining areas
in both Ghana and Tanzania; this is not the case in Mali. Similarly, the incidence of
diarrheal disease decreases in Mali but rises in Ghana and Tanzania, although in the case
of Ghana this appears to be driven by poor outcomes among migrants who live near the
mines.19


Access to infrastructure services
Does the opening of a mine close to a community affect the household’s probability of
having better access to infrastructure services such as electricity, a private toilet facility,
and water? The regression results using the baseline specification in table 1.6 show that
those households close to a mine are generally more likely to have access to a private toilet
facility. For example, households in mining communities in Tanzania are 24 percentage
points less likely to share the toilet facility with other households. There are differences for
migrants and never-movers in the same communities. Thus, migrants in Ghana are
seemingly less well off than never-movers and have less access to electricity. In Mali, the
relationship is reversed, with migrants having better access. District-level analysis shows
very small insignificant effects on access to electricity in mining districts in all three case



19
  The migrant communities may be economically and politically weaker and have less access to health
services and infrastructure.

positive, yet insignificant, effect on access to water in mining districts.

 1.6 Conclusion

This study examines the impacts of mines on individuals’ employment prospects and
wages, asset accumulation, child health outcomes, and access to infrastructure when they
live close to a mine or in a mining district. Overall, the results suggest that mining is
welfare-enhancing, though the results are not strong. While the evidence leans toward
improvements in welfare in most categories with proximity to a mine, this cannot be said
to be uniformly true. There is little indication, however, of deteriorating outcomes with
proximity. The results for employment and occupation suggest a move from farm labor to
other occupations (especially for women, for whom there are better data). This is most
evident from the spatial lag model. Thus, although mining is capital-intensive and its direct
labor effects are relatively small, there is some indication that the indirect effects are
transformative. Where wage data are available, such as Ghana, results indicate that wages
for those in mining are higher.
The results also point to better access to infrastructure and asset accumulation. The
evidence of an increased share of household expenditure on housing and energy is
considered a strong indicator of rising access to electricity and asset accumulation.
Finally, child health outcomes have mixed results. Overall, health outcomes such as child
mortality have declined in mining communities and districts. But decline in stunting (ratio
of height to age) and wasting (ratio of weight to age) for households in mining districts and
for individuals who live closer to mines is evident only in Mali. In both Ghana and
Tanzania, these outcomes appear worse for mining areas. Similarly, the incidence of
diarrheal disease decreases in Mali but rises in Ghana and Tanzania, although in the case
of Ghana this appears to be driven by poor outcomes among migrants who live near the
mines.
Migration patterns may explain some of the differences in child health outcomes across
countries. For instance, Mali, which shows the most positive changes, is also the country
with the lowest level of migration around the time of mine opening, and migrants in mining
areas in Mali seem less vulnerable than in Ghana or Tanzania. Tanzania, which shows little
evidence of structural transformation and few gains in child health, seemingly has the
largest increase in migration flows after mine opening.
In short, the econometric and case studies reveal little evidence that the local mining
communities suffer a resource curse due to resource abundance. If anything, these
communities experience positive, albeit, limited welfare benefits on average. Most of these
positive effects are experienced through the market channel. One question that arises is
whether the market effects can be enhanced. There is always a temptation to increase the
backward linkages via local content laws. Local content requirement (LCR) implies
replacing some imported inputs with costlier domestic ones. As with all protection,


                                             27
resources are thus pulled into activities in which they do not have a comparative advantage.
Advocates for LCR usually propose two reasons why this is beneficial: First, they argue
that over time producers of these inputs become more productive as they acquire new
technology and skills—learning by doing. This is essentially an infant industry argument,20
which claims that developing countries need time through protection to nurture their true
comparative advantage. Secondly, there may be other positive spillovers from these
linkages, such as increased worker training and managerial skills and experience, which
raise the productivity of other sectors as well. For these reasons the adoption of LCRs has
become widespread in general in Africa and quite ubiquitous in the oil and gas sector.
But there are problems associated with LCRs. For example, many LCRs are too vague to
be workable. The main reason for this is that regulators often have no special insights into
what is feasible. Local capacity, often, simply does not exist and attempts to calibrate the
impossible will either be ignored, circumvented or, in the worst case, prohibitive, thus
choking off the flow of foreign investment. Moreover, protection is a major cause of rent
seeking. The application of LCRs is likely to encourage rent-seeking behavior by all
stakeholders. In addition, LCRs actually imply national rather than local procurement.
Mining often takes place in remote areas where the capacity to provide intermediate inputs
is constrained. So firms source the inputs nationally, which may benefit the national
economy but have little local impact. In fact, the local impact may be negative: if firms
reduce output in response to the higher costs imposed on them they will reduce
employment thereby hurting the local economy. Lastly, if firms do in fact reduce output in
response to the LCR and if corporate revenues are reduced, which is likely (some would
say ‘inevitable’) then government revenue will be reduced as well. These costs may
completely or partially offset the benefits from LCRs.
Thus, governments may be better advised to focus on developing the conditions for
improved procurement than mandating it. As McMahon and Moreira (2014) warn: “the
failed experience of many import-substitution plans suggests that linkages cannot be forced
upon the mining sector without enabling business conditions.” To create enabling business
conditions, they cite improving fundamentals such as better power and transport
infrastructure, adequate human capital, access to finance, economies of scale, and outreach
or technical assistance programs. What policies will be effective in improving local supply
chain linkages will in the end depend on country conditions.
Broadly, it is clear that most benefits from extractives, in an African context, are likely to
be fiscal and national, because the government, as the owner of the resources on behalf of

20
  The infant industry argument, strictly speaking, requires the presence of a positive externality. If the
domestic inputs were potentially cheaper through learning by doing there would be no need for
protection: it would pay the companies to invest in them themselves. Some of the benefits will be
external so the companies themselves will not get the benefit. Alternatively, one may argue that the
multinationals have limited information about local potential and therefore government intervention is
needed.

                                                     28
the people, is the conduit of the benefits to the rest of the economy, including to local
communities. The empirical evidence shows that the size of resource-related
intergovernmental transfers to local communities has been modest so far. There is, thus,
considerable potential to improve welfare at the local level through larger transfers that can
support investment in much-needed infrastructure and development of human capital. By
improving worker productivity, the public sector will help strengthen the impact of market
forces unleashed by extractive activities. Moreover, it will also help diversify the local
economy, which will be important in sustaining growth after the large-scale mining boom
ends. Of course, both nationally and locally, the quality of governance and its influence on
how resource revenues are used will be a key determinant of the welfare impacts of natural
resources. Enhancing the capacity of local jurisdictions—bureaucrats and policy makers—
to deliver public spending programs will need to be high on the policy agenda.

There is a well-developed academic literature examining the socioeconomic impacts of
resource abundance, especially at the country level. The focus of this literature has been on
whether natural resource abundance is bad for economic development—the so-called
natural resource curse. Aragón, Chuhan-Pole, and Land (2015)21 systematically review the
evidence and theoretical arguments behind the so-called resource curse, along with other
impacts at the country level. A simple analytical framework is then developed to
understand how resource booms could impact local communities. The framework
identifies four possible ways in which a resource boom could exert a local economic
impact. Among these are the market channel of increase in demand for local labor, goods,
and services and the fiscal channel of increase in public spending on local services through
the taxation of natural resource wealth. The analysis highlights the importance of the
market compared to fiscal mechanisms to create positive impacts, and shows that the
channel through which resource rents reach a local community matters. Given that resource
wealth creates rents, often very large, that can be easily appropriated when institutions are
weak, the review also underscores the importance of local institutions for the effectiveness
of the fiscal channel in creating a beneficial impact.

Available empirical evidence on the impact of resource abundance on local growth,
employment, and living standards is examined to better understand the importance of these
different mechanisms. Similar to recent country-level findings, the evidence suggests that
a local resource curse is not inevitable, and that in some cases extractive activity has lifted
local growth. It also supports the importance of the channel through which resource rents
are distributed. When resource rents are distributed using public channels, a resource
windfall does not seem to improve welfare. By contrast, when resource rents reach a local
community through the market channel, there may be some positive effects. More research
is needed to see if developing local supply chain linkages may be more effective in
improving local living standards than sharing the revenue windfall with local governments
when institutions are weak. Despite the paucity of empirical evidence, especially for
developing countries, the emerging literature is opening new ways to think about the
relation between natural resources and economic development.

 2.1 Theory and evidence on the impact of resource abundance at
       the country level

The literature on the economic impact of natural resources in developing countries has been
largely dominated by the phenomenon that some resource-rich economics tend to have
worse economic performance than resource-poor countries, that is, the resource curse.22
Examples abound of poor outcomes in countries with abundant natural wealth. For
instance, Nigeria’s oil revenues increased almost tenfold between 1965 and 2000, but in
that same period, real income stagnated and both poverty and inequality increased (van der
Ploeg 2011). Similarly, Venezuela, a primary beneficiary of the increases in oil prices in
the 1970s, suffered a steep decline in per capita output of 28 percent from 1970 to 1990
(Lane and Tornell 1996). In Zambia, Africa’s largest copper exporter, the incidence of
poverty remained virtually unchanged at 60 percent during 2000–10, despite a doubling of
economic output during this period. There are exceptions to this rule of resource curse—
notably, Botswana, Chile, and, Norway, all of of which have been successful in
transforming their resource wealth into economic prosperity. Moreover, resource-abundant
countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Sweden, which are now high-income
countries, were long ago able to diversify their economies and reduce their dependence on
natural resources.

2.1.1 Analytical underpinnings of the impact of resource abundance

Theoretical explanations for the resource curse can be grouped into three broad categories.
First, a boom in extractive industries can crowd out other industries, such as manufacturing,
that are more conducive to long-term economic growth; this is the Dutch disease argument.
Second, dependence on primary sectors could leave an economy vulnerable to changes in
commodity prices, which may be more volatile. Third, the windfall from natural resources
can exacerbate rent-seeking, corruption, and conflict in a society. These phenomena can
lead to bad economic policies, deterioration of institutions, and lower income and growth.

Dutch disease. One of the earliest explanations of the link between resource abundance
and lower economic growth is provided by the Dutch disease (Corden 1984; Corden and
Neary 1982). Dutch disease models typically assume that an economy produces traded
goods (manufacturing) and nontraded goods (services). In these models, a boom in natural
resources exports represents an income windfall23 that increases aggregate demand and
raises the price of nontraded goods relative to traded goods. In the short run, this relative



22
   This literature is vast and has been reviewed extensively. See Deacon (2011); Frankel (2011); Rosser
(2006); Stevens (2003); and van der Ploeg (2011), for example.
23
   See van der Ploeg (2011, section 3.1) for a formal exposition.

                                                  33
price movement, which is effectively an appreciation of the real exchange rate,24 causes
the output of the nontraded sector to expand, while the traded sector contracts, and factors
of production (such as labor and capital) reallocate from the traded sector to the nontraded
sector. The effect on the wage-rent ratio depends on the labor intensity of the nontraded
industry. In particular, if this industry were more labor intensive, the wage-rent ratio would
increase.25,26

This market response to a revenue windfall is not by itself negative. In order to explain
why resource booms may weigh down economic growth, one needs to assume that the
traded sector crowded out by extractive industries is somehow more conducive to
supporting growth. This would be the case if the traded sector benefits most from learning
by doing and other positive externalities, such as human capital externalities (Krugman
1987; Matsuyama 1992; Sachs and Warner 1995; Torvik 2001). If the traded sector exhibits
increasing returns to scale, as in big push models (Murphy et al. 1989), then a shift of
resources away from this sector could also be detrimental to growth.

Exposure to changes in commodity prices. A second argument for the negative effect of
resource abundance on growth relies on the observed pattern of higher volatility and, until
early 2000, long-term decline of commodity price. Thus, natural resource exporters may
be exposed to higher volatility of terms of trade. The uncertainty stemming from this
volatility could, in turn, reduce investment in physical or human capital.27 If technological
progress is assumed to be driven by learning by doing or human capital externalities, then
the decline of investment associated with price volatility can constrain economic growth.
In resource-exporting countries, fiscal revenue is often heavily dependent on resource
revenue. For example, Angola, the Republic of Congo, and Equatorial Guinea rely on oil
for around 75 percent of government revenues. Price volatility, and associated boom-bust
cycles, can make it more difficult to implement prudent fiscal policies.

Rent-seeking, corruption, and conflict. Increasing attention is being given to political
economy channels in explaining poor development outcomes in resource-rich countries.
This is because resource abundance creates rents that can be easily appropriated when
institutions are weak. In the absence of strong institutions, resource rents may foster rent-


24
   This happens because the price of nontraded goods is set domestically, while the price of traded
goods is set in international markets.
25
   Note that in this context, short run and long run refer to whether capital is fixed or not.
26
   A more realistic model would assume that the extractive sector also employs labor and capital. In that case,
in addition to the short-run changes in relative prices and crowding out of the traded sector (the spending
effect), there would also be a reallocation of resources to the extractive sector, with negative effects on both
traded and nontraded sectors.
27
   Aghion et al. (2009) argue that with imperfect financial institutions, firms exposed to exchange rate
fluctuations are more likely to hit liquidity constraints and be unable to invest. Gylfason et al. (1999) propose
a model in which price volatility deters firms from moving toward high-skilled tradable sectors, which
demand investments in human capital, and instead keep them producing commodities.

                                                       34
seeking behavior, increase corruption, erode quality of institutions, and, in extreme cases,
even generate violent conflict.

Aragón et al. (2015) identify at least five political economy channels in the literature
through which resources can hinder economic growth and welfare. First, resource
abundance may increase rent-seeking—for example appropriation of resource rents via
production taxes or other transfers—and reduce net return to investment (Lane and Tornell
1996; Tornell and Lane 1999). The implications of lower investment on growth follow the
argument presented above. Second, resource windfalls can attract entrepreneurial skills
away from productive activities to more profitable, but socially inefficient, rent-seeking
(Mehlum et al. 2006; Torvik 2001). Third, rent-grabbing possibilities can increase political
corruption (Brollo et al. 2013) and undermine the development of democratic institutions
(Ross 2001). With additional revenues, politicians can appropriate rents, while increasing
spending to appease voters. The increased opportunities for grabbing rents, in turn, attract
other corrupt individuals to the political arena, leading to a deterioration in the quality of
politicians. The high reliance of budgetary revenue on natural resources, as opposed to
taxation of citizens, also weakens government incentives to build (or strengthen)
institutions of accountability. Fourth, resource booms can increase the returns to predation
and promote rapacity over these resources, which can fuel violence and civil conflict
(Collier and Hoeffler 2005; Grossman 1999; Hirshleifer 1991). Conflict can have adverse
consequences on a country’s capital stock and investment, reversing development gains. It
can also weaken state capacity. But resource booms do not necessarily increase violence.
Dal B´ o and Dal B´  o (2011) argue that if resource booms raise the opportunity cost of
participating in violence, for example, by increasing the returns from productive activity,
it could actually reduce violence. Finally, ethnic differences allow the formation of stable
coalitions which can facilitate resource-fueled conflict (Caselli and Coleman 2013).



2.1.2 Country-level evidence of the natural resource curse

Several studies have systematically examined the empirical evidence on the resource curse.
While early analysis from a cross-section of countries found a negative association between
resource abundance (measured as the relative size of primary exports) and GDP growth
(Gylfason et al. 1999; Leite and Weidmann 1999; Sachs and Warner 1995, 2001; Sala-i-
Martin 1997), recent empirical studies (Lederman and Maloney 2007, 2008) find that
evidence of the natural resource curse is far from conclusive. Recent empirical work
questions the robustness of the results to alternative specifications and measures of
resource abundance. A fundamental critique offered in the recent empirical work is that the
measure of resource abundance (usually the relative size of commodity exports) is
endogenous. For instance, there may be other confounding factors, such as quality of
institutions, which may affect both growth and size of commodity exports. In that case, the

                                             35
resource curse would just reflect the fact that countries with bad institutions have lower
growth and are less industrialized, thus more dependent on primary sectors. For instance,
Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003) and Bulte et al. (2005) find that when adding
measures of institutions as additional controls, the relation between resource abundance
and growth disappears. Brunnschweiler (2008) and Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2008) go a
step further by arguing that the usual measures of resource abundance are actually a
measure of resource dependence. They treat this variable as endogenous and find that the
negative relation between resource dependence and growth disappears.

One possibility emerging from the empirical literature is that the effects of resource
abundance on growth may be heterogeneous, and could depend on quality of institutions.
For instance, the effect could be negative in a country with bad institutions, but positive
when institutions are good (Robinson et al. 2006). Failing to account for this heterogeneity
may lead to the wrong conclusion that the effect is insignificant.



Political economy explanations for the resource curse

The cross-country empirical evidence points to the relevance of institutions, while offering
mixed support for Dutch disease and terms-of -trade volatility as explanations for the
resource curse. This suggests that rent-seeking and deterioration of governance may play
an important role in explaining the resource curse. Three sets of results point to the
importance of institutions in understanding the natural resource curse.

The first set of results suggests that the resource curse may be associated with the so-called
“point source” resources. These are resources (such as oil, minerals, and plantation crops)
whose production is concentrated in a few geographic or economic areas. This
concentration makes it easier for interest groups to control and capture their rents. For
instance, Isham et al. (2005) and Bulte et al. (2005) find that point source resources are
associated with worse political institutions and lower growth. Boschini et al. (2007) extend
this analysis by interacting the type of resource with quality of institutions. They find the
combination of abundance of point source resources with low-quality institutions is
detrimental for economic growth.

The second set of results suggests that resource abundance seems to be associated with an
increase in corruption, deterioration of democracy, and armed conflict, especially in
countries with weak democratic institutions. These results are consistent with the rent-
seeking explanation of the resource curse. For instance, using a cross section of countries,
Ades and Di Tella (1999) find that natural resource wealth is correlated with worse
subjective measures of political corruption. Bhattacharyya and Hodler (2010) use a panel
data of countries and find that natural resource abundance is associated with perceived
corruption only in countries with a history of nondemocratic rule. They interpret this as

                                             36
evidence that resource rents lead to corruption if the quality of democratic institutions is
poor. One paper (Tsui 2011) uses a panel data of countries and oil discoveries to show that
oil discoveries indeed reduce the quality of democratic institutions, but only in already
nondemocratic regimes. Oil does not seem to affect institutions in countries with
established democracies. A large body of cross-country evidence points to a positive
relation between resource abundance and civil war (Collier et al. 2004; Fearon 2005;
Fearon and Laitin 2003; Humphreys 2005; Lujala 2010; Ross 2004). This relation seems
to be driven by point source resources, such as oil, diamonds, and narcotics. These results,
however, may not be robust to including country fixed effects, which accounts for several
time-invariant unobserved omitted variables. For example, using a panel data of countries
and including country fixed effects, Cotet and Tsui (2013) fail to find a significant effect
of oil discoveries (large and small) on conflict. But there might be nonlinearities in the
relation between resource abundance and conflict, because, using a similar approach, Lei
and Michaels (2011) do find a positive relation between large oil discoveries and conflict.

Finally, the negative relation between resource abundance and growth seems to be present
only in countries with already bad institutions. In an influential paper, Mehlum et al. (2006)
show that the resource curse is essentially driven by countries with low-quality institutions.
By contrast, in countries with high-quality institutions, resource abundance does not affect
growth. Using a panel dataset of countries, Collier and Hoeffler (2009) find similar results.
In particular, the resource curse seems to be avoided in countries with strong democratic
checks and balances. Boschini et al. (2007) extend these results by adding differences in
the type of resources. They find that the curse is present only in countries with low-quality
institutions and easily appropriable resources, such as precious minerals and diamonds.



2.1.3 Insights from the country-level literature

Three conclusions emerge from the literature examining the impact of natural resource
abundance at the national level. First, natural resources, by themselves, do not seem to be
bad for economic growth. But they do become a problem in the absence of good
institutions. Second, the problem is bigger for some type of resources that are easily
appropriated, such as oil, minerals, and diamonds. Finally, deindustrialization and price
volatility may also matter, but not as much as initially believed.

The policy implications that flow from these insights, at the country level, relate to savings
and investment of resource rents and macroeconomic measures to address commodity price
volatility. The country-level empirical evidence, however, suggests that the main challenge
is not to identify the right policies, but to make societies willing (or able) to adopt them.
Hence, the main policy recommendation from this literature is that resource-rich countries
should improve their institutions in order to make the best use of a resource boom, and


                                             37
avoid its more deleterious effects. This is consistent with several efforts to improve
governance in resource-rich economies and to understand how to build durable and
effective institutions. This recommendation is consistent with the vast literature in
development economics that highlights the importance of institutions (especially the ones
that improve property rights) for economic development.

The use of country-level data has significantly advanced our knowledge on the impact of
resource abundance. This literature, however, has several limitations. First, there are still
relevant concerns regarding the causal interpretation of results. The presence of omitted
variables, reverse causality, and measurement error are important empirical challenges in
this literature. Scholars have tried to address them by including richer set of covariates,
exploiting panel datasets, and using instrumental variables. These solutions, however, still
fall short relative to experimental and quasi-experimental approaches currently used in
applied economics.

Second, the impacts (positive or negative) of resource abundance are unlikely to be
uniformly distributed in a country. For instance, many negative spillovers (such as
pollution and population displacement) have a local geographic scope. Distribution of
resource rents usually targets certain populations. Similarly, the impact of the demand of
extractive industries for inputs may be felt more intensively in specific local markets. These
local phenomena cannot be studied by looking at cross-country variation.

Finally, the main policy implication, that is, that countries need to improve institutions to
benefit from a resource boom, may offer only limited practical policy insight. An unsolved
question is what stakeholders, such as extractive firms, local communities, or funding
agencies could do, short of fostering an institutional reform, to ameliorate the negative
effects of resource abundance and enhance its potential benefits. Exploring the local
impacts of resource abundance may shed some light on this question.



2.2 Assessing the local impacts of resource abundance

Increasingly, attention is turning to analyzing the impact of resource windfalls on local
communities where these resources are sourced. In contrast to the country-level literature,
which focuses on the country as a unit of observation, the focus is instead on subnational
units such as states, counties, or municipalities. By exploiting variation within a country,
the literature is able to improve the empirical strategy for assessing the impact of resource
booms and explore novel mechanisms. There are, however, new empirical challenges that
need to be taken into account, in particular confounding changes in prices and population
that may affect the interpretation of results.


                                             38
2.2.1 Analytical framework

The economic literature suggests at least four possible ways to analyze the local economic
impact of natural resource booms. One way is to analyze resource abundance as a change
in local endowments, leading to specialization in primary sectors (and corresponding
changes in relative prices) at the expense of other traded sectors, such as agriculture and
manufacturing—in effect, a local Dutch disease. Another is to consider natural resources
as a source of fiscal revenue to local communities, so that a resource boom translates into
a fiscal revenue windfall. This fiscal channel is at the center of the country-level literature.
A more novel approach relies on viewing resource booms as an increase in the demand for
local goods and inputs, that is, a positive demand shock. Finally, there are the impacts of
resource abundance on local environmental and social conditions, such as pollution, which
have received some empirical attention of late.

Resource endowments and specialization

If we treat local areas as small open economies, then we can study this change in
endowments within the framework of the standard Hecksher-Ohlin model of international
trade. Specialization in the primary sector would involve an increase in input prices, such
as wages, prompting a reallocation of inputs. In turn, this would increase the cost and price
of nontraded goods relative to traded goods. If traded sectors experience faster productivity
gains, then specialization in natural resources would hinder long-term economic growth
and local income, assuming the population is fixed. A schematic of this model is presented
in Annex A.2.1. Predictions from models incorporating this specialization mechanism can
be tested empirically: change in relative prices, with the price of nontraded goods rising
relative to traded goods; a reduction in the local size of industries producing nationally
traded goods—for example, measured by employment shares, share in wage bills, or share
in local income; and a negative impact on local economic growth and income.



Local fiscal revenue windfall

Natural resources can be considered as a source of fiscal revenue to local communities,
that is, a fiscal revenue windfall. This windfall eases the hard budget constraint of local
governments, and supports higher public spending. The revenue windfall could have both
positive and negative effects on economic welfare. Figure 2.1 presents an analytical
framework of the transmission channels and the impact on local outcomes. In so far as the
windfall is used to improve the quantity or quality of local public goods and services, such
as roads, hospital, schools, and housing, there would be the potential to improve human
welfare outcomes, such as health and education outcomes. Moreover, to the extent that

                                              39
public goods are productive inputs, or create positive spillovers, as in the case of transport
infrastructure, a resource boom could also increase local income and growth. The positive
effect of revenue windfalls is underpinned by several assumptions: local politicians are
responsive to the broad population, which requires well-functioning local institutions and
a healthy degree of political competition (Besley and Burgess 2002)28; and local
bureaucracies have the technical capacity to provide those public goods and services. Lack
of responsiveness of local politicians to demands from the broad population or lack of
technical capacities of local bureaucrats, may undermine the positive effect of revenue
windfalls on public good provision and local living conditions.



                                 Figure 2.1 Fiscal revenue windfall




At the local level, a vast literature suggests that clientelism and vote buying are important
distortions. Clientelism refers to transfers made by a political elite to a narrow group of
poor or disadvantaged voters to secure their votes and maintain political power. Evidence
shows that this targeted redistribution may deteriorate provision of public goods.29 For
instance, in the Philippines, Khemani (2013) documents a negative relation between vote-
buying and delivery of primary health services. Using the case of local governments in
rural Maharashtra, Anderson, Francois and Kotwal (2014) argue that clientelism may lead
to poor governance, even in a context of free and fair elections and active political
competition.30


28
    In the absence of good democratic checks and balances, the revenue windfall can fail to significantly
improve public good provision (Caselli and Michaels, 2013) and lead instead to corruption and worsening of
political selection (Brollo et al. 2013).
29
   For a comprehensive review of the literature see Bardhan and Mookherjee (2012) Vicente and
Wantchekon (2009), and references therein.
30
   In contexts with weaker democratic institutions, political capture may also be relevant. We discuss this
  literature in more detail in Section 4.2.

                                                    40
The “rapacity” and “opportunity cost” effects discussed in the country-level literature on
conflict, may also explain a failure of resource windfalls to be converted into welfare gains
at the local level. Booms associated with “point” resources such as oil and gold (as distinct
from “dispersed” resources), may be more prone to generate a rapacity effect, since they
mostly increase appropriable rents, but may have a relatively smaller impact on local
wages.31 The literature also indicates that an absence of adequate reallocation and
compensation policies, amid competition for scarce resources, will have negative
redistributional consequences and can lead to conflict.

The fiscal revenue windfall channel highlights the importance of local institutions,
especially political institutions and fiscal decentralization arrangements. These institutions
are the subject of increased focus in the local-level literature. The theoretical political
economy literature has emphasized the importance of political institutions, such as
electoral rules and the form of government (Lizzeri and Persico 2001; Persson 2002).
Subnational evidence is consistent with these predictions. For instance, Besley and Case
(2003) find that different political institutions between U.S. states such as voter registration
procedures, use of primaries, restrictions on campaign contributions, or supermajority
requirements affect the degree of political competition and representativeness of elected
authorities. In turn, this translates into differences in spending and taxation. Pande (2003)
finds that in India, political reservation (wherein some seats in state legislatures are
reserved to candidates from minority castes) affects the size of public transfers to some
disadvantaged groups. Zhang et al. (2004) find that in China, the use of elections to select
local authorities (instead of appointment by the central government) was more conductive
to a better allocation of public expenditures. Similarly, Besley and Coate (2003) find that
elected utility regulators implement more pro-consumer policies than appointed ones.

A second set of institutions includes fiscal decentralization arrangements. These are rules
that define how fiscal revenue will be collected, distributed, and used at the subnational
level. The literature on fiscal decentralization is discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.4.



Local Demand Shock

A resource boom can represent an increase in demand for local goods and inputs (Aragón
and Rud 2013). A positive demand shock is plausible in contexts in which extractive
industries use locally supplied inputs, such as labor or intermediate materials. Note that a
similar effect could occur if rents of extractive industries are transferred directly to the local



31
  However, booms associated with dispersed agricultural resources, such as coffee, banana, and tobacco,
may have a greater effect on local wages, and thus increase the opportunity cost for conflict participants
(Dube and Vargas 2013).

                                                   41
population. Think of this as a direct dividend. Examples of this are the impact benefit
agreements in Canada and the permanent fund dividend in Alaska. The extent of the
economic linkages of extractive activities would determine the size of the local demand
shock. It should be noted, however, that strong backward linkages cannot be assumed in
all contexts. A useful framework to examine the general equilibrium effect of such
localized demand shocks is provided by models of spatial equilibrium (these models are
increasingly used to analyze local housing and labor markets). One commonly used model
is the Rosen-Roback framework, where a country is comprised of several cities or local
economies and every local economy produces a single internationally traded good using
labor, land, and a local amenity. Labor is homogenous and in infinite supply, while land is
in fixed supply and immobile. A resource boom would mostly benefit owners of immobile
factors, and real wages are equalized across locations. Figure 2.2 depicts the framework
for understanding how this positive demand shock would impact local outcomes.

Extending this framework to incorporate an upward sloping supply curve for both labor
and land or housing (Greenstone et al. 2010; Moretti 2011), yields more nuanced effects of
a local demand shock. A positive shock in the local demand for labor would initially
increase nominal wages. This, in turn, would attract workers from other cities, pushing
down wages and increasing housing costs. The net effect, however, depends on the
elasticity of supply of both labor and housing. Thus, the demand shock can lead to an
increase in real wages, and welfare, of workers. Under certain conditions, for example if
workers in different industries are substitutable, there could also be wider positive
spillovers.

Spatial equilibrium models suggest that local demand shocks would attract workers and
increase the local population. This may well increase congestion and create additional
pressure on local services, such as education and health. Yet, the growth in population
could also generate positive effects in the form of agglomeration economies: gains in
productivity associated with the clustering of economic activity. A growing body of
evidence, mostly from the United States, suggests that the magnitude of agglomeration
economies in manufacturing and high-tech industries is not trivial.32 There is little
evidence, so far, on the magnitude of agglomeration economies generated by extractive
industries. Agglomeration effects are explored in a recent paper by Fafchamps et al. (2015)
on the contribution of gold mining to proto-urbanization in Ghana, which draws on central
place theory.

Moretti (2011) also points to heterogeneous effects across tradable and nontradable sectors.
In particular, the model predicts that the demand shock would benefit mostly the
nontradable sector, such as services. The effect on tradable sectors is ambiguous. This
effect may be negative due to the increase in wages and land rents. Although, there may be
a beneficial effect from increasing agglomeration economies associated with the larger
population. Thus, it is not clear whether a resource boom would encourage or crowd out

                                            43
manufacturing. This prediction contrasts with the standard Dutch disease argument, which
would predict deindustrialization.

This framework predicts several impacts of a resource boom, if there are strong backward
linkages:

        Resource booms would have a positive effect on nominal wages and labor
         outcomes, such as participation rate, number of hours worked, or employment
         rates.

        Resource booms could increase real wages, and real income, of local populations,
         and lower the incidence of poverty.

        There may be positive spillovers working in several industries not directly linked
         to the extractive activity, and surrounding localities.

        Resource booms would be associated with the migration of workers and an
         increase in the price of nontraded goods, such as housing.


These predictions have some important implications for empirical analysis. One is that
migration induced by the resource boom may change the spatial distribution of a
population’s productivity. This could happen, for instance, if high-productivity workers are
more able to benefit from the boom or face lower migration costs, or if low-productivity
workers are displaced away from resource-rich areas. The worry is that an increase in local
real income would just reflect the change in population composition, not real improvements
in economic well-being. The importance of these compositional effects is case specific.33

While this framework predicts a possible positive impact of resource booms on real
income, it is less clear what would be the effect on other measures of human well-being,
such as education and health. On the one hand, education and health outcomes could
improve due to an income effect. In addition, if the resource boom is biased toward high-
skilled workers it could increase the returns to education. On the other hand, the increase
in wages could increase the opportunity cost of education and discourage it (Atkin 2012).
A similar effect can occur if the extractive industry demands low-skilled workers and, thus,
reduces the skill premium. In terms of health, an added consideration is that environmental
pollution can reduce, or offset, the benefits from higher income.




33
  Some empirical strategies to address this concern include using individual panel data, focusing on
subpopulations that reside in the locality before and after the resource boom, and examining
observable population characteristics (such as measures of human capital) that may be indicative of
the importance of compositional changes.


                                                44
However, the literature on country case studies amply highlights that extractive industries
in less developed and remote settings are associated with limited local hiring, procurement,
product sales, and distribution of profit, especially if large-scale and foreign owned. In the
policy arena, the Africa Mining Vision of 2009 has as its central pillar the aspiration to
move mining on the continent out of the enclave and into a more locally integrated form
of socioeconomic development.

Negative Externalities

Mining and mineral processing can generate several types of negative externalities
impacting local community welfare. For instance, these activities can generate significant
amounts of air pollutants from dust from blasting and earth-moving operations, fumes from
smelters and refineries, and exhaust of gasoline engines of heavy machinery. If toxic
emissions are relatively large, they can deposit on the ground as acid rain, which
contributes to soil degradation and can have cumulative negative effects (Menz and Seip
2004). Mining activities can also release industry-specific pollutants, such as cyanide,
sulfuric acid, mercury, heavy metals, and acidic drainages (Dudka and Adriano 1997;
Salomons 1995). These pollutants can have negative, cumulative effects, on quality of soil
and water sources. Similarly, small-scale and artisanal mining operations can pollute air
and water. The most notorious example is pollution from mercury used in gold
amalgamation.

Environmental pollution can adversely impact health (Currie et al. 2013; Graff-Zivin and
Neidell 2013) and, more broadly, labor supply and labor productivity (Graff-Zivin and
Neidell 2012; Hanna and Oliva 2011). There is evidence that pollution can adversely affect
cognitive outcomes and educational attainment (Almond et al. 2009; Lavy et al. 2012) and
increase school absenteeism (Currie et al. 2009; Gilliland et al. 2001; Park et al. 2002;
Ransom and Pope III 1992).

Another possible important pollution externality is the loss of agricultural productivity
(Aragón and Rud 2015). The mechanisms through which this may take place have been
examined in recent literature. One is through directly affecting crop health and growth
(Heck et al. 1982; Miller 1988; Marshall et al. 1997), which translates into lower yields.
Another is through degrading the quality of key agricultural inputs, such as soil and water
(Menz and Seip 2004; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2012). For instance,
deposition of air pollutants in the form of acid rain can lead to soil degradation. The
increased acidity leaches nutrients from the soil, reduces plants’ ability to absorb remaining
nutrients, and releases toxic metals, like aluminum. Finally, air pollution can reduce labor
productivity (Chang et al. 2014; Graff-Zivin and Neidell 2012). The loss of agricultural
productivity can have a negative impact on agricultural output, and, through that channel,
affect income of farmers and rural populations. This externality can be particularly relevant


                                             45
when extractive industries are located in the vicinity of rural areas, in which agriculture
remains an important source of livelihood.

This framework has several implications for empirical analysis. First, it suggests examining
the effect of resource booms on nonincome measures of well-being such as indicators of
human health: mortality rate and incidence of illness. Second, it points to other possible
outcomes such as worker productivity, labor supply, and agricultural output. Finally, it
emphasizes the loss of agricultural productivity, through which resource booms could
negatively affect local income, especially in rural areas.

2.2.2 Empirical evidence on local impact

In contrast to the country-level literature, the empirical literature exploiting within-country
variation is more recent and less developed. There are, however, a growing number of
studies already expanding this literature that are reviewed by Aragón et al. (2015). Broadly,
the literature has focused on the impact of resource abundance on growth, employment and
local living standards, corruption and conflict, and pollution.

Impact on growth. Using a cross section of subnational data from the United States,
several studies have replicated the growth regressions used in the cross-country literature
(Douglas and Walker 2013; James and Aadland 2011; Papyrakis and Gerlagh 2007). A
more recent study (Zuo and Jack 2014), examined the impact on growth using data from

                                              46
         Chinese provinces. For the most part, these studies detect a local resource curse (table 2.1).
         However, it is difficult to interpret these results in a causal way because these studies suffer
         the same limitations of omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and measurement error as
         the country-level resource curse empirics.

         Impact on employment and local living standards. In a shift away from the cross-
         country growth regressions, several studies have treated resource booms and busts in
         developed resource-rich countries (United States, Canada, and Australia) as shocks to the
         local demand of labor and examined the resulting economic spillovers (table 2.2).34 These
         studies show that booms in coal mining, oil, and gas generate positive employment

         34
           Black et al. (2005) use county-level data from the coal-rich areas in U.S. Appalachia to examine the short-
         term economic impact of the coal boom in the 1970s and subsequent bust in the early 1980s. Marchand
         (2012) uses data from Western Canada to examine the effects on local labor markets associated with the
         1970s energy boom and bust. Fleming and Measham (2014) study the employment spillovers associated with
         the recent boom of coal seam gas in Australia. Michaels (2011) examines the long-term economic impact of
         oil discoveries in the Southern United States. He uses county-level data covering 1940 to 1990 and exploits
         geological variation in oil abundance. Allcott and Keniston (2013) extend Michaels ’ (2011) study to rural
         counties in the entire United States. More recently, Jacobsen and Parker (forthc oming) extend Black et al.’s
         (2005) study to the Western United States. They focus on oil and gas boomtowns created during the 1970s
         increase in energy prices. They also use county-level data but observe a longer time span, that is, 1969 to
         1998. This allows them to explore the effect of a bust after a longer period.

                                                                47
spillovers in the short term—that is, increase in jobs and nominal wages in other industries.
But these studies provide less clarity about the crowding-out of local manufacturing, with
some studies documenting a reduction in the relative size of manufacturing, and others
finding evidence of an increase in manufacturing activity. This points to booms generating
possible agglomeration effects (increase in size of local markets) that benefit local
manufacturing. Another limitation of these studies is that they do not examine the effects
on real income and other measures of well-being.

Whether these local effects of resource booms carry over to less developed countries is
being addressed by a limited, but growing, literature. From the analytical framework on
local demand shocks, it follows that the economic effects at the local level depend on
several context-specific factors, such as the degree of economic linkages of extractive
activities (which determine the size of the local demand shock), substitutability of labor
among industries, and labor mobility.

Caselli and Michaels (2013) use municipality-level data to examine the local economic
effect of oil-based fiscal windfalls in Brazil. They find that oil production is associated
with an increase in oil royalties paid to local governments and in public spending.
However, the impact on provision of local public services is minimal. There is no
significant improvement in housing quality or quantity, supply of educational or health
inputs, or welfare receipts.35 There is also a negligible effect on household income and
population size.

These findings suggest that oil production has not been particularly beneficial to the local
population, because the extent of economic linkages between oil companies and local
economies is limited in Brazil. Instead, circumstantial evidence suggests that the oil
revenues were used to fund patronage and extract rents, and were embezzled by officials.
Using data from all municipalities (not only the recipients of oil royalties), Brollo et al.
(2013) find that fiscal windfalls are indeed associated with an increase in political
corruption.

Two studies have examined the impact of mining on local economies in Peru. Aragón and
Rud (2013) examine the importance of economic linkages in the case of Yanacocha, a large
gold mine in the Peruvian highlands. Using household-level microdata and a difference-
in-differences approach, they find that backward linkages had a positive economic impact
on real income and poverty reduction. The benefit of the local demand shock extends to
local population not directly linked to mining, such as farmers and service workers. Similar
to the findings of Caselli and Michaels (2013), they find that increased local revenue and
public spending associated with the resource boom do not translate into higher household

35
  Using the same case but a different methodology, Monteiro and Ferraz (2010) also document
that the oil windfall is associated to reported increases in expenses and size of the public sector,
but no improvement in public services to the local population.

                                                48
income. Using a rich dataset at the district level, Loayza et al. (2013) find a positive relation
between measures of living standards (such as poverty, consumption, and literacy) and
mining production, but not with government transfers associated to mining tax revenue.36
Findings from Brazil and Peru cast some doubt on the usefulness of revenue-sharing
schemes as a policy instrument for local communities to benefit from resource booms.

The more recent, though limited, literature on developing countries suggests that the
presence of backward economic linkages from mining might play an important role in
determining local economic outcomes. It also suggests that more research is needed to
understand how revenue-sharing schemes can be an effective policy instrument for local
communities to benefit from resource booms.

In one of the few studies focusing on Africa, Kotsadam and Tolonen (2015) examine the
effect of mining on local employment. They use a rich dataset at the individual level for
several Sub-Saharan African countries, and implement a difference-in-differences
approach exploiting the opening and closure of mines. This study finds that mine openings
seem to create new employment opportunities outside agriculture, and significant structural
shifts. Interestingly, these effects are differentiated by gender. Women switch toward
service sectors, while men move toward skilled manual jobs. Moreover, women’s
participation rate decreases with mine openings, while men’s participation rate increases.
These structural changes seem to persist after mine closures, at least for women. After a
mine closure, men return to agricultural jobs, but women do not shift back to agricultural
production. Instead, they leave the labor force. The authors interpret these findings as
evidence that mining works as a boom-bust economy on the local level in Africa, but with
permanent (negative) effects on women’s labor market participation.




36
   Moreover, they find suggestive evidence that mining is associated with an increase in inequality. The
authors highlight that this increase in inequality, among other factors, may explain the opposition of local
communities to mining projects. A similar relationship among resource booms, income, and
inequality has been reported in the c a s e o f Australia (Reeson et al. 2012). Interestingly, this
study suggests that the relation between mining and inequality may have an inverted U-shape.

           Impact on corruption and conflict. There is a small but growing literature on within-
           country evidence linking resource booms to corruption and conflict (table 2.3). As
           discussed earlier, evidence from Brazil (Brollo et al. 2013; Caselli and Michaels 2013)
           suggests that the fiscal revenue windfall associated with oil royalties has increased
           corruption and rent-seeking at the local level. A fiscal revenue windfall is also associated
           with changes in political outcomes. For example, Brollo et al. (2013) argue that an increase
           in revenues allows bad politicians to increase public spending, while diverting rents. This
           translates into higher reelection rates of incumbents. Monteiro and Ferraz (2010) also
           document a similar increase in incumbency advantage, but only in the short term.

           Anticipation of a windfall could change political behavior even before resources are
           actually extracted. This could happen because anticipated rents (from future resource
           extraction) increase the value of political positions, and politicians may start competing for
           office now in order to capture future rents. Vicente (2010) examines this issue in the context
           of São Tomé and Principe’s announcement of oil discoveries. He uses microdata at the
           individual level with retrospective information on perceived corruption. He finds that oil
           discovery announcements are associated with an increase in perceived vote buying and
           corruption across a range of public services, such as customs, public procurement, state
           jobs, health care, and police.

           The empirical study of resource abundance on local conflict has focused on exploring two
           possible mechanisms: the opportunity cost effect and the rapacity effect. As previously
           discussed, these mechanisms have different implications for the effect of resource booms

                                                             51
        on conflict, depending on the type of resource being exploited. Resources that increase
        local wages, such as agricultural products, decrease conflict by affecting the opportunity
        cost of conflict. By contrast, resources that create appropriable rents, such as oil, diamond,
        and minerals, may encourage conflict through a rapacity effect. Dube and Vargas (2013)
        provide convincing evidence of the importance of both the opportunity and rapacity effects.
        Using municipality-level data from Colombia, they find that increases in oil, coal, and gold
        prices are associated with an intensification of conflict, while the opposite is true for
        increases in the international prices of agricultural products, such as coffee, banana, sugar,
        palm, and tobacco.

Impact on pollution. There is a vast literature highlighting the potential for mining and
other extractive industries to pollute the environment. The negative effect of pollution on
human health and, through that channel, on labor supply and labor productivity has also
been documented in several studies (see references above). Despite these findings,
empirical work directly examining the socioeconomic impacts of mining-related pollution
is limited.

Some recent work examining mining pollution points to localized impacts on health and
education. For example, Rau et al. (2013) examine the impact on educational achievement
of children living in proximity to a deposit of mineral waste, which had hazardous levels
of lead and other heavy metals, in northern Chile.37 These children were found to have
higher concentrations of lead in their blood, and worse academic performance. The study
estimates that this translates into a significant loss of earnings in adulthood.38 van der Goltz
and Barnwal (2013) examine the effect of mining on human health outcomes using a rich
microdataset from 44 countries and a difference-in-differences approach. They find
suggestive evidence that mining is associated with an increase in stunting and anemia
among children and young women, respectively. The effects are localized in the vicinity
of mines (that is, within 5 kilometers [km]). Interestingly, these effects occur despite an
increase in household wealth, spotlighting the trade-off between economic benefits and
health costs that mining communities may face.

The importance of a pollution externality (that is, loss of agricultural productivity) that may
occur when potentially polluting industries are located in the vicinity of rural areas is well
highlighted by Aragón and Rud (2015). The study focuses on the effect of pollution on
agriculture in the context of large-scale gold mining in Ghana. The authors find robust
evidence that cumulative gold production (a measure of the stock of pollution) is associated
with a significant reduction in agricultural productivity, with the effects concentrated closer
to mines sites, that is, within a 20-km radius of mine sites, and declining with distance.39
This loss of productivity is associated with an increase in rural poverty. They rule out
alternative explanations, such as mines competing for local inputs (and increasing input
prices), or changes in the composition of the local population, that may occur in the
presence of selective migration (table 2.4).




37
   This is a case of environmental negligence in northern Chile in which hundreds of houses were built in the
proximity of a deposit of mineral waste.
38
   The estimated figure is around US$60,000 for the average affected individual.
39
   Using satellite imagery, they also document an increase in the concentration of air pollutants in the
proximity of mines.

          2.2.3 Insights on impacts at the local level

          Although the literature on the local impact of natural resource abundance is still emerging,
          it is already providing valuable insights. First, and in line with the country-level literature,
          it suggests that a local resource curse is not inevitable. On the contrary, there are some
          examples in which resource abundance has no detrimental effects. A provocative idea is
          that the channel through which resource rents reach a local economy might matter. When
          resource rents are distributed using public channels (such as a revenue windfall to local
          governments), resource booms do not seem to improve living standards, and may even
          foster negative side effects such as conflict, rent-seeking, and corruption. By contrast, when
          these rents are distributed through market channels (such as an increase in demand for local
          workers), resource booms may bring some economic benefits to the local population, at
          least in the near term. The failure of fiscal channels can reflect preexisting institutional
          factors that limit the responsiveness of local politicians and facilitate rent-seeking, as
          suggested by the country-level literature.




                                                          54
Second, there is no conclusive evidence that resource booms lead to deindustrialization,
despite the increase in price of local inputs. On the contrary, in some cases, resource booms
are even associated with an increase in manufacturing activity. This finding is the opposite
of what we would expect from the standard Dutch disease arguments, and suggests that
other effects, such as agglomeration economies, may also be relevant.

Finally, this literature highlights the importance of examining a broad range of outcomes,
besides income and growth. Evidence linking resource booms to local demand shocks,
employment shifts, and pollution suggests that natural abundance may also affect other
measures of human well-being such as inequality, education, and health.



2.2.3 Input-output analysis

Analysis based on input-output models and Social Accountability Models are useful for
economic planning and ex-ante impact evaluation. These tools construct mathematical
models of an economy and then calculate the change on economic outcomes associated
with changes in some variables, such as spending or output. Depending on data availability,
these models can be built to describe regional and local economies, and thus inform about
impacts at the subnational level. Their predictions are informative of what the economic
effect of a mining project could be. Some countries, like Canada and the United States,
routinely use I-O models to assess the ex-ante economic impact of extractive industries.
But a main limitation of these models is that they do not tell what the effect actually is, for
reasons that are well known (the Lucas critique).

.

2.2.4 Role of institutions at the local level

As noted earlier, a second set of local institutions for effective use of fiscal revenues
includes fiscal decentralization arrangements. These are rules that define how fiscal
revenue will be collected, distributed and used at the subnational level. Aragón et al. (2015)
find that the literature points to a limited scope for decentralization of mining-related taxes.
The main sources of mining revenue, such as corporate tax and royalties, may be better
managed by higher government tiers (national or regional) on grounds of efficiency, equity,
and reduced administrative cost. There are, however, some tax tools that could be suitable
to local governments, such as property taxes, surtaxes, and land use fees. Importantly, it
also points to the importance of intergovernmental transfers to match increased local needs
and to compensate local populations.

In practice, intergovernmental transfers are important tools to redistribute mining revenue
among local populations. Transfers consist of nonmatching unconditional transfers,


                                                55
nonmatching conditional transfers, and selective matching transfers (cost-sharing
programs). From an analytical perspective, nonmatching transfers create an income effect,
while matching transfers change the relative price of public goods, thus also creating a
substitution effect.

Another way to classify transfers is based on their source of funding. Some transfers are
paid with funds from the national budget. Others are linked to a particular source of revenue
or tax. This last type of transfer, also called a revenue-sharing or tax-sharing scheme, is
commonly used to distribute mining revenues. Revenue-sharing schemes usually define
the sharing rate and allocation procedure by law and thus are less subject to the
uncertainties of annual budget negotiations. These schemes effectively give local recipients
ownership over part of the stream of future fiscal revenue.

The main advantages of revenue-sharing schemes are their simplicity and transparency.
They also give incentives to local politicians to support mining activities. But they have
several disadvantages. First, if they are based only on certain taxes, they may bias national
tax policy. In particular, they may discourage national fiscal efforts to collect those taxes.
Second, if they share the revenue from origin-based production (as in the case of mining-
related sharing schemes), they can break the link between revenue needs and revenue
means at the local level; in other words, targeted localities may end up receiving too many
resources. In turn, this can reduce the accountability of local politicians and their incentives
to spend public funds efficiently. A similar phenomenon can occur if the sharing rate is
applied uniformly, and thus revenue is unrelated to actual spending needs. Third, if
revenue-sharing schemes depend on only a few taxes (such as mining firm corporate taxes),
then their funding is exposed to industry shocks, such as changes in commodity prices.
This can increase the volatility of local fiscal revenue. Finally, if tax collection is done
locally and shared with the national government, then revenue-sharing schemes can create
perverse incentives among local authorities to reduce fiscal effort or underreport tax
revenues.

There is a lack of quantitative studies examining how different fiscal decentralization
arrangements used to distribute mining revenues can shape the effect of this windfall. The
current literature mostly focuses on examining how different degrees of decentralization
affect income growth or corruption at the country or regional level. These studies use
measures of expenditure or revenue decentralization, such as share of subnational
governments in tax revenues or public spending. While not aimed at understanding how
decentralization of mining revenues affects local communities, this literature might be
informative of the overall impact of fiscal decentralization.

Related work examines the link between decentralization, corruption, and local capture.
Evidence from less developed economies shows that decentralization can facilitate capture
of local governments and collusion between local officers and local elites. For instance,

                                              56
Galasso and Ravallion (2005) find that the targeting performance of the Food for Education
program in Bangladesh is worse in communities where land inequality is greater, and they
interpret this as evidence of elite capture. In Ecuador, Araujo et al. (2008) find evidence
that local capture of a social development fund was more likely in villages with greater
inequality. Jia and Nie (2015) show how decentralization has facilitated collusion between
coal mines and industry regulators in China, and that this has translated into poorer safety
standards, and increased mortality rate of workers.



 2.3 Conclusion

A review of the emerging research on the local impact of natural resource booms and
sharing of resource rents is beginning to provide new insights on how the channels through
which these shocks are transmitted matter. First, a number of empirical studies find that
resource abundance may have negative effects by increasing corruption, deteriorating local
political processes, and even increasing conflict. This evidence is similar to the cross-
country literature, but is far from conclusive. Second, this work highlights the importance
of studying other local phenomena such as the general equilibrium effects of local demand
shocks, migration, and environmental pollution. These factors may also affect welfare and
make the impact of natural resources more nuanced. Finally, there is a well-developed
literature discussing several tools to distribute resource rents, and the principles that guide
fiscal decentralization. There are, however, still several limitations and unsolved questions
that merit further study.

A main limitation of the literature is that it is still emerging and, consequently, there is a
paucity of robust empirical evidence on the effect of resource abundance on employment,
local income, distribution of income, and poverty, especially in developing countries. The
available evidence is sparse and focuses on a handful of countries—namely, the United
States and Canada among developed countries and Brazil and Peru among developing
countries. Research in other resource-rich contexts, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, is
needed to increase the external validity of these results and to better inform policy makers
and practitioners.

A related issue is the limited number of quantitative studies exploring the effect of
extractive industries on nonincome outcomes such as health, education, and pollution
externalities. The few existing studies suggest that the impacts on health and agricultural
productivity can be important and costly. Again, additional research is needed to gain a
more complete view of the scope and magnitude of these negative spillovers, and to better
understand the mitigation actions needed to ameliorate these potential negative effects.



                                              57
Because the empirical literature on the local impacts of resource booms is still emerging,
findings need to be interpreted carefully. For example, available research highlights the
importance of market compared to fiscal mechanisms to create positive local impacts. It
suggests that in the context of already weak institutions of governance, developing local
supply chain linkages may be more effective in improving local living standards than
sharing the revenue windfall with local governments. More empirical analyses are needed,
however, to confirm these initial findings and to evaluate the effectiveness of different
policies in developing these local linkages.

The findings of the review suggest that more quantitative research is needed to examine
the effect of resource abundance on political outcomes. The existing evidence, mostly from
Latin America (Brazil and Peru), already suggests that the revenue windfall associated with
resource abundance may hinder political selection and increase corruption. There is a
paucity of evidence, however, from other regions with different institutional contexts, such
as Sub-Saharan Africa. Different institutional arrangements may attenuate, or exacerbate,
these negative effects. As the delivery of public services and programs is increasingly
shifted to local governments, including local politicians, local governance issues and
institutions of accountability are of paramount importance. There is also a lack of evidence
examining the effect of resource abundance on less violent forms of conflict, such as riots
and civil unrest.

In addition, there is a paucity of empirical evidence assessing the political economic impact
of different fiscal decentralization arrangements. The existing evidence examines the effect
of the overall degree of decentralization, but it is not informative of the importance of the
specific institutional arrangements, such as type of transfers, type of revenue-sharing
schemes, or type of competences devolved. These features may affect the impact of
resource revenues on local income, corruption, or local political responsiveness. Similarly,
there is not much evidence on which institutional factors contribute to the success (or
failure) of fiscal decentralization. Understanding these questions is crucial to inform the
design of fiscal decentralization.

Finally, a related issue is the role of technical capacities of local bureaucrats and public
officials. Even if local governments have the political will to use revenue windfalls to
promote local development, they may lack the appropriate technical capacity to formulate
and implement necessary public programs and projects. Some studies, using the Peruvian
case, suggest that lack of capacity may be important and affect local governments’
spending ability (Aragón 2013; Aragón and Casas 2009). More research is needed,
however, to understand the main technical constraints faced by local governments, their
effect on the ability of communities to benefit from a revenue windfall, and the best policies
to alleviate them.

Chapter 3: Insights from Three Country Case
Studies

 3.1. Introduction

Industrial gold mining is a natural choice for studying the socioeconomic impact of natural
resources in Africa. As noted in Chapter 1, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania are not new gold
producers, but the advent of large-scale, industrial gold mining is recent and has been
growing rapidly. Hence, it is possible to discern changes brought about by large-scale
mining via “before- and-after” type studies, as well as by studying the outcomes and
changes in mining areas as opposed to nonmining areas. However, each country is a special
case, so the country studies constitute an integral part of the overall analysis by considering
the specific country context.40 This section summarizes elements of those studies, noting
similarities and contrasts.
The point of departure in each of the studies comes from the tension between the national
or macroeconomic gains from minerals and the local gains. This arises from the fact that,
in all three countries, subsurface minerals belong to the national state, and the central
government as guardian exercises ownership rights over those minerals. Local host
communities have no property rights to the minerals. For the country as a whole, the
benefits flow from exports and fiscal revenue.41 For the mining areas themselves, these
benefits may appear remote and their impact minor or imperceptible.
There are three mechanisms, or channels, through which the impacts are felt: (a)
employment, income, and other positive spillovers such as improved infrastructure, worker
training, and management; (b) government revenue: since government is the main recipient
of the benefits from the minerals, the mechanism by which the revenues are distributed to
the subnational authorities and, particularly, the mining ones, is a key determinant of the
local impact; and (c) the negative externalities: the revenue benefits are national but the
environmental and other costs such as congestion and population displacement will be
local. As noted in the preceding chapters, while the national cost-benefit may have a
positive balance, the mining areas themselves may not. The case studies therefore track the
impact of mining through these three channels to gain insights into the country-specific
institutions, practices, and outcomes. This chapter will examine these findings after a brief
description of the role of large-scale mining in each country.


40
   This chapter draws on the three background papers, Sanoh and Coulibaly (2015) on Mali, Smith and
Kinyondo (2015) on Tanzania, and Ayee and Dumisa (2014) on Ghana.
41
   As discussed in Chapter 2, there may also be costs in the form of Dutch disease and other elements of the
so-called resource curse.

3.2. Country Background: Gold Mining in the three Countries

The role of gold: Important but not dominant
Large-scale gold mining and extractive industries in general are relatively capital-intensive
industries. From a macro perspective, since foreign multinational companies own much of
the capital, the returns to domestic factors of production, in particular labor, are relatively
small. Thus, because mining is not a major employment generator, the national benefits
from mining are mostly in the form of government revenue and net exports.
The contribution of gold mining to GDP in each of these countries is modest. In Mali, the
poorest of the three countries, about 7 percent of GDP is due to mining and quarrying; in
Ghana it is 5.5 percent (Bermudez-Lugo, 2012), and in Tanzania it is 4 percent.42 However,
in all three, the value of gold exports is substantial (figure 3.1) and gold is an important
component of exports: for Mali, the annual average between 2000 and 2013 was 69 percent
of exports; for Ghana, gold averaged 38 percent of exports over the same period; and in
Tanzania, the figure was 31 percent (figure 3.2). Mali, in particular, with gold being such
a large part of exports, is sensitive to the price of gold. The country study (Sanoh and
Coulibaly 2015) notes the perception that the price of gold is the key determinant of
business cycles in Mali. Although this dependence is not as strong in Ghana and Tanzania,
it is nevertheless significant. Not surprisingly, the price of gold is a key determinant of the
terms of trade, which is always a crucial factor in the macroeconomic fluctuations of
developing countries. The contribution of gold mining to government revenue varies: in
Mali, revenue from gold mining constitutes 25 percent of central government revenue; and
in Ghana, the comparable figure is 4.9 percent; whereas in Tanzania, it was barely 2.5
percent. The contribution of gold mining to fiscal revenues is discussed in more detail
below.




42
  GDP records the domestic value added of the gold exports —that is, the total value of exports minus the
associated imports (though this will sometimes be recorded separately.) Disposable income, however, is the
important variable with regard to national welfare. Thus, gross national income (GNI), which accounts for
factor payments to and from abroad, will deduct the repatriation of profits by the gold-mining companies.
Other things being equal, the contribution of mining to national income will therefore be less than its
contribution to GDP. The repatriation of revenue will be reduced by the royalties and taxes paid by the
companies. Hence, government revenue represents the domestic capture of the rents from mining.

Recent trends show that large-scale mining has contributed to the surge in exports and
government revenue from mining. Gold mining, however, is not new to these countries,
and has for the most part been done by artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM). The
background papers explore this activity in more detail, and elements of these are
summarized in box 3.1.

     Box 3.1 Artisanal and small-scale mining
     Sometimes known as “traditional” or informal mining, ASM combines mining activity with activities such as
     agriculture and livestock breeding, or even with informal activities such as services and production of
     craftwork. Also, the size of ASM activity fluctuates with the gold price and other employment opportunities
     and prospects. The scale of ASM varies considerably from cooperative ventures to individual miners. Some
     ASM operations are licensed, but others operate informally. For these reasons, it is also difficult to estimate
     the numbers involved in this activity at any given time.
     For Ghana, the estimate of the number of people who were working at ASM in 1998 was 200,000, and it is
     estimated that now there could be as many as 1 million. The number is also difficult to accurately estimate in
     Tanzania, though Smith and Kinyondo (2015) report an estimated 550,000. The authors also estimate the
     output from ASM as being equivalent to that of a single large-scale mine. Their survey of a few ASM sights
     in Tanzania revealed that 50 percent of the miners regarded ASM as their sole source of income, and around
     25 percent of them had been active for 5 to 10 years. This suggests that the activity is more stable than
     commonly thought.
     For Mali, the exact number of artisanal mining sites is unknown, but was estimated by the government to be
     around 350 in 2009. In addition, the number of communes reporting artisanal gold mining as an important
     economic activity has been on the rise from 9 communes in 2006 to 17 in 2008 and 25 in 2013. Employment
     estimates in the artisanal gold-mining sector vary considerably—from 6,000 to 200,000 and up to 1 million
     according to different sources (Sanoh and Coulibaly 2015). However, the latest population census estimates
     the number of people involved in artisanal gold mining at 25,000.
     Because of its informality, ASM is notoriously difficult to tax and regulate. In Ghana, it is estimated that
     300,000 workers are involved in unlicensed (that is, illegal) mining. (These are known as galamseys.)
     Although the evidence is mostly anecdotal, the sector is thought to be one of lawlessness, occasional mayhem,
     and with hazardous working conditions. Accidents involving injury and death are frequent and often go
     unreported. Miners are also exposed to mercury and cyanide poisoning, and to environmental hazards
     including water pollution. In Mali, local authorities receive payment of duties and taxes in the allocation
     permit or title authorizing artisanal mining.




 3.3. Channel 1: Employment, Linkages, and Positive Spillovers

Modern large-scale mining does not employ many workers. It has historically been capital-
intensive, and this feature has increased over time with technological progress. For the
country as a whole, this magnifies the extent of the windfalls via exports and central
government revenue, but may lower the amount of value added paid to indigenous factors,
mainly labor. Thus, extractive industries have been characterized as “enclaves,” cut off

                                                    70
from the domestic economy except through royalties and taxes. The benefits to the
economy as whole therefore depend crucially on how the central government uses the
windfalls and, as is well known, that is often not well in developing countries.
Partly in answer to the criticism that employment in the mines is low, the companies and
chambers of mines argue that although globally small, the number employed is locally
significant and can raise average income and expenditure in the vicinity of the mine.
Second, it is argued, mines are linked to local industry through the use of inputs of other
goods and services. Employment and income is stimulated through these (backward)
linkages. The country studies examine these claims complementing the empirical
evidence of Chapter 4 on the employment and income effects of proximity to a mine.
Third, analysts argue that industrial mining raises productivity in the area by improving
infrastructure for its own needs and also through worker and management training. The
companies also at times invest directly, through social responsibility endeavors, in
improving infrastructure, health, and education.Employment
The country case studies report that the companies employed mostly nationals as opposed
to expatriates, although managerial jobs went disproportionately to foreign nationals. In
Mali, Sanoh and Coulibaly (2015) report a ratio of 14 national workers to each expatriate,
and that on average, 78 percent of the jobs are held by people working in mines located in
three communes, or local government entities (Gouandiaka, Sadiola, and Sitakily).
Employees of the mining firms in Mali earn around US$1,200 per month on average.
National labor survey data suggest that the mean income from mining activity is higher
than the average income for all other activities, and considerably so when compared to the
agricultural or industrial sectors.
In Tanzania, employees of large-scale mining firms are typically based at the mine site, but
also internationally and in regional offices, including in Mwanza (Tanzania’s second city,
on the southern shore of Lake Victoria) and Dar es Salaam (the country’s commercial and
administration hub). The total number of jobs, as expected, is relatively small, particularly
when compared to a workforce of 22.1 million (2012 census) and the 70,000 Tanzanians
entering the labor force each year. Nonetheless, employees of the large mining companies
are typically well remunerated compared to national average income levels. The average
monthly income from a manufacturing job is TSh 103,407, compared to TSh 76,277 in
mining, TSh 49,693 in construction, TSh 31,301 in trade, and only TSh 15,234 in
agriculture, currently the largest source of livelihood for Tanzanians (ESRF 2009). Further,
it is clear that the vast majority of employees are Tanzanian and not foreign (figure 3.3), as
is often argued, although the balance tilts further toward foreign workers when just
management positions are considered.

In Ghana, the total number of people employed was 17,103 in 2014 (Government of Ghana
2014), of which only 289 were expatriates. In Tanzania, employment increased from
around 2,000 in 2005 to around 7,000 during 2010–13 (figure 3.4), and in Mali, the total
number of workers directly employed averaged 3,635 during 2008–13.

Linkages
It is difficult to estimate the linkages (or multipliers) because of data limitations. However,
although the description “enclave” is not accurate, it is also fair to say that the backward
linkages are not large. For example, for South Africa, where better data are available, gold

                                               72
mining is estimated to have a multiplier of around 1.8. In Mali, Sanoh and Coulibaly (2015)
report that for every job in the mines, a further 1.67 jobs are “created” elsewhere through
backward linkages and expenditure effects.
The multiplier effects are limited partly because of the capital intensity of the industry, but
mostly because of the lack of local cost-effective procurement opportunities. This could
change over time as the companies become better acquainted with local markets and
suppliers, and also as local entrepreneurs learn to take advantage of the relatively new
developments. In Tanzania, efforts have been made to improve the potential for local
procurement, including in services such as catering, vehicle repair, machine shop services,
welding, metal work, electrical work, and plumbing. However, the proportions of inputs
sourced locally remain low, a situation mirrored in Ghana and Mali. While there is always
a temptation to increase the linkages via local content laws, governments may be better
advised to focus on developing the conditions for improved procurement than mandating
it. McMahon and Moreira (2014) caution that: “the failed experience of many import-
substitution plans suggests that linkages cannot be forced upon the mining sector without
enabling business conditions.” Instead, they advocate a focus on improving business
conditions, such as better power and transport infrastructure, adequate human capital,
access to finance, economies of scale, and outreach or technical assistance programs.
The studies note (and the empirical results confirm) that the mines do succeed in raising
incomes in the near vicinity. The higher wages also attract migrant workers. This can have
the effect of raising some prices such as rents and food prices, so that some local residents
who may not be recipients of the higher mine wages may experience a loss of real income.
The inflow of workers may also strain social services and crowd out some of the original
residents.
Externalities
Direct development investment by the mining firms has traditionally been labeled
corporate social responsibility (CSR), with examples of typical projects including
secondary school construction, clinics, and water infrastructure. For example, Newmont
Ghana Gold Limited has supported Ghana’s Ahafo region via a partnership in the health
sector that has supported health centers by constructing housing for resident nurses and
three community health compounds in local villages, and equipped 60 local health
“volunteers” with bicycles and medical equipment. However, there is a growing trend in
the three countries for more sustainable projects that offer alternative livelihoods to mining
(for example, brickmaking and fisheries) in the communities around the mines. This
reflects greater interest in helping communities prosper after mine closures (World Bank
2002), and widespread recognition of the disappointing results (Campbell 2012).
Projects across the board have had mixed success and take a long time to implement. These
are problems and afflictions similar to almost all foreign aid and government interventions,
particularly where implementation capacity is limited. Challenges include ensuring that the
                                              73
investment has sufficient operational funding to provide an adequate level of the intended
service. For example, in Tanzania, the mining firms have often promised to build a school
or classrooms, with the government pledging to fund equipment and the recurrent costs of
providing education. Many of the complementary commitments are not legally binding,
however, and often do not happen in a timely manner, or at all.
There are some instances where infrastructure has been improved by the multinational
mining firms, but these remain rare. Gold mining differs from bulk mineral mining, and
infrastructure benefits are expected to be limited. Roads must only be good enough to get
inputs to the mine sites, since the mineral exports are typically flown out. When links
cannot be made to national electricity grids, large-scale mines develop their own exclusive
power supplies. Beyond some road improvement, infrastructure benefits are usually
associated with CSR investment in the community (that is, not directly related to
production needs).
Ayee and Dumisa (2014) note that, in Ghana, opinion surveys reveal unrealistically high
expectations by the public from mining. These expectations often focus on the provision
of public goods and services. Local governments often lack the capacity to provide these
benefits even when additional revenues are present. Consequently, the public pressures the
mining companies to step in for the government, for example, by building schools, health
facilities, and, transportation infrastructure. While this may sometimes be the best available
option, Ayee and Dumisa point out that there are also obvious risks in ceding responsibility
for the provision of public goods to a foreign-based private corporation. In addition, mines
inevitably are eventually exhausted. This is always a blow for the local economy but much
more so when the departing company is also the provider of basic services.
In Mali, mining companies also contribute substantially to local development funds43 that
are not under the control of local authorities. During 1994–2010, the contribution of mining
companies to the financing of local development amounted to more than 7 billion CFA
francs resulting from license fees and nearly 20 billion CFA francs from special
development funds. In general, the amount of license fees from each mine is lower than
the amount of special development funds, except for the three mine sites of Yatéla, Loulou,
and Morila, which represent 57 percent of the total license fees but only 17 percent of total
special funds. Sadiola commune is by far the biggest contributor, at 59 percent of license
fees and 71 percent of special development funds. This is because that mine has been
operating for the longest time (figures 3.5 and 3.6).




43
  The amounts contributed are not based on any standard formula but are decided mine by mine or specified
in the mining convention. These funds should be seen as another direct form of compensation for some of
the costs imposed by mining activities.

The sectoral distribution of the development fund within mining communes depends
largely on their needs and the complementarity with their own budget spending. In Sadiola,
more of the funds have been spent on agriculture (23 percent), while in Fourou, almost 83
percent of the fund has been spent on education. In Sanso and Gouandiaka, the focus has
been on infrastructure spending (31 percent and 50 percent, respectively). The largest part
of the development fund in Sitakilly was spent on relocating the local population (table
3.1). Because these funds are controlled by mining companies, they have more sway on
how the funds are spent. The government considers these funds to mining communes as
de-facto transfers, because they come as a deduction from equity returns to be paid to the
governments (ODHD 2011).44

 3.4. Channel 2: Government Revenue

The main sources of government revenue from gold mining are dividends accruing from
state equity participation; property rates, ground rents, profit taxes, and excise and import
duties; and royalties. Government revenues increased considerably in each of the three
countries during 2001 to 2013, although levels reportedly dropped in 2014 following a
decline in international gold prices. During 2005–13, gold mining provided the government
with US$362 million per year (annual average) in Mali, compared to US$300 million per
year in Ghana and US$137 million per year in Tanzania (figure 3.7). In Mali, it was
primarily customs duties, and, later, taxes, which drove the increase in mining’s
contribution to government revenue (figure 3.8).

In Tanzania, tax and royalty payments to government were limited in the years following
the opening of the first few large-scale mining projects, reportedly averaging only US$30
million per year between 1999 and 2006. This led to the claim that the incentives offered
to the companies to attract the investment gave away too much in terms of tax exemptions
and concessions. Despite an increase in the price of gold, tax holidays meant firms were
making only partial payments of corporate taxes, and despite tightening the terms of the
deals, most deals (Mineral Development Agreements) have stability agreements, locking
in the original terms.45 Nevertheless, taxes and royalties did improve to an average of
US$77 million a year during 2007–09, and then to an average of US$260 million a year
during 2010–13. However, a debate remains as to whether Tanzania has received a fair
amount of tax and royalty payments, given the volume of mineral produced.
In Mali, tax revenues from the mining sector increased steadily as a percentage of total
government resources, rising from 10 percent in 2005 to 25 percent in 2013, having peaked
at 33 percent in 2012, a year that was particularly difficult with regard to the mobilization
of resources because of the war in the north of the country. The strong growth of the mining
sector’s contribution to the national budget was due primarily to revenues from customs
duties, and secondarily to domestic taxes.

All three countries are concerned about whether gold mining has been adequately taxed.
Sanoh and Coulibaly (2015) report that in Mali, the tax burden on the mining sector (the
ratio of the tax revenues of mining companies to the value-added of mining activity) is
more significant than the tax burden on the whole economy (the ratio of the total tax
revenues to the country’s GDP), an average of 57 percent compared to 14 percent (figure
3.9). In 2012, the seven mining companies and their subcontractors represented 45 percent
of all corporate taxes in Mali. However, this average tax burden on the mining sector is
within the range of taxation on the mining sector observed in other countries like Canada
(60 percent), South Africa (45 percent), and Papua New Guinea (55 percent) (Bhushan and
Juneja 2012). While in developed countries the tax burden is a reflection of the high
environmental costs of mining, in Mali that is not the case.




45
 This delayed the start of the payment of large-scale gold-mining company corporation tax. Added to this
was the concession that mining firms could offset all equipment and machinery costs against revenues, and
were exempt from the value-added tax on goods and services.

Fiscal sharing
The central government owns the resources and therefore the revenues. The benefits from
a natural resource will depend to a large extent on whether the revenues are put to good
use. If history is a guide, there is ample reason to be cautious. In particular, the areas where
mines are located have no property rights to the minerals and may feel deprived of the
benefits while bearing the bulk of the costs. The fiscal arrangements between the central
and local governments at various levels will therefore determine how much of the benefits
from mining find their way back to the mining areas. In addition, the general competence,
honesty, and, overall implementation capacity of the local-level government will be key to
enhancing welfare and development.
The country studies show that Mali had the highest degree of fiscal decentralization and,
therefore, the local authorities received a larger proportion of the revenues compared to the
other two. Ghana is in the middle of the three in this regard, and its decentralization efforts
are relatively new. Tanzania has a rather rigid centralized mechanism. All revenues are
garnered by the central government. Transfers from the central budget fund 90 percent of
local government. The funds are allocated according to criteria and priorities unrelated to
the location of mines or the source of the funds.
Ghana
Ghana is an administratively centralized country with three local levels—districts,
municipalities, and traditional “stools,” presided over by traditional chiefs. Mineral
resources in Ghana are owned nationally by the people, and their management (according
to the constitution) is vested in the hands of the government. While the government is the

                                                78
caretaker of the minerals, corporations can apply for reconnaissance and prospecting
licenses to search for specific minerals. The 1992 Constitution of Ghana recognizes a
decentralized local government system to achieve this objective. Since 2007, the
government has mandated that 7.5 percent of total government revenues are to be
transferred to the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) by way of a
district transfer system. To supplement the transfers, MMDAs also collect internally
generated funds from various sources, including rates, license fees, and fines that constitute
between 1 and 20 percent of all MMDAs’ revenues. For mining royalties’ payment, the
government takes the biggest share, 90 percent. For the remaining 10 percent, 4.95 percent
is allocated to the MMDA where the mine is located and 2.25 percent to the traditional
stool where the mine is located (Ayee and Dumisa 2014).
Mali
The local authorities in Mali are recognized as autonomous, with specific responsibilities
related to the provision of public services. Despite some progress in the administrative and
financial empowerment of local authorities, local authorities are still to a large extent under
the authority of the central government with regard to resources, or even acts and decisions
related to their respective territories. The government seems to be more concerned about
national unity and the integrity of the territory than the enhancement of the transfers and
public resources to communities.
The local authorities in communes where gold production takes place are supposed to
receive 60 percent of local taxes paid by commercial mining firms and 80 percent of license
fees paid by small-scale miners. Producing Cercles are meant to receive 25 percent and 15
percent of these taxes, respectively, while producing regions retain 15 percent and 5
percent, respectively. Commercial mining companies are exempted from paying these
taxes during the first three years of operation. Unfortunately, local authorities do not have
the means to determine the actual level of the license fees that are supposed to be distributed
among them. In fact, license fees from mining companies are not actually distributed, as
required by the above-mentioned law. The share actually allocated to communes represents
73 percent of the total amounts collected instead of 60 percent according to the law. As a
result, all the other levels of local authorities receive less than the percentages required by
the law, 17 percent at the Cercle level (while the law requires 25 percent), and 1 percent at
the regional level (while the law requires 15 percent).
In general, Malian local authorities have a low rate of revenue collection and therefore a
low level of self-financing capacity. As a result, the transfers and subsidies from the
government represent the main source of revenue to support current and especially
investment expenditures. The analysis of the budgetary46 accounts from 5 mining
communes and 24 neighboring communes indeed reveal a low level of tax collection.

46
     These budgetary accounts do not include expenditures done by the state on behalf of the communes.

                                                     79
Because of the licensing fees paid by mining companies to local authorities, the mining
communes generate more of their own revenues compared to nonmining ones. These
license fees represented more than 50 percent of mining communes’ revenues between
2011 and 2013 compared to just 2 percent for neighboring communes (figures 3.10 and
3.11). Although mining communes are less dependent on the transfers from the
government, they still remain exposed to the risks related to the closing of mines or the
drop of production in this sector because license fees payments are a function of turnover.

Tanzania
In Tanzania, all gold mining revenues accrue to the central government, with the exception
of recent annual payments of US$200,000 per mine. There is no earmarking of revenues
and little point in tracking how much of the gold mining taxes and royalties make it back
to the respective districts. The gold in Tanzania belongs to the country and not the local
population, and government expenditure in the gold mining local government authorities
(LGAs) is largely unrelated to the revenues provided. In theory, expenditure is linked to a
needs-based formula, but in practice, there are substantial inequities in the allocation across
LGAs (ODI 2014). The formula is based on various measures of need, but because
employment costs dominate the transfers, financial flows for the most part follow the
number of public servants (mainly teachers and health workers), and this depends in turn
on where public servants can be encouraged to locate. Five of the six LGAs hosting large-
scale gold mining receive less in per capita terms than the national average (with the
exception of Tarime District Council

 3.5. Negative externalities: The costs borne by mining areas

As noted in Chapter 2, all types of mining can pollute and cause environmental damage
unless carefully managed. But even when carefully managed, there are still substantial risks
to local communities. Mercury is typically used in artisanal and small-scale mining, and
not used in large-scale gold mining; instead, cyanide is used, and although highly toxic, its
use is typically better controlled. Nonetheless, large-scale mines do produce toxic tailings,
which can be spread by wind, and when tailings dams rupture, the results can be
catastrophic.47 People are often forced to relocate for environmental and other reasons upon
the opening of a mine. If the costs of environmental damage and resettlement were treated
with the same multipliers and subtracted from the overall impact, the declared benefits
would be smaller. These external costs are an obvious source of tension between
communities and local authorities, and also between local and national governments.
Arguments asserting the existence of a resource curse often point to the potential for natural
resource windfalls to exacerbate rent-seeking, corruption, and conflict in society. Mining
firms face challenges of securing their investments from theft and violence, some of which
is fueled by community perceptions that they are not benefiting from the mine. In April
2009, armed thieves stole about 100 kilograms of gold worth US$4.2 million from the
Golden Pride Mine in Tanzania, and the North Mara Mine has experienced regular raids.
More commonplace is the intrusion of small-scale miners onto the mine site to access
tailings and mining opportunities. However, despite the contestation and ongoing violence,
the mines have continued to produce at a high level (Holeterman 2014).
In Tanzania, corruption is pervasive and a problem with roots wider than mining. However,
there have been cases of grand corruption directly relating to large-scale gold mining. In
2008, the case of Alex Stewart Assayers become public. Following concern in the early
2000s that the mining firms were engaging in tax evasion or fraud, the government in 2003
hired Alex Stewart Assayers, a U.S.-based company, to audit gold production, with the aim
of ensuring that Tanzania receives a fair deal. However, Alex Stewart Assayers also
received tax-free status, and was contracted without a formal tender process, without any
experience auditing mining companies, and on terms that would leave them with a fee of
1.9 percent of the marketed value of the audited gold exports, leaving only 1.1 percentage
points of the 3 percent royalty for the government. The auditing carried out by Alex Stewart
Assayers eventually cost the government US$70 million, without revealing any tax evasion
or fraud by the large mining companies (Cooksey 2011).




47
  For example, when the tailings dam at the Baia Mare gold mine in Romania failed in 2000, cyanide leaked
into the Somes River killing 1,400 tons of fish and contaminating the water supply of 2.5 million people, at
huge cost.

 3.6. Outcomes

The studies overall show marginal improvements in welfare indicators in mining areas,
though lack of data prevents drawing definitive conclusions. The study on Mali exploits a
relatively rich data source on socioeconomic indicators, which unfortunately is not
available for Ghana or Tanzania.
In Mali, for example, enrolment rates in primary schools clearly increase with proximity
to the mine, and are higher in neighboring areas than in more distant ones. Not only are the
rates higher, but they also increased faster from 1998 to 2009, these two years being the
years of the last two General Population and Housing Censuses in Mali. Outcomes for
poverty reduction are inconclusive, however: While poverty has declined across the whole
country, the pace of poverty reduction in mining communes has not been faster compared
to nonmining communes (figure 3.12).
Figure 3.12 Poverty headcount in mining and other areas in Mali (%)




A further interesting outcome in Mali is the differential population growth in mining versus
nonmining areas. The national population growth rate has averaged 3 percent annually
between 1998 and 2009, but the population growth rate in mining communes is almost
double the national rate.48 Mining communes grew on average 5.7 percent annually
compared with 3.5 percent for neighboring communes and other communes within the
same Cercle (figure 3.13). The population growth rate is above 6 percent in all mining
communes, except in Gouandiaka, where at 2.9 percent, it equals the national rate (figure
3.14). Since populations migrate from lower- to higher-income areas, the higher population
growth in mining is itself indicative of an economic stimulus. However, other things being
equal, the inward migration will tend to slow the rise of wages in the mining areas and raise
average wages in the “donor” ones. This may explain why, despite the increase in economic


48
  There are many reasons why mining areas may experience higher population growth. It could be simple
migration, or better health infrastructure in mining areas, or differential higher fertility rates.

                                                 82
activity due to mining, the reduction in poverty in these areas has not significantly
outstripped that of other areas. In other words, migration tends to be an equalizer.

Overall social outcomes in Mali are mixed. With regard to access to basic social services,
mining communes had low levels of access to electricity and improved cooking fuels
before the mining boom started in 1998. For example, less than 2 percent of the population
used electricity for lighting or improved cooking fuels. However, 30 percent had access to
an improved water source, and 50 percent to an improved sanitation facility (table 3.2). In
terms of progress, between 1998 and 2009, mining communes had significant improvement
with regard to those services where they started from a lower base. However, in 2009, only
the share of the population using an improved water source is far greater in mining areas.
This may explain the better children’s health outcomes in the vicinity of mining activity
(Polat et al. 2014 and Chapter 4). Beyond indicators of access, infrastructure outcomes in
2013 are not better in mining areas. For example, while paved road per capita is slightly
higher in mining areas, irrigation per capita49 is lower than in other areas. Mining areas
also have fewer nurses and midwives per capita than other type of communes (table 3.3).

     However, this may reflect differences in rainfall or farming intensity.

In the case of Tanzania, survey data from 2001 and 2011 are used to track changes in formal
employment opportunities in areas around the large gold mines. The surveys suggest a
considerable increase in employment opportunities, with additional jobs in 2011 relative
to 2001 in the mining towns (figure 3.15). However, as shown in figure 3.15, most of the
additional jobs were in the public sector.50 Interestingly, there has been only a small
increase in employment opportunities in manufacturing, suggesting linkages have been
fairly limited, although a lack of decline in that sector supports an argument that there have
not been local Dutch-disease-type effects from gold mining.




50
  In an export mineral boom, the booming sector is often the public sector, though in this case, the increase
in public sector employment may be due to population growth, which in part could be due to the mining
boom and the inward migration it attracts.

 3.7. Conclusions

All change in an economy brings both costs and benefits, and gainers and losers. So it is
with gold mining. From the studies reviewed here, there is little evidence of economic
decline at the national or local levels in the three countries. However, there is evidence of
negative externalities impacting communities close to gold mines. The national benefits
most likely outweigh these costs, but it is doubtful that compensation is made or effective.
Mining is not a major “employment generator.” Studies of economic growth emphasize
that higher productivity in general, and in extractive industries in particular, is a major
source of growth and development. However, if the capital is mostly foreign owned and
the industry is capital-intensive, then the main domestic recipient of the value generated by
the gold mines is the government. Thus, in the final analysis, the welfare effects of gold
mining (and generally mineral extraction in developing countries) depend on whether
government collects its due and puts it to good use.
The conclusions from the case studies presented here are suggestive but need to be
subjected to rigorous statistical analysis to yield more robust results. This analysis is the
subject of chapter 4.

Chapter 4 Socioeconomic Effects of Large-Scale
Gold Mining: Evidence from Ghana, Mali, and
Tanzania

4.1 Introduction

For more than a decade, starting around 2000, the minerals sector in Sub-Saharan Africa
has witnessed a boom. This chapter provides an approach for understanding how the
benefits from the minerals sector are captured by local communities, and it measures the
size of the impact of mining on local welfare. Since the minerals sector in Sub-Saharan
Africa is large and diverse, this chapter applies the framework developed in Chapter 2 to a
single mineral—gold. Gold mining is now an important industry in several countries in
Africa (see figure 4.1 for a map of gold mines). In 2013, Sub-Saharan Africa had four of
the top 20 gold-producing countries in the world—South Africa, Ghana, Mali, and
Tanzania. This chapter draws from studies trying to identify the local and district-level
effects of large-scale gold mining in three of the top gold-mining countries in Africa:
Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania.51 Together, these countries accounted for about 35 percent of
gold production in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2013.
Our focus on local impacts is motivated by the observation that, in general, the
socioeconomic effects of large-scale mining are not well understood. In fact, to the extent
that there is public opinion on impacts of gold mining on local communities, it is likely to
be unfavorable. This is partly because, despite making an important contribution to country
GDP and export revenue, total employment numbers generated country-wide by mines are
generally modest (see chapter 3). Adding to the negative perceptions of the sector is the
perception that the industry does not contribute enough to fiscal revenue, due to low royalty
rates and tax holidays.
This research contributes to recent attempts to analyze the welfare impacts of mining.
Evidence from Peru shows that mining districts have lower poverty rates, but also higher
inequality (Loayza, Teran, and Rigolini 2013). An important finding of the Peruvian
studies is that effects are found both around a mine (local impacts), and in mining districts.
More generally, the results show that benefits decline with distance from the mine. The

largest positive impacts are found close to a mine, defined as areas within 20 kilometers
(km) of the mine, but the impacts disappear altogether at distances that are more than 100
km away (Aragón and Rud 2013). The effects can be different at the vicinity of the mine
and district levels. Locally, the mine can have a footprint by generating direct employment,
while at the district level, welfare can additionally change because of the fiscal revenues
mining activities can bring. The fiscal revenue channel will of course depend on the
national fiscal sharing policies, which for Ghana is 10 percent of royalties. There is no
redistribution of “mining royalties” in Mali and Tanzania, although the governments
redistribute pooled funds according to criteria that have nothing to do with mining. In
addition, in Mali, municipalities with mining production receive 60 percent of local taxes
paid by commercial mining firms.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, while interest in these issues has been around longer, studies have
been slow in coming. One recent study, however, looked at all large-scale mines across
Africa, and using household data from 29 countries found that mining leads to a structural
shift whereby agricultural labor participation decreases, which is partly offset by increases
in other sectors such as services (Kotsadam and Tolonen 2015). In the case of gold, the
decrease in agricultural participation can in part be caused by decreasing productivity
within the sector because of pollution from the mines. This effect has been seen locally
around Ghana’s gold mines (Aragón and Rud 2015). Two recent studies explore the effects
of gold mining on urbanization rates in Ghana (Fafchamps, Koelle, and Shilpi 2015), and
women’s empowerment and infant health in nine African countries (Tolonen 2015).
Using a similar approach, the studies underlying this report use variation in activity status
and production volumes across gold mines to identify changes in welfare caused by the
mining activities. The studies exploit the geographic identification of observations from
existing household surveys, such as the Living Standard Measurement Surveys and the
Demographic and Health Surveys, to link mines to a household in order to analyze how
local- and district-level mining have affected the livelihoods of people residing there. First,
we present evidence on the power of a mine to generate (a) structural transformation, by
exploring effects on occupation and household expenditure; and (b) asset accumulation.
Second, we turn to health indicators and explore child health and access to health care
services. Finally, we examine access to infrastructure such as electricity and water. To
complement the local-level analysis, we explore changes at the administrative district level.
Overall, we try to determine whether both migrants and those permanently settled in the
communities can benefit from the mining activities.

Gold mining in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania
Gold mining in Ghana and Mali has a rich historical tradition. Both the ancient kingdoms
of Mali and the Gold Coast (Ghana) were renowned for their gold production, and remained
major sources of gold trade between Europe and Africa in precolonial times. For the
purposes of this study, it may seem that this historical tradition will pose a major problem
for our empirical strategy, which relies on variation in activity status and intensity of
production to identify the causal impacts at the local level. However, large-scale modern
gold mining for Ghana and Mali began during the colonial era, and only 15 years ago in
Tanzania.
To see why the historical production poses less concern for our study, it is worth noting
that gold production in Ghana, which started earlier than in Mali and Tanzania, went into
a prolonged and severe slump until the 1990s. But since the 1990s, several new large mines
have started extracting gold in the three countries. In 2000, three mines opened in Mali,
followed by an additional five mines over the next 10 years. In Tanzania, the oldest mine
among existing mines that opened in 1999 was Golden Pride, while the last one to open
within the study period was Buzwagi, which started extracting in 2009. From 1990 to 2012,
there were 31 mines in production at one time or other. Table 4.1 shows the first and last
year of activity of the gold mines included in the study, and figures 4.2 through 4.4 are
maps of the gold mines in the three countries.

 4.2 Empirical Methodology

Assessing the socioeconomic impact of gold mining
The discovery and exploitation of gold can introduce durable changes to an economy. The
macroeconomic consequences of the revenue windfall from such mineral wealth have been
the subject of a large literature in economics. In this report, we abstain from wading into
that debate and instead focus our attention on local impacts as noted in Chapter 2. At the
local level, the opening of a mine (or a cluster of mines) influences outcomes through two
channels. In one, it can “draw in” resources to the local community and create a virtuous
circle. For instance, it can increase the share of workers with higher wages. To meet the
inevitable increase in the demand for goods and services by the pool of high-income
earners, new local businesses might emerge or existing ones might expand, leading to more
demand for workers and goods and services. This process could eventually lead to the
concentration of economic activity in the local area—sometimes referred to as
agglomeration—and be self-sustaining.
The second channel is through local (or central) government action via revenues generated
from the mine(s). Imagine that the government sets aside a share of the mining revenues to

                                              93
be spent on local development. This could be implemented by the central government or
by the local government. And suppose that the local government spends the money on
productive public goods—roads, water, electricity, schools and clinics, and so on. Once
again, these public investments and services can attract more people into the area, create
new business, and eventually lead to local economic development. Thus far, these are the
possible ways in which positive socioeconomic benefits can emerge. But gold mining can
also bring zero or even negative benefits. It can poison the water and worsen health
outcomes, pour pollutants into the soil and render agriculture unproductive. Government
revenues may be spent on salaries and not on public goods. Even with no public goods,
this boom in the government sector represents a rise in income. Therefore, the question of
what impacts gold mining has on local socioeconomic development is, importantly, an
empirical question.
The econometric studies that inform this report look at two definitions of local
development. The first defines it as the district where the mine is located. The term district
is used to refer to political or administrative units that have spending authority. For some
of the countries, the latter may be due to a subnational fiscal arrangement in which the
district has authority to raise revenue and spend it. In some, it has no taxing authority but
instead implements projects on behalf of the central government as part of devolved
functions. What they have in common is that one or more mines are available in the unit
so described (for details of how districts are defined for the purposes of econometric
estimation, see Chuhan-Pole et al. 2015 and Polat et al. 2014). The second defines it as an
area within the vicinity of a mine. This section describes what this analysis looks like.


Measuring local effects of mining: District level
We begin with how to capture local impacts at the district level because conceptually it is
perhaps the simplest since we identify the effects using an indicator variable capturing
whether there are any active large gold mines in the district. Suppose that the outcome for
individual i in district d in time period t (Yidt) is regressed on an indicator for whether the
individual lives in a district with an active mine (ActiveDistrict) at the time of the survey.
The regression model also includes district ( ) and year fixed effects ( ), which will
control for cultural differences across districts, and contemporaneous changes that happen
across the country. The estimated equation looks like this:

             = 0 + 1  +  +  +  +    (1)

The above model is a difference-in-differences specification using a district panel. Quite
simply, it compares districts with and without gold mines, before and after the mines started
producing. The method allows for initial differences across districts. However, it makes a
crucial assumption—called the parallel trends assumption—which is the idea that these

                                                                  94
initial differences will not affect estimates of outcomes that will be due to the presence of
a mine, as long as the trends of the socioeconomic development in the districts were similar
before the extraction from the mines began. Under this assumption, one can deduce that
the change that happened in mining districts at the same time as the mine opening is in fact
a result of the mine (assuming that no other confounding changes happened at the same
time) (see box 4.1).
We can run this equation either using individuals as the level of observations and thus
control for their characteristics (captured by  ), or we could estimate a similar model
after collapsing the data to the district level and then controlling for the average population
characteristics (in that case captured by ( ). The standard errors are clustered at level of
treatment, the district level. Since the treatment variable is at the same level as our district
fixed effects, 1 is interpretable as the treatment effect. We refer to year fixed effect here,
because the data structure is not always so simple as to allow for the temporal variation
being defined as before and after the mine started producing.


Box 4.1 Artisanal and small-scale mining
The analytic intent of this report is to explore the impact of the large-scale, capital-intensive mining industry
in Sub-Saharan Africa on the welfare of local communities. However, not all mining in Sub-Saharan Africa
is large scale. In many Sub-Saharan Africa countries with substantial mining industries, including the three
cases covered in this report—Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania—there is an artisanal and small-scale mining
(ASM) sector, which provides employment (ILO 1999) and livelihood support for many families. It is
estimated that around 1 million people in Ghana, 200,000 in Mali, and 550,000 in Tanzania support
themselves with revenues from ASM activities. See box 3.1 for more details.
Unlike large-scale mining, ASM workers have low skills and low capital per worker. Moreover, the sector is
associated with several hazardous labor conditions: child labor, mercury exposure, risk of mine collapse, and
so forth.
Despite huge organizational and operational differences, these two sectors often exist side by side. In some
instances, the competing interests lead to conflict between the two sectors, such as around the Prestea mine
in Ghana, where domestic galamsey miners (informal small-scale miners) have been in conflict with the
multinational concession owner (Hilson and Yakovleva 2007). This presents challenges to the exact
identification of the impact of large-scale mining. Since we cannot always identify individuals who work in
ASM in the data, we cannot account for their contribution to these impacts or ways in which the opening of
a large-scale mine affects the ASM participants.




                                                       95
Measuring spillover effects at the district level
Looking for impacts in only the districts that have a mine, as equation (1) implies, could
miss the potential spillovers that result from mining. There are two main reasons to
consider spillover effects across districts. First, a natural economic impact area of a mine
can be larger than a district, whose administratively or politically determined geographic
boundaries can be too small for the mine’s overall economic and social influence. Second,
some mines will be placed on a district border, and the decision to consider the mine as
belonging to one district rather than another can seem arbitrary. There is, in fact, a third
important reason to consider spillover effects. Mining districts can receive additional fiscal
revenue if the mine is within its administrative borders and the country has such fiscal
sharing rules. This is one important reason to explore district-level effects. But mining
district spending can spill over to the neighboring district—for instance, if they build a road
to the border of the neighboring district. In order to compare outcomes in mining districts,
neighboring districts, and nonmining districts, the following estimation is used:

   = 0 + 1  + 2 ℎ +  +  +  +   (2)
                                                              .
The interpretation of this model will be similar to the interpretation explained for Equation
1. However, now we are interested in both 1 and 2, which allows us to compare the
difference in districts with mines, and districts that border these. Both of the methods
outlined in Equation 1 and Equation 2 can be further nuanced by allowing for differential
effects with intensity of mining, captured by the number of active mines or the annual and
aggregated production volumes. In addition, when data permit, a synthetic control method
can be used where instead of comparing mining districts to all other districts, we compare
them to a specially created synthetic group (following Abadie et al. 2010). The control
group is created to be as similar as possible to the treatment group. This method is
beneficial when there are few treatment observations (that is, few mining districts), but has
high demands on pretreatment data. For Tanzania and Mali, this strategy is tried, but for
Ghana, it is not possible since the mines opened earlier and there are too few observations
to ensure that we find the right control group.


Measuring local effects of mining: Vicinity of mines
Instead of the district-level effects—or in addition to them—one could look even more
closely—that is, analyze the impacts of mining within the vicinity of the mine(s). In this
case, it is important to determine how large this local area has to be. As noted, how broadly
the mine’s influence goes is an empirical exercise. Along with looking at the vicinity of a
mine, where up to 20 km from a mine is identified as being close (baseline treatment
area)—the focus is also on distance bins—concentric circles of varying distances from the
mine. These bins can be within a district or they can span several districts depending on

                                                                      96
the location of the mine. The spatial lag model divides the plane into small concentric
distances, such as 0–10 km, 10–20 km, 20–30 km, and so on, up to 100 km from a mine.
In the regression specification, each distance bin can have its own coefficient. The model
thus allows for nonlinear effects with distance. Moreover, it allows us to understand
whether there are spillovers from large-scale gold mining further away than our baseline
treatment distance. Figure 4.6 presents the distribution of mines in Ghana and illustrates
how the impact area of the mine is captured in the estimation.
Figure 4.6 Gold mines in Ghana and spatial buffers




For the distance-level analysis, what matters is estimating the outcomes of individuals who
live close to the mine regardless of the administrative jurisdiction they live in. The
difference-in-differences model that is estimated is as follows:

  = 0 + 1  ∗  + 3  + 2  +  +  +  + ,   (3)


where the outcome Y of an individual i who lives in village or neighborhood v in year t is
a function of living close to a mine—say, X kilometers from a mine (MineXkm), after the
mine has started producing (After). The estimate of interest is the magnitude and direction

                                                                    97
of the coefficient that is obtained from the interaction of the two, which captures whether
the individual lives in the vicinity of a mine that is currently extracting gold. We can still
control for individual characteristics, as well as the cross-sectional variation across
districts, and the broad changes that happen over time. A similar method has been used by
Aragón and Rud (2013, 2015), Kotsadam and Tolonen (2015), and Tolonen (2015).
It is possible that local procurement, to the extent it might not be captured by the businesses
in the vicinity of the mine, will contaminate the control groups, and therefore bias the
impact downward—toward zero. In addition, some mines have special programs to
increase the amount of domestic procurement from suppliers that are not necessarily in the
vicinity of mines. Lack of time series data on the level and composition of goods and
services procured by each of the mines studied means that this factor cannot be fully
controlled for in the estimation. One way to capture these spillover effects in the district-
level regressions is by adding specific dummies for neighboring districts.


Combining Mining and Household Data
To estimate models 1–3, the report combines data on mines and from household surveys.
The mining data are obtained from several sources. Information on the location of mines
(GPS coordinates) for all three countries was obtained from online sources such as mine-
atlas.com and google.maps, as well as from Raw Materials Database of IntierraRMG for
Ghana. The mine information on the first year of production and production volume was
from IntierraRMG.
Data on households/individuals come from four main sources: Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS), Household Budget Surveys (HBS), Living Standard Surveys (LSS), and
Censuses of Population. The DHS are nationally representative household surveys that
collect data on marriage, fertility, family planning, reproductive health, child health, and
HIV/AIDS. Household Budget Surveys are nationally representative surveys that are used
to track changes in consumption levels of households. They include information about
household characteristics as well as yearly and monthly household expenditures, and in
some cases income levels. The LSS also collects demographic and consumption data. In
addition, they collect detailed information on access to services (education, health, water
and sanitation), household enterprises and agricultural production, and labor market
activity.
Censuses collect information about a range of household and individual characteristics but
cover the whole population. Household characteristics include household size and access
to electricity, water, and toilet facilities. Individual characteristics like occupation,
education, age, and marital status are also included in the censuses. Most of the censuses
like the ones used for this analysis do not contain information about individuals’ income
or consumption levels.

                                              98
Some of the surveys, especially the DHS and the LSS, are geocoded. Since the mines are
also georeferenced, it is easy to determine how far a household observed in such surveys
is from the mine. The estimation strategy that uses individuals and households makes use
of this information to identify the impacts of the mines. Table 4.2 shows the survey years
that are used. Table A.4.1 lists the outcome variables.

 4.3 Results

The assumption of parallel trends is crucial for the difference-in-difference methodology. In the
context of this study, the assumption can be interpreted as demanding that the socioeconomic
outcomes of interest in mining areas and areas further away would follow the same trend in the
absence of the mine becoming active. One way of asserting the validity of this assumption is to
analyze pre-trends. The balancing table of outcome and control variables was one first attempt
at understanding pre-trends. However, the assumption allows for differences in levels between
the control and treatment group, as long as the evolution of the variables are on similar paths.
We explore this using night lights and infant mortality. The reason for choosing these two
variables is that they provide annual variation (in contrast to, say the labor data, which we only
have for the survey years). Moreover, both night lights and infant mortality are two important

Figure 4.7 indicates that night lights in mining areas (defined to within 10 km) are similar to
areas further away (30–50 km or 50–100 km away) 10 to 5 years before the mine opens. Already
starting from 5 years before, there is a small divergence in night lights and in the investment
phase, commonly two years before production begins, the mining areas are already clearly
having higher level of lights at night. If we do not exclude this pre-investment period from the
control group, it will downward bias our results (a discussion regarding this follows in the result
section where we try to exclude this phase). The night light estimates are local polynomial
smooth, whereas the infant mortality estimates are linear predictions. In figure 4.7 we allow for
a trend break around the pre-investment phase. To the left of the opening year, that is, before
the mine started producing, the trends in infant mortality are negative and similar in mining
areas and further away. However, the infant mortality rates are higher closer to the mines. After
mine opening, that is, to the right on the red vertical line, the opposite is true: Mine areas have
lower infant mortality rates. These results for Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania are confirmed in

Tolonen (2015), where the same patterns are found, and for additional mining countries such as
Burkina Faso and Senegal.

Occupation
Using the methods outlined above, we analyze how gold mining has changed the
livelihoods of people in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania. First, selected summary statistics show
that the mine areas have developed differently from nonmining areas in terms of occupation
(table 4.3). Mining communities, defined as villages and towns within 20 km of a mine,
are on average more focused on agricultural production, with a larger share of men working
in agriculture than further away. This is especially true before the mines start active
operation.
Mines are land intensive. It is therefore not surprising that they open mostly in rural areas,
where land is relatively cheaper and where we would expect agricultural participation to
be higher before the mine opens. This is true for Mali, but not for Ghana and Tanzania.
Women’s participation in the service sector is quite low overall, but the summary statistics
show that the sector has grown over time, suggesting that the growth rate in service sector
employment might be higher in mining communities.

Table 4.4 shows the econometric results for all three countries, across different occupations
and for men and women separately. Among women, the likelihood of being a manual
worker declined in populations living around the mines. This is stronger for Mali and
Tanzania and less so for Ghana, where this is observed more for men than for women. For
Ghana, there is a shift from agriculture to services for women, but it is not statistically
significant. In Mali, in addition to a large decrease in manual work, there was also a large
(insignificant) increase—by about 16 percentage points—in service sector employment for
women. Finally, for Tanzania, there was an increase in agricultural participation for
women, and a small increase in professional work.

The data used for this estimation comes from DHS, which has a prime focus on women’s
welfare. This means that fewer men were sampled. This can cause problems in our
statistical model for men, since a small number of observations means that we can have a
problem estimating effects precisely. Not surprisingly, for men, few statistically significant
effects are observed, with only a marginally significant drop in manual worker occupation
of 6.9 percentage point in Ghana.
Furthermore, these results were obtained by using a 20-km cutoff distance for the treatment
area; that is, it is assumed the mine influences outcomes within a 20-km radius. But, in
fact, there is no strong reason to assume that 20 km is the true radius of the mine caption
area. This cutoff was selected based on guidance from previous studies using similar

                                                  102
methodologies: Aragón and Rud 2015 and Kotsadam and Tolonen 2015 use 20-km
distances when they explored effects of mining on local agricultural and labor markets in
Ghana and Africa. However, Tolonen (2015) shows that most health and labor effects are
concentrated within 10 km and 15 km in gold-producing countries in Africa. By contrast,
Aragón and Rud’s (2013) study on one large gold mine in Peru showed that effects can be
found as far afield as 100 km.
The geography of mining
Instead of using a binary variable—comparing those within 20 km of a mine with everyone
else outside that distance—in order to capture the impacts, a spatial lag model is used,
which allows for nonlinear effects with distance. The results from this model are presented
in figure 4.8. The focus is on women’s access to occupations, since the DHS data these
results are based on are more suitable for women subsamples.
Figure 4.8 shows that service sector employment for women is significantly higher close
to active mines. In fact, the effects are stronger within 0 to 10 km of a mine than within 10
to 20 km of a mine. In Mali, the probability that a woman works in service and sales
increases by 30 percentage points, and in Ghana by 17 percentage points, in the very closest
distance. For Ghana and Mali, agricultural participation drops close to mines, by roughly
20 to 10 percentage points. In Tanzania, no clear change is noticed, either in service and
sales or in agricultural employment. The occupation pattern is similar across the three
countries between women migrants and never-movers (figure 4.9).
A similar analysis using DHS data can be done for men, since women answer what
occupation their partner has. Figure 4.10 shows that men are less likely to work in
agriculture if they live within 10 km of a mine (this is statistically significant in Mali).
There is a pattern in the data that indicated that there might be a geographic displacement
of farming activities from very close to a mine to slightly further away (20 to 30 km),
especially in Ghana. Men are not more likely to work in manual labor in Ghana or in Mali.
For Ghana, data on mining employment from the Ghana Living Standards Survey dataset
confirms that there is a 10-percentage-point increase in the likelihood that a man living
close to a mine works in mining.

The discussion in previous sections took a closer look at the impacts of mines on
individuals’ employment prospects and wages. This is one way of looking at local impacts
of mining. But the costs and benefits within the neighborhood of a mine that have been
discussed thus far are not exhaustive. As we argued at the beginning of this chapter, mining
can have additional impacts beyond the neighborhood of the mine if mining royalties and
revenues are spent on populations living in districts where the mine is located. Injection of
additional expenditures into the district could increase spending on welfare-enhancing
services, such as schooling or health care. The likelihood of identifying these channels
depends on a host of factors, including whether in fact there is a rule-based formula for
sharing of mining revenues, and the quality and performance of local politicians and
bureaucracy.
Unfortunately, while information is available on whether or not there is a revenue-sharing
rule in the three countries, time series data on the actual revenue flows or a measure of
bureaucratic performance are lacking. Absent data on these crucial drivers of outcomes,
we present in this chapter a first approximation of additional impacts by simply comparing
outcomes between mining and nonmining districts. As in the previous results, the district-
level analysis makes use of data from DHSs, HBSs, and censuses. In Mali and Tanzania,
we mapped (through well-known imputation methods) the outcome variables that do not
exist in the censuses (see table 2 of Polat et al. [2014] for the list of variables used in
mapping), which are malnutrition outcomes of children and per capita expenditure. The
averages of all the outcome variables for each district are calculated. Then, a simple
difference-in-differences analysis and a synthetic control group analysis using district-level
averages is undertaken. For Tanzania, the district-level analysis includes the districts that
are on the mainland; it excludes the districts of Pemba and Zanzibar.
In the synthetic control analysis, an average of the outcomes of the mining districts and
average of the outcomes of neighboring districts are used to compute one representative
mining district and one representative neighboring district. The synthetic control method
gives weights to the remaining districts to come up with the most representative control
district (see Polat et al. [2014] for details of how this was constructed). Following Abadie,
Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), placebo tests are used to find out whether the
significance of the results could be found by chance. That is, we try to determine whether
a district that is randomly assigned to be the treatment district differs significantly from its
synthetic control district in the post-treatment period. This will show us how often the
difference between the outcomes of the real treatment district and its synthetic counterpart
stands out. In the ideal case, it must be that the outcome of the real treatment district should
be significantly different from the outcome of its synthetic control district, while for other
districts that are randomly assigned to be the treatment district, the difference should not
be as high.

Overall, the district-level analysis of changes in women’s and men’s employment confirms
the findings of the distance-level analysis. Table 4.5 reports the simple difference-in-
differences at the district level for Ghana. The results indicate that agricultural employment
decreases in mining districts by 8.5 percentage points relative to nonmining districts for
women (panel A). Moreover, there is a negative relationship between tons of gold produced
and agricultural employment (panel B). In addition, the probability of a woman working
all year increases by 5.4 percentage points, as does the probability of working in manual
work (panel A). The same is not observed in adjacent districts (panel B). For men, there is
a 5.2-percentage-point decrease in agricultural participation, but no significant increases in
other sectors. However, the insignificant point estimates indicate that men might be shifting
toward service sector employment and manual work. Previously, results from the Ghana
Living Standards Survey had shown that men in Ghana might shift into mining
employment. For DHS, similar information on whether men work in mining employment
is not available, so this finding cannot be confirmed here.

Table 4.6 shows the results from a district analysis for Tanzania and Mali. For Tanzania,
the data come from HBSs and compare across districts in the Tanzanian mainland. For
each of the 103 districts in the analysis, 4 are mining districts (Geita, Kahama, Nzega, and

                                                        107
  Tarime). For Mali, there are 257 districts and 5 of these are mining districts (Fourou,
  Kalana, Kenieba Central, Sadiola, and Sanso). The difference-in-differences district
  analysis shows that there are significant increases in the likelihood of mining employment.
  In Mali, men are almost 10 percentage points more likely to work as miners, and women
  2.3 percentage points more likely to work as miners than before. Note, however, that these
  changes can also be due to increases in small-scale mining in these districts over the same
  period. Overall, men’s and women’s agricultural employment decreases, but these results
  are not statistically significant. For Tanzania (panel B), there is no recorded information
  on mining employment. Similar to Mali, there is an economically significant decrease in
  agricultural employment (8 percentage points for men and 11 percentage points for
  women), but these estimates are not statistically significant.

  For both Mali and Tanzania, a district-level analysis that compares mining districts to
  control districts using the synthetic control method is undertaken. While the findings do
  not indicate large positive impacts of mines on overall employment rates of men or women
  in mining districts compared to nonmining districts, there is some evidence of significant
  changes in the composition of employment. For example, in Mali, employment rates of
  men and women working in the manufacturing sector increased, while agricultural

                                                       108
employment for women decreased considerably (table A.4.2). In Tanzania, by contrast,
there are no significant differences between mining and nonmining districts on overall
employment changes or in the composition of employment for both men and women (table
A.4.3). Overall, these district-level results are consistent with the finding using individual-
level estimates that were reported in the previous section.


Is local structural transformation occurring?
Recall that one mechanism through which mining can have large impacts is through
agglomeration economies—that is, gains in productivity that are unleashed with clustering
of economic activities around the mine(s). The first sign of such a change would be the
movement of labor and other factors away from traditional sectors to new sectors. In our
country cases, that would mean a change in the structure of the local economy from being
dominated by “traditional” farming—defined by low inputs and low capital per worker—
to a more balanced local economy. Therefore, an important question is whether the results
presented in the previous section lead us to believe that gold extraction in these countries
has helped shift workers from agriculture to other sectors with higher productivity, higher
wages, and greater opportunities for economic growth. In other words, are there signs of
local structural transformation?
The empirical results thus far show that, in some countries, women shift from agriculture
to service sector employment in the close vicinity of mines. There is also an increase in
employment in mining for men. The shift into mining or into services is away from
subsistence farming, which is the dominant occupation before mine operation. Summary
statistics show that participation in the agricultural sector is between 33 and 70 percent in
mining communities at the start of our period (table 4.3) for men and women. After mining
begins, the participation rates for both men and women drop sharply in Ghana and Mali.
It is possible that this is caused by pull factors, where higher productivity and wages in
mines encourages community members to change occupations. A competing hypothesis is
considered by Aragón and Rud (2015), who show that pollution from the mine decreased
agricultural productivity around Ghana’s gold mines. This effect could be reinforced by
the land-intensive nature of mining, which increases competition over limited land
resources, and leads to a decrease in available arable land if the mines are located in the
agricultural hinterland.
The increase in service sector employment and in other sectors can be understood as “local
multipliers” (Moretti 2010), where for each job created directly in mining, there are
additional jobs created in the tradable or nontradable sector. The size of the multiplier will
depend on total mine employment, miners’ wages and spending habits, and how the mining
company sources inputs (such as food, electricity, and housing for its workers). Companies
can try to boost the multiplier by, for example, ensuring that it sources inputs from local
suppliers. In addition, there are local fiscal multipliers. A mine may result in local tax

                                             109
contributions that when spent by the local government can help stimulate the local
economy. Unfortunately, there are insufficient data to calculate these multipliers, but the
results support this hypothesis.
Findings from the Ghana Living Standards Survey show that women are not benefiting as
much from direct employment in mining, which highlights that the structural change that
happens with mining is gender specific. Gender segregation in labor markets has previously
been found to be important in determining how extractive industries can generate
employment for men and women. This argument was first made by Ross (2008) regarding
oil industries, and this hypothesis was later tested for African mining using microdata
(Kotsadam and Tolonen 2015).


Income, wages, and expenditure in mining communities in Ghana
One sign of structural transformation is the shift toward wage or nonfarm activities. The
findings so far have shown that there are signs that the latter is happening in local
communities around the mines in the three countries. Is similar evidence available for
wages? The available household surveys listed above have two drawbacks for
understanding wages and mining. First, they are not geocoded, so the workers cannot be
linked to a mine. Second, most have no wage data. The exception is Ghana, where
geocoordinates for the surveyed households are available in the Ghana Living Standards
Survey. This allows a mapping of wages, income, and expenditure change in the mining
communities. The analysis shows that in mining communities, household total wages
increase, as do women’s wages (table 4.7). Men’s wages increase too, but the increase is
not precisely estimated. In general, men’s wages are higher, so despite a larger increase in
women’s wages, these estimates do not indicate that women’s wages are higher than men’s
wages. While household total wages increase, there is a decrease in household expenditure
(column 4). Note that wage earnings are only recorded for those who are engaging in wage
labor—in fact, only 13.3 percent of people in the Ghana Living Standards Survey sample
have recorded wage earnings. So while there is an increase in the wage rate for those who
earn wages, what happens to total earnings in households without any wage labor is not
clear.

Findings on changes in expenditure in Ghana are presented in table 4.8. The evidence
shows that regional food prices are higher in mining areas (column 1), which is similar to
the findings in Peru (Aragón and Rud 2013). But unlike the Peru study, the regionally
deflated food expenditure does not increase (column 2), nor does the share of food in total
deflated household expenditure (column 6 or 7) rise. However, total household expenditure
on housing increases by 31.6 percent with the mining onset, all else being equal (column
4, not regionally deflated prices), along with the share of this component in total
expenditure. The same is true for energy costs, such as electricity and gas, which rise 29.7
percent with the onset of mining, all else being equal. This might be due to a rise in
electrification that is observed in the DHS data (results are presented later in the chapter).

Similar analysis for Mali andTanzania, using the district-level analysis that compares
mining districts to control districts using the synthetic control method, shows an increase
in income inequality in mining and neighboring districts compared to control districts in
Mali, while the opposite happens in Tanzania (tables 4.9 and 4.10). In Tanzania, average
real per capita expenditure decreases when the mining districts and neighboring districts
are taken together as treated units in the difference-in-differences analysis; however, the
decrease turns out to be significant for mining districts only in the synthetic control
analysis.

Asset accumulation
How does the opening of a mine close to a community affect the household’s probability
of ownership of assets such as cement floor, radios, and cars? The regression results using
the baseline specification in table 4.11a show that households (close to a mine) in Mali are
30 percentage points more likely to have floors made of cement, tile, wood, or materials
other than earth, sand, or dung. Households in Mali are also 5 percentage points more likely
to own a car (but 11 percentage points less likely to own a bicycle, at a 90 percent
confidence level). Elsewhere, households in Ghana are 14 percentage points more likely to
own a radio. Table 4.11b decomposes the effects by migration status of the surveyed
women. Radio ownership increases for both migrant women and nonmigrant women in
Ghana, but for Mali it seems like the positive effects on household assets are driven by
migrant households. In Tanzania, we found no significant changes in assets according to
table 4.11a, but we learn from the decomposition that radio ownership in fact increased
among nonmigrant households. These effects are also illustrated with figures 4.11 and 4.12.

Child Health
Large-scale gold mining can affect child health in different ways. First, it could change
household income. Higher income enables the household to buy better or more nutritious
food. Second, it could affect child health through changing the environment where the
children live. Higher income could improve child (and household) health by reducing the
disease environment through making it possible for the household to buy better-quality
housing—with proper sanitation and clean water. Higher incomes can also directly buy
better health care. However, if large-scale gold mining decreases local agriculture, it could
increase food insecurity among households in the vicinity, and if it leads to environmental
                                            116
degradation and pollution that is harmful for humans, the effects on child health could be
negative. Thus, how a mine affects child health remains theoretically ambiguous.
Previous literature, however, does provide some clues. Using a dataset from nine African
countries and more than 60 gold mines, Tolonen (2015) shows that infant mortality
decreases sharply in gold mining communities in Africa with the onset of large-scale
mining. She argues for an income story explaining the huge drops. Another econometric
study (von der Goltz and Barnwal 2014) focusing on different types of mineral mines
across developing countries finds that mines associated with lead pollution lead to
increased rates of anemia in women and stunting in children in very close proximity to
large mines (<5 km).
Summary statistics show mixed trends across a range of child (under 5 years of age) health
outcomes across countries and between mining and nonmining areas (figure 4.13). With a
few exceptions, the broad trend is lower incidence of diseases: declines in prevalence of
cough and fever, but mixed trends in prevalence of diarrhea.

Child health improves in Mali
The empirical analysis finds positive effects on access to health care and health outcomes
in Mali (table 4.12, column 2). Pregnant mothers receive many more prenatal health visits.
Infant mortality decreases by 5.3 percentage points (although it is not significantly
estimated), and stunting decreases by 27 percentage points, which is equivalent to a 45

                                           118
percent decrease in the prevalence from the pre-mine average rate of stunting. Stunting is
an indicator of chronic malnutrition, which affects children’s growth patterns and thus
makes them short for their age. By contrast, wasting measures acute malnutrition. Wasting
can be a life-threatening condition, if the child rapidly loses weight and becomes severely
malnourished. For Mali, the estimated effect is negative but insignificant for wasting, but
negative and significant for underweight, which is a composite measure of acute and
chronic malnourishment.
The results also show that the prevalence of cough, fever, and diarrhea decrease, although
all but fever are only marginally statistically significant. The significant drop in diarrheal
incidence of children in mining communities in Mali is a welcome development, since
diarrhea remains a serious threat to children in developing countries, even though it is a
disease that is easy to cure and prevent. Access to safe water and sanitation are important
in fighting diarrheal diseases, and this could be a way in which a mine affects diarrheal
incidence in Mali. Table 4.17 shows that households in Mali are 6.5 percentage points less
likely to spend more than 10 minutes fetching water (insignificant), although this suggests
little about the quality of that water. There is some evidence (box 4.3) that access to a
private toilet facility, which might be important to stop the spread of diarrheal diseases,
and access to flush toilets, increase in mining communities (although this is insignificant).

Box 4.3 Does access to sanitary facilities change in Mali?
Table 4.12 shows that the opening of a mine does not significantly change access to sanitation; there are no
significant shifts between having no toilet facility, to having a pit latrine, to having a flush toilet. a For
Tanzania, there is a marginally significant increase in the likelihood that the household does not have a toilet
facility in the compound. In Mali, the results indicate (although note that they are not statistically significant)
that there is a shift in likelihood from having no toilet (a 17.6-percentage-point decrease) to having access to
a pit toilet (a 17.7-percentage-point increase).
To understand the effect of a mine opening on household access to sanitation, we explore whether households
are more likely to not share their toilet facility and whether they are more likely to have access to a flush
toilet, the closer the household is to an open mine. Figure 4.14.a shows that the likelihood of a household
sharing their toilet facility with another household decreases close to active mines, and that the likelihood of
the household having a flush toilet increases (figure 4.14.b), although these results are not significant, as
indicated by the 95 percent confidence intervals, in grey. Figure 4.15 shows that no clear change in access to
any toilet or pit toilet is found in households where the woman is a never-mover. However, for the migrant
population, it seems like migrants who live very close to the mine (within 10 km) have better sanitation
facilities than migrants who live a little farther away. Note that no confidence intervals are presented here,
and that these effects are not significantly estimated.

Note: a. Decomposing these effects by migration status shows no significant differences across migrants and
never-movers.


In contrast with Mali, the evidence on child health effects of the onset of mining in Ghana
and Tanzania is ambiguous. The likelihood that a child is stunted increases 12.3 percentage
points in Tanzania, and underweight increases in mining communities in both Ghana and
Tanzania. However, there are some positive effects of the mine. Importantly, infant
mortality decreases in Ghana, and there is also a marginally significant decrease in cough
prevalence. The effect of the mine on diarrheal incidence in Ghana is positive but
insignificant. Disaggregating this effect by groups shows that, in Ghana, migrants
experience higher rates of diarrhea and never-movers lower rates.
The district-level analysis confirms some of the above child health findings. Table 4.13
shows five measures of child health care access. In Ghana, mothers in gold-mining districts
have 0.759 more prenatal visits per child, and they are 12.5 percentage points more likely
attended by a trained midwife (column 3). Moreover, infant mortality is 8.5 percentage
points lower in active mining communities (column 5). No changes are noticed for district-
level access to water (measured in time) and household electrification.

Findings from the district-level analysis (which compares mining districts to control
districts using the synthetic control method) for Mali and Tanzania indicate some positive
outcomes (tables 4.14 and 4.15). For example, the results show improvements in children’s
nutrition status in mining and neighboring districts compared to control districts.

Is diarrheal incidence different among migrants and never-movers in Ghana?
Diarrheal diseases are major killers of young children in developing countries despite the
existence of simple and inexpensive solutions, such as oral rehydration solutions. The main
result in table 4.12 indicates that diarrheal incidence among children under age five
increased in mining communities in Ghana. This is surprising given the expectation that
local industrial developments, such as mines, could increase infrastructure investment in
access to sanitation and water systems (including to electricity and road networks) in
mining communities, and this improved access is important in preventing diarrheal disease.
Perhaps, the results stem from the possibility that the same industrial developments could
also increase competition over available resources, such as clean water, or by increasing
the population pressure on limited resources through inward migration. Migrants may be a
particularly vulnerable group if they are less settled in the community and live in more
informal dwellings. If so, diarrheal disease could increase particularly in this group.
Figure 4.16 illustrates this. Diarrheal disease increases significantly up to 30 km from a
mine among children born to women who have migrated compared to children born to
women who have migrated but live farther away. The largest treatment coefficient is for

                                                  124
the baseline distance, within 20 km of a mine, where the mine is associated with a 6.9-
percentage-point increase in diarrheal incidence. Interestingly, children who are born to
women who have never moved experience (insignificantly) less diarrheal disease. Within
the first 10 km, the effect is a 9.1-percentage-point decrease in incidence. This shows that
in Ghana, child health—measured in diarrheal incidence—is very different among those
who have migrated compared to those who have been settled for a longer time. Migrants
living in mining areas seem particularly vulnerable. Since the reason for the migration is
not known (it could be relocation/displacement due to the mine, or that the household
moved to take an employment or income opportunity offered by the mine, or irrespective
of the mine), it is difficult to draw any strong conclusions as to why this population is doing
less well. Migration is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.
Table 4.16 shows that the strongest differences in child health across migrants and never-
movers are in Ghana. In Mali, there are no significant effects of mining across the two
groups. In Ghana, there is a decrease in prevalence of cough in the last two weeks among
both children born to migrants and children born to never-movers. However, as noted,
children born to migrants in Ghana see an increase in diarrheal incidence. The results for
Tanzania are not presented due to too-small sample sizes once controlling for migration
status.

Access to Infrastructure
Access to adequate infrastructure contributes to improvements in welfare. How is this
access impacted by the opening of a mine? Table 4.17 shows how the opening of a mine
close to a community affects the household’s probability of having access to infrastructure,
such as electricity and a private toilet facility. The regression results using the baseline
specification in table 4.17 show that those households close to a mine are generally more
likely to have access to a private toilet facility. The results are especially strong for
Tanzania, where households in mining communities are 24 percentage points less likely to
share the toilet facility with other households. Turning to the spatial lag model, figure 4.17
shows that access to electricity increases in Mali but with no discernable effect for either
Ghana or Tanzania.

The above analysis is complementary to figure 4.18, which shows differences for migrants
and never-movers in the same communities. The migration analysis shows differences in
infrastructure access across the study countries: migrants in Ghana are seemingly less well
off than never-movers. In Mali, the relationship is reversed, with migrants having better
access to electricity. In Tanzania, there is no difference in access rate among the two
groups.

Controlling for mine-induced migration
Thus far, the discussion has been on how mining affects the composition of local
employment, women’s economic opportunities, accumulation of assets, and children’s
health outcomes. The underlying assumption is that these impacts apply to people who
lived in the vicinity of the mine before the mine opened. However, such a result rests on
the assumption that either there is no migration, or if there is, that it had no influence on
the estimated impacts. But as shown below, the first assumption does not hold. The opening
of a mine in a local area is a magnet for workers from near and far as they seek opportunities
to improve their incomes and employment status. What about the second assumption?
If migrants and local populations have exactly the same characteristics—that is, identical
in all dimensions that matter for being successful at taking advantage of the opportunities
offered by the mine—then the estimated impacts will remain valid. However, if people
who move to the mining area from afar are different—say, with regard to skills, ability,
motivation, health status, and so forth—from the people who lived in the mining area
before the mine opened, then there would be selection bias. Imagine if men who are more
interested in and trained for mining jobs move into these communities, and women who
have a particular interest or aptitude for work in the service sector do the same. Then the
results reported above on the composition of occupations and the changing employment
opportunities for women, is identifying the change in composition of the labor force in the
mining communities that is not due to the mine alone.
It should be noted that the study is interested in identifying the impact of the mine(s) on
local populations who lived there before the mine(s) opened, as well as exploring how the
local economy is changing even if the population changes with it. This is why isolating the
role of migration on the estimated effects is important and not trivial. Because the data are
repeated cross-section, the analysis cannot follow an individual over time. Thus, the
analysis of migrants compares people who have moved to their current place of residence
(migrants) with those who have never moved (never-movers). In this sense, the analysis
compares migrants in mining communities with migrants who live elsewhere. Any
difference that is noted between these groups could stem from selection into migration to
mining communities, and so the results should not be interpreted causally. For example, if
only poorer households with children with worse health move to mining communities, the
results will indicate that migrants in mining communities are worse off. But this is not due
to the mine. With this important caveat in mind, the analysis is conducted to shed light on
the welfare of migrants in mining communities.
Most of the data available for the countries analyzed here do track migratory history in
detail. For most individuals, it is known whether they have ever moved in their life and in
what year they moved to the current location. In the following section, migration rates in


                                             129
mining communities are presented, and the outcomes between migrants and never-movers
are compared.
Migratory patterns in the three countries
Figure 4.19 shows the share of the population that moved in a given year and living within
100 km of a mine. The figure does not use calendar year but rather “mine year,” defined as
counting down to mine opening, with the mine opening year indicated as time zero. Thus,
the figure presents the fraction of the population that migrated prior to the opening of a
mine over a 20-year time span—10 years prior to the opening of the mine and 10 years
after the mine opens. As suspected, there is indeed plenty of in-migration, but the migratory
patterns are different across all three countries.


Figure 4.19 Timing and share of migration in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania




In Ghana, 4 to 6 percent of the population can be considered migrants, but there is no clear
evidence that the opening of the mine has affected migration patterns in any particular way.
Migration before and after the mine opened remained relatively stable. In Mali, migration
rates appear to have been decreasing over time. It appears that migration to the mining area
was relatively high 4 to 10 years prior to the opening of the mine. Then it slowed and
stabilized for the 3 years prior to the opening of the mine. There was a surge a year after
the mine opened, but the trend reversed so that less than 2 percent of the population around
100 km of the mine was considered migrants 10 years after the mine opened. The opposite

                                            130
seemed to have happened in Tanzania. Migration rates increased leading to the opening
date of the mine. They peaked two years after the mine opened, and remained relatively
stable and high for the following 4 years, after which they declined.
There are two points to keep in mind about these migration patterns. First, the relatively
higher rates in Mali and Tanzania could be explained by the relatively young nature of the
sector in these countries relative to Ghana’s. Second, it is important to bear in mind that,
while mines are major attractions for those seeking employment, not all this migration is
due to the opening of the mine. However, for our estimation of impacts, knowing whether
people moved because of the mine or not is not going to help identify the impact of mines
on the local community. Instead, what matters is the knowledge of whether or not migrants
differ substantively from the local population who lived in that locality before the mine
opened. The differences between migrants and never-movers are explored through
women’s occupation and household access to electricity and radio ownership.


Migrant women and nonmigrant women have the same opportunities in the labor market
Empirical analysis finds no difference in the labor market outcomes between migrant and
nonmigrant women. Figure 4.9 shows the increase in the likelihood of a woman working
in nonfarm employment, in this case proxied by service sector employment. The chances
of working in the service sector are substantially higher for women who live near the mine
compared to those who live further away, in both Ghana and Mali, although the effect size
is larger in Ghana. However, women who were born in the local communities and did not
move away and those who moved there plausibly because of the mine have equal chances
of working in the service sector. In other words, migrants do not seem to have major
advantages or disadvantages when it comes to success in finding new employment.
In Tanzania, women who live closer to the mines do not enjoy any better chances of
working in nonfarm jobs than women farther away. It would seem that the pull of the
nontraded sector is no greater closer to the mine than farther away. It is equally the case
that nonmigrant women do not enjoy any advantages closer to the mines (20 km) compared
to migrant women. The pattern for working in agriculture (figure 4.9 lower panel) is less
clear. In Mali, women are less likely to work in agriculture than those farther away, a
finding that in some ways reinforces the results on service sector jobs. The effect size is
larger for women who never moved. But in Ghana and Tanzania, the prospect of working
in agriculture for women closer to mines is not that different from women farther away.
And closer to mines, the change in probability of working in agriculture between migrant
and nonmigrant women is the same.


Access to infrastructure: A challenge for migrants?


                                            131
Figure 4.18 shows whether migrants, in general, have access to better infrastructure (in this
case, electricity) or lower assets. There are several hypotheses for why access to
infrastructure could be different between migrants and never-movers. It could come from
income differences: those with higher incomes can afford to pay for electricity and other
services. It could also come from service delivery failures by local governments, which
may not reach places where migrants settle. Similarly, if migrants have lower assets to
begin with, then the impacts reported above would be underestimating the effect of mines
on asset ownership.
There are three points to note regarding variation in access to electricity between migrants
and never-movers from figure 4.18. First, the difference in access to infrastructure between
migrants and never-movers is largest in Ghana, where the effect of the mine on local
electrification for the nonmigrant population is positive at the closest distance (within 20
km of the mine). Second, access to electricity for both migrants and never-movers near the
mine is highest in Mali, where household access to electricity increases sharply—by 30 to
50 percentage points—within the first 20 km.
Finally, these differences in access to electricity for both migrants and never-movers may
be partially explained by looking at the differences in the migration patterns in some of
these countries. For example, access to electricity might not be readily available to
community members, and if it entails a household investment, one could expect people that
have been settled in the communities for a longer time to do better. With that in mind, recall
that in Mali, most migration movements happened a few years before a mine opened, so it
can be assumed that many migrants may have already settled in the local community by
the time the mine opened. By contrast, in Ghana, migration patterns continued to flow at
the same pace from year to year. Given this migration pattern, it is expected that there
would be lower access to electricity for migrants in Ghana and equal access in Mali, which
is what is observed in figure 4.18.


Summary of Results
Although the mining industry is generally associated with weak direct employment
generation compared with its contributions to GDP and export revenue at a national level,
it nonetheless has the potential to have large local impacts through clustering of economic
activities. This chapter looked at these local impacts for individuals who live in the
neighborhood of the gold mines and districts that have a gold-mining sector. The results
lead to four major conclusions.
First, there appear to be signs of structural transformation associated with the mining
sector. Both the individual and district results find that employment in agriculture is
declining, while employment in nonfarm occupations such as services, manufacturing, and
mining is rising. In cases where wage data are available, such as Ghana, there is evidence


                                             132
that wages for those in mining are higher. These results are robust especially for countries
where gold mining started earlier, such as Ghana and Mali.
Second, mining is associated with improvements in women’s nonfarm employment
opportunities. Employment in sales and services for women are substantially higher for
women who live closer to mining sites than women who live farther away. In the same
vein, their employment in agriculture declines. In addition, the probability of working
throughout the year rises for women closer to mines and those who live in mining districts.
The finding that there is structural transformation in large-scale gold-mining communities
is further supported by changes in expenditures. Overall, despite increasing food prices,
neither total deflated food expenditure, nor food share of total household expenditure,
increases. Instead, the results show that expenditure on housing and energy increases,
which is in line with the higher electrification rates that are found in these mining
communities.
Third, child health outcomes have mixed results. Overall, health outcomes such as child
mortality have declined in mining communities and districts. But only in Mali do decreases
in stunting (ratio of height to age) and wasting (ratio of weight to age) appear to improve
for households in mining districts and for individuals who live closer to mines. In both
Ghana and Tanzania, these outcomes appear worse for mining areas. Similarly, the
incidence of diarrheal disease decreases in Mali but rises in Ghana and Tanzania, although
in the case of Ghana this appears to be driven by poor outcomes among migrants who live
near the mines. Diarrheal incidence is much higher among children born to migrants in
mining communities than migrants living farther away, whereas other children are doing
better. In addition, women of migrant households have less access to important
infrastructure, such as electricity.
It is not clear why these child health outcomes differ across these countries at this local
level. Stunting, which is a measure of long-term nutritional deficiency, may reflect a
significant income effect. In other words, those who live closer to mines may have higher
incomes and use it to buy better nutrition for their children. By contrast, wasting is a short-
term measure of nutritional deficiency and can be explained strongly by access to health
services.
Fourth, and finally, migration patterns may explain some of the differences in child health
outcomes across countries. For instance, Mali, which shows the most positive changes, is
also the country with the lowest level of migration around the time of mine opening, and
migrants in mining areas in Mali seem less vulnerable than in Ghana or Tanzania.
Tanzania, which shows evidence for structural transformation and few gains in child
health, seemingly has the largest increase in migration flows after mine opening.

Chapter 5 Does Large-Scale Gold Mining Reduce
Agricultural Growth? Case studies from Burkina
Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania


 5.1 Introduction

This chapter provides another perspective on the impact of resource extraction on local
economic growth by focusing on agricultural growth.52 The issue of interest is whether the
opening of mines has spillover effects on the local economy, and especially on the
agricultural sector. Agricultural production could be affected by mining activities in several
ways. Mining could lead to a rise in local wages, reduce profit margins in agriculture, and
lead to the exit of many families from farming—something akin to a localized Dutch
disease problem. Negative environmental spillovers such as pollution or local health
problems could also dampen productivity of the land and of the farmers, and thereby reduce
the viability of farming. Alternatively, mining could create a mini-boom in the local
economy through higher employment and higher wages that can lead to an increase in local
area aggregate demand, including for regional food crops.
Remote sensing data are used to estimate levels and changes in agricultural and
nonagricultural production in mining and nonmining localities in Burkina Faso, Ghana,
Mali, and Tanzania. The study investigates the spatial relationship between mining
activities and local agricultural development by using a vegetation index as a proxy for
agricultural production. In order to estimate the level and composition of production—
agricultural and nonagricultural—at the local level, the paper selects a radius around the
mining areas. For all the four countries, 32 mines were identified.
Satellite remote sensing missions are generally designed for specific applications, often
earth-sciences related, such as vegetation classification and weather forecasting. Very few,
if any, sensors are designed for social science applications (Hall 2010). The Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) sensor, also
known as “nighttime lights,” has attracted recent attention due to its capability to depict
human settlement and development. It is sensitive enough to detect street lights and even
fishing vessels at sea (Sei-Ichi et al. 2010). The light detected by the DMSP-OLS is largely
the result of human activities, emitted from settlements, shipping fleets, gas flaring, or fires
from swidden (slash and burn) agriculture. Therefore, nighttime light imagery serves as a

unique view of the earth’s surface that highlights human activities. One of the central uses
of the nighttime lights dataset is as a measure of and proxy for economic activity.
The relationship between economic activity and light has been explored by several authors,
and all have concluded that there is indeed a positive relationship between the light emitted
and the level of economic development within a region. This understanding has been used
to estimate both GDP and economic growth. This paper is a contribution to the literature
on the connection between extractive industries and local clustering of economic activity
using remote sensing data.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on remote
sensing and economic activities, with a particular focus on agriculture. Section 3 describes
the data used in the study. Section 4 describes the various methodologies and their results,
including the econometric results using a difference-in-differences estimation framework
(previously employed to understand the economic effects of gold mining in Africa by
Aragón and Rud [2015], Kotsadam et al. [2015], and Tolonen [2015]). Section 6 concludes
the paper.


5.2 Remote sensing and economic activities


Nightlight and economic activities


Several recent economic studies have exploited human-generated nighttime light data to
understand the structure, growth, and spatial distribution of economic activities in countries
or localized areas (Chen and Nordhaus 2011; Doll, Muller, and Morley 2006; Ebener et al.
2005; Elvidge et al. 1997; Ghosh et al. 2010; Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil 2012;
Sutton and Costanza 2002). An early identification of the strength of the relationship
between nighttime lights and economic development was made by Elvidge et al. (1997),
who explored the relationship between lighted area and gross domestic product (GDP); and
population and electrical power consumption in the countries of South America, the United
States, Madagascar, and several island nations of the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
Using simple linear regression over a single year (1994/1995), they found that GDP
exhibits a strong linear relationship with the lighted area.
Elvidge et al.’s (1997) study is unique in that it associated the relationship between
economic activity and lighted area. Most other publications using such data related
economic activity with light intensity. Doll, Muller, and Morley (2006) were one of the
first to apply this relationship to estimating economic activity on a national and subnational
basis. They identified a unique linear relationship between gross regional product (GRP)
and lighting for the European Union and the United States using 1996/1997 data and found

                                             146
that one linear relationship was not appropriate since some cities were outliers. However,
once the outliers were removed, they were able to generate simple linear regressions—
which showed strong links between GRP and light intensity—for each country, which they
used to generate a gridded map of GRP at the 5-kilometer level.
Building on this approach, Ghosh et al. (2010) use gross state product (GSP), GDP, and
light intensity in 2006 for various administrative units in the states of China, India, Mexico,
and the United States to obtain an estimate of total economic activity for each
administrative unit. These values were then spatially distributed within a global grid using
the percent contribution of agriculture toward GDP, a population grid, and the nighttime
lights image. This is an improvement over Doll, Muller, and Morley (2006) in the sense
that it was able to assign economic activity to agricultural areas, which are not usually
picked up by the nighttime lights dataset since they are not often lit. This is an important
observation about nightlight data that will inform our study.
Chen and Nordhaus (2011) were one of the first studies to exploit time series variation in
GDP and nightlight. To show the strength of the correlation between economic activity and
nightlight, their method assigns weights to light intensity in order to reduce the difference
between the true GDP values and the estimated GDP (that is, they minimize mean squared
error) for all countries of the world for 1992 to 2008. They show that while light intensity
data do not add much value—that is, do not provide any additional information than actual
data—to data-rich countries, the opposite is true for data-poor countries. They show that
GDP estimation using nightlight in data-poor countries, both at the national and subnational
level, improves substantially with nightlight data.
One of the most recent applications of the nighttime lights dataset in relation to economic
activity is by Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (2012). Rather than exploring the
relationship of lights with GDP levels, they look at the relationship between real GDP
growth and GDP growth estimated using nighttime light. Like Chen and Nordhaus (2011),
they use a time series of growth and light data for 1992 to 2008. Their statistical model
correlates GDP growth using country-specific economic data with light intensity values.
Similar to Chen and Nordhaus (2011), they construct different weights for the light data
and existing economic data based on the quality of the economic data. They found that for
countries with “bad” data, there are often large differences (both positive and negative)
between the recorded economic growth and the estimated growth.
In general, this short review of the literature using remote sensing data leads to two
conclusions. First, it demonstrates that such data provide a strong and accurate prediction
of economic activity. Second, although various types of remote sensing data are available,
the one that is most widely used tend to be nightlight data. To date, most of the studies
have used light intensity, rather than lighted area, to explain either GDP or its growth within
and across countries in a given year and, on a few occasions, over time. However,
nightlight, while certainly informative of human activity, does not exhaust economic

                                             147
activity in all places. In particular, in countries where electricity is unreliable and there is
significant reliance on generators for production activities, nightlight could be
underestimating economic activity. This would be true especially if the generators are
turned on at all at night for cost reasons. In addition, in countries that are mostly rural and
where the mainstay of the economy is agriculture, an overreliance on nightlight might miss
a big fraction of economic activity, even if electricity is in fact reliable. Fortunately, remote
sensing data can be used for capturing agricultural activities, as well, and the next section
discusses one such datum.


The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and agricultural production
Numerous methods exist for estimating production of agricultural commodities at a
specified geographic area using remote sensing technology. But most approaches rely on
the idea that vegetation, including crops, is very reflective in the red and near-infrared
(NIR) wavelengths. Combinations of these two wavelengths (that is, vegetation indexes)
are good measures of plant vigor and are the mainstay of nearly all approaches to crop yield
estimation (Lobell 2013). Yields are then estimated through establishing the empirical
relationship between ground-based yield measures and some vegetation indexes, typically
the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
Errors in remote-sensing crop-yield estimates vary, mainly as a function of sensor
properties (spatial-, temporal-, and spectral-resolution) and landscape complexity.
Classification of crop types is more problematic in regions characterized by multiple crops
with similar life cycles (that is, phonologies), or in regions with intercropped fields (Lobell
2013). Additional complexity is added with cassava, a major crop for which even farmers
themselves have difficulty estimating yields. This is basically because it is a root crop with
staggered harvesting, but also with widely differing above-ground architecture. Sometimes
overlooked is the problem of cloud cover in satellite-based remote sensing, which could
severely limit the number of available observations for a particular geographic region.
Nevertheless, yield estimation in mixed cropping systems, characteristic of African
smallholder agriculture, should be possible, using a remote sensor platform with the correct
properties. This indeed is the case, and the next section describes the data that is used to
obtain local economic production, including agriculture.
Long-time analysis of NDVI can reveal important information on vegetation anomalies
caused by variations in rainfall, temperature, and sunlight (irradiance) as well as the trend
for a certain location. Phenological metrics, such as the start and end of growing season(s),
length of season, mid-season time, seasonal amplitude in NDVI, and rate of increase and
decrease at the beginning and end of the season can be related to management and crop
yields for individual years and for longer periods. Medium-resolution remote sensing data

from MODIS53 are available from 2000 onward, aggregated into 16-day averages. For
every 16 days observations are available on how the vegetation changes at each pixel level.
Phenological metrics are extracted using the Timesat software, which gives information in
graphs showing how the vegetation changes at every pixel (Jönsson and Eklundh 2012).
For mapping output of agricultural products using remote sensing that can be compared to
other data that are thought to control crop yields, we use explanatory variables, such as
greenness, temperature, moisture levels, and management variables, which are then
statistically analyzed to derive the relative importance of each variable in driving crop
yields. There are several examples of this approach found in the literature (for example,
Lobell et al. 2005), but few that account for spatial autocorrelation and other peculiarities
associated with spatial data analysis. Thriving on the possibilities of remote sensing data
(large sample size compared to others), we attempt to identify interactions, nonlinearities,
or thresholds that are not evident in small samples and with ordinary statistical tools.
A second method to study yield gap causes is to examine the spatial distribution of average
yields with the average calculated over varying lengths of time. The basic idea is that
averages calculated over longer periods will show less spatial variation than averages for
shorter periods, since factors that are less persistent tend to cancel out across years. This
approach has been used extensively by Lobell in various study sites (Lobell et al. 2010).
Among other things, the steepness of these curves can provide insight into the persistence
of spatial yield differences throughout the study period. This can then be related to other
persistent factors (soil quality, hydrology, and so forth). Lack of persistence of yield
patterns does not suggest that, for example, farmer skills or socioeconomic factors are not
important, but that variations in these factors are not sufficient to explain yield differences.


 5.3 Data

Three sources of remote sensing data are used to estimate the effects of mining on local
economic activity: nighttime lights, NDVI, and forest loss. Nighttime lights data are from
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s National Geophysical Data Center
(NOAA-NGDC). The NOAA-NGDC produces three annual nighttime lights products:
cloud-free composite, average visible lights composite, and stable lights composite.54 For
this study, these data were processed in two steps. First, gas flares were removed using a
set of ESRI55 shapefiles available from NOAA-NGDC, which contain polygons outlining
the location of gas flares for each country. Second, the data were intercalibrated to allow

cross-year analysis. The intercalibration procedure developed by Elvidge et al. (2009b) was
aimed at overcoming the limited comparability of the DMSP-OLS data by calibrating each
composite against one base composite. It is a regression-based technique that works under
the assumption that the lighting levels in a reference area have remained relatively constant
over time and can therefore be used as the dependent variable.

Table 5.1 shows the satellite-year pairs that are used for the intercalibration. As indicated
in the table, satellite F18 and year 2010 (denoted as F182010) was chosen as the base
composite because, overall, its pixels contained the highest intensity, measured by digital
numbers (DN).56 Next, for each composite the following quadratic regression equation was
estimated:
                                            = 0 + 1  + 2  2


Table 5.1 shows the resulting calibration coefficients (C), which were applied to each
composite so that a new value (y) was calculated based on the original value (x). Any values
over 63 were truncated so that the range of the values remained between 0 and 63. In
principle, we can obtain light-intensity data for very small areas, up to a cell size of 1 km2.
Alternatively, one can take the average over small areas and create 21 composites, each
representing one year of nighttime lights between 1992 and 2012.

Since the focus of the analysis is on assessing the impact of mining on local economic
activity, a measure of the total intensity of lighting is created-- a sum of light (SOL)--for
all the cells around the mining areas and for each unit of the lowest administrative level
possible in each country. The latter serves the purpose of helping us link the intensity of
light to local economic activity, where unlike the areas around the mine, the local here is
defined as district.
The NDVI57 data are provided as a global dataset, with a 16-day temporal resolution and a
spatial resolution of 250 x 250 meters. NDVI is a dimensionless spectral index that relates
to the photosynthetic uptake by vegetation (Myneni and Williams 1994; Sellers 1985). It
is calculated from the near infrared (NIR) and red wavelength bands by using the following
relationship:
                                   NDVI = (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red).




56
   In their study, Elvidge et al. (2009b, 2013) selected F121999 as the base composite. The difference in the
selection is attributed to the fact that Elvidge et al. (2009b; 2013) were intercalibrating a worldwide dataset,
while the present study examines only the African case.
57
   The NDVI from MODIS vegetation indexes product MOD13Q1 were used (ORNL DAAC 2011).

It has previously been shown that NDVI is related to, for example, the vegetation
greenness, leaf area index (LAI), and primary productivity of the vegetation (Johnson
2003; Paruelo et al. 1997). Furthermore, it has been documented that a time series of NDVI
can be used to assess the changes in vegetation cover and responses over time (Hill and
Donald 2003). In addition, it can be used to estimate agricultural yields (Labus et al. 2010;
Ren et al. 2008). This makes it possible to evaluate the vegetation status and the agricultural
productivity on a large scale, by using remotely sensed NDVI, in regions where field data
are sparse.
To decrease the processing time of NDVI data, a mask was constructed to exclude areas
that are not associated with the agricultural economy.58 The mask was produced by

58
     For this purpose, the MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) was used (Friedl et al. 2010).

                                                   151
combining land covers from the MODIS Land Cover Type product. The MODIS land
cover scheme identifies 17 land cover classes,59 which include 11 natural vegetation
classes, 3 developed and mosaic land classes, and three nonvegetated land classes. Here,
desired classes were Croplands (Number 12) and Cropland/Natural vegetation mosaic
(Number 14). For areas within these two classes, yearly amplitude NDVI was calculated.
The recent global dataset60 of Hansen et al. (2013) was used to quantify forest loss annually.
This is a map of the extent, loss, and gain of global tree cover for 2000 to 2012 at a spatial
resolution of 30 meters. The dataset improves on existing knowledge of global forest extent
and change by being spatially explicit, quantifying gross forest loss and gain, providing
annual loss information, and quantifying trends in forest loss. Forest loss was defined as a
stand-replacement disturbance or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat
pixel scale. Tiles were merged into larger composites and reclassified into 12 layers, one
for each year, thus separating each individual forest loss year. Instead of sum of lights, sum
of forest loss was calculated in the same way as nightlights.
In addition, agricultural production data was obtained from the statistical offices in Ghana,
Tanzania, and Mali to analyze the relationship between NDVI and agricultural production.
The data were compiled at the district level and represent all agricultural products produced
during one year. Ghana had data for 2001 to 2012, Tanzania for 2007 and 2008, and Mali
for 2002 to 2007.

Finally, official GDP data were also obtained from the World Bank World Development
Indicators open data database (World Bank Group 2014). Data were downloaded for each
country on a yearly basis from 1992 to 2012. All GDP data are expressed in constant 2005
U.S. dollars.


 5.4 Growth Model and Results

In order to use these remote sensing data, it has to be demonstrated that these data can
indeed predict or track the pattern of data collected through statistical offices. In other
words, it is important to demonstrate the strength of the correlation between the remote
sensing data and the actual data that are collected by administrative agencies in countries.
Especially, for NDVI, some knowledge of the agricultural production at district levels, and
preferably at even more local administrative units, is needed.
In this spirit, this section has three parts. First, it establishes the correlation between NDVI
and actual agricultural production. Second, it estimates the national and local growth model
based on time series analysis covering 2001 to 2012 at the district level in the case countries

and combining nightlight, NDVI, and forest loss data to estimate the size of the local
economy. Third, it applies a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the effect of
mining on local economic activity, with a particular focus on local agricultural production.


NDVI and agricultural production
The remote sensing data allow the computation of NDVI for areas of any size, but actual
agricultural production are only available at the district level for this study. Therefore, the
first task is to show a spatial correlation of NDVI and actual agricultural production at
district levels. An important difference between spatial and traditional (a-spatial)
estimations, such as OLS regression, is that spatial statistics integrate space and spatial
relationships directly into their models. Depending on the specific technique, spatial
dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent
variables and the outcome variable, between the outcome variables and a spatial lag of
itself, or in unexplained (that is, error) terms. Geographically weighted regression (GWR)
is a spatial regression, applied to the small geographic areas, which generates parameters
disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis. This allows for assessment of the spatial
heterogeneity in the estimated relationships between the independent and dependent
variables (Fotheringham, Brundsdon, and Charlton 2002).

The analysis shows a strong association between actual production of agricultural products
and NDVI using spatial regression. Figure 5.1 illustrates the varying spatial relationship
between the two estimates of agricultural production using 2007 data: NDVI and official
statistics covering agricultural production. Other years show similar results, and the
summary of the strength of the association is shown in the Annex (Annex figure A.5.5 and
table A.5.1). The sum of NDVI at the district level is used as a predictor for the level of
agricultural production. The pattern that emerges is one of a highly-to-moderately-strong
correlation between agricultural production and NDVI in areas with high population
densities. In most years and countries—with the exception of Mali—over 60 percent of the
variation in district-level agricultural production can be explained by the differences in the
average district-level NDVI intensity (see Annex table A.5.1). We are not able to determine
whether the agricultural data include nonmarketed production, which in all these countries
could be substantial. That said, the strong correlation between NDVI and agricultural
production gives us confidence to use NDVI to predict agricultural production for small
areas—say, around the mine.

independent variable, sum of NDVI intensity, by district, 2007




National Growth Model
In addition to its impact on agriculture, there interest in knowing whether mining has
substantial economic benefits—spillover effects—on local economies. The previous
section showed that the strong association between NDVI and agricultural production
justifies the use of the NDVI data for measuring the changes to agricultural production
around the mines. Similarly, one could use the nightlight data, which have been
demonstrated to predict economic activity, to capture changes to the local economy around
the mines. While district-level agricultural output data is available, district-level GDP
information is not. Consequently, first a national model is needed to estimate aggregate
GDP and then parameters from such a model are used to obtain local economic production.
The basic estimation strategy follows Henderson et al. (2012), whose framework can be
shown as:



                                           154
                      ̂ xjt + cj + dt + ejt
                γjt = ψ                                                            (1)


where  is the true GDP of country j in time t.  is the level of observed nighttime light
at corresponding country and time. cj and dj are country and year fixed effects, and  is
the error term. As stated above, this is a model of the aggregate economy. It suggests that
the total production or total economic activity (or its changes) is explained by level of
measured nightlight (or its percentage growth) observed by satellite adjusted for some
country- and time-invariant effects and an error term.
Following standard practices, the error term is assumed to be uncorrelated with GDP
measurement. Given that the GDP and the nightlight come from two independent sources,
the assumption would seem to be appropriate. However, using gridded data of land cover
and nighttime light, we find that it is possible for agriculture’s value-added to increase
without emitting more observable nighttime light into space. If this is the case, then the
error term is actually dependent on the agricultural share, since the higher the agricultural
share the higher the measurement error from the nighttime lights.
Given this observation, our estimation follows the framework in equation (1), but takes
note of the fact that not all economic growth, especially in heavily agricultural societies, is
captured by growth in observed nighttime light only. The working assumption here is that
nighttime light observed in space is the result of growth in only the nonagricultural sector.
We therefore split the Henderson et al. (2012) model into a separate nonagricultural
(equation 2) and agricultural (equation 3) parts, which are then combined in equation 4.

Equation (2) is the familiar model that links GDP level (or growth) to the sum (or growth)
of nighttime lights. We argue here that this model is mostly predictive of nonagricultural
data. In equation (3) we extend this model to the agricultural sector by introducing two
variables: MODIS NDVI and forest loss. Finally, a year dummy (year 2004 as a cutoff
year) is added to obtain three models of income (growth) for each country, combining
nightlight, NDVI, forest loss, and a year dummy—see equations 4–6. The rationale for

using a year dummy and specifically using 2004 is related to Ghana’s rebasing of their
GDP around 2006, and most of the commodity prices started rising around that time.

The model is designed so that the regression line departs from the origin with the y-
intercept being equal to 0. The rationale behind not using the intercept is that in the second
step of the model, we are estimating local growth by using the national growth model to fit
with local parameters at the district level. The dynamics of the local economy are
dependent on the relationship between the variables used in the national growth model.
Including a national intercept term would result in a mismatch due to the spatial scale of
the local estimations.
Figure 5.2 shows the correspondence between the actual evolution of aggregate production
and the pattern of predicted output that can be obtained using the three different models
(4–6) for each country.

Figure 5.2 Actual and predicted log (GDP) using 3 different models, 2001–12




Three observations can be drawn from figure 5.2. First, the remote sensing data are strongly
predictive of the actual evolution of GDP in all countries and with better predicted levels
of GDP when including all three types of remote sensing data. The best fit is the model for
Ghana, especially the period after year 2004. In Mali and Burkina Faso, the actual log
(GDP) and predicted log (GDP) (using log nightlight, forest loss, and NDVI) are very close
for almost every year except for larger spikes in 2009 and 2001. By contrast, for Tanzania,
while the correlations are strong, there are periods when the remote sensing data
underestimates and others when it over-predicts total production. Similar spikes in the data,
especially for log nightlight, can be observed in Tanzania. The odd pattern in the last years
of the model for Burkina Faso, Tanzania, and Mali is similar to the pattern observed for
light data at the global level (Annex figure A.5.1). This pattern might be explained by a


                                            157
combination of the following reasons related to nighttime light: real variation in nighttime
light data between the years, calibration effects, and truncation of values over 63 (light-
intensive over 63)
In addition, as suspected, nightlight alone is not sufficient to predict aggregate production.
While it is true that nightlight stands out as strongly correlated with GDP, inclusion of the
NDVI improves the fit of the model (table 5.2). In fact, the country models seem to suggest
that nightlight with NDVI performs better than any other specification (for example,
nightlights, NDVI, and forest loss) in predicting log (GDP). Only in Ghana is the forest
loss statistically significant. Results from the other countries do not show any significance
by adding forest loss, so this variable is dropped in all the estimation models.

Finally, even though agriculture accounts for the largest share of economic activity in all
these countries, NDVI is strongly significant only for the model of Burkina Faso and Mali.
Adding forest loss to the model does not change the model fit, and the variable is only
significant in Ghana. Finally, the year dummy is strongly significant for Ghana, but does
not influence the results for the other countries.

Growth model at district levels
Ideally, we would like to estimate a model linking GDP at the local level to georeferenced
data. Unfortunately, while the georeferenced data can be compiled for areas smaller than
even a district, administrative data for district-level GDP is not available. Therefore, the
parameters of the relationship between GDP and georeferenced data at the national level
are used to impute district-level production in each case study country. The models are
based on the regression results from equations (4–6) and presented in table 5.3. Thus, the
local growth model is based on the national growth model.
When developing the growth model for districts, several methods were used in order to
provide an accurate local dimension of the local economy. Population data and average
household expenditure on district levels were included as weights in the model estimating
local growth patterns. However, population at the district level was highly correlated with
nightlight intensity at the district levels, and average household expenditure at the district
level was highly correlated with GDP at the local levels (see Annex figures A.5.3 and A.5.4
for correlation analysis), and therefore not used in the estimations.
The results of the district-level growth patterns are displayed in a series of maps and graphs
in the Annex. Annex figure A.5.2 presents maps of the imputed growth patterns at the
district level. The maps tag districts into those that are predicted to have had negative,
moderate, or high growth. These maps provide a visual display of the geography of growth
in each country.
A look at the maps leads to three main conclusions. First, average growth in mining districts
appears to be higher than in nonmining districts. In Ghana, the average growth rates turn
positive if the growth in districts neighboring the mining districts area taken into account.
The map suggests that effects on mining could evolve differently around mining and
nonmining areas in different countries. And the differential evolution could have an impact
on local economic growth. However, to test whether these spatial patterns of measured
local economic growth are due to mining activities requires a more rigorous test than a
mere visual inspection. A suitable test and the results are presented in the next section.

Nightlights and NDVI in a Difference-in-Differences Framework


Empirical Framework


To understand whether nightlights and the greenness index in mining communities are
linked with the onset of mining, a difference-in-differences empirical estimation strategy
is used.61 This strategy allows comparison of outcomes in the geographic proximity of
mines with areas farther away, both before and after the mines start producing. In effect,
this involves making three comparisons: close to and far away, before and after, and both
comparisons at the same time. The cross-sectional differences in areas with an active mine,
and without an active mine are modeled as:


                                                Yjt = β1 activejt + εj


where Y is the outcome variable (nightlights and NDVI), active is a binary variable that
takes value 1 if the mine is active in that year, and subscript j is for the mine and t for the
year. The importance of proximity can be modeled as:


                                                    = 1  + 
                                                  


where close captures the cross-sectional difference between areas that are close to mines
and those that are further away. Interest is in knowing the relative change that happens in
the geographic proximity of mines with the onset of the mine, compared to what happens
far away from the mine. This is captured by the difference-in-differences estimation model,
which includes an interaction effect of the two binary variables:


                 = 1  + 2  + 3  ∗  +  + 
               


where  is a mine fixed effect, which means that any change that is peculiar to a mine is
accounted for. Year fixed effects, which will take care of year-specific shocks that happen
across all mines, are also captured. To decide the relevant distances for examining the
footprint of gold mines, the analysis draws guidance from recent studies in the African

61
 This strategy is employed to understand the economic effects of gold mining in Africa by Aragon and
Rud 2015; Chuhan-Pole, Dabalen, Kotsadam, Sanoh, and Tolonen 2015; and Tolonen 2015.

                                                              160
context.62 These studies find that areas up to a 20-km radius are relevant, and that beyond
50 km the mines have little economic footprint. Moreover, we rely on the geographic
results found in this paper. Consequently, a distance of 10 km is chosen to understand the
footprint close to mines. This is compared with an area that is 10 km, 20 km, 30 km, and
50 km to 100 km away. The total sample size is 32 gold mines located in Burkina Faso,
Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania.


Results


Figure 5.3 explores the change in the different distances from the mine, over the mines’
lifetime. On the horizontal axis is the mine year, counting from 10 years before mine
opening, highlighted by the red vertical line, to 10 years after mine opening. The figures
are based on summary statistics, and do not control for any systematic differences across
the mines. Overall, it seems like areas very close to mines are on a steeper trend in
nightlights than are areas farther away, especially as one gets closer to the mine opening
year, which is highlighted by the red vertical line. One interpretation of this pattern is that
from a few years before the mine starts extracting gold, economic activity that emits
nightlight increases in these areas. One reason why this happens before the actual mine
opening year is because mines are capital-intensive and the local economy is stimulated
during this investment phase, a pattern confirmed in previously mentioned econometric
studies.
For NDVI, no big difference in patterns is observed across the areas. Although both areas
seem to be on an upward sloping trend, this needs to be interpreted with caution, because
it can be driven by the unbalanced sample63. If anything, we detect that areas close to mines
are getting relatively greener over time compared with areas further away.

  The sample is unbalanced as the data on nighlights start in 2002, but mines may have opened long before
2002, as well as after. If the mines opened before 2002, we will have night lights data only during the
active period of the mine. Such mines would then add to the estimates of night lights on the right side of the
red line, but not to the left. There are too few mines for which we have night lights the whole 20-year
period to do these figures on a perfectly balanced subsample.

Figure 5.3 Nightlight, NDVI over mine lifetime




Note: Nonparametric (local polynomial smooth) measures of nightlight and NDVI close to mines. Years
since mine opening on the x-axis counts the number of years from mine opening, with before the opening on
the left of the 0, and years after mine opening to the right of the 0. Nightlights and NDVI are measured as
averages across limited geographic areas, varying from within 10 km from the mine center point, to 20 km,
30 km, 50 km, and 100 km.

Table 5.4 shows the regression results from the strategies outlined in the Empirical
Framework section. The results indicate that there are clear increases in nightlights close
to mines. The strongest effects are found within 10 km of a mine (panel A, column 1). The
measures are simple differences, and compare within a given area before and after mine
opening. The larger the distance used to define the area close to a mine, the smaller the
effect sizes are. Note that these estimates are simple differences and they do not take into
account local trends in nightlights (for that, see the difference-in-difference analysis
below).

There is also the possibility that the model may be overestimating the effect size because
it does not capture changes in the composition of local production with just nightlights. For
instance, if households engaging in subsistence farming did not have electricity, but
demand more of it in order to change to more modern sectors at the time of opening of the
mine, then the increased demand for electricity will lead to an increase in nightlights.
However, the decrease in farming that will result from occupational switching will not be
reflected in the changes in nightlight if subsistence farming does not use electricity. In such
a scenario, the effect of the mine on the local economy would be overestimated.
Findings from the difference-in-differences analysis are presented in table 5.5. The results
do not show any robust increases in nightlights or NDVI in mining communities (20 km)
compared with those further away (20 to 100 km). The estimated effects are insignificant
for the main treatment coefficient active_close. The statistically significant coefficient for
active in the first specification shows that there are more nightlights across the whole area
after mine opening compared with before. The coefficient is insignificant when controlling
for year fixed effects, which indicates that there are trends in nightlights. Assessing the
visual evidence in figure A.4.3, suggests that there is only a modest increase in nightlights
over the area within 20 km of a gold mine around the time of the opening, but that this is
not true in the long run.

of a mine. ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1


If mines increase the urbanization rate or lead to decreased local farming--as found by
Aragón and Rud 2015--greenness in mining areas should decrease. In short, values of the
NDVI measure of greenness used in our model should decline. In table 5.4, panel B shows
that areas close to mines have higher levels of NDVI (column 2, 3, and 4). This could be
                                                    163
indicative of mining areas being more rural in general. However, the interaction terms
(table 4.5, column 3 and 4) are insignificant and negative, indicating that NDVI does not
change statistically with the onset of mining.


5.5 Conclusions

The objective of this chapter was to use remote sensing data to estimate the level and
growth (or decline) of local economic activities around the mining areas in Burkina Faso,
Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania. The analysis was divided into two parts.
First, it established the spatial relationship between NDVI and actual agricultural
production at the district level on one hand, and nightlights and overall economic output
(GDP) on the other. The results were encouraging. It was found that the NDVI—or
greenness index—and nightlights are good predictors (a relatively high r-squared) of
economic activities in these countries. However, forest loss as a predictor of economic
growth did not provide increased explanatory power to model economic growth on the
national level, so forest loss was dropped when modeling economic growth on local levels.
The remote sensing datasets used in the study covered 2001–12, providing not only high
spatial resolution but also a time series perspective in order to account for change over
time.
Second, having shown that remote sensing data provide a useful measure of economic
activity, the chapter makes use of these remote sensing data to compare growth in economic
activities around mining areas to those far away using a difference-in-differences
framework.
The findings can be summarized in two points. First, the analysis of a selected set of 32
gold mines from four African countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania)
suggests that the onset of mines is associated with increases in economic activity—as
proxied by nightlights—within the vicinity of the mines. Graphic analysis of the night
lights data show strong increases in night lights mining communities within 10km from a
mine in the years immediately before mine opening, and the years following mine opening.
A simple-difference analysis illustrates that the very near areas (within 10km) have
significantly higher levels of economic activity after mine opening. However, the
difference-in-difference analysis illustrates that over time, the areas near the mines are not
significantly better off than areas further away. This may partially indicate that with time,
the economic benefits from mining spread over a larger area from the mine’s center point.
The finding that economic growth increases is in contrast to the common perception that
views large-scale mines as economic enclaves separated from the local economies.
Proximity is defined as an area within 10 km, 20 km, 30 km, or 40 km from the location of
the mine, and the control group is drawn from an area 50 to 100 km away. Second, despite

                                             164
the risks that mines pose to agricultural productivity, for example, through environmental
pollution or structural shifts in the labor market, there is no evidence of a decrease in
greenness—which is the measure of agricultural production. Furthermore, the effects of
small-scale and artisanal mining activities, common in the study countries, upon economic
growth and greenness are not discussed within this report.

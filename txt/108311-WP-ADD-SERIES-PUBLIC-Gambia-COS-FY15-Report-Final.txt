I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in The Gambia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing The Gambia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in The Gambia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From June to September 2015, 657 stakeholders of the WBG in The Gambia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management
Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on
WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 274 stakeholders participated in the survey
(42% response rate).

Respondents received and completed the questionnaire either with the presence of an
independent fielding consultant or via email. Respondents were asked about: general issues
facing The Gambia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and
results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future
role in The Gambia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 60%, N=150). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 103).

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and respondents in the
        FY’12 Country Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG
        (weighted mean in FY’15 = 5.3; weighted mean in FY’12 = 4.8)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in The Gambia, the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in The Gambia, and the extent to which
        the WBG contributes to the country’s development results.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’12 Country Survey indicated that
       they most often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to the
       following: “lack of/inadequate levels of capacity in government? (41%), “reforms are not
       well thought out in light of country challenges? (33%), and “government works
       inefficiently/too slowly (32%).?
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from local
       governments, CSOs, and the Office of President/Prime Minister/Minister were
       significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to that
       “inadequate level of citizen/civil society participation,? compared to respondents from
       other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in The Gambia,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in The Gambia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in The Gambia, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year20
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY ‘12 Number of comparable respondents = 138  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 174

By weighting, the FY 2012 data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2015. Therefore, the
two years are comparable. Respondents from PMU, private foundations, media, faith-based groups,
youth groups, the judiciary branch, and the Federal/Central Government were not included in the year
comparison analysis, because there were no respondents from the PMU, private foundations, media,
faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch in FY 2015 and no respondents from the
media, faith-based groups, the judiciary branch and the Federal/Central Government in FY 2012. The
weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

(i)    Background. The Aral Sea Basin consists of the drainage area of two major rivers, the
Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. The rivers originate in the Tien Shan Mountains and the Pamirs,
and run through Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan. The basin is home to almost 60 million people, and provides irrigation to 11.4
million hectares (Ha). An estimated 116 km3 is diverted for irrigation, one of the key drivers of
economic growth, employment, poverty reduction and food security in the region. At the same
time, diversion of water for irrigation of vast agricultural fields has contributed to severe
environmental and health problems in the basin.

(ii)    As a result of population increases, climate change, and economic development, water
resources in Central Asia are increasingly under pressure. At the regional level, annual water
availability per person per year, currently 2,500 m3, is expected by 2030 to reach only 1,700 m3
per person per year, the internationally recognized level for water stress.

(iii) Despite mounting pressures and increasing water stress, water use in irrigated agriculture
is particularly wasteful, with irrigation efficiencies often not more than 30 percent. Improving
irrigation efficiency has important regional implications, because large amounts of water could
be unlocked for more productive purposes. For example, more efficient use of irrigation water
could help increase the water flows into the delta areas of the Aral Sea, and into the Aral Sea
itself. Similarly, securing access to drinking water of adequate quality in the downstream parts of
the basin requires a more efficient use of water and a reallocation of that water for drinking water
purposes.

(iv)    But irrigation efficiency is also important from a national perspective. Pumping plays an
important role in Central Asia’s irrigated agriculture and accounts for significant sunk and
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. For instance, in Uzbekistan, electricity use for
Irrigation and Drainage (I&D) pumps accounts for 16 percent of national electricity generation,
costing close to US$350 million annually and accounting for 60 percent of the annual budget of
the ministry responsible for irrigation. In Tajikistan, over 40 percent of irrigated agriculture
relies on pumps – the highest percentage in Central Asia. With more than 20 percent of Central
Asia’s I&D served by pumps, achieving low irrigation efficiencies comes at a high cost.

(v)      Scope and objectives of the study. Against this background, a study of irrigation
inefficiency in Tajikistan was conducted as the first phase of a larger regional assessment of
irrigation inefficiency in Central Asia. This study focuses on Tajikistan in recognition of the
interest expressed by national authorities who have articulated concerns about the intensity of
energy and water in Tajikistan’s economy. Along with its Central Asian neighbors, Tajikistan is
highly water- and energy-intensive. The irrigation sector is one of the largest consumers of
power in the country. Irrigation efficiency and energy use in the sector are intricately interlinked,
and inefficiencies in the use of one resource inevitably have an impact on the other.

(vi)    The study focused on causes, costs, and solutions of low irrigation efficiency in
Tajikistan’s irrigated agriculture. Its main purpose was to raise awareness about the high costs
resulting from irrigation inefficiency in Tajikistan.


                                                 1
(vii) A second objective was to develop a methodology for estimating the costs of irrigation
inefficiency that might be used when extrapolating the results of the study to other countries in
Central Asia.

(viii) Definition of irrigation inefficiency. Irrigation inefficiency is defined in this study as
the amount of water that is being supplied in excess of beneficial consumptive and evaporative
demand. The Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internal Calibration
(METRIC) methodology was used to estimate crop evapotranspiration of irrigated crops.

(ix)     Field studies. In six representative irrigation schemes in the country, field studies were
conducted. The methodology that was used in this study involved (i) determining irrigation
inefficiency, (ii) determining the costs of pump irrigation, and (iii) determining the costs of
irrigation inefficiency. The study identified a range of technical socio-economic and institutional
factors contributing to the inefficiency of pump irrigation. They include: limited knowledge and
incentives among farmers; extreme sand wear of pumps; problems with poor electric power
quality; periodic power outages; deteriorating conditions of the pumping infrastructure; and a
network of adjacent irrigation canals.

(x)      Costs of irrigation inefficiency. The costs of irrigation inefficiency are proportional to
the electricity used to pump water. Other fixed costs are not (or less) proportional to inefficiency
and were not analyzed in detail. The costs of inefficiency includes electricity costs, direct and
indirect price subsidies to agriculture and energy sectors for electricity, and foregone revenues of
the Tajikistan national power company, Barqi Tojik, due to bad debts, including cancellation of
debts in the irrigation sector. The total cost of pump irrigation to the country was assessed as
substantial. In 2013 alone, for instance, the annual cost of pump irrigation in the country was
US$31.09 million. The cumulative cost for the period from 2005-13 is even more striking:
US$217.89 million or US$95.54 per ha annually. According to FAOSTAT, a statistical report of
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2011 an estimated
income generated by one hectare of irrigated land was approximately US$95.00, while the cost
of pumped irrigation for the same year was US$120.84 per ha (if we consider the losses as a
result of electricity subsidies), or US$72.25 per ha (if we don’t consider these losses). Because of
the high costs of pumped irrigation, maintaining rural livelihoods through public support for
irrigation comes at a high real cost to the national budget.

(xi)    Cumulative paid and unpaid electricity costs and electricity subsidies from 2005 to 2013
amounted to US$139.48 million, or 69.0 percent of total O&M costs. The costs of irrigation
inefficiency at 72 percent was estimated at US$100.43 million from 2005 to 2013. This
represents US$11.16 million per year on average, or US$44.11 per irrigated hectare per year.

(xii) The Governments of Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan recently
signed a power purchase agreement to sell excess summer energy from the Kyrgyz Republic and
Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result of this power purchase agreement, Tajikistan
can now sell excess summer energy to Afghanistan and Pakistan for US$0.05 per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) – significantly higher than the 2013 rate of US$0.0041 per kWh and the 2014 rate of
US$0.0035 per KWh that the government of Tajikistan charged farmers for pumped irrigation -
and cost recovery is limited. Until recently, summer energy surpluses and comparably minimal
water demands of other sectors reduced the opportunity costs of summer energy (and of the

                                                 2
efforts to improve efficiency in the summer) to close to zero. The competing and more profitable
use of summer energy is thus expected to provide an incentive to the Government of Tajikistan
to pursue irrigation efficiency.

(xiii) In view of this development, the analysis examined the cost implications of improved
pump irrigation efficiency under three different scenarios. The scenarios are based on different
mixes of investments in irrigation efficiency and use of saved water for irrigation expansion or
electricity generation. In Scenario 1, estimates are made of the efficiency improvements and
energy savings that will be gained as a result of training of Water User Associations (WUA) and
Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI) staff. No physical investments will be made
in this scenario, and water savings will be used for irrigation expansion. In Scenario 2, an
assumption is made that in addition to the training under scenario 1, physical investments will be
made in irrigation infrastructure to improve efficiency, and savings will be used to expand
irrigation. In Scenario 3, an assumption is made that water savings as a result of efficiency
improvements will be used to generate electricity that will be sold to Afghanistan and Pakistan
for institutional strengthening. Instead of using water savings gained from efficiency
improvements for irrigation expansion, these savings will be used to generate electricity.

(xiv) The results of the analysis of these three scenarios suggests that the highest reduction in
costs to the country at 62 percent will be achieved mainly through the release of saved power to
the export market (that is, 57 percent from exported energy and 5 percent from increased
collection of irrigation service fees and power fees). In other words, the cost of pump irrigation
to the country cannot be meaningfully reduced when the saved energy is used to expand
irrigation coverage that is using energy at a subsidized rate. If the government follows the pump
irrigation cost reduction model proposed under Scenario 3, the earnings from the power exports
could then be used to support the population whose livelihoods depend on pump irrigation.

I.     INTRODUCTION

     A. Background

1.      The Aral Sea Basin consists of the drainage area of two major rivers, the Amu Darya and
the Syr Darya. The rivers originate in the Tien Shan Mountains and the Pamirs, and run through
Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The
basin is home to almost 60 million people, and provides irrigation to 11.4 million hectares. An
estimated 116 km3 is diverted for irrigation, one of the key drivers of economic growth,
employment, poverty reduction, and food security in the region. At the same time, diversion of
water for irrigation of vast agricultural fields has contributed to severe environmental and health
problems in the basin.

2.      Water resources in Central Asia are increasingly under pressure. For example, in
Uzbekistan, average annual water availability per year and per person is already close to 1,700
m3, which is the threshold for water stress. At the regional level, annual water availability per
person, currently 2,500 m3, is expected to reach this stress level by 2030. In addition, abundance
and shortage have important seasonal, geographic, and economic dimensions because
downstream countries are highly dependent on upstream countries for obtaining essential water
for irrigation. Hydropower resources are concentrated in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan,
while thermal energy resources are concentrated in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.

3.     Despite emerging water stress, water continues to be used in a particularly wasteful
manner. Irrigation efficiency in the region is estimated at about 30 percent (that is, only 30
percent of the water that is withdrawn from the rivers for a specific irrigated area actually
reaches the roots of plants), and average annual abstraction for irrigation is well over 15,000 m3
per hectare. Low irrigation efficiency and high water losses are associated with the fact that
much of Central Asia’s hydraulic assets were developed from the 1960s to the1980s and are now
aging as a result of deferred maintenance. But policies, institutions, and human capacities also
play a role in providing an environment that is less favorable for using water efficiently. For
instance, the use of mandatory production quotas in some countries in Central Asia, and the
hands-on involvement of local authorities in water management to make sure the quotas are
being met, often lead to chaotic water management schemes that result in high operational losses.

4.      Improving irrigation efficiency has important regional implications because large
amounts of water could be unlocked for more productive purposes by other sectors or in other
locations in the basin. For example, more efficient use of irrigation water could help increase the
water flows into the delta areas of the Aral Sea, and into the Aral Sea itself. Similarly, securing
access to drinking water of adequate quality in the downstream parts of the basin requires a more
efficient use of water and a reallocation of that water for drinking water purposes.

5.       But irrigation efficiency is also important from a national perspective. Pumping plays an
important role in Central Asia’s irrigated agriculture and accounts for significant sunk and
operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. For instance, in Uzbekistan, electricity use for
irrigation and drainage (I&D) pumps accounts for 16 percent of national electricity generation,
costing close to US$350 million annually, and accounting for 60 percent of the annual budget of
the ministry responsible for irrigation. With more than 20 percent of Central Asia’s I&D served
by pumps, achieving low irrigation efficiencies comes at a high cost in the national budgets.
                                                4
6.      As a result of inefficient use of irrigation water, all Central Asian countries score high in
global rankings that compare the water use per person and per unit of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP). Central Asian countries are among the most water-intensive economies in the world.
Aside from the environmental consequences of desertification and salinization, water scarcity is
becoming a binding constraint to growth in irrigated agriculture. A more efficient use of water
would reduce the costs of inefficient use and increase the returns in terms of agricultural
production, productivity, and income.

7.     Helping Central Asia countries improve irrigation efficiency would thus provide an
important contribution to reducing public expenditures and increasing incomes. Determining the
high costs of inefficiency would be the first step, a step that this study sets out to do.

8.       The study focuses on Tajikistan in recognition of the interest expressed by national
authorities who have articulated concerns about the intensity of energy and water in Tajikistan’s
economy. Like its Central Asian neighbors, Tajikistan is highly water- and energy-intensive.
Ninety percent of water withdrawals in the country is allocated to irrigation, with 44 percent of
the area that was originally equipped for irrigation being reliant on pumps. The irrigation sector
accounts for a significant proportion of the total national electricity bill, and is also one of the
largest consumers of power in the country. Irrigation efficiency and energy use in the sector are
intricately interlinked, and inefficiencies in the use of one resource inevitably have an impact on
the other. (See Appendix D for a Background Note on the relationship between energy and
irrigation in Tajikistan.)

   B. Scope and Methodology of the Study

9.      The study is the first phase of a larger, regional assessment of irrigation inefficiency in
Central Asia aimed at sensitizing irrigation practitioners in the region about the high costs – and
therefore the importance – of irrigation inefficiency. Against this background, a study was
conducted investigate the costs, causes, and mitigation measures of low irrigation efficiencies
found in Tajikistan’s irrigated agriculture. (See Appendix B for a description of the terms of
reference for the study.) The study was designed as a pilot analysis to both identify key issues
associated with assessing irrigation inefficiency, and to extrapolate the results to other countries
in the region. Raising awareness that irrigation inefficiency comes at a high cost at the national
level (in addition to the high costs of inefficient resource allocation more broadly at the basin
level) was the main purpose of this report. A second objective was to develop a methodology for
estimating the costs of irrigation inefficiency that will be used when extrapolating the results of
the study to other countries in Central Asia

10.    The study identifies key determinants of irrigation inefficiency in Tajikistan and proposes
generic solutions targeting improvements in these areas. The report is structured along the
following pillars: (i) determining irrigation inefficiency in the context of Tajikistan; (ii)
determining the variable costs of the irrigation sector, in particular related to the performance of
pump irrigation; (iii) determining the cost of irrigation inefficiency for the economy; and (iv)
proposing aggregate solutions for addressing irrigation efficiency at the national level.

11.     Field work associated with the study was conducted in June 2013, and data were obtained
for six representative pumping schemes. Visits were also made to two pump repair shops. Initial
and subsequent information gathering was facilitated by Sulton Rahimzoda, First Deputy
                                                 5
Minister of Energy and Water Resources. (See Appendix B for a list of key visits during the
information gathering process.) Crop water use in the six scheme areas was estimated for May
and June of 2013 using the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internal
Calibration (METRIC) process, which is a computational procedure that uses data from local
weather stations and from remotely sensed Landsat satellite images to estimate water used by
crops. Appendix A contains a detailed description of the METRIC process used in the study.

12.     There is no accurate information available (locally or nationally) on scheme details such
as area per crop, pump flow rates, distribution of water throughout the schemes, and power
consumption per pump station. The six selected schemes were: (i) KNS, Zafarabod District; (ii)
KojabokirgonProject, Bobojon Gafurov District; (iii) Makhram, Kanibadam District; (iv)
Faizobodkala, Panj District; (v) Garouti, Jillikul District; and (vi) Urtabuz, Farkhor District. A
detailed description of the selected schemes is provided in Appendix C.

      C. Definition of Irrigation Efficiency

13.     For the purpose of the study, irrigation efficiency is defined as the share of the withdrawn
water that is used beneficially, as follows:

                                                                ? ??
                 ?? =                                                                               × 100
                                                                             ? 

14.     Much discussion has been devoted to determining what exactly is considered beneficial.
For instance, leaching to reduce salinity in the root zone of soils, as practiced widely in Central
Asia, can be argued to be a beneficial use of water. Similarly, leakage from canals is sometimes
used by downstream farmers for irrigation of crops and should therefore not always be
considered a loss. This study will only consider beneficial evapotranspiration (ET) as a beneficial
use.

15.      Irrigation efficiency consists of two connected subsystems, as follows:

     Conveyance efficiency (water delivery efficiency) is the ratio between beneficial
      evapotranspiration (BET) at the last field and water withdrawal from the offtake. BET refers
      to water evaporated and transpired by plants. For the purpose of this study, all other water
      use is considered a loss. The major losses fall into three categories:
          a. Seepage and spill losses between the canals and the fields
          b. Spill and seepage from canals and pipelines
          c. Operational spill, such as those associated with management of pump cascades,
              daytime-only irrigation, escape flows, and so forth.

     Field irrigation efficiency (water application efficiency) is the ratio between BET and the
      amount of water supplied to a field. It includes all losses to the scheme at the field level. The
      major losses are related to:
          a. Field characteristics, including levelness, length and gradient of furrows, length of
              fields
          b. Soil characteristics, including depth of soil profile, porosity, existence of plough pan,
              and so forth
          c. Field application techniques (furrow/basin/sprinkler/drip, and so forth).
                                                                                6
16.     Improving irrigation efficiency is not a purely technical matter, but includes a wide array
of social, policy, institutional, and agronomic measures that need to be addressed. Some of them
are focused on on-farm measures, such as providing full information to farmers and WUAs about
water delivery, and ensuring a reliable and predictable supply to farmers, educating them about
crop water requirements and specific crop irrigation schedules, and offering reliable weather
forecast services to farmers for better planning and management of water supply. Other measures
are aimed at creating incentives for farmers to adopt water-saving technologies and to improve
water management practices. Enforcement and oversight to ensure that delivery schedules are
respected are also important to ensure higher efficiencies.

17.     However, no amount of capacity and incentives can accomplish high efficiencies if
schemes are designed and operated in a manner that is too complex. For example, a long crested
weir and orifice turnout combination will help provide a fairly constant turnout discharge. Canals
that require full supply to command the fields may lose the dead storage through infiltration and
evaporation at times when the canal does not operate. Agronomy can have an impact on
efficiency because of crop choice. For example, rice uses much more water than other crops.
Improving efficiency therefore requires a comprehensive effort to address all these issues in a
consistent manner.

18.     Scheme efficiency vs. river basin efficiency. Among irrigation practitioners, it is
commonplace to downplay the importance of irrigation scheme efficiency as compared to overall
river basin efficiency. One argument is that the only water loss to a basin is through
evapotranspiration, and that infiltration and percolation losses within irrigation schemes will find
their way back to the river basin through groundwater or surface runoff. The same applies to
drainage flows, and many irrigation experts therefore speak about “effective efficiency? that
does not consider these return flows as losses in view of their re-use downstream. In fact, while
scheme efficiency can be low, overall basin efficiency can actually be very high as a result of
repeated re-use of irrigation water. While this argument is technically correct to some extent (if
we discount the evaporation losses that are often associated with wasteful water use, and if we
ignore the water quality losses when drainage water percolates through salinized soil profiles),
the present study considers percolation as a loss because it increases the pumping costs of a
scheme. For the same reason, return flows are considered a loss because they add to the pumping
costs, and the report therefore adopts a very “restrictive? definition of irrigation efficiency.

19.      Irrigation efficiency vs. irrigation productivity. Expanding the scope of the study from
irrigation efficiency to irrigation productivity (or even further to water productivity) would dilute
the main message of the study significantly. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding two
issues: one is that the costs of low water productivity to the national economy as a result of
inadequate agricultural and water sector policies1 are likely to be much higher than the costs of
pumping; and the second is that it is recognized that water productivity (that is, the ratio of crop
output (measured in monetary or physical terms, or both, to water either diverted or consumed)
as opposed to water use efficiency (that is, how much of the water abstracted actually reaches the
plants) could be the more important policy consideration,

1
 See Appendix E for an analysis of the agricultural and water sector reforms that are under implementation in
Tajikistan

                                                         7
20.      The costs of irrigation particularly include operation and maintenance expenditures, such
as staff salaries, fuel for machinery, electricity for pumps, and depreciation of assets. Most of
these costs depend to a limited extent on the efficiency of water supply, and cannot be reduced
by improving irrigation efficiency. For example, inefficient water use does not necessarily
increase staff salaries, nor does it increase capital investment costs. The only costs that have a
strong correlation with inefficiency are the costs of pumping, including both the costs of fuel,
and the costs of maintenance and depreciation. The study therefore focuses on the pumping costs
as a proxy for the costs of inefficiency. This is justified because other fixed costs associated with
irrigation inefficiency are comparatively independent of the magnitude of the inefficiency, and
they cannot be reduced by improving efficiency. The fixed costs are therefore neglected in this
study.

21.     Determine irrigation inefficiency. In the study, six pilot schemes were examined that
were located in a diverse set of environments to determine each scheme’s inefficiency, that is,
the amount of water being supplied in excess of beneficial consumptive or evaporative demand.
Evaporative demand was calculated by using the METRIC analysis for a two-month period (May
and June) in 2013. Irrigation supplies were obtained by analyzing pumping records of the six
pilot schemes. Rainfall was not taken into account, since precipitation was negligible during the
study period.

22.     Determine the costs of pump irrigation. Information about the extent of the area that
was originally developed for pump irrigation in Tajikistan is readily available. The study
analyzed public expenditures for irrigated agriculture, including pumping costs, maintenance
costs, and capital development costs.

23.     Public subsidies were taken into consideration, including price discounts for electricity
and debt cancellation. The costs of pump irrigation were then divided into fixed and variable
costs. Only variable operating costs (for instance, electricity costs) were considered; maintenance
costs and capital expenditure costs were not included in the calculation of the costs of irrigation
inefficiency. Export prices for saved energy were used to quantify the value of the savings.

24.     Determine the costs of irrigation inefficiency. The cost of inefficiency was computed
as a product of the variable cost of pump irrigation and irrigation inefficiency.

25.     The methodology adopted in this study to calculate water use is standard for modern
projects in the western United States, because the use of the Irrigation Training & Research
Center (ITRC) METRIC process simplifies data collection and reduces assumptions regarding
crop water usage. In the context of Tajikistan, where availability of reliable information is a
major constraint, the METRIC procedure was the only realistic approach to estimating crop ET
of irrigated crops, for the following reasons:
     There was no need to rely on inexact data of crop types. Rather, METRIC only requires a
        knowledge of whether an area has field crops or tree and vine crops.
     There was no need to rely on inexact data of cropped acreage. This is often a major
        weakness using standard procedures, because reported areas may be quite different from
        actual areas. Errors with standard procedures include poor reporting, uncertainty about
        planting and harvesting dates, and differences between the gross area and the net area.


                                                 8
      There was no need to know the details of irrigation scheduling, including when irrigation
       water was applied to individual fields, the irrigation method, and soil characteristics.
      METRIC automatically compensates for non-uniform growth (and therefore non-uniform
       ET) within a field. Standard crop water usage estimates often ignore this reality, and
       therefore the crop ET is usually over-estimated.
      Internal project recirculation of water was automatically taken into account because the
       boundaries of the computations were set at the borders of the project.

26.     Limitations of the study. The study revealed that the methodology was able to generate
fairly accurate estimates of the costs of inefficiency, as confirmed by cross-checking the data
against a number of indicators. Nevertheless, the following limitations have to be acknowledged,
in view of potential expansion of the methodology to other Central Asian countries or other
specific irrigation schemes. It should be noted that studies in other Central Asian countries are
expected to be able to take advantage of better data availability, in particular with respect to
supply of water to project areas:

      Data availability. The two major data weaknesses for the computation of irrigation
       efficiency are the following:
        o Lack of good local weather data: This is a limitation for any method of ET
            computation.
        o Uncertainty regarding the gross volumes of water applied to the project: Pump flow
            rates were not tested, but instead were de-rated from new design flow rates based on
            observations of pump discharges and pump impeller conditions. The estimated
            volumes also depend upon data on the hours of pump operation, which were obtained
            from hand-written notes in field books at each pumping plant.
      Selection bias. The study analyzed six “representative? pumping schemes, covering 28
       percent of the pump-irrigated area in Tajikistan. Because the schemes were located in a
       diverse set of environments, and were considered to incorporate average conditions, the
       study can work on the assumption that the results of the study can be extrapolated.
       However, there may be a bias in the selection of the irrigation schemes themselves, which
       could result in the results being considered less reliable.
      Omitted variable bias. Only the costs of electricity in determining the variable costs were
       considered. As the report mentions, other costs may to some extent also be a function of
       the volume delivered. The costs therefore under-estimate the real costs of irrigation
       inefficiency.
      Measurement bias. As a result of data limitations, only two months were used to calculate
       the seasonal irrigation inefficiency. However, inefficiency may not be a fixed variable
       throughout the irrigation season, and extrapolating from two months of data might be
       inaccurate. For example, pre-season clean-up of canals will improve efficiency at the
       beginning of the season, but these effects will wear off. It is believed that, despite the
       weaknesses, the adopted methodology provides a reasonably accurate estimate of
       efficiency because the estimated efficiency is fully consistent with other estimates of
       irrigation efficiency in Tajikistan.

II.        DETERMINING IRRIGATION INEFFICIENCY

      A. Tajikistan’s Pumped Irrigation Sector

27.      Tajikistan has approximately 953,000 ha of agricultural arable land, of which 79 percent
is irrigated. (Table 2.1). Today, less than 500,000 ha of arable lands receive irrigation water,
primarily due to deteriorated conditions of irrigation infrastructure. Pump irrigation is designed
to serve around 383,000 ha. However, the actual mix between pumped and gravity irrigation is
unknown.2 Out of approximately 36 large, 450 inter-farm, and 1,807 on-farm pumps, only 21
large, 286 inter-farm and 900 on-farm pumps are presently operational. Design areas of the
presently operational pumping infrastructure is estimated at around 280,850 ha. However, water
does not reach an estimated 27,500 ha within the command area.

28.     As Table 2.2 shows, approximately 208,000 ha (or 75 percent) of the land is served by
non-cascade pumping infrastructure. The remaining areas are served by cascade pumps which
pump water up to 300 meters high. The country’s pumping infrastructure is complex in design
and is technically aging. Some pressure pipelines, for instance, have been in operation for over
fifty years and are characterized by water leakages. In addition to the poor technical conditions
of the infrastructure, power supply is also unreliable, especially in the springtime, leading to
significant losses of crop yield and additional maintenance costs to repair the power outage-
related technical faults.

29.    Deterioration has been more rapid on pumped schemes than on gravity schemes. This is
also explained by a lack of adequate technical and financial support that was made available
from Moscow during the years when Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the
former centralized governance style was more conducive to soliciting voluntary cooperation and
contributions from farmers.

      B. Institutions

30.      The Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI), recently established to replace
the former Ministry of Melioration and Water Resources, is a key agency responsible for the
operation of approximately 400 pump stations, which collectively have approximately 1,500
pumps, but where less than half of the pumps are functional. Small farmer-owned pumps (the
quantity is unknown but is estimated at approximately 2,000) are extensively used in some areas
– often lifting water from scheme canals to adjacent lands. There are also approximately 1,800
irrigation and drainage wells that pump groundwater, thereby lowering the water table.

31.      The “Water Users Association? Law was adopted on November 8, 2006, and laid a
foundation for establishment, operation, and management of WUAs as “non-commercial
organizations providing services for operation and maintenance of irrigation systems for the
benefit of water users?.3 Development of WUAs has been supported by the key development
partners in the country. However, WUAs are still facing legal, management, operational, and
budget constraints in their evolution into strong and socially representative organizations. Poor
conditions in the inherited infrastructure creates bottleneck in WUA development because
improvement of on-farm irrigation service delivery is associated with relatively large initial
investments in rehabilitation of the network. Another challenge faced by WUAs is that they are
dependent on irrigation authorities rather than having a partnership-based relationship with them,
and WUAs are in many cases just perceived as agents of irrigation agencies in collecting
irrigation fees. Low technical and managerial capacity, as well as limited financial resources,
also diminish the chances of WUAs succeeding.

32.     The largest initiative to expand WUA capacity development is currently channeled
through the support of the World Bank and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), which have jointly assisted the Tajikistan government in establishing
and strengthening one hundred WUAs in southern Khatlon Oblast. Areas with well-functioning
WUAs have reported better irrigation service delivery. However, success of WUAs is largely
dependent on the overall condition of the irrigation infrastructure in the area. As observed during
the field visits, the WUAs located in the areas with gravity irrigation or the ones set-up after
rehabilitation of the irrigation network (including pumps) are likely to demonstrate better
performance. In the areas, where WUAs are active, the organizations prove to be efficient both in
assisting collecting irrigation fee collection rates (operating as an agent for water services) and
promoting rights of water users for equitable access to irrigation water.4 They were also able to
establish a basic system of “checks and balances? in the irrigation sector.

      C. Determining Irrigation Efficiency in the Six Study Schemes

33.     Comparison of the selected pumped schemes. In all schemes visited, the technical
conditions of pumps, motors, and peripheral hardware largely contributed to irrigation
inefficiency. There are many engineering technical details, but the two main problems appeared
to be extreme sand wear of pumps and poor electric power quality including periodic outages.
Technical solutions exist for all of the problems that were identified. Water distribution is a
challenge of both hardware and management; management changes are difficult, but pump and
electricity problems can be solved with infusions of money – if done properly.

34.      Appendix C provides detailed information for each scheme, as well as a sketch of key
facilities. Table 2.3 provides a comparison of key data for each selected scheme.

35.       A summary of the information presented in Table 2.3 suggests the following:


5
  kWh for KNS are from 2012, not from 2013
6
  Makhram monthly data for kWh and hours pumped was very inconsistent
7
  The Pumping Plant Efficiency for KNS used pumped volumes from 2013 and power from 2012; this likely caused
an over-estimation of efficiency.

                                                             12
     Approximately 40 percent of the pumps do not function.
     The flow rates of the functioning pumps are lower than the design flow rates.
     The actual irrigated areas are significantly less than the design acreage.
     There are major differences between schemes in terms of the availability of good quality
      power.
     The three schemes in the northern region have had relatively clean water due to uptake of
      water from the Kayrakkum reservoir. However, there are huge silt loads in the water in
      schemes that do not receive water directly from a reservoir.
     The pumping plant efficiencies in the schemes with clean water are higher than those
      with dirty water. None are excellent.
     The scheme irrigation efficiencies are low (in the 30 percent range).

36.    Evapotranspiration (ET) Estimates. Appendix A provides a description of the process
that was used to estimate crop evapotranspiration in each of the six selected schemes. The
methodology has been used in a variety of schemes in the United States and Mexico. It provides
a more accurate estimate of crop ET than can be obtained with assumptions of specific crop
acreages, irrigation management, pests, soil fertility, planting and harvest dates, and so forth. In
any case, none of that detailed information is readily available in Tajikistan.

37.    Despite constraints regarding data availability, estimates are believed to be reasonable
because of the following factors:
     Crop consumptive use (ET) could be estimated quite accurately from satellite images and
       the METRIC methodology for May and June of 2013. Although there were uncertainties
       about exact scheme boundaries, the areas used for the analysis matched the areas
       provided by each scheme.
     Discussions and observations at the pumping plants and repair facility provided the basis
       for estimates of likely pump flow rates. The flow rate per pump is found in both the
       “Irrigation Efficiency? and “Pumping Plant Efficiency? computations.
     The electric consumption (kWh) numbers appeared reasonable if multi-month totals were
       used so that errors for individual months are averaged.
     “Excellent? pumping plant efficiencies rarely exceed 70 percent. Because the Pumping
       Plant Efficiency estimates in this report only used elevation changes for the total dynamic
       head (friction and minor losses are relatively small and were ignored because there were
       uncertainties in even the elevation changes), an “excellent? Pumping Plant Efficiency
       would likely be computed as between 65-70 percent. That sets an upper boundary on
       potential Pumping Plant Efficiency values. However, the lack of good maintenance
       facilities, the fact that many of the pumps are old, the lack of excellent bearing and
       impeller balancing, and other factors would likely lower that value for pumps even in the
       best of conditions.
     The computed values of Pumping Plant Efficiency and Irrigation Efficiency vary
       inversely with errors in the estimate of volumes (cubic meters) pumped. If the pumped
       volume is over-estimated, the computed Pumping Plant Efficiency rises, and the
       computed Irrigation Efficiency drops. These two values therefore serve as reality checks
       against each other, because likely ranges are known from field estimates and various
       data.


                                                13
38.     Because of uncertainties related to estimates of the volume pumped, the computations
were simplified and did not account for stored rainfall or leaching requirements. “Field Irrigation
Efficiency? values will be higher than the values in Table 2.3, because the computed
inefficiencies include conveyance losses and spills that occur before the water reaches the fields.

   D. Key Factors Contributing to Irrigation Inefficiency

39.     Several factors, ranging from institutional, socio-economic, and technical, contribute to
the deteriorating status of irrigation inefficiency in Tajikistan. Observations made during field
visits would identify more details on the specific infrastructure conditions that are exacerbating
the efficiency of the irrigation sector.

40.     Sedimentation. There is a need for good sediment ponds upstream of the first pumping
plants. High sediment (sand) loads, one of the major causes of low pumping plant efficiencies,
result in high maintenance expenses, and also require schemes to perform frequent canal
cleaning.

41.     Pump Station Pipelines. The large pipelines between the pumps and canals are steel,
and can be quite long. Numerous leaks were observed. It is easy to replace a pipeline, requiring
only a monetary investment. It was noted that for just one scheme (Garouti), pipe replacement
represented about 50 percent of the requested investment (other items were motors, pumps,
valves, and electrical panels). The pipe cost was about TJS 41 million (US$5.2 million). It does
not appear that efforts have been made to explore options for pipe lining to increase the life of
existing pipes. No active or passive cathodic protection systems were observed on the steel pipes,
although such systems are commonly used to minimize pipeline corrosion.

42.      On-Farm Pipelines. Pipelines providing water control between the canals and groups of
farmer fields were observed in a variety of schemes. These pipelines were often located on the
territories serviced by WUAs. Pipelines are an excellent tool, and if designed and maintained
properly, can greatly enhance farm irrigation management. There are many variations of pipeline
(and associated hardware) designs, each with specific benefits and disadvantages.

43.    Dilapidated Canals. Many of the pipelines have fallen into disrepair. As a result, water
supply to the fields is unreliable and inflexible, yields are reduced, farmer income and motivation
are low, and maintenance of pipelines falls off. Operators currently need spillage to avoid under-
supplying the downstream pumps in cascades. As much as 1 m3 per pump station was observed.
This represents a substantial energy loss, and also causes additional wear on pumps.

44.     Water Level and Flow Control in Canals. The WUAs and farmers often do not have
equipment to control water flow in the canals. Basic irrigation structures, such as outlet gates, are
not in place, which leads to unpredictable water flows and increased water losses in the system
during the periods of water abundance.

45.     Electric Power Quality. The poor power quality that is provided to many of the
pumping plants in Tajikistan causes pump motors to shut down automatically. Unless the
pumping plants are located near a major electrical transmission line, voltage fluctuations and
complete power outages are not uncommon, and may occur 10 or 20 times each year. The
interruptions result from limitations in the size, age, condition, and reliability of the electrical
                                                 14
transmission and distribution assets. They create severe operation problems to both pump station
operators and farmers. The problems are worse for farmers, who then face unexpected
interruptions in their water supply, which poses significant constraints in particular on
production of higher value crops for markets.

46.   Figure 2.1 illustrates the on/off nature of the first pumping station in the Kojabokirgon
scheme. The days with little or no pumping are days when electricity outages occurred.

III.       DETERMINING THE COST OF PUMP IRRIGATION

47.     The analysis uses the official data of ALRI and its district level agencies. There are two
limitations with this data that may affect the accuracy of the results of the analysis. The first
limitation relates to the accuracy of ALRI data on O&M of pumping infrastructure. Specifically,
the financial reporting system of ALRI does not keep separate the expenditures on gravity and
pump irrigation and on drainage systems. In addition, no accurate data exists on investments in
rehabilitation and modernization of pumping infrastructure. The second limitation relates to the
completeness of the data. ALRI is responsible for O&M of large and interim pumping
infrastructure for which data is available. As described earlier in Section II, there are an
additional 2,000 farmer-owned and maintained field-level pumps that lift water from off-farm
canals to farm fields. Information is not available on how many of these on-farm pumps are
functional and what the pumping costs for these functional pumps. According to ALRI, nearly all
field-level pumps are unused either due to their poor technical conditions or to unaffordability of
power costs.

48.     Public expenditures. Irrigation – either pumped or by gravity supply – is crucial for the
livelihoods of the rural population. However, it comes at a high cost to the country. Annual
expenses for irrigation were reported to be TJS 87 million (US$11.0 million8), not including
special construction projects funded by international financiers. Approximately TJS 31 million
are provided by the government for operating expenses, 41 million TJS are received from
farmers, and TJS 15 million are provided by the government for capital projects.

49.     Expenditures (not adjusted for inflation) on irrigation O&M fell from US$88.0/ha in
1990 to US$14.3/ha in 2003. The requirements just for O&M were estimated in 2004 by ADB at
US$21-28/ha for gravity systems and US$60-150/ha in pumped systems. Using the present
irrigated area of 515,000 ha and annual expenditures of US$23 million (including US$4.7
million unpaid electrical bills), the current average cost for all irrigation expenses (including
O&M) are approximately US$45/ha.

50.     Water Charges. Farmers are charged TJS 17.7 per 1,000 m3 of water (TJS 15.5 plus 18
percent Value Added Tax (VAT), regardless of whether the water is pumped or gravity fed. If
the six projects are “typical?, the average electricity charge to ALRI is approximately TJS 14 per
1,000 m3 pumped. If one considers the administrative costs, the farmer charges would be barely
enough to cover the average electricity cost in pumped projects. No money remains for any other
costs (pump repair, salaries, canal maintenance, upgrading, transportation, and so forth).

51.    The collection rate from farmers is approximately 70 percent in the north, and an
estimated 50 to 60 percent in the remainder of the country, which implies that farmer payments
are insufficient to pay for electricity costs. The approximately TJS 41 million collected from
farmers represents about 48 percent of the total budget of ALRI.

53.       The costs and values assigned to electricity consumption vary by usage and time of year.

     The current price of electricity charged to the public is TJS 0.12/kWh (US$.015/kWh).
     ALRI is charged a reduced rate during the irrigation season of TJS 0.0188/kWh
      (US$.002/kWh).
     In the six projects examined for this report, the weighted average usage of power was 0.64
      kWh/m3 pumped, with a range of 1.09 - 0.33 kWh/m3, depending on the scheme.
     The average power usage is about 9,210 kWh/ha.
     At an annual weighted average cost of TJS 0.0225/kWh, the annual energy cost to ALRI is
      TJS 207/ha of irrigated land supplied by pumps.
     Assuming that the six selected schemes represent the other national pumped schemes, the
      volume pumped nationwide is approximately 2,461 million cubic meters (MCM), or 246,000
      ha-m, or about 14,500 m3/ha. (This number is only provided to give a sense of magnitude.)
     Table 3.2 below shows that the average power consumption per hectare in May and June for
      the six “typical? schemes that were examined in this study is almost identical to the national
      average.

54.    Operation and Maintenance of Pumping Stations (excluding the cost of electricity). It
appeared (but was not verified with numbers) that just keeping the pump stations operational was
one of the largest scheme expenditures, and was likely much greater than the cost of electricity.
Total costs include:

   Spare parts
   People to maintain the equipment at the stations
   The pump maintenance shops
   Transportation to and from the maintenance shops
   Management time

55.    Detailed cost estimates would require a comprehensive inventory of the existing pumps
and their conditions. The costs for pump station pump replacement, valve replacement, motor
reconditioning, and maintenance facilities would likely total approximately US$350 million (TJS
2,758 million). This does not include the costs for rehabilitating drainage or well pumps.

IV.       THE FINANCIAL COST OF INEFFICIENCIES IN PUMPED IRRIGATION
          SCHEMES

56.      This section examines the real financial cost of pump irrigation to the country, including
direct and indirect price subsidies, debts of the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation
(ALRI) to the Tajikistan national power company, Barqi Tajik, and debts of water users for
irrigation water delivery which, if paid, could be invested in operation and maintenance (O&M)
of pumping infrastructure. Concerns about the costs of irrigation inefficiency has recently gained
in importance since the recent signing of a power purchase agreement between Afghanistan, the
Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan for the supply of summer energy. Energy use in
Tajikistan during summer, previously not recognized as a concern because of the excess energy
availability in summer, has been propelled on the national agenda because energy wastage now
results in high opportunity costs.

      A. Public Support to Pumped Irrigation

57.     The government supports pump irrigation through direct and indirect subsidies in both
agriculture and energy sectors.

58.     Direct irrigation sector subsidies. As shown in Figure 4.1, the direct subsidies to
ALRI’s pump irrigation budget are large, and the amount of subsidies has been steadily
increasing since 2005. In 2013, the government’s contributions to ALRI’s pump irrigation
budget of US$14.31 million consisted of a one-time direct subsidy of US$2.72 million for the
O&M of the infrastructure and US$7.17 million from state budget funds for ALRI.

59.      Power Subsidies. The government’s support also comes in the form of power price
subsidies. With the exception of 2007 and 2008, the government set the power tariff for pump
irrigation at discounted rates. As shown in Figure 4.2, since 2010, discounts have been very
substantial at approximately 70 percent. Furthermore, while the discounted tariff in 2010 was set
for the period of May 1 to September 30, in 2011 the subsidized season was extended starting
from April 1 to September 30.

60.    Debt Cancellation. Another government support for pump irrigation is in the form of
cancellation of water user debts to ALRI for irrigation service fee (ISF) consumption, and funds
owed by ALRI to Barqi Tajik for power consumption. As shown in Table 4.1, the government
cancelled these debts twice since 2005: US$5.1 million in 2009 and US$48.2 million in 2014.

Note: at the time of the preparation of the current analysis, data only till April 2014 was available

61.     Cost recovery of pump irrigation is very low. As presented in Table 4.1, the respective
average collection rates for ISF and power fees for the period 2005-13 were 31 percent and 21
percent. Consequently, the actual O&M budget for pump irrigation for the same period did not
exceed 65 percent of the planned budget of US$92.58 million. Inadequate O&M and limited
capital investments resulting from these poor technical conditions of the pumping infrastructure
perhaps explains the increased power consumption to lift 1 m3 of water since 2005 (Figure 4.3).

   B. Total Cost of Pump Irrigation to the Public Sector

62.    Total cost of pump irrigation. The costs of pump irrigation to the country, which
includes both the costs of pump irrigation to ALRI and losses to the energy sector, are presented
in Table 4.1. The pump irrigation cost to ALRI, which is shown in column 5, includes the actual
amount paid by ALRI to Barqi Tajik for consumed power at the subsidized rate, and for O&M
budget and capital investments. Since 2005, the pump irrigation cost to ALRI increased from
US$7.59 million to US$14.31 million. As Figure 4.1 shows, the bulk of the ALRI budget comes
from the state budget. The pump irrigation cost to the energy sector is considerably higher.
Cumulative losses to Barqi Tajik in the form of debts written-off for unpaid power fees and
forgone revenues due to the subsidized power tariff from 2005 to 2013 are estimated at
US$281.98 million. This amount is 112 percent higher than the pump irrigation costs to ALRI of
US$92.96 million.

63.     The total cost of pump irrigation to the country is substantial. In 2013 alone, the annual
cost of pump irrigation to the country was US$31.09 million. The cumulative cost for the period
from 2005 to 2013 is estimated at US$217.89 million or US$95.54 per hectare per year (the sum
of columns 5 and 8 in Table 4.2), assuming that the irrigated area is 253,348 ha. According to
FAOSTAT, an estimated income generated by one hectare of irrigated land was approximately
US$95.00 in 2011. The cost of pumped irrigation for the same year was US$120.84 per ha.

64.    Paid and unpaid electricity costs and price subsidies from 2005 to 2013 represented
US$139.48 million (the sum of columns 2, 6 and 7 in Table 4.2), or 69.0 percent of total O&M
costs. The costs of irrigation inefficiency at 72 percent is estimated at US$100.43 million
between 2005 and 2013. This represents US$11.16 million per year on average, or US$44.04 per
hectare per year.

   C. Opportunity Cost of Electricity

65.     Signing of the CASA-1000 agreement. Until recently, summer energy surpluses
reduced the opportunity costs of summer energy (and the efforts to increase efficiency in
summer) to close to zero. The Governments of Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and
Tajikistan recently signed a power purchase agreement to sell excess summer energy from the
Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to the recently signed
agreement, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan receive US$0.05 per kWh – significantly higher
than the 2013 rate of US$0.0041 per kWh and the 2014 rate of US$0.0035 per KWh that the
government of Tajikistan charged farmers for pumped irrigation.

66.     The signing of the power purchase agreement is a potential game changer, as summer
energy surpluses in Tajikistan can now be sold to Afghanistan and Pakistan for US$0.05 per
kWh. The subsidized fee for irrigation pumping is US$0.0035c per kWh, and cost recovery is
limited. More efficient irrigation and the related reductions in energy use will help Tajikistan sell
these energy savings to Afghanistan and Pakistan, while reducing the costs of irrigation. The
competing and more profitable use of summer energy is expected to provide an incentive to the
Government of Tajikistan to pursue irrigation efficiency.

67.   In view of this development, the analysis examined the cost implication of improved
pump irrigation efficiency under three different scenarios. Technical and financial results of the
examined interventions under these scenarios are summarized in Table 4.3.

68.      The scenarios are based on different mixes of investments in irrigation efficiency and
uses of the saved water for irrigation expansion or electricity generation. They investigate the
implications of using water savings for irrigation and electricity generation. In Scenario 1,
estimates are made of the efficiency improvements and energy savings that will be gained as a
result of training of WUA and ALRI staff. No physical investments will be made in this scenario,
and water savings will be used for irrigation expansion. In Scenario 2, an assumption is made
that, in addition to the training under scenario 1, physical investments will be made in irrigation
infrastructure to improve efficiency, and savings will be used to expand irrigation. In Scenario 3,
an assumption is made that water savings as a result of efficiency improvements will be used to
generate electricity that will be sold to Afghanistan and Pakistan for institutional strengthening.
Instead of using water savings gained from efficiency improvements for irrigation expansion,
these savings will be used to generate electricity. Details about the three scenarios, the
assumptions underlying each of them, and their implications for irrigated areas, electricity
generation, and cost savings are presented below.

69.     Scenario 1: Institutional improvements in performance of water agencies, and to
increase irrigated areas to use the saved irrigation water. The assumption in Scenario 1 is
that the current pump irrigation efficiency at 30 percent will be increased to 35 percent through
improved institutional capacity of the water agencies (WUAs and ALRI) resulting in more
efficient water distribution planning and O&M planning and implementation. The costs of these
“soft? investments are based on actual project investments in Central Asia. The current volume
of lifted water is projected to remain unchanged. Improvements in irrigation water delivery
service is projected to lead to increases in the following: (i) irrigated lands within the command
areas from 253,400 ha to 266,070 ha (a 5 percent increase); (ii) ISF collection from 53 percent to

                                                 22
60 percent; and (iii) power fee collection rate from 29 percent to 55 percent. 9 The improved
irrigation water delivery service is expected to increase water and power fee collections by
US$2.23 million. This cost recovery amount is expected to be deducted from the current state
transfers to pump irrigation. As a result the current pump irrigation cost to the country would be
reduced from US$31.09 million to US$28.86 million (or 7 percent reduction). This translates
into a reduction of the pump irrigation cost per ha from US$122.7 to US$111.5, and an increase
of the cost recovery rate from 20 percent to 29 percent. No incremental investments are projected
under this scenario.

70.      Scenario 2: Institutional and technical investments to improve irrigation efficiency
to expand irrigation water delivery to command areas. The assumption in this scenario is
that, in addition to the institutional improvements previously discussed, investments will be
made in on- and off-farm physical infrastructure to increase the current pump irrigation
efficiency from 30 percent to 45 percent. Based on unit prices recorded in a recent and ongoing
irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation project in the country and also in the Kyrgyz Republic, the
required investments are estimated at US$350.00 per ha. The investments would allow the
pumping stations to increase the volume of pumped water from 1,869 million m 3 to 2,090
million m,3 thereby making it possible to irrigate the entire command areas, that is, 280,850 ha (a
27 percent increase). The technical life of rehabilitated infrastructure is assumed to be 25 years
and the annual maintenance costs are assumed to halve following the rehabilitation. Improved
technical and institutional water delivery capacities of water agencies are expected to lead to
increases in irrigation service fee collection rates from 54 percent to 85 percent and power fee
collection rates from 29 percent to 65 percent. As a result, additionally collected ISF and power
fees at US$5.63 million would reduce the current pump irrigation cost to the country from
US$31.09 million to US$24.68 million or by 21 percent. The reduction is even higher when costs
per hectare are considered. For instance, the current cost per ha of US$122.7 would be reduced
to US$87.9 or a 48 percent reduction.

71.     Scenario 3: Institutional investments to improve irrigation efficiency and release of
energy savings for export. Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 except for one assumption. In
Scenario 1, an assumption is made that the current volume of lifted water at 1,869 million m3
will remain the same and that with the improved water delivery service the volume of water will
irrigate an additional 5,500 ha. In contrast, in Scenario 3 an assumption is made that the currently
irrigated area at 253,400 ha will remain unchanged, and that with the improved water delivery
service only 1,602 million m3 of water will be required to irrigate these areas. A 15 percent
reduction in the volume of lifted water would release 15 percent of the currently consumed
power of 202,000 kWh to the market to be sold at the export tariff at US$0.05 per kWh. The ISF
and power fee collection rates, like in Scenario 1, are assumed to increase from 54 percent to 60
percent and from 29 percent to 55 percent respectively. These changes are expected to generate
an additional US$1.62 million from increased collection of ISF and power fees and US$15.11
million from the marketing of the released power for export. The current pump irrigation cost to
the country would be reduced from US$31.09 million to US$11.70 million or by 62 percent. The
earnings from power exports account for 57 percent of the cost reduction, while increased
collection of water and power fees would contribute the remaining 5 percent. In this scenario, the

9
    These assumptions are plausible as the respective fee collection rates for water and power were approximately 60
    percent in 2014 and 65 percent in 2005.

                                                           23
cost of pump irrigation per hectare would be reduced from US$122.7 to US$46.2, or by 67
percent.

V.      ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY

72.      This section provides a discussion of a number of issues that are associated with
irrigation efficiency. They either determine or are determined by the success of efforts to
improve irrigation efficiency. They are presented without prioritization but with the recognition
that integrated solutions need to be pursued. Predictability and reliability of the irrigation supply
are the key operational terms.

     A. Existing Priorities of Pump Managers

73.    Resource allocation in the six schemes appears to focus on pump maintenance and
sediment removal. With little budget, scheme personnel must struggle to overcome issues
involving these two items. Very little personnel time, energy, resources, or innovation remain to
solve the huge problems associated with not being able to provide flexible, reliable, and
equitable water distribution down to the fields. Scheme proposals currently focus on immediate
problems faced by scheme personnel, for instance obtaining funds for replacement pumps and
pipelines.

74.    ALRI should spread its resources and efforts in a more balanced manner, including water
movement and management between the rivers and the individual fields. Until the quality of
water distribution service to fields can be improved, strong WUAs are unlikely to develop.

     B. The High Cost of Power Outages

75.     The pump operators in most schemes continually struggle with pumping outages that are
associated with the loss of electricity or low power quality. When the pumps shut down, the
pipelines sometimes empty out. Check valves may not exist or may not work properly. When the
electricity becomes available, it can be difficult to prime pumps. However, the operators have
learned to take advantage of the shutoff times to repair pump bearings and perform other
maintenance. Not once during the field visits was anything mentioned about the impact of these
outages on irrigation performance, water conservation, and the strength of water user
associations.

76.      This problem of outages is huge. It takes hours to fill up pipelines and canals when they
are empty. When the power goes off, all of the pipelines and canals begin to empty out.
Deliveries to farmers begin to dwindle and eventually stop – all without any advance notice. The
distribution channels that convey water to individual fields become dry. Farmers who are
irrigating suddenly do not have water. At that point, any organized schedules of farmer
irrigations or flow measurement programs are worthless. This problem repeats itself weekly, and
in some cases, more often.

77.      Once the pumps are restarted, it takes many hours to re-establish flows. Furthermore,
almost all the field irrigation is gravity (surface) irrigation with furrows or border strips. Water
may have advanced halfway across a field when the water disappears. Farmers need to re-irrigate
the first half of a field just to get the water to the position it was in when the water disappeared.

78.     In summary, when water levels are uncontrollable and unpredictable, farmers and scheme
authorities who manage canals understand that it is often fruitless to develop good irrigation
                                                 25
schedules or to invest in good flow measurement and control measures. Farmer leaders recognize
that if they try to form an organization that requires dependable water, it will fail. Hence, there is
no motivation by responsible farmers to take the lead in a losing endeavor. This is especially true
if the primary function of the water user association is to collect money to give to scheme
authorities. Good water control in schemes is therefore a precondition for strong WUAs, high
irrigation efficiencies, and high crop yields.

79.     Unreliable supplies could be addressed by installing buffer reservoirs downstream of
each pumping plant discharge point. These buffer reservoirs fill up while the pumps operate, and
are automatically drained by gravity when power outages occur.

80.      Such reservoirs are found in California for a different purpose, but with the same end
result. In California, some irrigation districts do not pump between noon and 6 p.m. because the
electricity rates are high during those hours. Buffer reservoirs allow them to pump 18 hours a
day, but deliver consistent flow rates to canals 24 hours a day.

81.    Operators at the pumping plants appear to have a good idea of the time of the day when
the power quality deteriorates. Having a predictable time could provide a new model for daily
pump operation. Each pumping plant could depend upon scheduled off times for pump
maintenance.

82.   Each reservoir would only have sufficient capacity to serve the area immediately
downstream of it. Its capacity would be determined by the average historic down time of the
pumps. One concern is that reservoirs often act as silt traps. Because of the high silt loads, this
would be especially important in Khatlon. Maintenance equipment and procedures are available
and must be included in the investment.

83.     An additional and significant benefit could be that the inlet and outlet control of the
reservoirs could be designed so that the pump flows do not need to exactly match the required
flow rates in a canal. If the gravity discharge is automatically regulated to maintain a constant
desired flow rate, then if the reservoir empties or fills up, a pump can be turned on or off.


   C. Irrigation Schemes and Water User Associations

84.      Other countries have found themselves in somewhat similar situations regarding
irrigation schemes to what Tajikistan now faces. It is not uncommon for central governments to
discover that for one reason or another they have not been able to maintain (much less
modernize) existing irrigation schemes.

85.     Irrigation schemes fall into a vicious downward spiral of degradation, followed by
rehabilitation, followed by even worse degradation. In Tajikistan, this is most obvious in the case
of pumping plants where pumps are constantly being rebuilt, and 40 to 50 percent of the pumps
and motors no longer operate at all.

86.    The observations below regarding the United States might assist the future direction of
the Tajikistan government as it is relates to irrigation. These observations are related to the

                                                 26
gradual evolution of successful irrigation schemes. (See Appendix F for a more detailed analysis
of a comparison with the United States.)
 In most countries, water and electricity for irrigation have historically been greatly
    subsidized in federal (national) pumped irrigation schemes.
 For irrigation schemes that were constructed by the United States government, the farmers
    had to pay back the construction costs over a period of 40 to 50 years. However, there was a
    very favorable, low interest rate.
 The justification for subsidies was that the countries would benefit from political and
    economic stability that irrigation schemes would bring in. The subsidies also recognized the
    significant “multiplier? benefits that irrigation schemes would bring to the local and national
    economies.
 In the United States, as field irrigation practices have improved, as water user organizations
    have become more sophisticated, and as crop yields have increased, the farmers have been
    able to pay for the complete costs of irrigation.

87.     In national irrigation schemes outside of the United States, WUAs have generally been
formed by the government if they did not previously exist. Global experience suggests that the
WUAs must be large enough to be sustainable (usually at least 5,000 ha each) and must not exist
primarily to collect money for the government. Although thousands of water user associations
have been formed in the world over the past three decades, the vast majority have failed because
of a lack of ownership.

88.     In many of the pumped schemes, the crop yields are so low, and the water control from
the main and lateral canals is so poor, that it is unlikely that WUAs will be socially or financially
able to support large irrigation schemes in the near future. A long-term improvement program to
provide manageable water will need to succeed before farmer support on sustainable levels can
be achieved.

VI.      PRIORITIES FOR ACTION

      A. Impacts of various irrigation interventions on total O&M costs and crop yields

89.    This section analyzes and proposes a number of priority actions to improve the
performance and efficiency of irrigated agriculture in Tajikistan. At the same time the section
intends to show that not all interventions to increase irrigation efficiency automatically lead to a
reduction in electricity use, and therefore to a reduction of the operational expenses, for reasons
outlined below.

     Less area is irrigated now – or more area is actually under-irrigated – than was originally
      intended for each scheme. It thus seems logical that if there is less conveyance loss, then
      more area could be irrigated, or less area could be under-irrigated. The net effect is no
      savings in power.

     The immediate consequence of poor irrigation management and poor distribution uniformity
      of water across fields is very poor crop yields. This means:
          a. If there is very weak and non-uniform crop growth, the evapotranspiration (ET) is
             much lower than it could be. This is clear from the satellite images.
          b. Because the predominant irrigation method is surface irrigation, farmers must wet the
             entire field even if the growth is spotty. A certain volume of water is required to
             simply wet the field during irrigation, regardless of how healthy the plants are.
             Farmers cannot use less water for irrigation simply because the actual average field
             ET is lower than what it should be. The amount of water infiltrated is a function of
             the soil, not of the crop.

90.    Figure 6.1 below depicts three different irrigation scenarios. They can be described as
follows:
        30 percent Irrigation Efficiency. The left-hand bar indicates the approximate
          condition today. About 30 percent of the pumped water is used for crop
          evapotranspiration (consumptive use).
        60 percent Irrigation Efficiency. The center bar indicates what is likely to be
          achieved with the use of modernization and the right incentives. The same amount of
          water will be pumped, but a higher percentage will be used for crop
          evapotranspiration because of improved water delivery service and on-farm
          improvements. This particular graphic assumes a 70 percent on-farm efficiency.
          There is no electricity saving as a result of improving irrigation efficiency.
        60 percent Irrigation Efficiency with More Area. The right-hand bar indicates what
          would happen if more pumps become functional and there is improved water delivery
          service and improvements in on-farm irrigation. More area could be irrigated, and
          yield would increase by about 50 percent if approximately 50 percent more water was
          pumped. The electrical power cost would increase by 50 percent unless pumping
          plant efficiency improved.

91.    Therefore, if the irrigation practices were more reliable and predictable, the yields should
improve considerably. This in turn would increase the ET in each field, which would then cause
an increase in irrigation efficiency with the same volume of applied water. As discussed before,
there would be no power savings.

                                                Project Irrigation Efficiency



92.    One aspect of “timing? may result in savings in power. There often no good correlation
between pump operation and irrigation water demand at the end of the summer. This might be
one area that is relatively easy to improve without better hardware, because it mainly requires
increased communications and motivation. Although better scheduling of pumping hours at the
end of the summer is a good idea, in order for it to work there need to be more consistent and
transparent computations and communications with farmer groups. These are not likely to be
strong until progress is first made in solving some fundamental main system issues and
problems.

E.     Indicators for Scheme Performance Evaluation

93.     Making progress with irrigation modernization and improvement of irrigation efficiency
moves slowly. There are pre-conditions for improving yields, so investments of many years are
needed before farmers increase yields and are willing to pay more for high-quality service
delivery. The impacts of modernization that gradually makes irrigation water delivery more
dependable and flexible cannot be immediately measured. The impact of improving pumping
plant efficiencies, on the other hand, can be measured immediately. Nevertheless, performance
indicators at all levels can be used to document progress.

94.     Recommended performance indicators are:
 Change in pumping plant efficiencies
 Change in frequency of pump repair
 Change in the quality of water delivery service that is provided by scheme personnel to group
    turnouts (as measured by user satisfaction surveys)
 Change in irrigated areas covered by good quality irrigation services
 Change in yields on fields that receive immediate intervention such as gated pipe, land
    leveling, or targeted phosphorus fertilizer application
 Changes in the amounts of water fees collected
 Changes in the rates of water fee collection
 Changes in meaningful information management

   Priority #1: Breaking the Vicious Cycle

95.     Breaking the vicious cycle in irrigation management of inadequate resources, poor
quality of service delivery, and low incomes requires a long-term approach. Revenues will not
increase and costs will not go down overnight. Because the Government of Tajikistan plans to
continue to provide to farmers livelihood services in irrigation schemes that depend on pumping,
continued public support in paying for the expenses of these schemes will be required. However,
at the same time, efforts need to be made to increase incomes and cost recovery, while reducing
costs.

96.     Breaking the vicious cycle needs to start by improving the quality of service delivery.
International experience has provided ample evidence (especially in municipal water supply) that
increasing service fees without improving the quality of service delivery is not successful. The
following series of actions and development of plans should be considered priority:

1. Develop a plan for strengthening WUAs. Scheme managers must keep in mind that until
   water is available to a WUA in a flexible and reliable manner, WUAs are unlikely to
   succeed. This will require a re-definition of how the WUAs work with the canal operators
   (including some form of performance measurement), how funds are transferred (with most of
   the funds remaining at the local level and directly linked to performance), and what
   responsibilities are required of both parties (scheme managers and WUAs) for success.

2. Increase crop yields. This should include some independent on-farm improvements such as
   gated pipe, land leveling, and appropriate phosphate fertilization on cut areas. This plan
   should also contain metrics to evaluate the success and failures of the program. Pilot
   implementation should provide reasonable information of costs, problems, and benefits.

3. Implement modernization steps. This should involve developing confidence, expertise, data
   on true costs, and benefits related to the modernization of the main water distribution systems
   for several schemes. In addition, this must be done for complete schemes, not just a few
   demonstration areas. Different approaches can be used in different scheme areas, but the
   intent is to implement modernization in complete schemes. This is necessary to learn how to
   integrate tasks and responsibilities that are currently primarily performed as individual,
   disconnected efforts. In order to address the priority objective to provide a more reliable and
   more flexible water supply to the schemes, the following two action plans should be
   considered:
   a. Identify one or two pumping schemes, such as KNS, that have few pumping problems.
      Place a major emphasis on quickly (within 3 to 4 years) modernizing the hardware and
      operations of the main and lateral canals through improved water level and flow control,
      flow measurement, improved communication with WUAs, electronic record keeping,
      mobility of staff, and improved daily scheduling of flow rates. Verify pump flow rates
      and develop procedures to properly operate the pumping plants to pump the correct flows
      on an hourly basis. Work with WUAs from the outset. Scheme employees must be
      trained and equipped to replace and repair all of the hardware (for instance, gates).



                                               32
   b. Consider employing a private operator to improve management of the pumping station
       and who will operate the pumps on the basis of key performance indicators. Doing so
       would incentivize the operator to provide reliable and flexible water supplies to WUAs.
4. Once the main and lateral canal operations are operating reasonably well, focus on making
   essential infrastructure improvements downstream of the canals and strengthening the
   WUAs. ALRI must be immersed in the complete integrated effort – from the pump stations
   to the final efforts with the WUAs. The lessons learned from these schemes (both positive
   and negative), and the gaining of knowledge of true costs and the efforts required, will be
   essential for planning future modernization programs. These schemes should also serve as
   training grounds for ALRI staff and engineers. As other schemes are modernized in the
   future, these schemes will serve as examples. The following action plan should be
   considered:

   a. Locate two schemes that have extreme problems with power outages. Install buffer
      reservoirs downstream of each of the pumping plant discharges with proper inlet and
      outlet controls. Then follow the same procedures as recommended above for the two
      pumping schemes.

5. Before modernizing the schemes mentioned above, develop the performance indicators. It is
   especially important to use the ITRC-based Rapid Appraisal Process that was developed for
   the World Bank (WB) to identify proper interventions necessary for canal modernization.
   Careful thought must be given to the training of the persons who will develop the
   performance indicators. The people who ultimately do the field work should be employees of
   ALRI because a bigger objective is to develop the domestic expertise to understand
   modernization. Simply contracting the work out will not develop this necessary expertise.

6. Address the issue of future corrosion to the pump discharge pipelines. The cost to replace all
   the pipelines is very high. Eventually the pipes will need to be replaced, but less expensive
   options such as cathodic protection and sleeving and lining of pipes should be examined,
   tested, and implemented on a pilot scale.

7. Develop a national plan, and begin to implement that plan, to reduce expenses related to
   operating the pumping plants. This involves a combination of improving pumping plant
   efficiencies to reduce the energy costs, and also reducing the costs associated with constantly
   rebuilding and servicing pumps. This should be a national plan. When donors offer assistance
   for individual schemes, their assistance should fall within the national plan. If this is not
   done, Tajikistan will eventually have a wide mix of incompatible hardware, parts, training,
   and maintenance requirements. The key elements of this plan are:
   a. Sand/silt settling basins. Sand and silt wear are the major cause of low pump
      efficiencies and large maintenance costs. There should be a plan to systematically equip
      pumping plants with good settling basins, including the proper equipment to frequently
      clean the basins, and the means to dispose of the sand and silt. The maintenance
      equipment and basin designs should be standardized.

   b. Pump Specifications. Definition of pump specifications and rules for the selection and
      installation of new pumps. Many of the existing pumps are so worn out that eventually

       they will need to be replaced. There needs to be a plan to replace them properly. A plan
       might consist of:

       i.   Development of an inventory of each of the approximately 800 functioning pumps.
            This will include, for each pump:
            1. Measured flows. This requires the purchase of portable transit-time external flow
                 meters.
            2. Measured discharge pressures
            3. Measured input kW. This could require special equipment, or during the winter
                 one pump at a time could be operated, and the kW to the plant can be measured
                 to determine this value.
            4. Computed pumping plant efficiency
            5. Pump hardware and orientation (diameters, valves, and so forth)
      ii.   Definition of the characteristics required for “typical? pumping plants, including:
            1. A high bowl/impeller efficiency at the required flow rate and pressure
            2. Net positive suction heads
            3. Impeller materials that are resistant to wear, such as Ni-Al-Bronze or Aluminum-
                 Bronze 954 Alloy
            4. A mix of large and small pumps, so that flow rates can be more carefully
                 matched to the demand
            5. A required number of “spare? pumps and motors available to turn on if other
                 pumps must be taken off-line for servicing
     iii.   Definition of the requirements for proper pump and motor maintenance. This will
            include the required training, transportation, shop equipment, and spare parts, both at
            each individual pumping plant, and at regional pump and motor maintenance
            facilities. Emphasis must be placed on what specific equipment is needed to rebuild
            pump impellers of different materials, how to ensure quality control, and how to
            dynamically balance repaired impellers.

   c. Pump Supplier. Once the needs are reasonably well defined, ALRI should embark on a
      search for a single pump supplier that can supply the specified training, service, and
      equipment at a reasonable price. It is essential that the final decision not be made solely
      on price, but also heavily weigh the importance of proven quality.

   d. Maintenance Facilities. Once the pump supplier is identified, it is essential that excellent
      maintenance facilities be established, and that personnel are trained before the pumps are
      purchased. There is typically a rush to purchase pumps, but without insufficient thought
      being given to the eventual maintenance of them.


  Priority #2: Monitor Performance and Progress

98      The following are further actions that should be implemented as part of efforts to monitor
the performance and progress of the schemes:

1. Develop good, simple Geographic Information System (GIS) maps of all the schemes.
   Consolidate the scattered efforts that are currently underway. Take care that the expenses for

                                                34
   this effort do not get too large because these efforts can become very expensive if they are
   not properly controlled.

2. Develop a better understanding of the “multiplier? economic impact of irrigated agriculture
   on Tajikistan’s financial health. This will be very important when seeking increased financial
   support.

3. Define what records and data are important for both evaluation and operation of the schemes.
   Standardize formats and computations. Equip offices to electronically enter, manipulate, and
   transfer this information.

4. Evaluate the lessons learned from all the steps described under Priority #1.

5. Reassess financial and human needs for expanding the limited work outlined under Priority
   #1. Reestablish priorities, and seek funding.

6. Implement the lessons learned as rapidly as possible.

7. Continue quantifying performance indicators, to assess the success of various interventions.

VII.       CONCLUSIONS

1.      Pumping plays an important role in Central Asia’s irrigated agriculture and accounts for
significant sunk and O&M costs. As a result of the inefficient use of irrigation water, Central
Asian countries are among the most water-intensive economies in the world and increasingly
face the challenge of addressing the proportionally low contribution of water to economic
development, employment, and poverty reduction.

2.       This study focused on the costs of irrigation inefficiency to the Tajik economy. The Tajik
irrigation sector is one of the largest consumers of power in the country. Hence, irrigation
efficiency and energy use in the sector are intricately interlinked, and inefficiencies in the use of
one resource inevitably have an effect on the other.

3.      This study examined the implications of improved pump irrigation efficiency in
Tajikistan. Field work was conducted in June 2013, and data were obtained for six representative
pumping schemes. Crop water use in the six scheme areas was estimated for May and June of
2013 using the METRIC process (see Appendix A).

4.      The study found that the average weighted irrigation efficiency across the six schemes
that were part of the study was close to 28 percent, with some of the schemes performing at an
efficiency that was as low as 16 percent (Kojabokirgon). The highest measured efficiency was 50
percent in the Garouti irrigation scheme.

5.         It was found that the following factors contribute significantly to irrigation inefficiency:
          High sediment (sand) loads is one of the major causes of low pumping plant efficiencies
           that result in high maintenance expenses, and also require schemes to perform frequent
           canal cleaning.
          Pump station and on-farm pipelines between the pumps and canals are steel, and contain
           numerous leaks.
          There are dilapidated canals that result in water supply to the fields being unreliable and
           inflexible. Operational losses are required to avoid under-supplying the downstream
           pumps in cascades.
          Water level and flow control in canals are not in place, which leads to unpredicted water
           flows and increased water losses in the system during the periods of water abundance.
          Low electric power quality causes pump motors to shut down automatically, creating
           severe operational problems for both pump station operators and farmers.

6.      It was found that the total overall costs of pump irrigation (including O&M, electricity
costs and capital investments) for the period from 2005 to 2013 was US$218 million, or US$94
per hectare. Paid and unpaid electricity costs and subsidies for the same period represented
US$139.48 million, or 69.0 percent of total O&M costs. The costs of irrigation inefficiency at 72
percent was estimated at US$100.43 million between 2005 and 2013. This represents US$11.16
million per year on average, or US$44.11 per irrigated hectare per year.




                                                   36
7.      The Governments of Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan recently
signed a power purchase agreement to sell excess summer energy from the Kyrgyz Republic and
Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

8.      As a result of this power purchase agreement, Tajikistan can now sell excess summer
energy to Afghanistan and Pakistan for US$0.05 per kWh – significantly higher than the 2013
rate of US$0.0041 per kWh and the 2014 rate of US$0.0035 per KWh that the government of
Tajikistan is charging farmers for pumped irrigation, and cost recovery is limited. The competing
and more profitable use of summer energy is thus expected to provide an incentive to the
Government of Tajikistan to take measures to improve irrigation efficiency.

9.       In view of these facts, the analysis examined the cost implication of improved pump
irrigation efficiency under three different scenarios. The outcome of this scenario analysis
suggests that the highest reduction in costs to the country at 62 percent will be achieved mainly
through the release of saved power to the export market (that is, 57 percent from exported energy
and 5 percent from increased collection of irrigation service fees and power fees). In other
words, the cost of pump irrigation to the country cannot be meaningfully reduced when the saved
energy is used to expand irrigation coverage using energy at a subsidized rate. If the Government
follows the pump irrigation cost-reduction model proposed under Scenario 3, the earnings from
the power export could then be used to support the population whose livelihoods depend on
pump irrigation. Investing in energy savings in irrigated agriculture becomes an attractive
proposition if these savings are sold to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

                                   APPENDIX A. METRIC ANALYSIS

A crop consumptive use (evapotranspiration) analysis was conducted for six projects in
Tajikistan for a two-month period (May and June) during 2013. The analysis coincided with
gathering pumping records from the pump stations supplying these irrigation projects. Remotely
sensed data (satellite images) were used to compute the actual evapotranspiration from fields at
the time the images were taken, using the Cal Poly ITRC 10 METRIC process. The monthly
evapotranspiration was estimated by computing a pixel by pixel crop coefficient for each image
and averaging that over the estimated pumping plant service area in each project. The monthly
grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is then multiplied by the average Kc to estimate the
total monthly actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc).

        ETc = Kc × ETo

More details on the procedure are included below.

CAL POLY ITRC METRIC Model
The Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internal Calibration (METRIC)
process is based on a surface energy balance. It depends upon both accurate and frequent Landsat
satellite thermal images (available only once per 16 days and less frequently if clouds are
covering the area) and an understanding of the cropping systems within a region. The METRIC
procedures have gradually evolved from research in the United States and other countries and
have the objective of being able to directly estimate actual ETc over large areas with limited data
availability (such as irrigation method, or irrigation practices). The image processing can be
relatively fast, but the collection of significant background data (besides the satellite images) that
are necessary for each image is time-consuming. Proper use of METRIC also requires expert
input and interpretation on the part of those who run the program.

Landsat 8 image pixel resolution is 30 meters by 30 meters. Inputs into the ITRC METRIC
model include:
 Landsat imagery
 Weather station data (hourly and daily data)
 Digital elevation data
 Spreadsheet calculated values
 Tabulated constants

The general monthly ETc computational procedure includes the following inputs:
 ITRC METRIC was used to compute the ETc the instant the satellite image is taken.
 The hourly grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) at the time the image is taken was used
   to compute a Kc value for that image date (Kc = ETc/ETo) for each pixel in the image.

   For this project, the Kc from each image was averaged by the service area for each pumping
    plant to get a Service Area Kc. If there were multiple images taken in a month, the Service
    Area Kc from each image data was averaged.
   Monthly ETo compiled from daily ETo data was multiplied by the monthly service area Kc to
    estimate the monthly Service Area ETc (the volume of water consumed through
    evapotranspiration).

Satellite Images
Landsat 8 images available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) on sixteen-day
intervals were used in the ITRC METRIC process for the six projects examined. The six project
locations are scattered throughout the nation of Tajikistan. This required multiple Landsat
images to be processed for each image date. The Landsat 8 images that encompassed the areas of
interest were located in Path 153, Rows 32 and 34, and in Path 154, Rows 32 and 34, for a total
of four different Landsat images. Three image dates (from May through the beginning of July)
were examined for each of the images, resulting in a total of 12 Landsat images processed for
this project. Figures A.1 through A.4 show close-up views of the areas of interest for this project
from the Landsat 8 images.

Weather Data
Daily and hourly weather data for the project time frame were collected from Weather
Underground.11 This website collects and stores data from weather stations throughout the world.
Two weather station sites were selected: one in the northern region of Tajikistan at Khudzhand
Airport, and one in the south (Parkhar Airport). Figure A.6 shows the location of these weather
stations in relation to the project areas examined.

Weather data collected from each station included hourly and daily information from May
through July of 2013. Weather data parameters available were air temperature, relative humidity,
dew point temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. Weather data needs to be estimated near
the time that the image is taken (approximately 10-11 a.m.). Specifically, hourly grass reference
evapotranspiration (ETo) is required by the ITRC METRIC model to compute the grass
reference-based crop coefficient on a pixel-by-pixel basis throughout the image. Daily ETo is
summed up for each month and multiplied by the pumping plant service area Kc to estimate the
monthly ETc. Monthly ASCE Standardized PM ETo computed from weather data obtained from
two weather stations in 2013 is shown in Table A.2

ETo is computed based on the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE) 2005
Standardized Penman Monteith (PM) equation for a grass reference crop. The PM equation
requires input on solar radiation, which was not measured at the weather stations in this study.
Instead, the solar radiation was estimated based on a corrected maximum clear sky solar
radiation (Rso). Rso can be computed directly based on latitude, elevation, and day of year. Rso
assume clear skies, which is never the case. Clouds and haze will influence the true solar
radiation reaching the earth’s surface. Therefore, corrections were made to the daily data as will
be discussed.

Hourly ETo
As previously mentioned, the hourly ETo is needed to estimate the ETo at the time the image is
taken. It was assumed that since there were no clouds covering the area of interest in any of the
processed images, the Rso was equal to the Rs at this instant; therefore, no correction was made
to the hourly data. The hourly data collected at each weather station, and the computed Rso data,
were used to compute the ASCE 2005 Standardized ETo using a program called REF-ET
developed by Richard Allen from the University of Idaho.12

Appendix A




Daily ETo
The daily ETo was used to compute the monthly ETo, which was multiplied by the monthly
Service Area Kc. From day to day, the solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface is impacted by
cloud cover and haze. A correction for the clear sky solar radiation (Rso) was made based on the
estimated monthly percent of sunshine at each weather station location. The percent of sunshine
was obtained from the FAO AQUASTAT website13 on a monthly basis. The daily Rso data was
reduced by the monthly percent of sunshine to correct Rso to Rs.

The daily data collected at each weather station and the corrected Rs data was then used to
compute the daily ASCE 2005 Standardized ETo using REF-ET. The daily ETo was summed up
for May and June 2013 to obtain the monthly ETo.

ETo and individual weather data were used within the ITRC METRIC process to compute inputs
into the software. ITRC METRIC computed the instantaneous ETc for every pixel within the
Landsat image at the instant the image was taken. Knowing the ETo at that instant from the local
weather station, a crop coefficient (Kc) can be computed (Kc = ETc/ETo). It has been shown that
this instantaneous Kc at the time of image acquisition (approximately 11 a.m.) was a very good
representation of the Kc for that entire day.

Elevation Data
A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) obtained from DIVA-GIS was used to adjust the model
outputs based on the surface elevation through the area of interest. The DEM used had a pixel
resolution of 90 m.

METRIC Kc Results
Figures A.7 through A.9 consist of example Kc results from three different image dates and their
ranges of Kc values (Urtabuz). At the end of this appendix, Figure A.10 contains 16 panels
showing all Kc images and a reference Landsat 8 image for each of the project sites. The lighter
the pixel color, such as yellow, the lower the Kc value. Conversely, the darker the pixel color,
such as blue, the higher the Kc value.

Volume of ETc by Project
Using ArcGIS, the Kc values from each image processed were averaged by the estimated service
areas. Since each pixel within the image is the same size, the Service Area Average Kc accounts
for cropped areas and fallow areas equally. Higher fallowed areas or areas with poor crop cover
would have a lower Kc value than crops with full canopy cover that are well irrigated.

As shown in Table A.3 below, the following image dates corresponding to Service Area Kc
values were averaged to estimate the monthly Service Area Kc:

       Images processed on May 5, May 14 and June 6        =      May Kc
       Images processed on June 15, 22 and July 1          =      June Kc

             APPENDIX B. TERMS OF REFERENCE AND IN-COUNTRY VISITS

The terms of reference for this assignment were:
 Determine the immediate costs of irrigation inefficiency, including the energy costs for both
   irrigation and drainage, and also the costs of additional items that could be quantified, such
   as those related to pump life span.
 Develop a set of irrigation efficiency indicators that can be used for monitoring progress over
   time and/or for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking. The indicators should be
   relevant for other Central Asian countries to ensure comparability between data sets.
 Calculate the costs of inefficiency to the national budget.
 Identify expenditures and revenues associated with irrigation and drainage, including: capital
   expenditures; operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures; the composition of various
   expenditures (such as recurrent budget items in the development budget, wage versus non-
   wage expenditures, and energy versus non-energy related expenses); the main sources of
   financing the budget; flow of funds; and cost recovery.
 Identify possible measures to reduce the immediate costs of irrigation inefficiency, and for
   each of these measures, quantify the associated monetary savings as compared to the current
   situation. The consultant was tasked to present the proposed measures in an attractive
   graphical manner to facilitate acceptance and adoption on the part of stakeholders.
 Design and implement a stakeholder consultation process for the implementation of the
   assignment.

The terms of reference included the caveat that there would likely be a scarcity of available data,
which would limit the extent of quantitative analysis that could be conducted with reasonable
accuracy.

                APPENDIX D. ENERGY AND IRRIGATION IN TAJIKISTAN

                                        Background Note

Energy and irrigation are intimately connected in Tajikistan in a number of important ways. In
the first place, hydropower resources in the Aral Sea basin are concentrated in the Kyrgyz
Republic and Tajikistan, while thermal energy resources are concentrated in Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Downstream countries are highly dependent on upstream
countries for essential water for irrigation. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this
dependence.

Secondly, Tajikistan has one of the world’s largest potential for further expansion of
hydropower. The country is ranked first globally in terms of hydropower reserves per territorial
unit. At present, hydropower provides more than 90 percent of the country’s energy demand. In
addition, the aggregate potential of small hydropower plants in irrigation canals is estimated at
152 million kWh per annum, which constitutes about 10 percent of the current energy
consumption in domestic irrigation systems.

Third, energy plays a key role in economic development of Tajikistan. Tajikistan, together with
its Central Asian neighbors, is among the most energy- and water-intense countries in the world,
with high water and energy consumption per capita and per unit GDP. The share of energy costs
in the total volume of the GDP amounts to 60 percent. Energy intensity in Tajikistan is almost
twice the world average, and three times higher than in most developed countries, which means
that Tajikistan needs two times more energy to produce one unit of GDP then the average
country. According to the latest data from different sectors of Tajikistan’s economy, the local
aluminum producer TALCO accounts for almost half the electricity consumption. Irrigation is
the third largest consumer in the country, accounting for a consumption of 19 percent of the total
volume of electricity produced, but mostly concentrated in the summer months when electricity
is abundant. Irrigated agriculture contributes disproportionally because over 44 percent of the
irrigated area relies on pumping, and also because of the limited contribution of irrigated
agriculture to GDP.

This important share of irrigation systems in the structure of electric energy consumption in the
country demonstrates the importance of reliable and efficient power supply in this sector to
ensure national food security. Out of 1.5 million hectares of land in Tajikistan where irrigation is
potentially applicable, only 748 thousand hectares of irrigated land have originally been
developed for irrigation. At present, it is estimated that only 515,000 hectares are still under
operation, out of which an estimated 170,000 hectares (33 percent) rely on pumps. In most
facilities, the pumps have exhausted their economic life and the consumption of electricity is
excessive.

Low electricity tariffs for pumping stations during the vegetation period (0.3 US cents per k/w/h)
are not conducive to energy saving and more efficient use of water and electricity. Thus, reliable
energy supply and efficiency of irrigation systems constitute important factors for obtaining
sustainable and guaranteed water supply and food security in Tajikistan.

Appendix E



             APPENDIX E. AGRICULTURAL, ENERGY AND WATER REFORMS

The Government of Tajikistan is pursuing a number of reforms that each have an impact on the
efficiency and productivity of irrigation water use. These reforms are part of Tajikistan’s
“Strategy for State Administrative Reform? that was launched in March 2006. This appendix
provides a summary of these reforms and highlights their impact on irrigation efficiency.

The “Action Plan on Reforming the Agricultural Sector in the Republic of Tajikistan?
(Resolution 406 of July 2009) signaled a renewed and stronger commitment to reforms,
including changes in several legal acts and institutions. It details specific steps to implement a
number of major reforms. Six working groups covering different agricultural policy areas are
preparing strategic documents in the following areas:
• Agricultural reform
• Social development in rural areas
• Land reform and in particular establishing a functioning land use right market
• A new mechanism of agricultural finance
• Development of an integrated water resources management system
• Reform of the agricultural administrative system at national, regional and local levels

In all cases, a wide range of stakeholders were actively involved in preparing policy positions
including several ministries, state institutions, research organizations, experts from donor and
other international organizations. Farmers, nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and women’s
organizations were also regularly consulted.

Agricultural Sector Reforms

In July 2009, the Government of Tajikistan approved the “Agrarian Reform Program of the
Republic of Tajikistan?. On 1 August 2012, as part of the Agrarian Reform, the Government of
Tajikistan approved the “Agriculture Reform Program? of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2012-
20.

The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) of the Republic of Tajikistan is the central executive
authority which is prescribed in the legislation of Tajikistan to carry out development and
implementation of the integrated state policy in the sector of agriculture in cooperation with
other ministries, agencies, and local executive authorities. As part of its authority, the MoA, at
the strategic level, is guiding the efficient use of water in agriculture, such as on irrigated lands
and in fishery.

Subsequent to enactment of the Action Plan, the Agriculture Reform Program draft was
presented by MoA to the Government and to donors in May 2010. The ministry sent the program
draft to other relevant ministries and agencies for comments. So far, positive feedback from most
agencies has been provided. Comments and suggestions were also provided by international
organizations and experts. After suggestions were discussed and revisions incorporated as
appropriate, the program was finalized at the end of 2010.



                                                 62
Appendix E

The agriculture sector reforms are expected to have a positive impact on irrigation productivity
because they provide incentives to farmers to grow higher-value crops. As a result, while the
volume and the costs of pumping will not necessarily decrease, the value of production per unit
of water will improve.

Freedom to Farm

Because of debt write-offs and also the substantial progress in the Land Registration and
Cadastral System Project financed by the World Bank, significant gains in establishing a culture
of “freedom to farm? have been achieved. There is now much less pressure on farmers to
produce cotton. With the national government endorsing the principle of “freedom to farm,?
local government authorities have less power to exercise pressure over farmers to grow cotton.

Although progress is not rapid enough in some areas, according to the Monitoring Survey of
December 2009, approximately 60 percent of farmers felt that they were free to decide when to
collect cotton stalks. A sizeable percentage of farmers reported that they had the ability to decide
whether or not their cotton crop would be followed by an alternative crop.

Land Use and Ownership Rights

A new land registration law was approved as a critical initial step in the development of a market
of land use rights. As noted previously, substantial progress has been made by the Land
Registration and Cadastral System Project. In 2009, 5,431 land use certificates were issued while
an additional 9,000 have been issued so far this year. The total number of land use certificates
that have been issued - including those issued by the State Land Committee - is almost 50,000.

At the end of August 2010 the concept of Tradable Land Use Rights was developed by a USAID
project, and it has been presented to key donor agencies for comments. Work is being undertaken
on land valuation, which is considered an important issue for land market development. The
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also joining other donors on land-related projects and
activities. These reforms are being supported by amendments to the following laws: Law on
Dehkan Farms; Law on Mortgages; Law on Registration of Immovable Property and Rights; and
Law on Service Cooperatives.

Access to Finance

Government and donors agree on the need to develop a broader base for agricultural lending and
to strengthen the overall financial system. The government’s response has centered on providing
budget-funded credit lines to commercial banks. These amounted to TJS 140 million in 2008,
TJS 180 million in 2009, and an estimated TJS 130 million for 2010. Banks were initially
required to use most of this credit for cotton, at preferential interest rates. But government has
now made this credit available for all types of agricultural products, with no preferential interest
rates for cotton. In addition, the government requires that commercial banks use the European
Bank for Reconstructiothe systemn and Development’s (EBRD) Tajik Agricultural Finance
Network (TAFF) loan screening methodology for loans made with budget-funded credit lines.

However, recognizing that government budget lending is not an efficient mechanism, the
government has decided to gradually eliminate such lending, and is instead seeking donor
                                                63
Appendix E

support to boost private sector lending for agriculture. EBRD is leading the response to this
request through its support for commercial bank lending and the recent acquisition of a minority
equity share in the Agro-Invest Bank. The post-harvest credit line for cotton in the restructured
Cotton Sector Recovery Project also responds to this need. A trade facilitation program by
EBRD and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the planned introduction of
warehouse receipts by ADB, will further broaden access to rural finance. The mechanisms for
trade facilitation and for warehouse receipts are being finalized so implementation may start
soon.

Cotton Grading and Regulation

The National Bank of Tajikistan's exports controls have been eliminated, thus removing another
layer of government control and intervention. The legislative basis for a modern cotton grading
system has also been adopted, but systematic grading has yet to be widely applied in the coming
years. It is expected that the ADB-funded Sustainable Cotton Sector Project. Will provide
important support for the country-wide implementation of grading.

Non-Cotton Sub-Sector

Non-cotton products produced from household plots, especially staple food commodities such as
cereals, meat, milk, vegetables, and potatoes, have recently emerged as a main source of
agricultural growth. These commodities are relatively low-cost commodities. They have
significant potential to raise the current level of productivity, and can be readily sold in domestic
markets. The government recognizes the importance of this non-cotton production and is
committed to support it with better irrigation and drainage infrastructure, rural finance services,
and better access to inputs.

Water Sector Reforms

The water sector reforms were initiated as part of the “Agriculture Reform Program? for 2012-
20. A Presidential Decree of 19 November 2013, #12 “On Improvement of the Management
Structure of Executive Authorities of the Republic of Tajikistan? created the legal base for the
water sector reforms. According to this decree, the former Ministry of Melioration and Water
Resources was abolished and the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR) was
created. MEWR is charged with water sector policy and regulation, while the responsibility for
the operation and maintenance of the irrigation sub-sector was transferred to the newly
established Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI).

The water sector reform aims to lay the foundation for application of Integrated Water Resources
Management (IWRM) in Tajikistan based on decentralization and devolution of service delivery
activities with responsibilities divided between the ministries, agencies, and (partially) NGO.
The proposed reforms are based on common regulatory principles of IWRM and focus on taking
into account social, economic, and environmental interests through sustainable and balanced
management and development of the water resources.

Implementation of IWRM is expected to facilitate cross-sectoral water transfers in Tajikistan,
and to safeguard the interests of vulnerable sectors, such as the use of water for ecological

                                                 64
Appendix E

services. As such, the reforms provide an incentive to reduce losses and improve efficiency while
also promoting basin water productivity.

Main Stakeholders

MEWR is the central executive authority in the sector of water resources. It carries out functions,
in line with Tajikistan legislation, in developing an integrated state policy and implementing
normative legal regulations in the areas of management, use, and protection of water resources.

MEWR will fulfill tasks related to development and implementation of national policies,
strategies, and programs. It will determine mid-term and long-term goals, will develop, propose,
and adopt normative and legislative documents, and will coordinate water-related activities of
line ministries and agencies. Furthermore, MEWR will be responsible for planning and
implementation of IWRM, regulating relations between different water users, and carrying out
other tasks related to management, use, and protection of water resources under its authority.

ALRI is the central executive authority, which carries out land reclamation and irrigation
functions, based on Tajikistan legislation in cooperation with other ministries, agencies and local
state authorities.

In the water sector, ALRI is charged with land reclamation and irrigation, riverbank protection,
and other measures on prevention of mudflows and floods, improvement of ameliorative
conditions of irrigated lands, and other tasks within the framework of its assigned
responsibilities.

Water User Associations (WUAs) in Tajikistan are the only NGOs specializing in maintenance
and operation of irrigation and other water systems at the on-farm level. WUAs are able to join
in WUA Federations to bring about more efficient operations. The federations may be created at
the level of large canals and other appropriate hydraulic and hydrographic units.

Guiding Principles

Integrated Water Resources Management

The Water Sector Reforms will be implemented on the basis of several guiding principles. A key
principle is transitioning to IWRM, which particularly includes improving basin management
and separating policy and regulation functions from operational and management tasks,
including importantly the operation and maintenance of water services infrastructure. The
following principles should be observed in IWRM:
            The environment is recognized as a water user and its needs should not be
             compromised, because it is difficult to restore deterioration, damage, or even loss of
             the ecosystem.
            During the definition of priorities for water use, it is necessary to balance
             requirements of all sub-sectors so that the use of one sub-sector does not jeopardize
             the use in other sub-sectors.
            In case of emergencies, potable water is the main priority because it is a vital
             necessity.

                                                65
Appendix E

Basin Management

Proper planning of water allocation and development of water resources is only possible within
the natural flow area of the water resources. Therefore, the river basin is the most appropriate
management unit for water resources management. In this regard, the introduction of a basin
management approach to water resources management, which is an integral part of IWRM, is
considered one of the main principles of water sector reform.

Separation of Policy and Management Functions from Operational Functions

For the purpose of effective implementation of all tasks linked to integrated water resources
management, it is necessary to ensure that divisions exist between the constitutional tasks (policy
making and legislative), organizational tasks (planning, management, and regulation) and
operational tasks (water supply, maintenance service of systems, and rehabilitation).

Current Status of Reforms

Institutional reforms in water sector (with a focus on irrigation) was launched with the issuance
of the Presidential Decree of 19 November 2013, #12, according to which political and
management functions in the water sector were separated from production and economic
functions.

Based on this decree, the Ministry of Energy and Industry was reformed into MEWR, which was
assigned policy and regulation functions, while functions of land reclamation and irrigation were
assigned to the newly established ALRI.

In accordance with the Resolution of the Government of Tajikistan of 3 March 2014, #149, Open
Joint Stock Holding Company Barqi Tojik, the Tajikistan national power company, which had
conducted operation and maintenance of hydropower facilities, was detached from the
management structure of MEWR.

Thus, MEWR was relieved of the tasks related to production and economy of water resources,
including the operation and maintenance of water services facilities, and the ministry is now
responsible for policy and management tasks.

Prior to the aforementioned Decree of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, another critical
step was taken on institutional changes. According to the Resolution of the Government of
Tajikistan dated 18 May 2012, # 247, the state enterprise "Main Department of Tojikobdehot",
which previously was in the management structure of the former Ministry of Land Reclamation
and Water Resources, was transferred under the management structure of SUE “Khojagii
Manziliu Kommunaly?. Thus, the functions on drinking water supply and sanitation in the
country for both urban and rural areas have been brought under the management of a single
service organization, which is also in line with the principle of water sector reform.

                 APPENDIX F. COMPARISON WITH THE UNITED STATES

Water charges are highly variable in successful irrigation schemes. In general, successful
schemes invoice farmers depending on the actual expenses for each scheme. In the United States
there are some very old irrigation districts with excellent water rights (that is water is “free? at
the inlet to the scheme), that do not utilize pumping, and that use earthen canals that charge as
low as TJS 17.7 per 1,000 m3. However, such examples are rare. Typical charges range from 7 to
20 times that amount, with some pumped agricultural water costing as much as TJS 1,060 per
1,000 m.3

For a comparison of budgets, the annual O&M budget for the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) in
California is US$143 million. IID has approximately 97 percent gravity flow, all of its irrigated
areas are contiguous, and it has approximately 171,000 ha of irrigated land. The quality of water
delivery service by IID is very good; IID provides very flexible deliveries to farmers, crop yields
are high, and IID employees deliver and measure (within 10 percent accuracy) water to each
individual field, for a total of about 4,500 field delivery points. Water deliveries are requested
one day in advance of being provided to individual fields; there is no rotation schedule.

ALRI has an annual budget of only 13 percent of the annual budget of IID, but it must manage
numerous small schemes with approximately three times the irrigated area. In Tajikistan there
are extra high expenses due to pumping. On the other hand, wages in Tajikistan are much lower,
and occupational safety rules and standard compliance costs are a fraction of those for IID.

The existence of pumped irrigation schemes is commonplace in some countries. In the United
States, examples in California include Banta-Carbona, West Stanislaus, and Patterson Irrigation
Districts, plus about 12 large irrigation districts served by the Delta-Mendota Canal and the
California Aqueduct. The Columbia Basin Project in the eastern portion of the state of
Washington in the United States has 260,000 irrigated ha, with a vertical pump lift of 85 meters
(m) to the irrigated area. Many other examples could be provided.

Some differences between Tajikistan schemes and successful schemes in North and South
America can be noted. In the Americas:
 Almost all of the collected money stays within the irrigation district, except for water and
   power purchases.
 The collections do not go first to the province or federal government, with a portion being
   returned to the individual schemes. Rather, the individual schemes keep all the money that is
   not paid for power or water.
 The successful schemes charge different rates for water, depending upon the costs within
   each scheme. Sometimes there are different rates within a single scheme, depending upon the
   existence of “improvement districts? that farmers in some areas may have voted to fund.
 Delivery of water to the farm, or to no more than 3 or 4 fields, is done by a scheme
   employee.
 The collection rate is 100 percent in the United States, and close to that in successful South
   American schemes with strong WUAs.
 The collection of money is a minor part of the activity in strong WUAs. The WUAs are
   responsible for deciding the budget, the charges for water delivery service, and the
   improvement schemes that are needed. In other words, they are functioning as local
   governments that are formed under provincial, state, or national water codes.

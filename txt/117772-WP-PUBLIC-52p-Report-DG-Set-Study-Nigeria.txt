EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Diesel gensets contribute to emissions of fine particulate matter (PM), including black carbon, which
derives from the incomplete combustion of diesel (as occurs in many diesel generating sets or
gensets). Particulate matter is a predisposing factor for respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease leading
to increased hospital visits and risk of premature death. Local health costs can have a greater impact in
the short-run in densely populated urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos. Black carbon (BC) is the most
strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter and is the second largest warming agent after
carbon dioxide. The emerging role of BC as a significant driver of global climate change is increasing
attention on its mitigation efforts. In addition to the negative health and the climate effects of
emissions, most gensets contribute significantly to noise pollution which further reduces the quality of
life of users and non-users alike.

Current demand for electricity in Nigeria is estimated to be between 8,000-10,000 MW and a
significant part of this demand is met by onsite generating sets which are primarily fueled by petrol
and diesel. At the current pump price of about $1 per liter of diesel, it costs about twice as much to run
a diesel genset compared with the power from the grid. These factors are increasing attention on the
use of diesel gensets for self-generation. With the removal of subsidies on gasoline, the share of diesel
gensets could rise.

This study is a first attempt to develop an inventory of emissions of various types of pollutants
(including black carbon) from diesel gensets in Nigeria. Due to inadequate resources to conduct new
surveys or gather additional primary data, the study draws on available literature and data to estimate
Nigeria’s diesel genset inventory and emissions from the generation of electricity with such gensets. In
doing so, it illustrates an approach to estimate emissions within the constraints of available data. For
example, given that data on local emission factors was unavailable, an approximation had to be made
based on international emission factors including the US EPA standards. Such an approach could be
used to initiate a dialogue with interested stakeholders like the Federal Ministry of Environment as well
as analysts and researchers, but would not be robust for arriving at policy recommendations.

The availability and quality of data varies across the various sectors and the inventory numbers
presented should be regarded as preliminary. Data of relatively better quality was available for the oil
and gas, manufacturing and telecommunication sectors; however, the residential and commercial sector
inventory of diesel genets was much harder to assess. For example, the Nigeria Harmonized Living
Standards Survey was used to estimate the residential sector usage of diesel gensets. This survey does
not indicate the sizes of gensets which has an impact on emission levels and it was assumed that all
gensets are under 1.5MVA thus leading to a lower level of confidence in the resulting estimates of BC
emissions from the residential sector. A similar assumption was made for the commercial sector. The
number of diesel gensets in these sectors were assumed to be small (about 600,000 or 3.5% of the total
number of gensets) but due to the large number of (up to 17.5 million generators in the two sectors), a
more rigorous assessment is necessary because as fuel subsidies on gasoline are revised, the number of
diesel gensets could increase.

Improving data collection of diesel genset use and emissions are first steps toward setting priorities
for action. For example, it could help track changes in emissions over time. This might necessitate sector
specific surveys or follow-up surveys. There are indications that data exists with various agencies in
Nigeria which could be used in estimating self-generation, and sector specialists such as those who
participated in a stakeholders workshop organized for this study in Abuja, could help scope and source
relevant data and information on diesel genset use across the economy. While data may be routinely
collected in some instances, it is not collated or stored in a format that allows for easy collation and this
calls for better data management practices. By strengthening the analysis and evidence base, the results
could help inform policy and further bolster the case for improving the reliability of power supplies to
customers.

1    INTRODUCTION
Demand for electricity in Nigeria is currently estimated to range between 8,000-10,000 MW 1 while
available capacity on the national grid averages around 3,500 MW (World Bank 2014). A significant
proportion of this shortfall is met with onsite generating sets (gensets) at consumer locations; some of
these gensets operating between 15-18 hours a day (NBS, SMEDAN 2010).

Diesel gensets contribute emissions of fine particulate matter (PM), including black carbon, which
derives from the incomplete combustion of diesel (as occurs in many diesel gensets). Particulate matter
is a predisposing factor for respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease leading to increased hospital visits
and risk of premature death. Local health costs can have a greater impact in the short-run in densely
populated urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos. (World Bank, 2011, 2013)

Black carbon also affects the climate. It absorbs sunlight and generates heat in the atmosphere, which
warms the air and can affect regional cloud formation and precipitation patterns. When deposited on
bright surfaces, such as snow and ice, it reduces the reflectivity of the surface and absorbs sunlight,
generating heat. This warms the air above and the surface below, thus accelerating melting (the albedo
effect). Since BC remains in the atmosphere for only a short period (typically 1-2 weeks) its climate
effects would dissipate quickly if emissions were reduced.

Black carbon is often emitted with organic carbon and sulfates which are lighter in color. While black
smoke has a high proportion of BC and exerts a strong warming influence, white smoke, which usually
contains mostly organic carbon, exerts a cooling influence. Although the combustion of diesel in diesel
gensets is dominated by black smoke, it is important to take account of co-pollutants, which reflect
sunlight and thus have a cooling effect on the climate.

In addition to the negative health and the climate effects of emissions, most gensets contribute
significantly to noise pollution which further reduces the quality of life of users and non-users alike. The
financial burden of operating a diesel genset in Nigeria is also significant. At the current pump price of
nearly $1 per liter of diesel 2, it costs about twice as much to run a diesel genset compared with the
currently subsidized power from the grid.

The health impacts and emerging role of BC as a significant contributor to global climate change,
possibly second only to CO2, is increasing the focus on the potential climate impacts of diesel genset use
(USEPA 2005). This study attempts to estimate the order of magnitude of black carbon and other
pollutants from the use of diesel gensets in Nigeria.

2        BACKGROUND
Nigeria is the largest country in Africa with its population of 158 million people and accounts for 47% of
West Africa’s population (World Bank 2013). Despite the general increase in per capita electric power
consumption from year 2000, the national average has been significantly below the average for the sub
region as seen from figure 1. Nearly half of the entire population had no access to electricity according
to 2010 statistics (World Bank a).

                                                                                                        For the other half with access, the quality

prices. Gasoline is subsidized in Nigeria and therefore cheaper than diesel as shown in figure 2. This has
influenced consumption patterns. For example, most private vehicles run on gasoline due to the lower
price. Subsidies are expected to gradually reduce and narrow the price difference between gasoline and
diesel which will affect consumption patterns and the composition of generators. (IISD 2012) (Cervigni,
Rogers and Dvorak 2013)

There are no quality control regulations so the market consists of gensets of varying quality and prices
(Frost & Sullivan 2011). While there are regulations to control vehicular emissions from petrol and diesel
engines, there are no regulations to control emissions from gensets (NESREA 2013a). The National
Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA), a parastatal agency of the
Federal Ministry of Environment, has responsibility for the protection and development of the
environment, biodiversity conservation amongst others and are also responsible for enforcement of
regulations (NESREA 2013b).

A draft National Policy on the Environment proposed in 1998 sought to control amongst others: air
pollution by establishing ambient air quality standards and monitoring stations at designated zone; and
noise pollution by setting up noise standards including acoustic guarantees and prescribing guidelines
for the control of noise (FEPA 1998). These are yet to be established.

Despite the challenges, the government is working to improve supply. The ongoing National Integrated
Power Projects (NIPP) will add 3,700 MW capacity in the coming three years (World Bank, 2014) with
the vision of expanding available capacity to 40,000MW by 2020 (PTFP, 2013).

2.1     Scope and Methodology
This study draws on available literature and data to estimate Nigeria’s diesel genset inventory and
emissions from the generation of electricity with such gensets. In doing so, it illustrates an approach to
estimate emissions within the constraints of available data.

The sectors of the Nigerian economy with significant utilization of diesel genset for electricity generation
include manufacturing; residential; telecommunications; oil and gas; and the commercial and
construction sectors. The commercial sector is a broad categorization that includes banks, other offices,
schools, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, markets, and shops amongst others.

The availability and quality of data varies across the various sectors and in the analysis, sectors with
relatively better data are discussed first before other sectors where data quality is poorer. Data of
relatively better quality was available for the oil and gas, manufacturing and telecommunication sectors.
It is difficult to estimate the level of genset usage in the residential and commercial sectors due to the
nature and distribution of users. The residential sector was analyzed using the Nigeria Harmonized Living
Standards Survey (HLSS) as a basis.

An estimate of the potential contribution of the commercial sector is included based on: (i) a load
demand study published in 2009 by Tractebel Engineering Suez and Omega Systems; and (ii) a survey by
the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and the National Bureau

of Statistics (NBS). These two sources yield varied results and is used to present a range for the extent to
which gensets are used.

To estimate energy generation from diesel gensets, the following parameters are required for each of
the relevant sectors of the economy:
        • Number of gensets.
        • The capacity of the gensets.
        • The rate of diesel consumption for electricity generation by these facilities.
        • Average hours of running these facilities per day.
        • Information on the fuel efficiency, the capacity factor, and the availability of the facilities.

Given the data limitations, multiple assumptions are used in estimating some of these parameters. A
weakness with this approach is the need to extrapolate data across the culturally and economically
diverse population of Nigeria. An alternative to this approach would be to use data on diesel
consumption or sales to estimate energy generation from diesel gensets. The weakness of this
alternative approach is that the distinction between the sectors is lost and with that the potential to use
relatively better data from sectors like the manufacturing and telecommunication sectors.

There are indications that data exists with various agencies in Nigeria which could be used in estimating
self-generation. This was apparent during stakeholder consultations held in Abuja. In some instances, it
was confirmed that while the data is routinely collected, it is not collated or stored in a format that
allows for easy collation. In other instances, obtained data included several missing points. This further
heightens the need for better data management.

After building the inventory, emissions were estimated using emission factors available. In the absence
of local factors, international factors, including U.S. EPA emissions standards, were used for the
estimates. The EPA standards stipulate different emission factors for engines under 600 horsepower and
engines above 600 horsepower. Per the EPA standards, the inventories for the sectors analyzed were
split into two groups according to the generator rating. To capture the age and maintenance practices in
Nigeria, the U.S. EPA emissions factors were modified by drawing on the expertise of the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). IIASA conducts policy-oriented research into problems
that are too large or too complex to be solved by a single country or academic discipline and has been
involved in developing emission factors in various countries.

2.2     Structure of the Report
This report is organized as follows:

        •   Chapter 3 presents the inventories developed for the relevant sectors of the Nigerian
            economy where data/information is available.
        •   Chapter 4 includes a discussion of the emissions factors used in the estimation of the
            emissions from diesel gensets in Nigeria and the results for emissions of BC and co-
            pollutants. This chapter also looks at data gaps and suggested sources of data to bridge the
            gaps.
        •   Chapter 5 presents conclusions and offers recommendations for further work.

In Chapters 3 and 4, the telecommunication, oil and gas and manufacturing sectors, where relatively
better data exists, are presented first followed by the residential and commercial sectors. Finally, the
annexes present key data, results, and the equations used in this study.

3       THE NIGERIAN DIESEL GENSET INVENTORY
This section presents the inventory of diesel gensets for the manufacturing, residential,
telecommunications, and oil and gas sectors. These sectors, along with construction and commercial,
are significant users of gensets. Due to the paucity of data, the construction and commercial sectors
were not analyzed.

3.1         Diesel Genset Inventory for the Manufacturing Industry

3.1.1 Data Sources
The main data source used for the inventory work for the manufacturing sector was a 2007 report by
the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN), 3 Power and Energy Audit Exercise for Member
Factories Nationwide (MAN 2007). The survey was commissioned by MAN to estimate the capacity that
would be required for a power plant to service members of the association. This was necessitated by the
erratic supply of power from the national grid.

The data from the survey is summarized in Table 1.

3.1.2 Analysis of the MAN Database and the Resulting Inventory
According to the MAN survey report, the 1,500 manufacturing sites covered by the survey is said to be
about 90% of the manufacturing industries in Nigeria. Analysis of the data indicated that only 602 of the
sites had complete data that can be used for this analysis. This means that the sample size that is being
used to build this inventory is about 36% of the sector population of diesel gensets;

The following steps were taken to analyze the MAN database and develop the diesel genset inventory
for the manufacturing industry:

       •     The MAN database, which was organized in accordance with MAN’s eight zonal regions, was
             reorganized into the 11 Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) power distribution zones.
       •     For each manufacturing entity, the HP 4 rating of the onsite generation facility was calculated,
             and the resulting database was graded by HP rating. The reason for grading by HP rating was to
             facilitate the use of the emissions factors which are available by HP rating.
       •     Using the weekly diesel consumption per site for generation of electricity and an assumption of
             fuel efficiency for each of the sector gensets, the electricity generation (MWh) at each site was
             estimated.
       •     The KVA rating of the generators and the power factor (PF) at each site were included in the
             survey; these were used to estimate the available power capacity (MW) at each site.

As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 40 percent of gensets with capacities above 600 HP are in Eko while
40 percent of gensets with capacities under 600HP are in Ikeja. Analysis of the data indicate that only
602 of the sites had complete data that could be used for analysis, which translates to a sample size that
is about 36 percent of the sector’s population of diesel gensets.

Reliable estimates of average hours of grid availability in each of the 11 power distribution zones in
Nigeria are not available; the electricity generated at each site was estimated from the diesel fuel
utilized and an assumption of average fuel efficiency of the gensets. In a recent World Bank Low Carbon

 study for Nigeria, an average fuel efficiency of 25 percent was assumed for diesel generators operating
 in Nigeria and this assumption was adopted for the study (Cervigni, Rogers and Dvorak 2013). This
 efficiency accounts for the fact that many of the generators in Nigeria are old and poorly maintained.
 Key assumptions that were used in the development of diesel genset inventory, as well as the electricity
 generation estimates by diesel gensets in this sector are provided in Table 2.

 Given these assumptions, it was estimated that in 2007 generators with capacity less than 600 HP within
 the MAN database generated about 312.3 GWh of electricity. Diesel generators with capacity ≥ 600 HP
 generated about 184.1 GWh that same year, giving a total of 496.4 GWh by the 602 gensets covered in
 the MAN survey data (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Details of the calculations can be found in Table A- 1 and

Given the fact that this represents about 36% of the total inventory of gensets in the sector, and
assuming that the MAN survey data is a good representative of the inventory in the sector, it is
estimated that electricity generation by diesel gensets in the Nigerian manufacturing sector in 2007 may
be as high as 1,378.6 GWh. Using the same assumption, this is equivalent to an installed capacity of
2,400 MW.

3.2      The Telecommunications Sector’s Diesel Genset Inventory

3.2.1 Data Sources
The Nigerian telecommunications sector witnessed strong growth and expansion in the last decade,
expanding 15.3 percent in network size between 2011 and 2012. Nigeria, as the leading African mobile
telecom market, reached a subscriber base of 107 million as of September 2012, with a current network
size of 24,252 tower sites. (IFC, GSMA 2012)

A total of about 12,560 sites are deployed in off-grid locations, representing about 52 percent of the
total; the remaining 48 percent represent about 11,692 sites that are purely on-grid. Off-grid sites rely
on diesel generators as their primary source of power. Mobile network operators (MNOs) and tower
companies, however, have pursued alternative solutions (notably battery hybrid power stations) to
reduce their dependence on diesel generators.(Ibid)

Almost every on-grid site is equipped with a diesel generator as a backup power source due to
unreliable grid power supplies in the country. None of the on-grid sites runs completely on grid power
supply or grid-battery hybrid power. The majority of on-grid sites (75 percent) have adopted a
grid/genset solution.

3.2.2 Analysis of Data and Development of the Inventory
Key information obtained from the market survey (IFC, GSMA 2012) and used for the diesel genset
inventory included the following:

                •        Nigeria’s on-grid sites consume an average of 1,500 liters per month.
                •        Off-grid sites consume over 1,700 liters per month.
                •        Given the fact that most of gensets in this sector are new, the fuel efficiency was assumed to
                         be 35 percent.

The total number of gensets is estimated at 24,252 (see Table 3). The telecommunications sector is one
of the largest end users of diesel gensets in Nigeria. Gensets in the capacity range 10-30 KVA accounts
for about 80 percent of the purchases in this end-user sector. Stakeholder consultations indicated that
gensets in the capacity range greater than 30 and up to 60 KVA make up about 15 percent of the
inventory in the sector and those in the range 300-500 KVA, which are used to supply onsite electricity
at MNO offices and switching centers, constitute 5 percent. Gensets with capacities higher than 500 KVA
and whose capacities can be classified as having > 600 HP are only one percent of the sector’s diesel
genset inventory (see Figure 7).

3.2.3 Estimation of Electricity Generation by Diesel Gensets
The estimate of electricity generation in the year 2012 by onsite diesel generators operating in the
telecommunications sector in Nigeria is presented in Table 5. A total of 1,645.54 GWh was generated
from diesel gensets in the telecommunications sector. This is approximately six percent of electricity
production from the grid in 2011. Most of the generation was from gensets rated under 600HP (see
Figure 8).

3.3                     The Oil and Gas Sector’s Diesel Genset Inventory

3.3.1 Use of Diesel Gensets
Almost all the oil and gas fields in Nigeria are located in areas far removed from the grid; as such, the
development of these fields has been designed for the use of onsite generation equipment. Even for
those fields close to grid access areas, the norm over the years has been to equip the fields with onsite
generation due to the unreliable supply situation of the national grid.

Most fields use gas-fired gensets to provide onsite electricity. Diesel gensets are used for startup and
standby electricity generation requirements (standby when gas supply fails or there is a shutdown of the
primary power supply system due to scheduled and/or forced maintenance). According to a market
survey by Frost and Sullivan, oil and gas fields in Nigeria are usually equipped with two diesel gensets
ranging in capacity from 500-1000 KVA to meet standby and cold startup requirements (Frost & Sullivan
2011). Only one of the gensets at a field is operated; the second is a backup genset in case the main set
breaks down.

3.3.2 Database and Approach to Inventory Development
According to the information contained in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) statistics
bulletin of 2011, there were 16 oil and gas companies with active production in the Nigerian offshore
and onshore fields in 2011. Assumptions used for the analysis include the following:

          •             The main diesel genset is operated when needed and the spare is only operated when the main
                        set is out of operation (due to forced or planned maintenance).

          •             Each field in Nigeria is equipped with gas-fired gensets, which produce electricity for field
                        operations; diesel gensets in oil fields in Nigeria are primarily used for cold/black starts and as
                        alternative generating sets when gas-fired engines are not available.

          •             It was assumed that these diesel gensets are operated for an average of about 440 hours per
                        year. This average running hours comprises:

                            •      52 hours per year for the usual running of the gensets for 1 hour each week to keep the
                                   system in good running condition,


                                                                              12
                         Diesel Power Generation: Inventories and Black Carbon Emissions in Nigeria


             •   Two weeks per year when the oil and gas facility is being maintained and the gas
                 gensets are unavailable. This comes to 336 hours/year.

             •   An estimated two weeks per year for forced shortages at the facility due to unforeseen
                 circumstances (e.g., theft) has been assumed. During this period, the onsite diesel
                 genset will be operated. This equates to another 52 hours/year.

     •   Based on information obtained from the Frost and Sullivan survey, the capacity of diesel gensets
         operating in the oil and gas sector ranges from 500 kVA to 2,000 kVA. It was thus assumed that
         the average capacity of diesel gensets in the oil and gas sector in 2011 is 1,250 KVA.

     •   An average power factor of 0.80 and an average capacity factor of 0.85 for the diesel gensets
         operating in this sector have been assumed.

Key assumptions that were utilized in the development of diesel genset inventory as well as the
electricity generation estimates by diesel gensets in this sector are summarized in Table 6.

3.4       Diesel Gensets Inventory in the Residential sector

3.4.1 Data Sources
The inventory for the residential sector was developed with various sources of data and took into
account feedback from a consultation meeting organized in Abuja. Data sources included the following:

      • The Harmonized Nigeria Living Standards Survey (HNLSS) - Nigerian Household Survey (NHS) –
         The Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) 2009/2010 was an enlarged scope of
         previous National Consumer Surveys and also a follow-up of Nigeria Living Standard Survey
         (NLSS) 2003/2004 to include demography, health; and fertility behaviour, education and
         training; housing and housing condition; social capital; agriculture; household income,
         consumption and expenditure. The survey covered all 36 States of the Federation and the
         Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and was carried out in two parts. Part A measured welfare and
         was conducted in 77,400 households which is an average of one hundred households per Local



                                                            14

            Government area. Part B measured consumption and covered 50 percent of the households
            covered under Part A. Part B of the survey asked respondents to estimate the expenditure on
            diesel and gasoline for electricity production. This is what was used to estimate energy
            generation from diesel gensets in the residential sector.
       • Aba Electric Consumer Census: a consumer census commissioned by Geometric Power Limited,
            an independent power producer (IPP) to develop a detailed inventory of future consumers. The
            consumer census was designed and conducted within Aba Town in 2008. The census focused on
            urban consumers only and was designed to collect information regarding personal data,
            consumer category (residential, commercial, or industrial); house/business location and
            address; meter information, and PHCN billing number or other reference information; generator
            size; type, and fuel consumption. This survey was used to estimate the number of gensets rated
            above 600 hp.

This analysis also assumes that each household runs only one genset even when multiple gensets are
owned by the household. In the survey carried out in Aba city, 20 percent of the respondents owned
more than one generator.

3.4.2 Analysis of Data and Development of the Inventory
33,775 households were interviewed under Part B of the HNLSS. Out of this number, 2,901 (about 8.6
percent) reported owning gensets (diesel or gasoline). Out of this number, only sixteen percent (456
households) reported purchasing diesel or gasoline for electricity generation. This could mean several
households do not run the gensets owned, or the gensets are operated by other users. For example, 4.5
percent of households that did not report ownership of gensets reported purchasing fuel for power
production. However, the observed results could also reflect a weakness in the survey. In the state of
Gombe, no household reported purchasing gasoline for any purpose. This is unlikely to be true even
though Gombe was reported as only second to Jigawa state in terms of poverty rates (World Bank
2013). It should therefore be noted that there could be margins of error with the results of the survey
but it was used in estimating genset usage in the residential sector. Applying this to the entire
population using household weights, nearly 12 percent of households own generators in Nigeria
(approximately 4.5 million).

In estimating energy output, ownership of a genset is less relevant than operating the genset and so the
statistics on households that reported purchasing fuel for power production was used. Of the
households that reported purchasing fuel for power production, nearly 468,000 reported expenditure
on diesel (14%) and nearly 3 million reported expenditure on gasoline for power production. The total
expenditure on diesel was converted from Nigerian Naira to US dollars using the average exchange rate
of 148.4 Naira to a Dollar in 2009 5.

The weighted results show that the Lagos has the highest number of diesel gensets in the residential
sector and also reported the highest expenditure on diesel purchases (Figure 9). This is indicative of the
population and poverty levels of the states. Lagos State has the lowest estimated poverty rate of 22.9%,

gensets:

    •                    Uniform average pump price of $0.95 per liter diesel across all states in 2009. This is an average
                         of the 2008 and 2010 average prices reported in the World Development Indicators and was
                         used to estimate the liters of diesel purchased.
    •                    An average genset efficiency of 25% as consistent with the efficiency assumed for older gensets
                         used in this study and the low carbon study.

The total energy output for diesel gensets is estimated at approximately 154 GWh. Table A- 3 and Table
A- 4 in the Annex show the results by state. Using similar assumptions as for the diesel genset and a
pump price of $0.53 per liter of gasoline, energy output from gasoline gensets is estimated at
approximately 2,260 GWh. As was done in the low carbon study, the estimated energy generation from
genset was varied by 40 percent. With this sensitivity, total captive generation in the residential sector is
estimated between 1,450 GWh and 3,370 GWh.

The range is realistic compared with similar analysis like the load demand study which roughly estimated
installed self-generation for the residential sector to be between 1000 MW and 2000 MW. The average
observed grid unavailability for 11kV feeders was 47 percent (Tractebel Engineering Suez, Omega
Systems 2009). In part A of the HNLSS, less than 2 percent of households reported using generators as
the main source of lighting (NBS 2010). This implies most gensets are used for back-up supply. Assuming

an average load factor of 45 percent 6, the installed capacity for gensets in the residential sector could be
between 780 MW and 1,820 MW based on the estimated energy output which compares well with
estimates in the load demand study.

3.5      Diesel Gensets Inventory in the Commercial Sectors
Two scenarios were considered for the commercial sector: (1) based on the load demand study; and (2)
based on a survey by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN)
carried out in collaboration with the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The load demand study establishes a correlation between the commercial and residential loads and
estimates the commercial sector to contribute 25% of unsuppressed demand with the residential sector
contributing 55% of the same. Using this assumption with the analysis of the residential sector above,
self-generation from gensets (total) in the commercial sector could be 904 GWh with a possible range of
660 GWh and 1,530 GWh (40 percent variation). If a ratio of diesel to gasoline gensets similar to that of
the residential sector is used, energy generation from diesel gensets in the commercial and construction
could be approximately 70 GWh. This estimate is based on the share of commercial load connected to
the grid.

Other sources of data indicate that this could be an underestimation of the extent of genset usage in the
commercial and construction sectors. In a preliminary survey report on the micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria, it was estimated that nearly 23,000 small and medium enterprises (also
referred to as the formal sector) 7 used alternative sources of power daily and nearly 13.9 million micro
enterprises (also referred to as the informal sector) 8 used alternative sources of power daily (NBS,
SMEDAN 2010). The results of the survey show significant usage of gensets (see Figure 10, Table A- 5
and Table A- 6 in the Annex).

Almost 14 million gensets are recorded in the survey operating between 1 and up to 20 hours a day.
Nearly all (99 percent) of these gensets are used in the informal or micro scale enterprises and are thus
likely to be operated on gasoline. Assuming an average capacity of 7.5 kVA and 2.5 kVA for the formal
and informal sectors respectively, total annual energy generation from gensets could be 108 GWh and
13,270 GWh for the two sectors; a total of over 13,380 GWh (see Table A- 7 and Table A- 8 in the
Annex).

The average genset sizes are obtained from the consumer survey carried out in the city of Aba where
the average generator size for the residential sector was 2.5 kVA while the average genset size for the
commercial sector was 7.5 kVA. It is further assumed that gensets in the micro enterprises are likely to
be similar to household gensets. The average loading of the gensets during operation is assumed to be
40 percent (Cervigni, Rogers and Dvorak 2013) and the businesses are estimated to operate 250 out of
365 days.

                Figure 10: Distribution of gensets in micro, small and medium enterprises by sector

There was no data to directly estimate the share of generation from diesel gensets. However, it is likely
that most of gensets used by small and medium enterprises are diesel operated due to the larger
capacities. With this assumption, energy generation from diesel gensets could be approximately
108 GWh.

3.5.1 Estimation of Electricity Generation by Diesel Gensets
The data from the different sectors comes from different years and different sources so it is not
accurate to compare or aggregate results across sectors. However, this was done to obtain a sense of
the magnitude of energy generation from diesel gensets. For the telecommunication, manufacturing
and oil and gas sectors where centralized data was available, self-generation from diesel gensets was
estimated to be about 3,100GWh. This is likely to cover the bulk of captive generation in these sectors
since most of the gensets used are run on diesel with others on gas (mainly in the oil and gas sector).

Self-generation from diesel gensets in the residential sector is estimated at 154 GWh with a possible
range of 92 GWh to 215 GWh assuming a variation of 40 percent in energy output. For the commercial
sector, self-generation from diesel gensets has been estimated to be between 70 GWh and 108 GWh. In
total, estimated generation from diesel gensets could be between 3,262 GWh and 3,423 GWh (see Table
9).

                              Diesel Power Generation: Inventories and Black Carbon Emissions in Nigeria


The low carbon study estimated total self-generation at 16,360GWh in 2009 and this included
generation from diesel, gas and gasoline generators. Self-generation for the sectors analyzed in this
study is estimated between 5,240 GWh and 20,380 GWh. The high range is due to the significant
difference in results from the two scenarios evaluated for the commercial sector. Using the load
demand study as a basis, the energy generation was estimated 904 GWh while the analysis with the
SMEDAN survey estimate energy generation at 13,380 GWh.

A load factor of 70% was assumed to estimate peak demand equivalent to the estimated range of
energy from self-generation (Tractebel Engineering Suez, Omega Systems 2009). Under this assumption,
the peak demand is between 855 MW and 3,324 MW (see Table 10). As these generators are located
on-site, this estimated peak is without losses. Aggregate technical, commercial, and collection (ATC&C)
losses in the transmission and distribution system are as high as 35 percent (World Bank 2014) but
assuming technical losses to be 20 percent (Tractebel Engineering Suez, Omega Systems 2009), a
4,000 MW plant will be required to meet the estimated demand currently served by self-generation.

The installed capacity for off-grid generators will be higher than this estimate because most of such
generators typically operate at low utilization factors (between 40% and 50% according to the low
carbon study). The low carbon study estimated available self-generation capacity at 4,300 MW while the
load demand study by (Tractebel Engineering Suez, Omega Systems 2009) roughly estimated installed
self-generation capacity to be between 3,700 MW and 5,750 MW. While the two estimates represent
different parameters, they show a significant amount of self-generation in Nigeria’s generation mix as
also demonstrated by this study. It is also worth noting that self-generation is a fraction of total
suppressed demand. It is not directly related to the load demand but rather to generation and
transmission system inadequacies. 9

 For example, some genset owners connected to the grid will only use their generators for lighting when the grid is unavailable
rather than run the entire normal load. The total unserved load counts towards suppressed demand but not all of this is met
through self-generation.

4       EMISSIONS OF BLACK CARBON AND OTHER CO-POLLUTANTS

4.1         Development of Emissions Factors
In calculating emissions in this study, the inventory detailed in the previous sections and electricity
generation estimates were combined with appropriate emissions factors for each of the pollutants to
estimate emissions in a base year of the data used for the inventory (e.g., 2007 for the manufacturing
sector or 2010 for the residential sector).

Where possible, the emissions factors used in this study are based on parameters developed for the
stock of diesel gensets available in the Nigerian economy and take into consideration characteristic
parameters of the stock of diesel gensets (e.g., age, operational load factor, horsepower rating). In the
absence of these local factors, international factors, including U.S. EPA emissions standards, were used
for the estimates. These standards informed the split of the generator inventory into two groups
according to the generator rating. For example, the manufacturing sector diesel genset inventory was
developed along two HP ratings segments: (1) generators with horsepower ratings less than 600 HP; and
(2) those with HP ≥ 600 (see Table 11).

The emissions factors used for the study were derived from a combination of Table 11 and Table 12
factor in the following assumptions:

   •   The emission factors in Table 11, which are from U.S. EPA emissions standards for Tier 1-3
       engines, are applicable to new engines.
   •   The fuel efficiency of average diesel gensets operating in Nigeria is 25 percent, while that for
       new diesel gensets has been assumed to be 35 percent;
   •   Diesel gensets according to their HP ratings in any of the inventories developed were divided
       into the following categories:
           o Old diesel gensets with HP < 600.
           o Old diesel gensets with HP ≥ 600.
           o New diesel gensets with HP < 600.
           o New diesel gensets with HP ≥ 600.
   •   NOx and PM10 emission factors for new diesel gensets with HP < 600 and for HP ≥ 600 were
       derived from Table 12.
   •   SO2 emission factors in Table 12 were considered inappropriate for use in estimating the
       emissions from electricity generation using the average diesel gensets in the various user
       sectors in Nigeria because the sulphur content in diesel fuel used as the basis for determining
       the emission factors in Table 12 is ≥ 2,500 PM, while the average sulphur content in diesel fuel
       in Nigeria is about 1,500 ppm. Given these considerations, SO2 emission factors for diesel
       gensets in the two categories were determined as follows:
           o For new diesel gensets with HP ≥ 600 and HP < 600, the emission factors in Table 11 with
               average diesel fuel efficiency of 35 percent was adopted.
           o For old diesel gensets with HP ≥ 600 and HP < 600, the emission factors in Table 12 with
               average diesel fuel efficiency of 25 percent was adopted.
   •   NOx and PM10 emission factors for old diesel gensets with HP < 600 and for HP ≥ 600 were
       derived from Table 11 - but with the assumption that such diesel gensets have an average fuel
       efficiency of 25 percent.

Given these assumptions, the emissions factors in Table 13 were developed.

4.2       Estimation of Emissions
Emissions of CO2, SO2, NOX, OC, and BC are calculated for electricity produced by diesel gensets. Key
parameters for the estimation of emissions include the quantity of electricity produced by the diesel
generators in the year and the emissions factors. The emissions factors presented in Table 22 have been
used for this estimation.

In this estimation, generation by diesel gensets in each sector has been divided into two groups: (1)
generation by diesel gensets with HP < 600; and (2) generation by diesel gensets with HP ≥ 600. The
results for each sector and pollutant are presented in the following sections.

BC and OC are estimated using the speciation factors for the two pollutants. It has been assumed in this
report that the BC contribution to PM2.5 is 60 percent for the larger, newer gensets found in the
construction and telecommunications sectors and for the smaller (and some larger but new) gensets in
the telecommunications sector. For all the other sectors, where older gensets are predominant (e.g.
industrial, residential, and so forth), BC contributions of 40 percent have been assumed. For OC, the
contribution to PM2.5 is 30 percent for newer gensets and 45 percent for smaller and bigger (but older)
gensets.

Table 14 shows the emissions estimates for CO2, SO2, NOX, OC, and BC and the electricity generated for
the two categories of HP ratings for the manufacturing sector.

4.2.5 Emissions from the commercial sectors
Significant use of onsite diesel gensets for electricity generation also occurs in the construction and
commercial sectors. It was not possible to obtain tangible information on the deployment of diesel
gensets in these sectors. Various assumptions were used to estimate energy generation from diesel
gensets. This resulted in about BC emissions ranging between 52 tons and 80 tons per year if it is
assumed that all genset engines in this sector are rated under 600HP. Emission of other pollutants is
shown in Table 18.

Stakeholder consultations yielded useful insights that can be used to obtain necessary information on
some key sub-sectors of the commercial sector: the banking sub-sector (with potential data and
information from a Shared Infrastructure Program by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the United
Nations Development Program); the health sector (with information from the various hospitals and
hospital management boards); organized markets (with the possibility of obtaining baseline information
from a centrally managed genset systems at the Utako Market in Abuja and at the Ariara market in Aba);
hotels (with information and data from the Nigerian Tourist Board); and secondary and tertiary
educational institutions.

4.3      Summary of Sector Emissions
The telecommunications sector is a major source of BC emissions from the use of diesel gensets (1.22
kilotons per year based on 2012 estimates). BC emissions from the manufacturing sector in 2007 were
estimated at 0.76 ktBC/year. As the base years are different for the different sectors, it is difficult to
compare results across sectors.

An inventory developed to support the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report estimated anthropogenic black
carbon emissions for Nigeria at approximately 67 kilotons per year in 2010.(26) 11 This inventory includes
emissions from the energy (including gas flaring), industrial, transportation, residential, and agriculture
sectors. The inventory from the telecommunication, oil and gas and manufacturing sectors analyzed is

inventory included all sectors except the combustion of agricultural wastes (e.g., burning rice stubble) and biofuels (e.g., cow
dung, charcoal).


                                                                 24
                              Diesel Power Generation: Inventories and Black Carbon Emissions in Nigeria


approximately 2.01 kilotons, 12 which represents about three percent of Nigeria's anthropogenic BC
emissions. Other sources of BC emissions include transportation, gas flaring, etc. While the residential
and commercial sectors contribute significantly to energy generation from gensets, the low share of
diesel gensets in these sectors translates to low BC emissions. Total emissions from these two sectors
are estimated at about 0.2 kilotonnes.

4.4       Data Gaps and Recommendations for Bridging Gaps
The data used in developing diesel genset inventories for each of the four sectors covered in this report
were developed through desk-based research that focused on publicly available information. The
database used for inventories in the manufacturing and residential sectors was from earlier sector
surveys; all other data was extracted from research and study publications as well as discussions with
local sector experts. Additionally, basic assumptions had to be made. A number of data/information
gaps were identified in the course of this study that, if filled, could improve the inventory of diesel
gensets in the country as well as emissions estimates. These are described below.

4.4.1 The Manufacturing Sector
The key source of data for the diesel genset inventory is the 2007 survey by the Manufacturing
Association of Nigeria (MAN). A review of the database showed that useable data/information was
available for 602 manufacturing companies representing about 36 percent of such enterprises in Nigeria
in 2007. The survey dataset also contained information on diesel consumption for each generator
identified in the survey. The following information/data gaps were identified:

      •    Genset Fuel Efficiency – The dataset did not have information on hours of operation of the
           gensets, so average fuel efficiency was used to estimate the electricity generated. Establishing
           typical grid unavailability data is an important next step.

      •    Age of Gensets – This is an important parameter that has significant impacts on the
           performance of the generating sets, which in turn impacts emissions. Since this data was not
           explicitly provided in the survey, a general assumption was made that the majority of facilities
           in the manufacturing sector are old. This is likely to overestimate the emissions for newer
           gensets.

      •     Diesel Fuel Density, Sulfur Content, and Net Calorific Value – These are important
           characteristic properties of diesel fuel used in the estimation of electricity generation and
           emissions. Further work is needed to generate more reliable estimates of emissions. Potential
           sources of data include the National Automotive Council and the Nigeria National Petroleum
           Corporation.

  Note that the years of analysis in the various sectors are different and summing the results across the sectors is only meant to
give an indication of the magnitude.


                                                                 25
                         Diesel Power Generation: Inventories and Black Carbon Emissions in Nigeria


4.4.2 The Telecommunications Sector
The information and data used to develop the diesel genset inventory were obtained mostly from a
sector report covering Nigeria and Ghana. This single source contains macro information on the sector.
A more robust and reliable database on the sector would involve activity-level data from mobile
network operators in the country.

The following is a list of parameters that need to be collated from the MNOs:

    •   Number of operating diesel gensets at each site.
    •   The capacity (KW) of each of these diesel gensets at each site.
    •   Average weekly diesel consumption by each genset at each site.
    •   Grid availability and estimate of hours per day each diesel genset is operated to generate
        electricity.
    •   Fuel efficiency of each operating genset at each site.
    •   Power factor at each of the sites.

4.4.3 The Oil and Gas Sector
The basic data and information for developing the diesel engine inventory in the oil and gas sector were
taken from the 2011 NNPC Statistical Bulletin and a market survey by Frost and Sullivan.

The assumptions made to facilitate the development of diesel genset inventories in this sector came
mostly from secondary and tertiary sources; there is a need to validate these assumptions from primary
data sources.

4.4.4 The Residential Sector
The key database used for the inventory of diesel gensets was the Harmonized Nigeria Living Standards
Survey. This was useful in estimating generation from diesel gensets because respondents were
specifically asked to estimate diesel expenditure for power production. However, it may be necessary to
verify some of the data. For example, in the state of Gombe, no household reported purchasing gasoline
for any purpose. This is unlikely to be true even though Gombe was reported as only second to Jigawa
state in terms of poverty rates (World Bank 2013).

The next National Household Survey is in the planning stage as is the next population census. The
average run hours of gensets per day at each site or the average hours that grid electricity is unavailable
at each site/day could be useful in checking estimates of fuel purchase.

4.4.5 The Commercial Sectors
The survey by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and the
National Bureau of Statisctics (NBS) provides a good foundation for estimating the number of gensets
used in the construction and commercial sectors. However, beyond the number of gensets, there is little
information to use in estimating energy output. Follow up surveys in this sector should include
questions on obtaining estimates of hours of operation, type and quantity of fuel purchased and size of
gensets.

Additionally, for future work, the commercial sector could be further disaggregated to make it easier to
contact central bodies for data.

4.4.6 Emissions Factors
It would also be beneficial to develop local emissions factors for emissions from gensets operated in the
sectors analyzed in this report. Genset marketing operations in the country could potentially provide
emissions factors for new engines sold in the Nigerian market.

5     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study has estimated the diesel gensets inventory and emissions from the generation of electricity
with such gensets in Nigeria, within the constraints of available literature and data. The approach used
could help initiate a dialogue with interested stakeholders like the Federal Ministry of Environment as
well as analysts and researchers; however, it is limited in its utility for arriving at policy
recommendations.

It was necessary to make a number of assumptions to develop an inventory of gensets and associated
emissions in Nigeria. This study provides an order of magnitude estimate of about 2 kilotons for annual
black carbon emissions from the use of diesel gensets in three sectors where the quality of data is
relatively better, namely: telecommunications, oil and gas and manufacturing. This estimate is
approximately 3 percent of anthropogenic emissions in Nigeria.

Emissions from the residential, commercial and construction sectors were roughly estimated at 0.2
kilotons but more accuracy is needed which will require further data collection and analysis. It was
estimated that these sectors could contribute significantly to genset usage but most of the gensets are
operated with gasoline. As fuel subsidies on gasoline are revised, the number of diesel gensets could
increase. It is therefore worth analyzing these sectors in further detail.

Indications during stakeholder discussions in Abuja suggested that there are several potential sources of
data that could be tapped for future studies. However, it was difficult to obtain data and where data
was available; there were a number of missing data points. This calls for improved data collation and
coordination amongst the curators of data (the NBS) and data custodians.

There are no emission standards for gensets and to develop any such standards, it would be helpful to
develop locally-tailored emissions factors for the existing inventory of old gensets as well as for new
gensets that are regularly injected into the national stock. Further work could bridge data gaps identified
could assist policy makers address the use of gensets in Nigeria but ultimately, the high unit cost of
electricity from gensets is a main driver for power sector reform.

5.1       Recommendations
Given the results of this desktop study and the data gaps discussion, the following recommendations are
made to improve the quality of the diesel genset and emissions inventories in the near term:

      •   Focus efforts on validating the assumptions used in this study and where possible, deploy sector
          specific surveys or follow-up surveys. As an example, data from the manufacturing, oil and gas,
          and telecommunication sectors show significant impact on BC emissions and could be improved
          and used to drive discussions with regulators.

      •   Engage the major telecommunications operating companies in gathering data and information
          to support a sector-wide diesel genset inventory and emissions dataset.




                                                             28
                        Diesel Power Generation: Inventories and Black Carbon Emissions in Nigeria


   •   Reach out to sector specialists, such as those who participated in the stakeholders’ workshop in
       Abuja, to help scope and source relevant data and information on diesel genset use across the
       economy and to validate assumptions.

   •   Encourage the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) to update the 2007 manufacturing
       sector survey and to include additional parameters identified in this desktop study that are
       needed to develop a robust diesel genset inventory.

   •   Develop a national emissions factor inventory for Nigeria. The following data is needed to
       support this: old and new diesel genset use as well as different capacity categories typically used
       for onsite power generation in all sectors. A way to do this could be to select different
       categories of diesel gensets and carry out stack emissions testing on each to ascertain more
       reasonable emission factors for various air pollutants.

Improving data collection on diesel genset use and emissions are first steps toward developing
emissions standards for new and in-use gensets and regulations to manage emissions from diesel
gensets. By strengthening the analysis and evidence base, the results could help inform policy and
further bolster the case for improving the reliability of power supplies to customers.

(d)      Emissions of Black Carbon (BC) and Organic Carbon (OC) from the Operations of Diesel Gensets

Using the emission factors estimates in Table 20, emissions of black Carbon and organic carbon from
the PM-10 will be based on the following:

      •     An assumption that 99 percent of the PM-10 estimates is PM-2.5 has been utilized in Equation 7.
      •     BC and OC are estimated using the speciation factors for the two pollutants.
      •     It has been assumed in this report that the BC contribution to PM2.5 is 60 percent for the larger,
            newer gensets found in the construction and telecommunications sectors and for the smaller
            (and some larger but new) gensets in the telecommunications sector. For all the other sectors,
            where older gensets are predominant (e.g. industrial, residential, and so forth), BC
            contributions of 40 percent have been assumed. For OC, the contribution to PM2.5 is 30 percent
            for newer gensets and 45 percent for smaller and bigger (but older) gensets. This simple
            assumption has been used due to the poor information on the age of the diesel genset stocks in
            most user sectors.

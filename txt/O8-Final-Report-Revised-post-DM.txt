1   PURPOSE

    1. Brazil’s National Water Agency (ANA), entrusted in mid-2011 with a new
       mandate of regulating authority for the safety of multipurpose dams on federal
       rivers i , requested that the World Bank provide technical assistance (TA) to
       support it in taking up this new responsibility. ANA approached The World Bank
       given its experience with dam related investments and capacity strengthening
       worldwide.

    2. Three scoping missions were undertaken (August 2011, November 2011 and
       May 2012) to agree with ANA on the terms of reference of a Reimbursable
       Analytical and Advisory Services (RAS) on dam safety. Subsequently, in July
       2012, a legal agreement between ANA and the World Bank was signed for TA
       and capacity strengthening, encompassing a continuous period of three years
       (July 2012-June 2015).

    3. The objective of the Technical Assistance was to provide technical support to
       ANA to:
        implement the Dam Safety Law, through the development of norms,
          standards, regulations, guidelines and manuals;
        design of the National Dam Safety Information System (SNISB);
        provide capacity strengthening in dam safety inspections; reporting; and
          communication of findings to the authorities and the public, and
        provide capacity strengthening and training to ANA, and its key partners, on
          dam safety management.

    4. Additionally, the RAS had the objective of pre-assessing the capacity of ANA to
       take on the new madate assigned by the Law as well as other insitutions at
       federal and states levels that received new responsibilities and need to interact
       with ANA in its function as coordinator of SNISB. Before completion of the
       RAS contract, the Bank made an evaluation of how the country and ANA
       specifically have advanced in the implementation of the Law over the past years
       and since the beginning of Bank’s support. The methodology applied for the
       evaluation is presented in section 4.2 of this report.

    5. This internal completion report aims to inform World Bank management and
       interested colleagues about the RAS provided to ANA, the main Client, which
       requested analytical, advisory, and convening services to support the agency in
       the implementation of its mandates given by Brazil’s 2010 Dam Safety Law.

    6. The second section of this report provides the rationale for the request for
       technical assistance (TA) by ANA. The third section describes the Dam Safety
       RAS (henceforth referred to as ‘the Project’) in terms of objectives, type of
       analytical and advisory services, the composition of the Bank team, as well as the
       different partners involved.

7. The fourth section summarizes the main deliverables provided to ANA during
   the period of the Project (October 2012-February 2015). It is important to note
   that most of the deliverables are written in Portugueseii. All of them are available
   in WBDocs. This report and its annexes are written in English and provide only a
   brief summary of each deliverable. The fifth section presents the main
   conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations for ANA, other key
   stakeholders involved in dam safety, and for the World Bank Group.

8. Finally, the annexes provide: (i) RAS Chronogram, (ii) Bank Team at Design and
   Implementation, (iii) The RAS in numbers, (iv) List of RAS Products and
   corresponding level of effort, (v) List of missions, (vi) List of Client Team
   Members, and (vii) List of States and Institutions involved in the RAS.

2   SECTOR AND CLIENT CONTEXT

    9. Brazil is a presidentialist federative republic, constituted by the union, 26 states,
       1 federal district and 5561 municipalities, each one with its own government.
       Although Brazil is considered to be rich in water availability, having 12 per cent
       of the world’s fresh water availability, this availability significantly differs from
       one region to another. Furthermore, there are important seasonal variations, and
       problems of water supply for different uses. These problems result, mainly, from
       high demands in relation to the availability and poor water quality due to
       pollution (ANA, 2007). Regarding water use distribution among sectors, the
       irrigation represents 69 per cent of the total water demand (ANA, 2007). The
       remaining 31 per cent is divided among urban supply (11 per cent), animal needs
       (11 per cent), industrial uses (7 per cent) and rural supply (2 per cent).

    10. Water resources authority, according to the 1988 Federal Constitution, is divided
        between the union and the states. Also, ‘lakes, rivers and any other streams in its
        lands of domain, or which flow through more than one state, or are boundaries
        with other countries’1 belong to the union. Water resources management in Brazil
        is compared to the management of international transboundary river basins.
        Therefore, all federative levels need to work cooperatively in order to overcome
        conflictual intergovernmental relations and achieve integrated water resources
        management.

    11. The National Water Resources Policy of Brazil, established by the Water Law in
        January 1997, aims to ensure adequate water availability for present and future
        generations, as well as to prevent and protect against critical hydrological events,
        through rational and integrated water resources management. The Law has
        established five management instruments to support the implementation of
        National Policy. These are river basin plans, water quality classification, water
        permits, water use charges, and information systems.




2.1 The importance of dams for Brazil’s society
    12. Dams have been built in Brazil mostly since the last quarter of the 19 th century to
        supply water for various purposes: initially for human and livestock consumption
        in the Northeast region to mitigate the impact of drought, and progressively to
        promote the development of irrigated agriculture and the production of
        hydroelectricity throughout the country. Figure 1 shows the importance of dams
        for Brazil: over 13,000 dams, of which 11,748 for multiple purposes and 1,261
        exclusively for the production of hydroelectricity. The latter account for nearly
        67% of the total installed capacity in the country. A small number of dams are
        designed to contain industrial wastes, and over 600 dams for piling up mining
        tailings. Notwithstanding the benefits that dams provide to society at large, the


                                                                                 Page 3 de 41
     risks that dam failures pose to human lives, the economy, and the environment
     cannot be overlooked.


                        Total - 13,529 dams

                                                                                           Licensing Authorities

2.2 The Dam Safety Law
  13. Before 2010, no dam safety legislation existed in Brazil, at either the federal or
      state level. The Law 12.334 of September 20, 2010 (henceforth referred to as
      ‘Dam Safety Law’, or ‘The Law’) became the landmark legislation in the field of
      dam safety. It establishes the National Dam Safety Policy (PNSB, by its
      Portuguese acronym); defines which dams should be regulatediii; assigns legal
      responsibility for dam safety to the owner of the dam; creates the National Dam
      Safety Information System (SNISB, by its Portuguese acronym); and assigns
      regulatory authority to specific institutions.

  14. The fundamental principles of the National Dam Safety Policy are:

         the safety of the dam must be taken into consideration at the following stages:
          planning, design, construction, first fill and spill, operation, decommissioning
          and future uses;




                                                                                         Page 4 de 41
      the population must be informed and encouraged to participate either directly
       or indirectly in preventive and emergency activities;
      the dam owner is legally responsible for dam safety and must take the
       appropriate measures to guarantee it;
      to promote social participation and control mechanisms, and
      the safety of a dam has a direct influence on its sustainability and on the
       extent of its potential social and environmental effects.

15. The Dam Safety Law highlights the fact that the dam owner is responsible for the
    dam safety; this implies its regular inspection and the production of the pertinent
    documentation, as well as the implementation of the recommendations deriving
    from them.

16. The Brazilian regulatory framework on dam safety is quite fragmented. The
    implementation and enforcement of the Law is a responsibility of the federation,
    the states, and the federal district:

           1.      Dams destined for multiple uses, where hydro-electricity is not the
           main use, must be regulated by ANA, if they are situated on federal
           rivers. If they are situated on state rivers (i.e., rivers that remain within
           state boundaries), they must be regulated by the water resources
           management authority of the same state;

           2.     Dams where hydro-electricity is the main use must be regulated by
           the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency, ANEEL;

           3.      Tailing dams used in the mining industry must be regulated by the
           Brazilian Mining Licensing Authority, DNPM;

           4.      Industrial waste dams must be regulated by the environmental
           licensing authority (i.e. IBAMA at federal level, and the state
           environmental authority at state level).

17. This totals forty-seven dam safety regulating entities, and thus implies a
    challenging and complex institutional and administrative framework (Figure 2), ,
    which poses a huge challenge: to build compatible regulations and proceduresiv.
    In addition, the division of dams among state and federal regulators is quite
    uneven. States, which have fewer resources, are responsible to regulate a larger
    number of dams (see Figure 1).

2.3 The National Water Agency
  18. The National Water Agency (ANA) was created in 2000 as a government agency
      under a special regime, with financial and administrative autonomy, linked to the
      Ministry of Environment. ANA is entrusted with the implementation of the
      National Water Resources Policy established by Law 9.433 of January 1997; it
      authorizes and regulates water uses on federal rivers, and mediates conflicts
      among water users. It has a collegiate Board of Directors composed by five
      members: the Director-President, and four Directors.

  19. The Dam Safety Law places ANA at the center of dam safety regulation, by
      assigning several key responsibilities to it. Firstly, ANA must regulate the safety
      of those multipurpose dams where hydro-electricity is not the main use, on
      federal rivers. This represents over 130 dams (Fig. 3). Secondly, it must promote
      coordination among all dam safety regulators (e.g. to ensure consistency in their
      respective implementation of the Law). Thirdly, it has to design, implement and
      maintain the National Dam Safety Information System (SNISB). Finally, it is
      responsible for elaborating the Annual National Dam Safety Report.

                                               2011)
20. To respond to these new mandates imposed by the Law, ANA created two new
    Departments in 2011: (i) the Department for Regulation of Dam Safety and
    Public Services (GESER), to lead the agency’s efforts on dam safety regulation,
    and (ii) the Department on Monitoring of Dam Safety and Public Services
    (GEFIS), to lead its efforts on dam safety monitoring and enforcement.

21. In 2011, these Departments included a total of about fifteen professionals, many
    of which were newly recruited civil servants that needed capacity strengthening
    and on the job training. That situation was very critical in light of ANA’s very
    low in-house expertise on dam safety. Annex 6 lists the Client staff directly
    involved in the RAS.




                                                                                     Page 7 de 41
2.4 The Client’s request
   22. In 2011, ANA requested the Bank’s technical support to achieve the following
       objectives:

         implement the Dam Safety Law, through the development of norms,
          standards, regulations, guidelines and manuals;
         design of the National Dam Safety Information System (SNISB);
         capacity strengthening in dam safety inspections; reporting; and
          communication of findings to the authorities and the public, and
         capacity strengthening and training to ANA, and its key partners, on dam
          safety management.




2.5 The World Bank’s engagement on dam safety in Brazil
   23. For decades, the Bank has been a long-standing partner of GoB in the water
       sector, and has financed a multitude of projects, both at the federal and the state
       level, with dam components. Through the federal project PROAGUA, for
       example, the Bank has helped to provide adequate TA for the planning,
       construction and maintenance of dams, and to elaborate adequate operation and
       maintenance procedures, training of staff in dam surveillance, and elaboration of
       emergency preparedness plans, among others.

   24. At the time of ANA’s request, the Bank had a worldwide portfolio of over 110
       projects with a significant dam component, several of which focused on
       strengthening the client's dam safety regulatory framework and human capacity
       on risk assessment and dam safety. Countries like China, India and Indonesia had
       benefited from the Bank's technical and financial expertise to help design and
       implement specific dam safety projects, which were viewed to provide
       potentially valuable lessons for Brazil. The Bank's analytical work on dam
       safety, including the multi-country comparative analysis of dam safety regulatory
       frameworks v , was also considered of great value added. Finally, the Bank’s
       collaboration with US government agencies specialized in dam safety such as the
       US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was also seen as a great plus by the
       Client.




                                                                               Page 8 de 41
3   THE DAM SAFETY RAS



3.1 Design of the RAS
    25. The Bank responded to the Client’s request by proposing a Reimbursable
        Analytical and Advisory Services (RAS). This RAS was designed as a
        comprehensive, medium-term (three years) TA program led by the Bank, to help
        ANA take up its mandates given by the Dam Safety Law and increase the
        capacity of its staff.

    26. However, considering that at the time, hardly any RASs had been implemented
        in Brazil, the team had few or no lessons learned to take into account in the
        design of this RAS, in particular on the scope and extent of Bank participation,
        and risks.

    27. The RAS was designed around three Components:

          Component 1: Project Inception. This included (i) a detailed work plan, and
           (ii) an institutional assessment of ANA and a few other key dam safety
           regulators, which would serve as a baseline for the RAS, and to design the
           necessary capacity strengthening and training activities.

          Component 2: Dam safety tools and instruments. This was the core of the
           technical expertise provided by the RAS on topics such as: (i) dam
           classification, (ii) design of the SNISB, (iii) dam safety management
           (regulation, manuals, guidelines), and (iv) annual reporting.

          Component 3: Capacity strengthening and training. This referred to technical
           support to ANA’s staff and included: (i) quality review of regulations drafted
           by ANA, (ii) revision of reports produced by dam owners and operators, (iii)
           support to dam safety inspections, and (iv) specialized training to ANA and
           its key partners.

    28. It was implicit that a large part of the RAS would be contracted out, and have to
        be supervised by the core Bank team: (i) most of Component 2, to an
        international consultancy firm specialized in dam safety; and (ii) the training part
        of Component 3, to specialized government agencies such as the US Army Corps
        of Engineers (USACE). The remaining part would be carried out by either Bank
        staff, national and international individual experts, and consultancy firms, under
        the guidance of the core Bank team.

    29. A total of fifteen deliverables or products were defined (Fig. 4). They can be
        distinguished in four types: (i) dam safety manuals and guidelines, to be used by


                                                                                 Page 9 de 41
         ANA, but also to serve as a countrywide reference for dam safety regulating
         entities, dam owners and operators, engineers and technicians; (ii) technical
         reports, for ANA’s use mainly, such as the conceptual design of the SNISB, and
         the institutional assessment on dam safety; (iii) the design and organization of
         workshops, for ANA and its key partners, and the corresponding workshop
         reports; and (iv) the design and organization of high level trainings, for ANA
         and its key partners, and corresponding training material and report.

3.2 RAS processing
   30. The RAS was processed using the former guidelines for fee-based services (FBS)
       in the LCR region. The overhead applied to the costs was negotiated down from
       the standard 50% to 35% of total costs. The contract amount was US$ 3,640,537
       including overhead. The legal agreement was drafted exclusively in Portuguese,
       and signed by the Bank’s Country Director and ANA’s Director-President.
       Bank’s resource management advised to limit the number of payments: a total of




                                                                                                      Page 10 de 41
       seven payments were included in the legal agreement, ranging from 5% to 30%
       of the contract amount per payment.




3.3 RAS Team
   31. The RAS team at design was a reduced team of four Bank staff. The contribution
       of the Bank’s then Lead Dam Specialist, Alessandro Palmieri, was essential in
       shaping the design of the Project, both on content and the required overall team
       composition for the implementation phase. The Bank’s core team was formed by
       two co-TTLs based in Brasilia, Erwin De Nys and Paula Freitas, and a YP
       providing support from DC during the first year of the Project, Richard
       Abdulnour. At early implementation, the core team was complemented with the
       hiring of an ETC based in Brasilia and fully dedicated to the Project, Inês
       Persechini.

   32. At implementation, the RAS team grew substantially with the hiring of: (i) STCs,
       (ii) the international consortium COBA (Brazil) - LNEC (Portugal), selected
       through ICB for a contract amount over US$ 1.4 million, and (iii) USACE-
       USGS. The core team strongly relied on the Bank’s program assistants to help
       with the heavy logistics of the RAS (i.e. high number of missions, VCs,
       workshops and trainings, contract management, etc.). Ad-hoc support was
       provided by several Bank colleagues on several technical issues, including
       quality review.

   33. The RAS involved a large and diverse team, with an estimated total level of
       effort of 208 man-months over the three years of its implementation. This
       corresponds, on average, to 1.5 Bank staff working with a team of six specialists,
       continuously dedicated to this TA.

4   RESULTS


    34. This chapter provides a brief description of the main results of the RAS. The first
        part of it deals with the main outputs, e.g. reports, which were requested by and
        delivered to the Client. It summarizes the content of each report, its utility for the
        Client and its partners. The second part goes beyond the output level and
        describes outcomes and impacts; in other words, the institutional change that the
        RAS activities have brought about, in terms of the Client’s people, procedures
        and policies related to dam safety. The next steps taken by the Client, as well as
        the extent to which the Bank’s advice has been incorporated in its planning and
        routine activities, are also described in this second part.




4.1 Outputs
    35. The knowledge and data generated by the RAS are captured in the form of a
        large amount of reports; a total of 25 have been delivered to the Client, with an
        average of 75 pages main text and 150 pages annexes. They are described below
        in only a few words, along the main lines of the analytical and advisory services
        provided: (i) institutional assessment of ANA, (ii) classification of dams, (iii)
        National Information System on Dam Safety, and (iv) Annual Report on Dam
        Safety. The convening services provided by the RAS through trainings and
        workshops are also briefly presented. The detailed list of reports, with their
        respective level of effort, can be found in Annex 4.

       4.1.1   Institutional assessment

    36. The institutional assessment (IA) represented the baseline of the Project. It was
        undertaken by a team of three individual short-term consultants (i.e., water
        resources engineer and lawyer, dam safety specialist, and IT specialist). Its main
        objective was to evaluate ANA’s capacity to deliver on the mandates imposed by
        the Dam Safety Law, and provide recommendations on institutional
        strengthening. The evaluation also covered other dam safety regulators at federal
        level (i.e. ANEEL, IBAMA, and DNPM) and state level (i.e. six states out of
        twenty-seven); as well as four large dam owners/ operators (i.e. DNOCS,
        CODEVASF, CAESB, COGERH)vi.

    37. The IA highlights the lack of sufficient workforce qualified to carry out the
        inspections (e.g. regular inspections, periodic reviews) and documentation (e.g.
        dam safety plans, emergency action plans) required by the Dam Safety Law as a
        major bottleneck, both within ANA as for the major part of the dam safety
        regulators, and owners/ operators. There is a deficiency of mid-career engineers,


                                                                                  Page 12 de 41
   calling for long term capacity strengthening and training efforts to reduce this
   gap on the labor market.

38. The IA recommends strengthening ANA’s articulation role: internally among the
    different departments in ANA involved directly and indirectly with dams;
    externally, with the other dam safety regulators, as well as the entities of the
    National Protection and Civil Defense System. It also highlights the need to
    secure sufficient financial resources at federal and state level, in order to address
    priority dams in high risk conditions, and to undertake the rehabilitation and
    modernization of dams required to guarantee their safety.

39. On the side of the dam owners, the IA points to a different degree of
    implementation of the Dam Safety Law according to the revenue produced. The
    wealthier dam owners, such as hydropower (with a long tradition in Brazil) and
    mining, are more advanced in the implementation of dam safety procedures, and
    therefore, have a higher level of compliance. On the other hand, multiple use
    dams, which encompass irrigation and water supply, are owned by either public
    agencies or small entrepreneurs. They usually do not have the sufficient
    resources (human and financial) to comply with the requirements of the Dam
    Safety Law.

   4.1.2   Classification of Dams

40. The RAS supported ANA in classifying the dams it has to regulate, as required
    by the dam safety law. Seven professionals from LNEC/COBA and two quality
    reviewers provided this technical support. The work consisted in, firstly,
    applying the generic guidelines issued by a resolution of the National Water
    Resources Council (CNRH) for all dams (i.e. hydro-electric, multi-purpose,
    tailing dams etc.) in Brazil (henceforth the ‘CNRH guidelines’) to the universe of
    dams that ANA is responsible forvii.

41. The CNRH guidelines consist in classifying a dam according to its risk and
    potential hazard, and results in five classes (A to E) according to Table 2. The
    risk category is evaluated according to several parameters, including: (i)
    technical characteristics of the dam, (ii) conservation state of the dam, and (iii)
    the availability of key documents such as the dam safety plan. Potential hazard is
    based on the impacts resulting from a possible dam breach, defined as: (i) loss of
    life, (ii) environmental losses, and (iii) economic losses. A punctuation system
    taking into account the weight of the different parameters determines whether the
    risk and potential hazard categories are classified as low, medium or high.

42. Depending on the classification of the dam, the dam owner/ operator must
    comply with a series of obligations, such as the presentation of a dam safety plan,
    the dam safety emergency action plan, and frequency of inspection visits.




                                                                             Page 13 de 41

             Dam classification                  Potential hazard category

                                               High           Medium           Low
             Risk             High                A               B             C
           category
                             Medium               A               C             D
                              Low                 A               C             E


43. The application of the CNRH guidelines to the universe of dams regulated by
    ANA resulted in classifying all dams as high potential hazard (in other words,
    category A, see dark blue column in Table 3). One reason for this is the high
    weight given by the CNRH guidelines to loss of life: one person living
    downstream of the dam and potentially affected by a dam failure is sufficient to
    classify the dam as high potential hazard.

44. The Client then requested a critical analysis of the generic CNRH guidelines, in
    order to make them more specific to the multi-purpose dams regulated by ANA.
    This resulted in a modified dam classification method, incorporating additional
    criteria, adjusting weight factors, etc. The interesting finding is that when this
    modified classification method was applied to ANA’s dams, the final result was
    not significantly different. This is mainly related to lack of information (e.g.
    absent dam documentation; poor satellite imagery to estimate downstream
    impacts). That results in a high punctuation of the different parameters and,
    ultimately, a high risk and potential hazard category. Hence, a major




                                                                                       Page 14 de 41
   recommendation to ANA was to enhance the available information in order to
   fine-tune the dam classification results in the future.

45. Consequently, ANA communicated the results of the dam classification to some
    of the corresponding dam owners/ operators, and the implications for them. The
    method defined by the RAS will likely be replicated both by ANA to other dams.
    ANA will also make this methodology available to other dam safety regulating
    entities.

46. The dam classification method and its application to ANA’s dams are described
    in detail in two comprehensive reports viii . It includes the methodology for
    estimating the downstream area affected by a possible dam break, the
    presentation of estimated downstream inundation maps and associated impacts
    for each of the dams regulated by ANA. A key input to the discussions on dam
    classification was formed by an overview of national and international (e.g.
    Argentina, Spain, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Portugal, USA)
    best practices on dam classificationix. The latter was prepared by an expert of the
    US Army Corps of Engineers, entity hired by the Bank to provide institutional
    support and specialized trainings (see section 4.1.6).

47. The overview presents the results of the application of CNRH classification
    criteria, and proposed modified classification system, according to the risk
    category and potential associated damage (DPA). Emphasis was put on the
    sources and analysis of the quality of the available information, as well as to a
    critical analysis of the results of the classification, resulting in the proposition of
    some additional criteria. The methodology application was systematized for the
    sake of avoiding subjectivity in as much as possible. The results include the data
    to be incorporated in the National System Dam Safety Information (SNISB).

   4.1.3   Dam Safety Manuals

48. The client requested analytical and advisory support in the elaboration of
    manuals intended to help different audiences involved with or having
    responsibility for the safety of dams to comply with the Dam Safety Law. Three
    main audiences were targeted: (i) ANA and other regulatory entities, (ii) dam
    owners and operators, engineers, technicians, and water resource managers, and
    (iii) individuals involved with or having responsibility for the safety of small
    dams. Seventeen professionals from LNEC/COBA and four quality reviewers
    provided this technical support.

49. The Policy and Practice Manual for ANA and Regulatory Entitiesx explains
    the role of ANA, as well as other dam safety regulators, in the implementation of
    the National Dam Safety Policy. It covers the main procedures to be developed
    by such entities, relating to: register of dams, classification, regulation,
    enforcement, procedures in case of emergency, preparation of the annual dam
    safety report, use of the National Information System on Dam Safety (SNISB),


                                                                               Page 15 de 41
   education and communication, and evaluation of institutional performance. The
   content of this manual considered international and national best practices on
   dam safety regulation and functions of regulatory entities.

50. The Policy and Practice Manual for Dam Operatorsxi provides guidance to
    dam owners and operators to comply with the dam safety legislation, in
    particular their obligation to provide regulators with a Dam Safety Plan. This
    manual consists of four volumes, referring to the emergency action plans
    (Volume I), the safety inspections (Volume II), the periodic review of dam safety
    (Volume III), and a set of standard terms of references designed to assist the dam
    owner/ operator to contract special professional services (Volume IV). The latter
    terms of reference provide guidance to the dam owners on the contracting of
    external expertise to: prepare the emergency action plan, carry out the regular
    inspection of dam safety, special inspection of dam safety and periodic review of
    dam safety.

51. The Orientation Manual for Dam Operators xii provides guidance to dam
    owners and operators on best practices along the various stages of the dam life
    cycle, namely, planning and design; construction and first filling; operation and
    decommissioning. It consists of three volumes: preparation of the dam project
    (Volume I), construction (Volume II), and operation and maintenance, and dam
    instrumentation (Volume III). The latter guides the operator to: (i) develop a
    manual of procedures, (ii) plan safety inspections, maintenance and monitoring,
    and (iii) elaborate a dam safety report; and (iv) establish and record operating
    rules of the dam discharge devices and all other records that are part of the Dam
    Safety Plan. The audience of these manuals consists not only of dam operators,
    but also construction companies, project designers, technicians responsible for
    the elaboration of the Dam Safety Plan, and more generally, individuals and
    institutions involved in dam safety issues.

52. The Safety Manual for Small Damsxiii aims at providing guidance to operators
    and owners of small dams on the different operations that need to be carried out
    during the different stages of the life cycle of the dam. Small dams are minor
    dams which do not meet the criteria established by the Dam Safety Law; they are
    generally of small size and mostly located in rural areas. Safety conditions of
    small dams are generally less than satisfactory due to several reasons, including
    lack of appropriate design and engineering standards in construction. Lack of
    adequate operation and maintenance is also another typical problem, due both to
    lack of funds and to an inadequate safety management. International experience,
    including in Brazil, shows that the number of incidents peaks in this class of
    dams. Albeit ANA is not legally bound to regulate such dams, the Bank advised
    it to look at strategic options for managing risk associated with the non-regulated
    dams, and play a protagonist role on this matter. This manual contains




                                                                            Page 16 de 41
   information similar to the Orientation Manual for Dam Operators, but in a more
   simplified and more user-friendly language.

53. The above manuals benefited from comments made by a restricted audience of
    regulators (e.g. ANA, ANEEL) and operators (e.g. DNOCS, CODEVASF), as
    well as by the quality reviewers hired by the Bank, before delivering them to the
    Client. Subsequently, the Client submitted the Orientation Manual for Dam
    Operators for a public consultation, with the intention to make them available
    publicly; ANA aims to follow a similar process for all the other manuals.

   4.1.4   The National Information System on Dam Safety

54. The National Information System on Dam Safety (SNISB) is a computerized
    platform that aims to record and report on the safety conditions of regulated
    dams throughout the country, and allow monitoring the progress of
    implementation of the National Dam Safety Policy. It is one of the main
    instruments of the National Dam Safety Policy, with ANA being responsible for
    its design, implementation and management.

55. Its basic principles are: (i) decentralization of data and information production
    and input, (ii) unified coordination of the system, and (iii) access to information
    to society. The responsibility for keeping the information available and updated
    in the SNISB belongs to the regulatory entities, either federal or state, which are
    responsible for ensuring that dam owners comply with the dam safety
    regulations. Dam owners/ operators will be the main source of information to the
    system.

56. The RAS supported ANA with the design of the SNISB. Three professionals
    from LNEC/COBA and two quality reviewers provided this technical support.
    The work adopted a strategy based on a modular concept, prioritizing the
    following modules: (i) entities (i.e. regulator or owner/ operator), (ii) dam
    register, (iii) dam classification, (iv) dam safety plan, (v) extreme events, and (vi)
    dam safety report. The RAS outputs consisted of detailed technical
    specifications, so-called use cases, and a prototype of the SNISBxiv; the next step
    being the hiring of a specialized software engineering firm by ANA to develop
    the SNISB as an operational software product. It must be noted that the IT
    assessment that was made as part of the institutional baseline of the Project,
    provided substantial input to the design of the SNISB.

57. Once implemented, the SNISB will consist of a national register of dams in
    Brazil, which consolidates the registers of all dam safety regulatory entities
    throughout the country (Figure 5). The system will comprise the collection,
    processing, storage and retrieval of information and should include dams under
    construction, in operation and decommissioned. It will serve key functions such
    as: (i) support ANA’s elaboration of the annual dam safety report, (ii) help dam
    safety regulatory entities in their regulation and enforcement tasks, and (iii)


                                                                              Page 17 de 41
   allowing communication with civil society about the safety conditions of
   regulated dams across the country. It will be accessible through ANA’s website.




     Figure 5. The SNISB and its relation with the different dam safety regulatory entities. (Source:
            Produto 11: Sistema Nacional de Informações sobre Segurança de Barragens).

   4.1.5    The Annual Dam Safety Report

58. The Dam Safety Annual Report is a key instrument of the National Dam Safety
    Policy, to track, monitor, promote and influence its implementation countrywide.
    The Dam Safety Law provides that it is up to ANA to annually coordinate its
    preparation, and the National Water Resources Council to analyze it for its
    subsequent submission to the National Congress. ANA coordinates the
    preparation of the Report, based on the information received from all other dam
    safety regulatory entities. The production of the Report should be managed
    through the SNISB, once operational.

59. ANA requested the Bank’s technical support to help it with a critical analysis of
    the first (2011) annual dam safety report, and recommendations for
    improvement. Four professionals from LNEC/COBA and one quality reviewer
    provided the necessary technical support, which resulted in the following RAS
    outputs: (i) a template of annual dam safety report, (ii) forms to be filled out by
    dam regulating entities, and (iii) forms to be filled out by dam owners/ operators,
    which will eventually be linked to the SNISB and the annual reportxv.

   4.1.6    Specialized Trainings

60. The Client requested different institutional strengthening activities, which
    included: (i) training of ANA staff, other regulators, and dam owners/ operators,
    (ii) support ANA with dam inspections, and (iii) support ANA with the quality
    review of documents submitted by dam owners.



                                                                                         Page 18 de 41
61. The RAS team mobilized world’s top experts and trainers from the US Army
    Corps of Engineers (USACE) and US Geological Survey (USGS). Three one-
    week trainings were conducted on the following topics: (i) introduction to dam
    safety management (May 2013), (ii) potential failure mode analysis (May 2014),
    and (iii) mapping, modeling, and evaluation of consequences of dam failure
    (February 2015) xvi . Each training involved five expert trainers from USACE-
    USGS, and in terms of participants, about seventy professionals involved with or
    having responsibility for the safety of dams, from different states and entities in
    Brazil. While being extremely intensive in terms of workload for the RAS team
    (e.g. technical preparation; logistics; translation of over 5,000 PowerPoint slides,
    etc.), those trainings proved to be extremely valuable in terms of knowledge
    generation and learning, as well as for the perceived leadership by ANA (with
    Bank support) to convene this type of high-level and innovative trainings in
    Brazil and make it available to its partners.

62. The RAS team invested heavily in training a team of translators-interpreters and
    getting them acquainted with the technical language of dam safety, to secure
    their participation throughout the RAS.

63. The institutionalization of these trainings is still a pending issue within ANA that
    requires attention.




                  Figure 6. Training on dam safety provided by the USACE-USGS




                                                                                Page 19 de 41
   4.1.7   Dam Safety Panel of Experts

64. To help ANA with dam inspections, the RAS team contracted a national
    consultancy firm, Sociedade de Engenheiros Especializados em Segurança de
    Barragens (S2eSB), to act as dam safety panel. This panel of experts was
    mobilized for five dams, at ANA’s request, after its safety monitoring team had
    detected serious anomalies. The support of the panel (two to three engineers
    mobilized for each inspection) consisted of field inspections as well as evaluation
    of dam related documents. It eventually resulted in a robust technical assessment
    by ANA, with corresponding alerts and required remedial actions to the dam
    operators and/ or regulatory entities with view to secure the safety of the damsxvii.

65. The institutionalization of the dam safety panel is still a pending issue within
    ANA that requires attention.

   4.1.8   Convening services

66. At the Client’s request, the Bank involved other partners at federal and sub-
    national level, both during the trainings as well as during four workshops
    organized to present and validate the key RAS products (i.e. dam classification,
    SNISB design, manuals). Eleven federal entities were involved, including
    Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL), Departamento Nacional da
    Produção Mineral (DNPM), Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas
    (DNOCS), and the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos
    Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA); and the dam owners and operators:
    Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas (DNOCS) and Companhia de
    Desenvolvimento dos Vales do São Francisco e do Paranaíba (CODEVASF).

67. Twenty-eight sub-national entities were involved, from 19 (out of 26) states and
    the federal district (Fig. 6). These include, for example, the dam owner and
    operator Companhia de Gestão dos Recursos Hídricos do Estado do Ceará
    (COGERH), as well as the regulating entities of the states of Rio Grande do
    Norte, Paraíba, Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The full list of
    states and institutions involved in the trainings and workshops is presented in
    Annex 7.




                                                                             Page 20 de 41

4.2 Outcomes
  68. The core team intended to capture outcomes and impacts of the RAS, at key
      moments of the 3-year partnership with ANA: one year after implementation,
      and near the end of the contract. A special mission led by Alessandro Palmieri
      (in 2013 as Bank staff, in 2015 as consultant) aimed to undertake a rapid
      assessment of the evolution of ANA’s capacity to implement the DS law, by
      looking at the progresses in terms of: technologies and instruments, policies,
      practices, resources, norms, and information, as well as how those interact to
      support ANA’s governance of dam safety.



                                                                                        Page 21 de 41
69. The methodology used consisted of a succinct analysis during a one week
    mission, based on semi-structured interviews with key ANA high level
    management as well as professionals involved in dam safety. The missions
    helped to identify ANA’s major achievements and next generation challenges,
    and provide strategic recommendations and priorities on institutional
    development, with view to sustain the results achieved by ANA on dam safety
    over the last five years.

70. In an effort to look into outcomes, progress of the implementation of the national
    dam safety policy up to March 2015 has been assessed around three strategic
    pillars: (i) Infrastructure, (ii) Institutions, and (iii) Information. Table 4 lists the
    essential elements for each of the “ 3 Is?.

                    implement fixes at problem dams;
                    make SNISB operational.

73. The following activities represent Ongoing Tasks:

                   Staffing and capacity building; training in emergency handling in
            particular.
                   Preparing "Risk Profiles" of dam portfolios and monitor
            progressive reduction (see example below from Armenia Dam Safety
            Project, Figure X).

    74. ‘New tasks’ requiring attention:

                         Mobilize financial resources for staffing, inspections, dam
                  classification, implementation of urgent fixes.
                         Engineering approval of new dam projects.

    75. The essential elements used in the assessment may be seen as variables
        influencing effective implementation of the reforms associated with the Law.
        The importance of a variable in a system cannot be determined from the variable
        itself, but only through its relationship with the other variables. Cross impact
        analysis (CIA)1 permits to identify and analyze such relationships. The following
        graph shows the results of the analysis.




1
  CIA uses a matrix which provides a simple means to estimate this relationship among variables on a
step-by-step basis. The effect of each variable on all the others is estimated by allocating to each
relationship an intensity of the impact with a value between 0 and 3. The range is from 0 (no impact) to 3
(for strong impact). The question is: if variable A is changed, to what degree is variable B affected
(regardless of whether the change is positive or negative)? By building the sum of rows (“active sum?)
and the sum of columns (“reactive sum?), the variable can be classified as critical/ inert (for their degree of
participation in the vents) and active/ reactive (degree of dominance).




                                                                                                 Page 24 de 41

                       program (Source: Alessandro Palmieri, mission report 2015).


   76. The following categories of variables can be identified:

                     Active variables, which affect all the others strongly, but are not
              changed by them; active variables provide good leverage for change in a
              system.
                     Reactive variables, which leave low impact on others, but are
              themselves highly affected by changes of the other variables.
                     Critical variables, which have strong impact on other and are
              themselves strongly affected.
                     Inert or buffering variables, which neither have an impact on
              others nor are they themselves strongly affected; these are stabilizing
              forces in the system.

   77. In our case, dam safety tools, i.e. developing and disseminating dam safety
       management tools, features as the only Active element. That confirms the
       validity of the effort placed in the RAS on Component 2 (Dam Safety Tools and
       Instruments).

78. Staffing, financing, capacity building, safety inspections, and fixing problem dams
    emerge as critical elements. Addressing such elements should be the priority in the
    future steps of the national dam safety program.

5   LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



5.1 For the Government of Brazil
    79. Define highest priority dams and needs for immediate repairs and
        maintenance. In spite of the technological advances experimented in various
        sectors of the Brazilian economy involved with dam planning, design,
        construction and operation, maintenance of the majority of the existing dams is
        still considered as insufficient to insure long-term sustainability and efficient
        uses of the water resources. With the exception of the electrical sector which
        conducts coordinated operation and proper maintenance procedures of the
        hydropower generating facilities, the remainder as a general rule lacks systematic
        procedures and regulating legal instruments.

    80. The need for adequate maintenance and prompt repairs of dams for the sake
        of protection and effectiveness of public and private investments made to supply
        enough water to the society cannot be stressed enough. This issue should be
        properly addressed by the federal government and at subnational level and by the
        private sector. Out of nearly 14,000 dams identified in several existing data bases
        in the country, around 14% belong or are under the jurisdiction of the federal
        entities. Most of these dams were built and operated for power generation, but
        have some marginal use for other purposes. Also, some tailings dams resulting
        from mining activity are overviewed by the federal government. In general, it
        appears from the information available so far that the power and tailings dams
        are gradually being controlled according to the terms of the National Dam Safety
        Policy. However, there is a significant number of multipurpose dams under
        federal responsibility that still require measures to bring them in compliance with
        the Dam Safety Law.

    81. The remainder, actually the majority (86%) of the existing multipurpose dams,
        belong or are under the jurisdiction of the federal district and 26 states of the
        federation. It appears from the small sample considered in present studies that
        those that are adequately kept still constitute the exception rather than the general
        rule due to several reasons, a situation that is bound to change as the Law
        enforcement gets the attention of owners and entities in charge of overviewing.

    82. It is fair to consider that Brazil’s Dam Safety Program is a “young one?.
        Five years (i.e. since the publication of the Dam Safety Law in 2010) is still a
        short time period to achieve effective results on dam safety. It is also fair to say
        that most of the countries where such programs have been initiated 20 or more
        years ago, such as to be considered “mature?, are not there yet in terms of fully
        satisfactory outcomes. In such situation, Brazil should make sure that priority



                                                                                 Page 26 de 41
   actions are implemented first. This refers in particular to those dams which are in
   urgent need of structural fixes. Probability of failure of modern dams, built and
   operated according to good engineering practice, is less than 10-5 per dam per
   year. With a portfolio of 14,000 dams, that probability gives a rate of failure of
   0,14 dams/year (or 1 to 2 dams every ten years). Considering that several dams in
   the portfolio are “less than modern?, the rate is conceivably higher. To identify
   priority dams in need of structural fixes, Dam Classification should focus on
   “technical characteristics? (part 1) and “status of conservation? (part 2).

83. Strengthen institutional coordination with view to reach water security. As
    water security is calling increased attention of authorities and the private sector,
    it seems reasonable to recommend that coordination of related public policies be
    strengthened. Indeed, for example, some steps are being taken by the federal
    government to establish a national water security program based on the
    development of water storage and transfer facilities. Along with this initiative,
    taking care and improving the existing water infrastructure, including dams and
    their sustainability and safety would make all the sense. On the other hand Brazil
    has taken important steps towards disaster prevention and risk management
    which have a lot to do with dam safety. It would be highly desirable that the
    efforts in all these directions be on the focus of the public sector rationale and
    fund allocation.

84. Ensure the necessary financial resources for dam maintenance and dam
    safety. The issue of lack of human and financial resources to take care of the
    extensive portfolio of dams is crucial and should be faced by adequate budgetary
    allocation and by providing capacity to most of the entities involved in the
    business, either the federal ones or the ones at the states level mainly. Again as
    an example, the provision of a federal fund established in the Civil Protection
    and Defense Law could be taken as an idea to develop a similar measure on
    behalf of the dam safety needs. Examples of fund raising programs exists in
    several US States, in particular the West Virginia Dam Safety Rehabilitation
    Revolving Fund Program (www.damsafety.org).

85. Approval of engineering design of new dams and dams under construction.
    Only water concession and environmental permits are granted in Brazil, but
    design quality, including dam safety, is the responsibility of individuals
    confirmed with an assertion of technical responsibility (ART). Individuals are
    reluctant to sign ARTs, main issue being liability. This issue should be addressed
    to bring it in line with international practice which, in addition to the individual
    professionals, envisage the role of institutions and panel of independent experts.

86. Promote skill development on dam safety. As to capacity building, it was
    identified the need to approach universities in order to increase the number of
    courses in the dam safety related sciences to be offered to students and graduated
    professionals. Although dam engineering practice has promoted a steady


                                                                            Page 27 de 41
     development of professional market, it is evident that the Dam Safety Law will
     induce an increasing demand for professionals in all related fields. Some new
     courses are being offered thanks to the initiatives of interested professionals who
     have sought the support of engineering schools to organize them under minimum
     legal requirements. It seems that some kind of official policy and incentives may
     be required to cope with the demand.

  87. Communication to society. Besides, it seems to be appropriate and timely to
      recommend that the Law and the Policy be propagated throughout society in
      order to raise awareness about the issues related to dam safety and risk
      management, since this is one of the objectives of the Dam Safety Policy.

  88. Increase international cooperation on dam safety. Last but not least, it is to be
      mentioned the interest rose by the development of the dam safety theme in Brazil
      in countries like Uruguay, Vietnam, Mexico, Peru and others. Although
      incipient, it certainly represents an opportunity for international cooperation that
      deserves some attention of the Brazilian authorities.




5.2 For ANA
  89. Enhance ANA’s technical excellence and protagonist role on dam safety. The
      technical and managerial capacity of ANA is high and is being well applied in
      the implementation of its duties established by the Dam Safety Law. Besides the
      efforts developed to be in compliance with the Law, ANA took the opportunity
      offered by the present Technical Assistance by the World Bank to develop a
      series of tools that will help all the other entities and dam owners involved in the
      dam safety activities.

  90. Promote a country-wide implementation of the National Dam Safety Policy.
      Taking into account that the universe of dams under ANA’s jurisdiction
      represents a quite small portion of the dams under the jurisdiction of the states’
      entities, it is now the time for ANA to consider strengthening its articulation
      capacity not only with the federal, but mainly with the states entities in order to
      promote coordinated use of the above mentioned tools. Indeed promoting
      homogenous criteria for the dam safety law enforcement in the states, necessarily
      respecting their autonomy to issue dam safety regulations, if they so prefer, is
      something that can facilitate the measures to be taken by owners and
      overviewing entities to comply with the Law, especially when owners are under
      the jurisdiction of more than one overviewing entity.

  91. ANA has an important role in this direction, given its legal competence under
      both the Dam Safety Law and the Water Resources Management Law, and
      should act permanently to promote the involvement of all interested parties.



                                                                              Page 28 de 41
     Indeed in late 2013 ANA launched the PROGESTÃO initiative to provide
     support to the states that adhere to a set of commitments towards the
     strengthening of the water resources and dam safety management. In this respect,
     the initiative of offering capacity building opportunities to the states and other
     federal entities is commendable and should be stressed by ANA in a continuous
     fashion.

  92. Improve dam safety and risk management at the river basin level . Also,
      having as homogeneous procedures as possible, when considering dams in a river
      basin, seems to be something of undisputable convenience in the light of the need
      of minimizing as much as possible the increased risk existing in any dam
      cascade. Since there may be dams of different jurisdiction in a river basin, the
      coordinated action amongst the overviewing entities is not only recommended
      but is already being claimed by some owners. As for example of the need of
      dealing with this issue, one can mention the need of having a coordinated dam
      classification system the yield consistent criteria and results for the whole basin.

  93. Make the SNISB fully operational. The National Dam Safety Information
      System (SNISB) represents a critical task. After the RAS completed the
      conceptual design, the development of the SNISB is ongoing by a national
      consultancy firm hired by ANA. However, if ANA does not give sufficient
      attention to the development and implementation of the SNISB, it is unlikely to
      produce meaningful outputs before a few years. A fully operational SNISB will
      relieve ANA's responsibilities significantly; meanwhile ANA’s ‘exposure’ is
      high.




5.3 For the World Bank Group
  94. Picking strategic themes for RAS engagements. We believe the dam safety
      engagement with ANA has been strategic for the Bank given the importance of
      dams and water resources for Brazil’s economy and the achievement of the
      Bank’s twin goals. The implications of the 2010 Dam Safety Law will require
      huge institutional strengthening and investments at the level of federal and state
      entities, as well as major dam owners/ operators. Business opportunities (both
      analytical and investments) with clients other than ANA may result of this RAS.
      The achievements of the Brazil RAS have generated quite some interest from
      neighboring LAC countries and clients.

  95. The Bank has been utilized for its expertise and convening power, but also
      to deal with all the ‘heavy work’. RAS requests involve complex demands
      from sophisticated clients to help them with building capacity, convene key
      partners, and evaluate pros and cons of different options. At the same time, the
      Bank has also been used by clients to deal with all the burdensome aspects of



                                                                              Page 29 de 41
   procuring and contracting experts, managing large consultancy contracts,
   organizing workshops, editing and formatting reports, etc. This ends up being a
   very heavy workload for the Bank’s Core Team. RASs could be re-thought to
   focus more on the strategic advice as opposed to the operational tasks.

96. A three-year continuous RAS engagement is extremely audacious. Given the
    new contractual relationship Bank-Client that a RAS entails (and even more so if
    the Client is relatively unknown to the Bank), it may be worthwhile to design the
    RAS in phases. A Framework Agreement (i.e. one broad framework agreement,
    with subsequent specific technical annexes to negotiate with the Client) seems a
    promising approach. This allows maturing the RAS relationship and re-thinking
    the commitment over time.

97. Managing the relationship with long-standing partners may become
    delicate. The RAS contract transforms the Bank into a sort of remunerated
    consultancy/ TA provider, at the service of the Client (‘Client is King’). This
    may cause situations and issues that are difficult to manage, especially when the
    RAS Client is also a long-standing partner of the Bank that is also involved in
    other operations (e.g. Bank lending). We need to be aware of perceived conflict
    of interest and communicate our independency in providing advisory and
    analytical services.

98. Defining the engagement as clearly as possible, early on. The Client always
    wants to get more out of the contract, especially when the RAS delivers quality.
    It is thus important to define the engagement and expected deliverables well
    throughout the engagement: in the RAS agreement, financial proposal, detailed
    work plan, mission aide-memoires etc. It is advisable to keep institutional
    memory about the RAS within the client team, as staff turn-over may be an
    important risk.

99. Local expertise is key in complex RASs. Especially for large and complex
    RASs, it is essential to have country-based staff as part of the Bank’s core team
    to lead the dialogue and ensure daily interaction with the client, as well as with
    the consultants, for the whole period of the RAS. Similarly, it is important to
    bring in local experts that are familiar with the country and sector context (e.g.
    institutional, legal etc.) to brief international RAS experts so that they can make
    pertinent and context-specific recommendations to the Client.

100.      Mixed results on quality control. We have been able to ensure an
   adequate quality control on our RAS deliverables, mostly through local and
   international STCs hired for that purpose. The Portuguese language may have
   complicated quality review by Bank staff (all our RAS deliverables are in
   Portuguese). On the dam safety RAS, the Bank lead dam safety specialist has
   come in at specific moments (i.e. once a year) to raise the dialogue at the highest
   level with the Client. On the other hand, we feel there was a lack of quality at



                                                                            Page 30 de 41
   entry by the Bank, e.g. on operational guidance, such as designing the RAs
   engagement, costing tables, etc.

101.       Management is encouraged to reflect on trade-offs of staff time
   invested in RAS. While the RASs represent interesting venues to build or
   strengthen relationships with key clients on innovative topics, and learning
   opportunities for Bank staff, they also imply a work load for TTLs that is
   significantly heavier than for any other Bank product. As mentioned previously,
   this TA required a full-time dedication of 1.5 Bank staff during three years; an
   average of five missions was conducted per year, in addition to the trainings. The
   potential business opportunities and sustainability of results that will come out of
   these RASs will certainly be an important element in this analysis.

102.       More flexibility is needed from Resource Management on payment
   schedules. The Bank puts a lot of pressure on TTLs to bill the client in function
   of the Bank’s fiscal year considerations (e.g. to send invoices in the first half of
   the FY, and avoid payments in the second half). However, several reasons may
   complicate this payment schedule (e.g. Client’s fiscal year is different, delays in
   delivering products for several reasons, large contracts of consultancy firms
   typically cover several years, etc.). Therefore, it would be worthwhile exploring
   more flexibility on payment schedules and avoid the fiscal year restrictions so
   that TTLs can better manage their RAS incomes and expenses.

103.      Risk of contracting out a substantial part of the RAS. When the RAS
   mobilizes an international consultancy firm (in the case of the dam safety, a US$
   1.5m contract of 3 years duration), the Bank assumes the unusual role of both
   contracted entity (by the Client) and contracting entity. It puts a lot of pressure
   on the Bank core team to deliver quality products that respond to the Client’s
   expectations; it requires from the Bank Team a very rigorous selection, and
   subsequent supervision and quality control of the consultancy firm.

104.       Institutionalize a cooperation agreement between USACE and the
   Bank. Despite the exceptional efforts undertaken to hire the services of USACE
   for the Brazil dam safety RAS, this did not materialize because of difficulties
   within the US government entities. The only way the RAS team could resolve
   this was by the Bank hiring USGS, and the latter transferring funds to USACE. It
   is recommended to find a more permanent and institutional mechanism to
   institutionalize this cooperation so that the Bank’s interested client countries can
   benefit from it more easily.

105.      Opportunities for replication and south-south exchange with Brazil.
   Similar dam safety RASs could be implemented primarily in Mexico, Colombia,
   Turkey, Uruguay, and Thailand. Other countries that would strongly benefit from
   capacity strengthening on dam safety include: Indonesia, Vietnam, Russian
   Federation, Iran, Philippines, Malaysia (Borneo), and Morocco.

i
 Multipurpose dams provide services to different water uses such as human consumption, irrigation,
recreational use and hydropower. ANA is the regulating authority for those multipurpose dams that are not
predominantly used for hydropower, on federal rivers. The Constitution indeed establishes a distinction
between federally controlled water, for rivers across state boundaries, and state-controlled water, for rivers
and groundwater that remain completely within state boundaries.
ii
 The only documents in English are: Product 1 – RAS Work plan (87 p), and Product 4 – Dam
Classification: Evaluation of General Criteria, Simplified Methodology for Downstream Flooded Areas
and Guidelines for Classification.
iii
  Dams that satisfy at least one of the following criteria: more than 15m high, reservoir capacity of more
than 3,000,000 m , high or medium hazard, or reservoir containing hazardous substances.
                     3




iv
  As an example, the National Department of Works Against Drought (DNOCS), one of the major public
dam owners, is regulated by ten different entities on dam safety: the water resource authorities of the nine
states of the Northeast, and ANA.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding of how
        stakeholders in Lesotho perceive the WBG;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Lesotho regarding:
             Their views regarding the general environment in Lesotho;
             Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Lesotho;
             Overall impressions of the WBG’s effectiveness and results, knowledge work and
                activities, and communication and information sharing in Lesotho;
             Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Lesotho.
       Use data to help inform Lesotho country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
From April to June 2014, 142 stakeholders of the WBG in Lesotho were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 106 stakeholders participated in the survey (75% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to face.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Lesotho; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Lesotho; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’06. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in two
years, which allows for between-year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present
in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the
“other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14 data and
the total number of respondents in two years are slightly different from those of the original data
reported in appendices A, B, C, E, F, G. For year comparison results, please see appendix D
(page 104).
A. General Issues Facing Lesotho: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Lesotho is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development
   priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Lesotho, WBG staff preparedness to help
   Lesotho solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity building
   in Lesotho, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the
   extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were asked to
   indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in
   helping reduce poverty in Lesotho, and in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most
   of its resources (financial and knowledge services).
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Lesotho, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Lesotho’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty development areas, and the WBG’s level of
   effectiveness across these areas, such as job creation, health, and education.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   contribution of the WBG’s technical assistance to solving Lesotho’s development challenges.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Lesotho: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Lesotho and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Lesotho, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic locations.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
     Stakeholder groups: Respondents from ministries, PMUs, and consultants working on
       WBG projects had the highest levels of familiarity with the WBG, whereas respondents
       from the CSOs had significantly lower levels of familiarity with the WBG.
     Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG were significantly more
       familiar with the institution than those who do not collaborate with the WBG.
     Familiarity, effectiveness, relevance, and achieving results: Respondents’ levels of
       familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of
       the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Lesotho, and significantly, moderately correlated with
       the respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to Lesotho’s development or its
       ability to help achieve development results in Lesotho.

specialized in “health/communicable/non-communicable diseases/HIV/AID,? so analysis was done to identify

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
       Stakeholder groups: Pluralities of the stakeholders attributed failed/slow WBG-assisted
        reforms to “inadequate levels of capacity in Government? and “inadequate level of
        citizen/civil society participation.? Respondents from the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks and CSOs were significantly more likely to believe that “inadequate
        level of citizen/civil society participation? was the cause for failed/slow reforms
        compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       Overall, the WBG was well rated for its effectiveness in development areas which were
        rated as most important in Lesotho (poverty reduction, economic growth, transport,
        education, and agricultural development and food security).

       Stakeholder groups: There were significant differences between stakeholder groups in
        their ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in a number of sectoral areas (listed below).
        Overall, respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks had
        significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in these areas than respondents
        from other stakeholder groups.
              Foreign direct investment;
              Energy;
              Public sector governance/reform;
              Job creation/employment; and,
              Global/regional integration

       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 58) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
        “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
        areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Lesotho, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Lesotho.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and,
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Lesotho, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;

        Collaboration: respondents who professionally collaborate with the WBG gave

         of several areas (indicated by * below), compared to respondents who do not collaborate

         significantly in their views of the institution’s accessibility, responsiveness, work with
         private sector, and being a long-term partner in Lesotho. Those who collaborate with the

Appendix D: Responses to All Questions by Year5
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.
FY ’06 Number of comparable respondents = 53  FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 97
By weighting, FY06 and FY14 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

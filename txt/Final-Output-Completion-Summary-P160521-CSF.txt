        P160521: Summary Note on the Technical Assistance Support
                    to DOTr for PPP Capacity-Building


Objective
1. The objective of the technical assistance (TA) was to increase the capacity of the Department of
   Transportation (DOTr) and its attached agency - the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) - to
   effectively manage their PPP portfolio, using learning by doing approach.

2. The intermediate objectives of these activities were: (a) to support the DOTr and LRTA to
   strengthen the institutional framework and build its capacity to implement and manage PPPs,
   primarily for the LRT line 1 Cavite Extension and O&M concession with the view that this will
   benefit subsequent PPP projects in the urban rail transport sector, (b) to build the capacity of
   DOTr and LRTA technical staff in monitoring the compliance of the concessionaire with the
   terms of the concession agreement, including key performance indicators, and (c) to support
   the DOTr/LRTA in carrying out their obligations under the concession agreement.

3. This particular TA was initiated by IFC in FY2016 and was turned over to the IBRD for continuing
   supervision in FY2017. An earlier initiative by the IFC with funding as well from PPIAF (FY2012)
   supported DOTr in determining the appropriate institutional/organizational arrangement for the
   management of the anticipated LRT1 concession and future other urban rail PPPs. This study included
   defining the organizational form, functions, governance structure, internal/external linkages, and
   requisite staffing and skill set.

Background and Development Context
4. In 2015, DOTr had the biggest PPP portfolio among all implementing agencies in terms of
   number of ongoing projects and projects in the pipeline in various sectors. Projects in the
   pipeline included several airports, a port and several more urban rail projects.    Today, the
   ongoing PPP projects were mostly in the urban transport sector, including the LRT Line 1
   Extension and O&M concession. Among these projects, LRT line 1 concession is considered a
   flagship project, and appears to be most challenging in terms of size and complexity. It involves
   two of the biggest domestic private conglomerates active in the PPP sector in the country.

5. The LRT Line 1 Extension and O&M concession agreement (CA) was signed in September 2014
   between the Republic of the Philippines’ Department of Transport ation and Communications
   (DOTC) and LRTA as Grantors, and the Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC) as Concessionaire.
   Under the LRT Line 1 concession, the LRMC is expected to (i) operate and maintain the existing
   20.7 km LRT Line 1 system, (ii) extend the existing LRT Line 1 system towards Cavite province in
   the south by an additional 11.7km, and (iii) operate and maintain the LRT Line 1 extension.
   The Government is expected to (i) cover right-of-way (ROW) acquisition, (ii) procure light rail
   vehicles (LRVs) via Official Development Assistance from the Japan International Cooperation
                                                    Page 2 of 12
   Agency (JICA), and (iii) provide Automatic Fare Collection System (to be covered by a separate
   PPP contract).

6. This PPP project has a long history that can be traced to the original unsolicited PPP proposal
   submitted by a private proponent in the mid-1990s. The project underwent a series of
   reviews and reconfigurations in 3 administrations before it finally was tendered under a
   competitive process that yielded the existing PPP concessionaire, now in place and in full
   control and operation of the existing LRT line. To date, the LRT extension has yet to be
   constructed and completed.

7. Until the PPP program was launched in 2010, DOTr and its attached agencies pursued the
   majority of their projects via the traditional or non-PPP mode, with a few exceptions. Thus,
   implementing PPP projects is still relatively new to DOTr and its attached agencies. In the
   2010-2016 administration, DOTr took the lead in preparing the PPP projects but project
   execution or day-to-day management and eventual operations was intended to be eventually
   delegated to its attached agencies.

8. At the time of the TA implementation in FY17, DOTr was undergoing a re-organization as the
   agency transitioned into a new administration after the national election. In the process, a
   significant number of project managers retired, resigned or have not been engaged for project
   or contract management and specifically the PPP program. The transition also led to an exodus
   of many of the younger staff who have been working on the PPP program in the past years. The
   agency has been continuously hiring new staff, but typically has only attracted younger and
   relatively inexperienced staff as project managers. The new staff along with managers who
   were not previously engaged in PPPs will need comprehensive and sustained technical support
   to build their capacity to manage the PPP portfolio. On the other hand, LRTA has an existing
   organizational setup more suited for the day to day operation of the LRT line, but not for
   dealing with a private concessionaire that has now taken over the day-to-day functions and is
   responsible for the construction of the LRT Line 1 extension.

9. An initial assessment of the institutional framework for the LRT Line 1 concession revealed that
   DOTr and the LRTA would need urgent support to effectively ensure the successful delivery of
   the PPP project. Assistance was specifically requested for (i) the development of the key
   performance indicators (KPI) manual for the LRT 1 concession to support LRTA’s new role as a
   regulator, and (ii) technical advice on project management to DOTr and LRTA in setting up
   appropriate system for communicating with the private concessionaire and for monitoring its
   obligations, and in performing their own obligations under the concession agreement.

10. To address such needs, the DOTr sought technical support from PPIAF through IFC for
    establishing a contract management function for PPP concessions, primarily focusing on the LRT
    1 Concession. IFC launched the PPIAF technical assistance in 2016 to undertake the (i)
    development of the KPI manual, and (ii) mobilization of an external Project Management
    Adviser to support DOTr and LRTA in managing and coordinating their responsibilities under the
    Concession Agreement. After implementing the TA in FY2016, IFC requested IBRD to take over


                                                   Page 3 of 12
   this TA. This handover took effect in FY2017. IFC and IBRD CMU/GP agreed to continue the TA
   as it was deemed still relevant for future engagement.

11. At the time of the transfer of the TA to IBRD, three international consultants had been selected
    and had delivered partial outputs:
         The KPI manual had been drafted and was under review by the new DOTr and LRTA
            administration, and LRMC.
         The Project Management Adviser was providing advisory support to DOTr and LRTA and
            undertaking mentoring and coaching of DOTr and LRTA staff on critical implementation
            issues using good international practices as basis.

Scope of the TA
12. The TA under IBRD leadership aimed at completing the KPI and project implementation
    overview briefing booklet, and continuation of the mentoring and coaching activities that were
    started under IFC. Apart from these, the TA also supported the development of a training plan
    upon the request of LRTA to address capacity gaps in project and contract management.
    Two local consultants provided additional assistance to complete the TA outputs.

Financial Indicators
13. A total of US$418,000 was disbursed from the PPIAF TF of US$449,950, of which approximately
    US$204,000 was spent in FY16 and US$214,000 in FY17. Major disbursement categories were
    consultancies (all individual consultants—international and local), IBRD staff, travel expenses
    (of STCs) and training/workshops (Figure 1).

Key Activities, Outputs and Initial Results
14. The TA had four specific activities/outputs, two of which were initiated under IFC leadership,
    and all were completed and delivered by the end of the TA. A brief summary of the
    activities/outputs and initial results are presented below:

   A. Project Management Advisory

15. An external international consultant was mobilized as Program Management Adviser to
   provide advisory support to DOTr and LRTA in managing the concession contract and
   strengthen the capacity of the LRT Line 1 Extension and O&M Project contract management
   team. The work of the advisor included: (i) assisting and advising the contract management
   team members in the day to day exercise of their duties and inform the Grantors through the
   Project Director of any areas requiring urgent higher-level authority; and (ii) preparing written
   deliverables which will set out the next steps and longer term administrative structure for
   contract management.

16. Activities and outputs. Key activities and outputs of the Consultant under the TA included:

      Rapid response plan to address urgent concerns and obligations of the grantor, such as
       responding to claims, facilitating ROW delivery to the concessionaire, coordinating with JICA
       for the timely supply of LRVs
      Review of the organization and capacity of the Grantor’s contract management team and
       recommendation on the organizational structure and additional skills needed to address
       gaps
      Master schedule for the grantors’ obligations under the concession agreement; a plan to
       execute the master schedule, and begin implementing the deliverables in the first 12
       months
      Communication platform for the grantor’s contract management team and the
       concessionaire and other relevant stakeholders (e.g. Independent Consultant, JICA, etc.) to
       establish an effective mechanism for communications, information sharing and reporting
       among stakeholders
      Financial Reporting Plan for reporting the Grantors’ current and expected future financial
       commitments under the Master Schedule
      Schedule and guide for validating Key Performance Indicators for the operation and
       maintenance of the system (to be mutually agreed by the grantor and concessionaire)

17. The consultant was hired on a full-time basis for a 6-month period and was deployed to the
    Philippines in April 2016.     During the initial period of TA, the advisory activities achieved
    promising results in advising and assisting DOTr with their immediate problems such as
    situation analysis on various issues, draft communications to be used by the project team,
    sample technical and presentations, analysis of the concession agreement (CA), coaching and

                                                    Page 5 of 12
    mentoring for DOTr and LRTA staff involved in the project.    However, upon the assumption
    of the new administration in July 2016, new management counterparts at DOTr and LRTA took
    office, and typical challenges associated with a change in management in the counterpart
    agencies arose, resulting in reduced engagement of the consultant at DOTr.

18. In the course of the TA, the TA team started to engage more with the PPP Center1, which is a
    separate agency attached to the NEDA, and which is mandated to facilitate the implementation
    of the country’s PPP program and projects. The TA team also intensified the dialog with the
    LRTA OIC-Administrator which continued to appreciate and seek technical inputs from the
    consultant.      The TA team organized two workshops in 2016 which basically aimed to explain
    the PPP arrangement and the CA to a wider audience of DOTr and LRTA staff. The first
    workshop was held on August 10, 2016 to provide DOTr and LRTA staff an overview of the LRT
    Line 1 Extension PPP Project CA, and an introduction to contract management and monitoring
    principles. Fifty-five (55) staff from DOTr, LRTA and PPP Center attended the workshop,
    including technical staff, department and division heads and high level officials, like the
    Executive Director of PPP Center. The second workshop, held on September 21, 2016, discussed
    in detail the requirements of the CA, particularly the roles and responsibilities of LRTA and DOTr
    and the reporting and auditing requirements. Fifty-six (56) staff from LRTA, DOTr and PPP
    Center holding technical and managerial positions participated in the workshop.

19. The PPIAF Trust Fund originally had a closing period of December 31, 2016, and the team had to
    revisit the strategy if any TF extension was going to be pursued. The TA team considered
    shifting the focus the assistance to the LRTA team, which continued to appreciate the efforts on
    capacity building, and it was agreed that the consultant will begin to be housed at the LRTA
    office beginning in January 2017. The staff attrition at DOTr brought the project team members
    to only 2 individuals, who continued to interact on a regular basis with the consultant on
    technical matters. With this re-focusing of the technical assistance to the LRTA team, the PPIAF
    TF was approved for extension for a period of 6 months until June 2017. Given also the
    remaining TF funding, the selected approach was to stay engaged as long as possible, and
    basically to stretch the consultant’s days to cover a period of 6 months, which will allow the TA
    to maximize the availability of the consultant to the LRTA and DOTr team. Hence it was agreed
    to schedule monthly missions on a regular basis, with durations of two weeks.       Until the
    completion of the TA, the TA team continued to deal with LRTA primarily while keeping
    concerned DOTr staff involved and PPP Center adequately informed.

20. Physical Progress on the PPP Project.   Under LRTA management the Grantors operated LRT
    Line 1 until September 12, 2015 when the line was successfully turned over to LRMC. Some
    limited progress was achieved under the PPIAF TA with the consultant providing clarifications to

  The PPP Center provides technical assistance to national government agencies (NGAs),
government-owned-and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs), etc. as well as to
the private sector to help develop and implement critical infrastructure and other development projects.
The PPP Center is also advocating policy reforms to improve the legal and regulatory frameworks governing
PPPs in order to maximize the great potentials of these infrastructure and development projects in the
country.

   the parties regarding binding supplementary notices affecting right of way (ROW), which was
   effective in ending a 21-month delay by the concessionaire because of refusals to proceed with
   ROW handover procedures. Despite initial difficulties in communication between the parties,
   within two weeks of the handover the concessionaire embarked on an assessment of the trains,
   substations, tracks and passenger terminals to determine the extent of work needed to
   improve light rail service. Plans to upgrade the passenger terminals, including facilities such as
   escalators and elevators across the stations will be repaired and overhauled. LRMC has now
   started with the restoration of lighting at all passenger terminals for enhanced passenger
   safety. Despite the lack of formal notices to proceed (NTPs) from the Grantors, the
   Concessionaire broke ground for the pre-construction work on the LRT-1 Cavite Extension;
   existing line is being rehabilitated and an additional 25 LRVs have been repaired/refurbished
   and deployed; and track work is being upgraded to accommodate increased operational
   efficiency, increasing commercial track speed to 60 kilometers per hour thus reducing
   headways and increasing the number of trips on weekdays resulting in a much
   improved service by shorter queueing and journey time for passengers.

21. By 2017, a new LRMC management was also in place, with a new CEO. DOTr and LRTA
    technical staff have observed a gradual change in the working relationship with LRMC even at
    the lower level; they reported seeing less of the private lawyers at the forefront of the technical
    discussions, which was resulting in more cordial and constructive dialogs. Within a few
    months, by July 2017, LRMC passed the audit of international systems certification body TÜV
    Rheinland, with a recommendation or certification in Quality Management Systems (ISO
    9001:2015) and Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001:2015). ISO 9001:2015 is the
    international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system (QMS); -
    organizations use the standard to demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and
    services that meet customer and regulatory requirements. On the other hand, ISO
    14001:2015 specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an
    organization can use to continuously improve its environmental performance; it is intended for
    use by an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a systematic
    manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability.


22. Outcomes. Strengthening the institutional framework and building the capacity to manage
    PPPs was limited by external factors such as changes in key officials and high staff turnover at
    DOTr. As a result, some of the capacity developed through the mentoring and coaching
    activities were lost. Also, hiring new and qualified talent at DOTr proved to be difficult and
    time-consuming. The experience highlighted the importance of having a more permanent
    institutional set-up at DOTr if a longer-term capacity building program is to be effective. Given
    the institutional gaps at DOTr, the Consultant focused on working more closely with LRTA
    (specifically the CA Management Team or CAMT which took on the day-to-day management of
    the CA implementation) and looping in the PPP Center as this provided another channel for
    sharing feedback to top management of concerned agencies on critical PPP issues.

   KPI Manual Finalization

23. Output and activities. During the implementation of the TA under IFC, a Grantors’ KPI
    Monitoring Manual was drafted by international KPI consultants to assist the LRTA managers
    and staff responsible for monitoring the Concessionaire’s performance against the KPIs and for
    reporting performance to the DOTr. Introductory workshops with the Grantors and the
    Concessionaire were conducted but inadequate/incomplete feedback stalled finalization of the
    document. The KPI consultant’s contract ended by the time IBRD assumed the TA. As such,
    the program management adviser took on the work to finalize the document. Meetings with
    the Grantors were further undertaken to finalize the KPI Manual to ensure the understanding
    and interpretation of the Concession Agreement between the Grantors and the Concessionaire
    (LRMC) are adequately reflected.

24. The purpose of the Manual was to provide a practical guide to interpreting the KPI
    requirements in a way which would encourage the underlying purpose, set out in the
    Agreement and the Introduction to the “Manual:“… encourage a good quality of performance
    and service. They do not replace or derogate from any of the responsibilities and obligations of
    the Concessionaire. The KPIs set the minimum standards expected of the Concessionaire?.
    They do so by specifying minimum standards of performance including those for:

      System Reliability and Punctuality

      Cleanliness of the vehicles and stations
        Provision of the station lighting, equipment and facilities needed by passengers
        Provision of lighting and air conditioning in vehicles
        Control of load factors and overcrowding
        Ensuring Safety for passengers and staff

25. The task of the Grantors’ Compliance Team is to report on the actual performance achieved
    vis-à-vis the KPIs through a regular program of audit, inspection and validation. They then
    report to DOTr (the co-Grantor responsible for financial matters) on the actual performance
    achieved and any failure to achieve the KPI requirements. If the Concessionaire has failed to
    meet KPIs, or in some circumstances, failed to correct any failures in proper time during the
    required grace periods, charges are levied by the Grantors. These charges are not primarily
    intended to be “fines? or to compensate Government and the community for failure but are
    intended to encourage the Concessionaire to achieve at least these minimum levels of
    performance. The Manual was written to provide practical guidance to both Parties on how
    to carry out these duties and practical workshops were conducted to explain (using practical
    examples drawn from observations of stations still operated by the LRTA) the processes and
    standards.


26. Results. DOTr, LRTA and LRMC provided comments on the draft KPI Manual to which responses
    were provided and appropriate changes reflected in the final revised draft of the KPI Manual.
    The process of bringing out and fully understanding the context behind the comments and
                                                   Page 8 of 12
   concerns of LRTA staff proved to be long and felt more like a trust-building activity. But once
   it was understood, it seemed worth the long wait, because otherwise the concern on possibility
   of sharp practices happening could have been overlooked. The final draft of the KPI Manual
   would then need to be formally adopted by LRTA. It should be noted that the KPI Manual
   would need to be updated regularly to reflect the experience of LRTA in the monitoring KPIs
   and to cover any agreed changes in the CA.

   B. Booklet: Overview of the LRT 1 Extension and Operations and Maintenance PPP
      Project

27. Output. The TA also developed a booklet that will provide an overview of the project and the
    key features of the LRT Line 1 Extension and O&M concession contract. The booklet is intended
    to provide a basic understanding of the project for the staff of the Grantors--DOTr and
    LRTA--who are new to the project or have limited understanding of the project.      This is
    basically a consolidation of many of the outputs prepared by the project management adviser
    in the TA, and properly organized and laymanized for a broader audience.

28. The topics in the booklet include:

       a. Project background and description, including the scope and the PPP structure of the
          project
       b. Basic introduction to PPPs to help the users of the manual better understand the nature
          of the project
       c. An introduction to the Concession Agreement specifically identifying the major parties
          to the agreement and discussing the legal nature of the contract
       d. Key features of the Concession Agreement, specifically on (i) fare setting and
          adjustments, (ii) quality control and dispute management, (iii) the key performance
          indicators (KPIs) and (iv) the risk allocation between the government and the private
          sector
       e. Overview of the institutional requirements in managing and monitoring the Concession
          Agreement

29. Results.   Based on the comments provided by DOTr, LRTA, and PPP Center, the booklet was
    made more reader friendly and appropriate for new staff, who may have little background on
    PPPs.    PPPC has confirmed that the booklet will not duplicate parallel initiatives of PPPC to
    develop similar PPP materials, as it has recognized that the contribution of this output is as a
    project-specific document rather than a generic one. The booklet can be considered as an
    introductory and accompanying document to a Master Project Implementation Manual that will
    be developed as part of a longer-term training program described below.

   C. Training Plan

30. Towards the end of the TA period, LRTA requested additional training specifically on contract
    management in light of their stepping up to the role of taking on the day-to-day management

                                                  Page 9 of 12
   of the CA and the urgent need to undertake due diligence and closely monitor the obligations
   of the Concessionaire. However, with the nearing closure of the TA, the IBRD proposed to
   develop a training plan instead. The training plan can then be utilized as a starting point for
   discussion for follow-up support from PPIAF or other donors on long term capacity building for
   the rail sector. Learning from the experience of the implementation of the TA, the training
   plan is premised on the condition that DOTr and LRTA are able to constitute an
   adequately-staffed contract management team.

31. Output. A training plan was developed to capacitate DOTr and LRTA staff on project and
    contract management in the context of the LRT 1 Concession Agreement though the principles
    and systems can be easily adapted to other PPP rail projects. The training will apply learning by
    doing principle and intends to teach the staff to prepare tailor-fitted guides, manuals and tools,
    in standardized and documented forms aligned with Philippine laws and regulations to ensure
    continuity of the system and practices. The course modules proposed under the training plan
    include:

       a.   Course 1: Fundamental concepts of PPP
       b.   Course 2: In depth review of the PPP structure, financial model and the CA
       c.   Course 3: Structuring the Contract Management System
       d.   Course 4: Technical aspects (e.g. rail operations related standards, etc.)
       e.   Course 5: Financial Management

32. Targeted training participants will include DOTr and LRTA contract management team as well as
    the DOTr Rail Team in the Office of the Secretary and selected staff from its attached rail
    agencies, such as Philippine National Railways. The training is envisaged to help DOTr
    standardize its Rail Projects Contract Administration Unit. It should also jumpstart the
    development of a pool of trainers within the DOTr and LRTA.

33. The training design also took into account the findings of the Project Management Advisory
    work under the TA and a number of training materials or ongoing initiatives by other donors on
    PPP contract management such as: (i) the PPP Contract Management Guidebook, a generic
    manual on contract management funded by JICA through PPP Center, (ii) the PPIAF PPP
    Certification Guide, and (iii) the basic training program of the PPP Center of the Philippines.

34. Results. The intended beneficiaries – DOTr and LRTA – worked closely with the capacity building
    consultant in determining the priorities for the training, and the training program has been
    finalized based on the comments received from them. The TA team presented a draft of the
    training plan to the new DOTR Undersecretary for Rail and sought additional guidance on the
    training plan.    Once finalized, DOTr can opt to seek funding to implement the training
    program either through PPIAF (which has expressed interest to provide follow-up support) or
    other agencies such as DFAT, ADB or JICA.

Lessons Learned

35. Timing of TA engagement needs to take into account period of government transition. It is
    indeed very hard to control the circumstances surrounding the TA, such as the political
    transition, the institutional capacities, and working conditions in the agency-partners, in this
    case the DOTr and the LRTA. Overall, it was the uncertainties with respect to change in
    government that seemed to create risks for the PPP project. A more tangible commitment
    from DOTr and LRTA (e.g. via a Department Order and the hiring of staff) to form a dedicated
    unit to oversee the PPP project could have mitigated such risks. Or, the role of an external
    agency like the PPP Center could have been explored much earlier to support DOTr and LRTA to
    better ensure continuity.

36. Effectiveness of co-grantor arrangement will need to be assessed for future PPPs. The
    arrangement of having 2 co-grantors is posing issues during implementation. It is recognized
    that under the previous administration, DOTr was leading during project preparation but now it
    seems to have passed on the leadership role to LRTA, though this has resulted in LRTA not
    being properly prepared for this role. But in the later part of the TA, LRTA eventually
    stepped-up and took on the day-to-day management of the CA. The implementation of the
    training plan will hopefully help start the process of revisiting the MOA and clarify roles as DOTr
    and LRTA will have the opportunity to study in depth the provisions of the LRT Line 1 Extension
    and O&M Project CA.

37. Stability in institutional PPP setup needs to be ensured. For the rail PPP program to become
    successful and sustainable, the PPP project development cycle (like that of any other
    infrastructure projects) should be able to survive the changes within and beyond the 6-year
    term of every administration. This will require having a stand-alone PPP Unit that is not
    connected to the day-to-day activities of DOTr or LRTA and led by a career professional, who
    would be in a position to provide management direction and continuity under changes in
    administration. Similar to the PPP Unit of the Department of Public Works and Highways
    (DPWH), DOTR’s and LRTA’s PPP Unit also must be involved throughout the PPP project cycle
    from project identification, development, approval, tendering and negotiation,
    implementation, operation and hand-over.

Recommendations to Government Counterparts
38. Agree with concessionaire on the KPI manual, and maintain a high-level dialogue on big issues.
    All parties to the CA should move towards immediate formal adoption of the KPI manual. A
    legalistic approach to KPIs is impractical or unnecessary to ensure proper standards of service.
    The CA has mechanisms to deal with such problems. The intention is that these issues will be
    handled by higher level bodies composed of representatives of both Parties who will seek to
    resolve matters in an amicable manner and that if this proves impossible, an independent
    third-party expert will make a binding decision. This is the approach which is adopted on
    engineering contracts. What must be avoided is to develop the Manual into a lengthy and
    quasi- legal extension of the Agreement, covering all eventualities. This will inevitably lead to
    the KPI assessment becoming a burdensome and expensive bureaucratic system rather than a
    simple, straightforward and mutually agreed means of checking on standards of customer
    service and ensuring that the service delivered is of proper quality.     It has been emphasized
    that it is necessary to avoid "cannibalism"--switching parts from machine to machine-- to satisfy
    the letter of the Agreement without correcting the underlying customer service failure. If
    there is any suspicion of sharp practice of this nature, it should be dealt with through high-level
    liaison meetings with the concessionaire, not through the KPIs.

39. Form the PPP unit, hire permanent staff, and build their capacity. It is recommended that both
    agencies permanently establish and stabilize the institutional mechanism for managing their
    PPP portfolio, including the LRT Line 1 Extension PPP.    Once their PPP unit/s are established
    and assigned with adequate personnel, a follow-up PPP capacity-building program may be
    implemented.       In the meantime, PPP Center on behalf of oversight agencies may provide
    external guidance and support to DOTr and LRTA technical staff.

40. Set up formal system to receive and review claims from concessionaire. While there appear to
    be positive accomplishments on the part of the concessionaire, there remain risks and
    perceived consequences of DOTr and LRTA not being able to manage the CA more effectively,
    which could imply risk of losses to GoP.    Grantors should be immediately effectively
    organized to deal with claims under the CA.     If the foregoing issue is not addressed, resolving
    some claims may be very challenging and will only worsen over time since reliable documentary
    audit trails to satisfy various GoP mandatory requirements will not have been established.

41. Assess applicability of and consider adopting FIDIC standards. The Grantors team needs to
    urgently commit to give priority attention to better project management and to ensure that
    principles of integrity and good governance are observed. The sheer number of contracts that
    are at risk point to the need for more robust and consistent standards for international
    consulting engineering & construction projects such as FIDIC. FIDIC is an international agency
    that formulates conditions of contract recommended for construction works where tenders are
    invited on an international basis. FIDIC conditions of contract can also be used in domestic
    projects with minor modifications. FIDIC is the abbreviation of Fédération Internationale des
    Ingénieurs-Conseils, meaning International Federation of Consulting Engineers in French.

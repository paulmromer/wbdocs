Executive Summary
Close to a quarter of the Macedonian population lives off less than $4 per day – a rate more than
twice as high as the regional average for Europe and Central Asia (ECA)1. Similarly, income
inequality is higher in Macedonia than in many other countries in the region. Joblessness,
including both unemployment and inactivity, are likely to be important determinants of these
outcomes. In 30 percent of all Macedonian households, none of the household members work2,
and overall employment rates are low in comparison to other countries in ECA. Although an
improved general economic environment, sound macro-economic management and structural
reforms (including in the labor market) have started to change the conditions for job creation in
Macedonia, labor market challenges remain profound, and pre-date the recent economic crisis.
Comparisons of Macedonia’s employment and participation rates among the adult population
(15+) with EU and non-EU OECD countries suggest a severe gap in employment, and
participation outcomes comparable to these other countries. However, these aggregate labor
market outcomes mask important within-country inequalities, such as gender inequalities and
inequalities between different ethnic groups in terms of labor force participation.

This report looks at the two main dimensions of inequality that characterize labor market
participation in Macedonia: gender and ethnicity. Almost half of the female working age
population is inactive, whereas male inactivity is considerably lower. Labor market outcomes
also vary significantly with ethnicity. In particular, a strong interaction exists between gender
and ethnicity, with ethnic minority women forming a particularly vulnerable group.

One of the main contributions of this work is an extensive analysis on the position of the Roma
with respect to labor market participation. This report uses a recent Regional Roma Survey,
conducted in 2011 through a concerted effort of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), the World Bank, and the European Commission (EC). This is the most extensive survey,
to date, to exclusively focus on the situation of the Roma in Eastern Europe. Moreover, the
survey includes a sample of non-Roma living nearby, allowing for a comparison between Roma
and non-Roma individuals that are subject to the same local and regional conditions. In addition,
this report makes use of newly collected qualitative evidence, which allows us to discuss issues
that are often difficult to measure in quantitative terms, such as aspirations and job preferences.

Gender Inequalities in Labor Force Participation

Among women, the inactivity rate is 48 percent, compared to 23 percent among men. This
gender gap in participation has persisted for over twenty years, and has not decreased in
magnitude. Even when background characteristics are taken into account, simply being a
woman is associated with a fall in the likelihood of participating in the labor market of
approximately 30 percentage points. The participation gap between men and women is highest
among older workers, but starts early in individuals’ working lives. In particular, the gender gap
in participation seems to widen in years of marriage and child bearing (25-34), during which
many more women than men leave the labor market. Moreover, keeping other things constant,
age and education have a much stronger correlation with female labor force participation than
they do with male participation. Other factors, such as being married or living in a household

                                                    6
with children, also correlate differently with women’s likelihood to participate in the labor
market than they do with men’s.

Although these results reflect correlations rather than causation, findings do suggest that young
women with higher levels of educational attainment constitute a potentially large and promising
group to activate. Moreover, the evidence discussed in this report suggests that family
responsibilities, reinforced by existing gender norms, have a considerable influence on women’s
labor force participation decisions.

Inequalities among Ethnic Groups in Labor Force Participation

According to official 2002 census estimates, about 36 percent of the Macedonian population
belongs to an ethnic minority (mostly ethnic Albanian), and about 3 percent of the Macedonian
population is Roma. However, more recent, unofficial estimates suggest that the share of Roma is
much larger than the census-reported 3 percent. Labor force participation among ethnic
minorities is often significantly lower than among ethnic Macedonians, especially for women.
Indeed, in ethnic minority groups, the gender gaps in employment outcomes are starker than
among ethnic Macedonians. Generally, activity rates among ethnic minorities are about two or
three times lower among women than among men.

Labor force participation is particularly low among Roma women and ethnic Albanian women:
approximately two thirds of Roma women of working age do not participate in the labor force,
and this is 86 percent among ethnic Albanian women. However, when controlling for
background characteristics, Roma women are more likely to participate than their female non-
Roma neighbors. This indicates that the low engagement of Roma women in the labor market is
likely to be related mostly to labor market entrance barriers explained by observable factors
such as age, family structure and education: inequalities in these correlates of participation
(especially education) generate vast differences in access to labor markets, when comparing
Roma to non-Roma. At the same time, among Roma, the gender effect on participation is
stronger than among non-Roma neighbors. Regardless of marital status, Roma women are 33
percentage points less likely to participate in the labor force than Roma men. Among non-Roma
neighbors, this is only 30 percentage points. Critical for policy, education levels, start to have a
correlation with labor force participation among Roma earlier than they do among non-Roma
neighbors.

Explaining the Gaps

These patterns of inequality in labor force participation are caused by a combination of unequal
incentives, skill levels, and barriers across population groups.

1. Incentives to Work

Those with low education levels, which are often women and ethnic minorities, have the lowest
chances of finding work. When women and ethnic minorities do find work, they are likely to
work informally or in unskilled positions, and hence can expect lower wages than men and
ethnic Macedonians. Indeed, despite an overall increase in wages, median wages have remained
static in lower-earning sectors. Wage disparities between the public- and private sector are
particularly stark for women, providing the latter with strong incentives to pursue public sector
jobs, which are much less widely available than private sector jobs. Private sector jobs, by


                                                 7
contrast, are generally considered to be undesirable, mainly due to employers’ reported
disrespect of existing labor regulations. Similarly, whereas migration abroad remains a viable
option for men who don’t have access to employment opportunities in Macedonia, for women,
migration is much less common. Moreover, there are significant disincentives for the jobless to
terminate their receipt of social assistance or unemployment support when taxes on labor and
benefits lost are taken into account. This holds in particular for low wage earners, which often
include women and ethnic minorities.

Macedonian taxes are not exceptionally high, but markedly less progressive than in other
European countries. Macedonia also has a number of non-contributory social assistance
programs, covering a total of 6.9 percent of all Macedonian households. Social assistance
benefits are not extremely generous, rendering any disincentives to work based purely on the
generosity of these benefits unlikely. Still, incentives to work (formally) could be strengthened:
thirty one percent of all individuals receiving social assistance could be categorized as able to
work, but remain out of the labor force. A sizable group among these inactive social assistance
beneficiaries is made up of women: about 27 percent are poor, inactive women, often living in
households with young children. This suggests that improved child- and elderly care provisions
could be an important step towards activation of this group. Certain labor regulations also
contribute to unequal expectations: for example, labor laws intended to protect women by
providing for long maternity leave, limited working hours, and lower retirement ages can affect
a firm’s decision to hire female employees.

2. Education and Skills

Skills and level of education are key determinants of labor market participation. Those who
complete secondary education, for example, are 20 percentage points more likely to participate
in the labor force than those who do not complete any education at all. However, most women, a
total of 51 percent never goes beyond primary education. Among certain ethnic minorities, the
pattern is similar: for example, among Roma, 47 percent of women and 34 percent of men never
completes secondary education. The most prominent reason for Roma to leave school before
completion of secondary education is that costs are too high. Moreover, among young Roma
aged 15-19, many who are not enrolled in school also do not have jobs: only 50 percent is either
in school or has a job. The remaining half is either unemployed (8 percent) or inactive (42
percent). Among non-Roma neighbors of the same age, as much as 76 percent are in school or
working. In fact, 15 to 19 year old Roma in Macedonia show the second highest level of
inactivity, excluding those enrolled in school, among Eastern European countries surveyed.

The gender gap in labor force participation is also much larger for those who did not go beyond
primary education as compared to higher education levels. Indeed, when controlling for
background characteristics, education has a much stronger correlation with women’s likelihood
to participate in the labor force compared to the same correlation for men. Similarly, among
working age Roma women who have not completed primary education, 70 percent do not
participate in the labor force. This drops to 29 percent among Roma women with tertiary
education.

In addition to formal education levels, a lack of foundational and job-specific skills can hinder
labor market entrance. For example, many employers in Macedonia contend that workers often
lack responsibility, reliability and commitment. Indeed, obtaining a diploma does not always


                                                8
guarantee to employers that all the needed skills for the job have been obtained. Moreover,
especially among women, the types of study programs chosen do not reflect what is most in
demand on the labor market. Long-term joblessness further aggravates the skills disadvantage,
since work experience often forms an important component of what employers take into
account in hiring decisions. Although training programs are often available, awareness on the
existence of such programs is low. Recent policy-measures have improved access to tertiary
education, but important steps remain to be taken to complete the transition to an “access for
all? model, especially at lower levels of education.

3. Barriers to Work

In addition to inequalities in incentives and skills, various barriers to participation exist among
women and ethnic minorities, including social norms and discrimination, limited childcare and
elderly care provisions, a lack of flexible work arrangements, and limited mobility and access to
networks and productive inputs. For example, a very large group of women leave the labor force
due to household and family care responsibilities. Women from ethnic minorities often face
stronger pressures from their family to become housewives than ethnic Macedonian women.
Moreover, social norms often determine what types of jobs are deemed appropriate for women.
Ethnic minorities, as well as women in general, may also face outright discrimination on the
labor market. Child and elderly care options remain scarce and preschool enrollment rates are
low, standing at only 26 percent among girls and 25 percent among boys, as compared to an ECA
average of 75 percent and 76 percent for girls and boys, respectively.

Flexible and part-time work arrangements are largely lacking in Macedonia, affecting women in
particular. Moreover, restricted mobility, especially among women, forms an important
constraint. Regional unemployment rates range from 14 to 53 percent, but this does not seem to
incentivize large streams of internal migrants. Macedonians of all ethnicities and both genders
also cite a lack of personal connections, nepotism, and lack of affiliation with the political parties
in power as a reason for inactivity. When attempting to start a business, many cite difficulties in
attempting to access capital. For women in particular, social norms that regard women as “not
cut out for business? form an additional constraint. For the poor, which include, for example,
many Roma, financial constraints present a significant barrier to inclusion in the labor market in
general, through their impact on education.

Policy Recommendations

Based on the above, this report identifies a number of key priorities for public policy

1. Improved work incentives for individuals and employers

            o   Rationalize existing schemes aimed at subsidizing employment of
                vulnerable groups.
            o   Increase the level of progressivity of labor taxation, either directly (through the
                elimination of the reference wage, for example) or indirectly (through the
                introduction of a negative income tax).
            o   Equalize the retirement age for men and women.
            o   Reduce the costs associated with hiring and firing, especially those that affect
                youth who have a longer working live ahead of them.



                                                  9
           o   Introduce more strict enforcement of discrimination laws and regulations on
               labor conditions, particularly in the private sector.
      Broader access to tools and institutions that facilitate training and jobs
           o   Give priority to increasing investments in early childhood education, especially
               among ethnic minorities.
           o   Strengthen the partnership between government, educational institutions and
               employers, to: 1) build a national job-search database, including information on
               required skills and job orientation strategies, 2) actively assist with skills
               development.
           o   Within education and training systems, increase the focus on job-relevant skills –
               i.e. not only cognitive and technical, but also socio-emotional skills. These have
               been shown to have an equalization effect among groups with lower formal
               educational attainment.
           o   Use the recent improvements in activation programs as a starting point for an
               integrated social protection model that prioritizes activation, building in
               conditionalities where needed.
           o   Incentivize work among married women and women with children, through
               awareness-raising and provision of affordable care facilities outside the home.

Some of these policy recommendations can have important fiscal implications, and their
desirability needs to be balanced against other priorities and fiscal sustainability goals. We
highlight in the policy discussion those recommendations for which a fiscal assessment is
particularly important.

1 Introduction
Close to a quarter of the population in Macedonia lives off less than $4 per day – a rate
more than twice as high as the regional average for Europe and Central Asia (ECA).4
Similarly, income inequality is higher in Macedonia than in many other countries in the region5.
Even communities that assess themselves as belonging to the middle class in relative terms
(because they have a job and have completed secondary education) indicate that in absolute
terms, they in fact struggle with poverty:

“The middle class is a class that is fading... the dream for a comfortable middle class life is fading
away?

                                                                  (Jobless woman from Sveti Nikole6)

Joblessness, including both unemployment and inactivity, is an important determinant of
these outcomes. For example, focus group discussions have shown that many Macedonians
identify access to jobs as the single most important condition for entering the middle class7. Yet,
in 30 percent of all Macedonian households, none of the household members has a job8, and
overall employment rates are low in comparison to other countries in the Europe and Central
Asia region. Furthermore, the majority of those who are jobless have not had work for extended
periods of time: 76 percent of non-employed 15-24-year-olds have not had a job for more than a
year, a figure that rises to 96 percent among jobless 55-64-year-olds9. Whereas unemployment
rates also remain a critical issue, part of this pattern is caused by gaps in labor force
participation.

This case study examines inequalities in the Macedonian labor market, focusing in
particular on labor force participation. The study includes an analysis of inequality patterns
in terms of labor force participation as well as a review of policy responses, and areas for
possible further policy action. In particular, the report looks at the two main dimensions of
inequality that characterize Macedonia’s labor market: gender and ethnicity. Almost half the
female working age population is inactive, whereas male inactivity is considerably lower. Labor
market outcomes also vary significantly with ethnicity. In particular, a strong interaction exists
between gender and ethnicity, with ethnic minority women forming a particularly vulnerable
group. Hence, it is worthwhile to investigate in more detail how gender and ethnicity shape the
Macedonian labor market, and how public policy could be used to increase labor market
participation and job opportunities for women and ethnic minorities.

This report relies on two main sources of information. First, it takes advantage of household
surveys, including, first and foremost, the 2006 and 2011 Macedonian Labor Force Survey (LFS)
and the 2011 UNDP/World Bank/EC regional Roma survey (henceforth: the “regional Roma
survey?). The former is a nationally representative survey conducted by the State Statistical
Office (SSO) of Macedonia, capturing a variety of labor market issues for the entire Macedonian
population. The latter is the most comprehensive survey effort to date to capture the situation of
Roma in Macedonia10, and the results obtained for Macedonia are being systematically analyzed
here for the first time. Although the survey is not nationally representative, it accurately reflects
the living conditions of the vast majority (88 percent) of Roma living in Macedonia. Second, this
report relies on qualitative information, collected through focus group discussions in Macedonia
in 201311. Annex 1 provides a more detailed overview of the surveys and methodology used.

The main conclusions of this report are as follows. Female labor force participation lags far
behind male labor force participation, across all age groups. This gap starts early in life: many
young women exit the labor force when they get married or have children. Among ethnic
minorities, accessing labor market opportunities is challenging, and this is particularly so for
women. The challenges that women and ethnic minorities face are related to incentive
structures, skills gaps and group-specific barriers. Among the incentives analyzed, the lack of
progressivity in the tax system and the impact of pensions stand out as particularly influential.
The skills mismatch is also limiting for many, including for those who did obtain at least
secondary education: in addition to school completion. Among the group-specific barriers, social
norms and discrimination stand out. Importantly, many of the other barriers faced by (ethnic
minority) women are somehow induced or reinforced by commonly accepted gender norms.
This is the case for childcare and elderly care options, flexible work arrangements, the gender
gap in educational attainment, mobility, and access to relevant inputs and networks.

This report is organized as follows. First, the report describes the main characteristics of the
Macedonian labor market, emphasizing the most important patterns of inequality in terms of
labor market participation (Section 2). Section 3 addresses the possible causes of these
inequality patterns. Section 4 discusses potential policy responses and concludes.

2 The Macedonian Labor Market: Key issues
2.1 Employment and Labor Market Participation in Macedonia
Getting a new or better job is considered one of the most important factors contributing
to upward mobility in Macedonia. Women place a higher focus on the importance of this
factor: among respondents between the age of 25 and 55 years old, 52 percent of men and 59
percent of women identified getting a new or better job as one of the two most important factors
to promote their household’s upward mobility, making it the single most important factor.12

All communities interviewed assessed job loss, coupled with a scarcity of job
opportunities, as the main risk factor that may cause a household fall down the
socioeconomic ladder. Men placed more emphasis on this factor than women: 90 percent of
men felt that this was one of the largest risks to the household’s economic wellbeing, as
compared to 73 percent of women. Given their greater involvement in formal employment and
role as breadwinner, this gender gap is not surprising. As a woman from the Tana community
noted: “Everything revolves around the same thing, if you don’t have a job, you don’t have money,
you don’t have anything.?13

Yet, labor market challenges in Macedonia are profound, and pre-date the recent
economic crisis. Macedonia has experienced significant economic volatility associated with
economic crises in both 2001 and 2009. At the same time, overall growth during the past decade
has been positive: the average annual GDP growth rate stood at 5 percent between 2001 and
201114. However, the core challenges faced by Macedonia in relation to labor market dynamics
seem to be more structural: for example, over the last decade, the unemployment rate15 has
hovered at around 30 percent, and employment rates have remained just below 40 percent
(Figure 2-1).

Comparisons of Macedonia’s employment and participation rates among the adult
population (15+) with EU and non-EU OECD countries suggest a severe gap in
employment, and a comparable outcome in participation (Figure 2-2). However, these
aggregate labor market outcomes mask important within-country inequalities, such as gender
inequalities and inequalities between different ethnic groups. 16 Similarly, Macedonia’s
employment rate is low compared to other relatively poor countries in the ECA region (Figure 2-
3). Overall inactivity in Macedonia does not rank exceptionally low among these countries.
However, this masks much higher inactivity rates among women and ethnic minorities. Indeed,
inactivity among Macedonian women (48 percent) stands at more than double the inactivity rate
among men (23 percent). Similarly, specific ethnic groups, including the Roma, often face
significant barriers to labor market entry. Hence, increasing labor market participation among
these specific population groups could boost employment rates significantly.

An improved general economic environment, together with sound macro-economic
management and significant structural reforms (including in the labor market) have
started to change the conditions for job creation in Macedonia. Indeed, in recent years,
employment rates have gradually increased, whereas unemployment rates have gone down.
However, improvements remain small, and inequalities in labor force participation between
different population groups remain unaddressed. Recent reform efforts have been successful in
improving the general business climate, and in shedding certain rigidities that previously
restricted the labor market in general. However, thus far, these reforms have produced
relatively modest improvements in key labor market outcomes: activity rates have remained
relatively constant, standing at approximately 55 percent of the adult (15+) population.
Employment rates have shown a gradual increase over the past few years, reflecting a reduction
in unemployment rates from approximately 37 percent in 2005 to 32 percent in 2010 and
further to 29 percent in 201317. Given the poor labor market conditions at the start of the reform
process, however, significant challenges remain, including important within country inequalities
in labor force participation.

2.2 Gender Inequality and the Macedonian Labor Market
As highlighted in the above, one of the two most prominent dimensions of inequality in
the Macedonian labor market is the gender dimension. The employment rate among men is
much higher than among women, a trend that is largely fuelled by a gender gap in participation
rather than unemployment. Although unemployment rates are slightly higher for men than for
women, this difference is marginal when compared to the difference in participation rates,
which stand at 48 percent for women and 23 percent for men (Figure 2-4). In fact, as of 2011,
male labor force participation was similar to the regional average, which stood at 77 percent for
the age range 15-64 years, while female participation remained eleven percentage points below
the regional average of 62 percent for the age range 15-64 years. This gender gap in
participation has persisted for over twenty years, and has not decreased in magnitude (Figure 2-
5).

The participation gap between men and women is highest among older workers, but
starts early in individuals’ working lives. In particular, the gender gap in participation seems
to widen in years of marriage and child bearing (25-34), during which many more women than
men leave the labor market (Figure 2-6).

Even when background characteristics are taken into account, simply being a woman is
associated with fall in the likelihood of participating in the labor market of approximately
30 percentage points (Figure 2-7). This is the third highest rate compared to other poor
countries in ECA.

Moreover, keeping other things constant, age and education have a much stronger
correlation with female labor force participation than they do with male participation.
Among women of working age, being in the age-group 60-64 decreases one’s chance of being in
the labor force more than being in any other age-group (Figure 2-8). Moreover, across the board,
the correlation of age with labor force participation is stronger for women than it is for men.
Similarly, and keeping other relevant factors constant, the correlation between completing
secondary or tertiary education with a woman’s chance to participate in the labor force is about
four times as big in magnitude as the same relation for men.

Other factors also correlate differently with women’s likelihood to participate in the labor
market than they do with men’s. For example, in households where at least one other
individual is employed, women have a much higher likelihood of participating in the labor force,
possibly reflecting the fact that women are typically second-earners in the household. Among
women, living in a household with young children (aged 0-6) decreases the chance to participate
in the labor force by approximately 18 percentage points, and a less substantial correlation, of 6
percentage points, is observed for women living in households with school-aged children. These
correlations are not statistically significant for men.

Although these results reflect correlations rather than causation, findings do suggest that
young women with higher levels of educational attainment constitute a potentially large
and promising group to activate (Table 2-1). Moreover, the initial evidence discussed in this
section suggests that family responsibilities do influence women’s labor force participation
decisions; we return to this issue later in this report (see Section 3.3).

2.3 The Ethnic Dimension of the Gender Gap
According to official 2002 census estimates18, about 36 percent of the Macedonian
population belongs to an ethnic minority, and about 3 percent of the Macedonian
population is Roma (although this last number is likely to be higher). Figure 2-9 shows the
official 2002 census results for ethnic backgrounds of the Macedonian population. Ethnic
Albanians form the biggest ethnic minority, followed by the ethnic Turkish, Roma, and ethnic
Serbians. Apart from the ethnic Albanian minority, none of the other ethnic groups exceed a

share of 5 percent of the total population. However, more recent, unofficial estimates suggest
that the share of Roma is much larger than the census-reported 3 percent (Table 2-2)19.

To the extent that data are available, they indicate that labor force participation among
ethnic minorities is often significantly lower than among ethnic Macedonians, especially
among women. Even when comparing ethnic minorities to the general population without
distinguishing by gender, striking inequalities appear. However, it does stand out that the
participation gap is driven almost entirely by gaps among women (Figure 2-10).


19Although the numbers vary to a certain extent, non-census estimates suggest that the number of Roma
in Macedonia is much larger than what is reported in the census data: estimates generally range from
approx. 6 percent to 13 percent (see Figure 1-1). For example, “field researches show that in R. Macedonia
there are 150.000 Roma people (Petrovski, T. 2000; 56-57) or 135.490 Roma people (A. Elezovski, 2003;
1-2).? (REF / World Bank, 2004: 5) A simple average between these two research -based estimates would
bring the share of Roma in the total population up to 7 percent, making it the second largest minority.

Note: 2006 is the last year for which data is publicly available on ethnicity in the LFS. In these graphs, it is important
to note that the LFS data is not representative by ethnicity, so there may be some discrepancies with actual data at the
population level. According to the regional Roma survey (2011), the employment rate among Roma men is 35
percent; 28 percent of Roma men are unemployed, and 37 percent are out of the labor force. According to this same
survey, the employment rate among Roma women is 10 percent; 25 percent of these women are unemployed, and 65
percent are out of the labor force. These numbers are not nationally representative, but rather, reflect communities
where one can find a higher-than-national concentration of Roma.

Critically, in ethnic minority groups, the gender gaps in employment outcomes are much
starker than among ethnic Macedonians. As for the general population, low employment
rates among ethnic minority women are driven by higher inactivity rates rather than by higher
unemployment. Unemployment rates are generally lower among ethnic minority women than
among ethnic minority men, whereas inactivity rates are much higher. Whereas ethnic
Macedonian women have an employment rate of 41 percent, only 10 percentage points lower
than their male counterparts, women who are ethnically Turkish only have an employment rate
of 27 percent - a 32 percentage point gap with men with the same ethnic background. Roma and
ethnic Albanian women lag even further behind in terms of employment, with employment rates
of only 7 and 6 percent, respectively. These trends are mirrored by those in labor force
participation rates: ethnic Macedonian women lag behind men of the same ethnic group the
least, and have, overall, a much higher activity rates than other ethnic groups in the country.
Generally, activity rates among ethnic minorities are about two or three times lower among
women than among men.

We focus mostly on the Roma in the rest of this report given their poor labor market
outcomes, and the lack of detailed data on the drivers of these outcomes for this
population. Employment rates among Roma are not only much lower than among non-Roma in

                                                                            21
general, but also when compared only to non-Roma living nearby. Figure 2-11 illustrates that
this is particularly the case for prime age workers (for men, this is driven by differences in
unemployment rates, while for women it is driven by differences in activity rates). Interestingly,
among older women, this pattern is reversed, with an 8 percentage point difference in inactivity
rates between Roma and non-Roma women (82 percent among Roma, and 90 percent among
non-Roma neighbors). The latter possibly reflects higher levels of poverty among older Roma
women.

a higher-than-national concentration of Roma (see Annex 1).

However, when controlling for background characteristics, Roma women are more likely
to participate than their female non-Roma neighbors. This indicates that the low
engagement of Roma men and women in the labor market is likely to be related mostly to labor
market entrance barriers explained by observable factors such as family and age structure or
education. Such barriers may include education, gender-norms, and access to relevant networks
and inputs (see Section 3). Indeed, when keeping factors such as age, education, marital status
and family composition constant, Roma women and their female non-Roma neighbors remain
over 30 percentage points less likely to participate in the labor force than men in the same
communities. Moreover, for these women, a much stronger correlation of higher education with
labor force participation is observed than for men, whereas marital status has a much weaker

relation with labor force participation for women than it does for men (after controlling for
dependents). These relations strongly resemble those obtained for women in the general
Macedonian population.

At the same time, among Roma, the gender effect on participation is stronger than among
non-Roma neighbors (Annex 2). Regardless of marital status, Roma women are 33 percentage
points less likely to participate in the labor force than Roma men. Among non-Roma neighbors,
this is only 30 percentage points. Critical for policy, education levels, on the other hand, start
having a positive correlation with labor force participation earlier among Roma than they do
among non-Roma neighbors: among Roma, achieving primary education already has a positive
association with labor force participation, whereas among non-Roma neighbors, this effect does
not exist.




3 Explaining Labor Force Participation Gaps across
  Gender and Ethnicities in Macedonia
The previous section has shown that inequality in labor force participation in Macedonia
is driven mainly by gaps between men and women, and that there is an important ethnic
dimension to this pattern. The factors behind these gaps are multiple and interrelated.
First, work incentive structures vary significantly across gender and ethnic groups, reflecting
different labor market aspirations and expected wages, as well as the design of the tax-benefit
system and of labor regulations. Second, gaps in formal education (and skills more broadly)
hamper access to economic opportunities for the more disadvantaged groups. Third, women and
ethnic minorities are likely to face additional barriers to participation and employment related
to social norms, but also to a lack of flexible work arrangements, the unavailability of affordable
child- and elderly care options, and limited access to productive inputs and networks. This
section discusses these issues in more detail, starting with an exploration of incentive structures
(section 3.1), and then discussing education and skills gaps (Section 3.2) and additional barriers
to work20 (section 3.3).

3.1 Incentives to Work
3.1.1 Expectations & Wages
Both men and women consider jobs to be the most important channel to move up the
economic and social ladder. In qualitative interviews, approximately 30 percent of
respondents considered a job to be the main avenue for getting ahead in life, compared, for
example, with 11 percent who saw education as the main ingredient for moving up (Figure 3-1).

Notes: This figure reflects the share of respondents that chose each option when asked: “What do you think are the
two most important channels for women / men [corresponding to gender of the respondent] to move up the social
ladder in this community??. Respondents include both employed and jobless individuals.

When overall labor market conditions are depressed or when expectations are low,
however, workers can get discouraged. Between 2007 and 2011, nearly 60,000 jobs were
created in Macedonia, primarily in agriculture, trade, and the public sector. Most job creation
was informal, and even though required skill levels were often not very high, the majority of new
jobs were taken up by those with tertiary education, either among well-educated, older workers,
or among younger workers with tertiary education (World Bank, 2013). Two thirds of new jobs
in this period were accounted for by informal employment in the agriculture and trade sectors.
Focus group discussions have pointed out that ethnic Albanian and ethnic Turkish women in
particular felt that they were unable to find jobs with their qualifications, regardless of their
level of education (World Bank, 2008 and forthcoming). Indeed, lower labor force participation
associated with relatively high levels of unemployment seems to be a much stronger factor for
women than for men: when the regional unemployment rate for women with a certain level of
education is high—reflecting local labor market opportunities, participation among women with
that same level of education is much lower, with a much larger effect size than is found for men.

When women and ethnic minorities do find work, they are disproportionately likely to
work informally (Figure 3-2) or in unskilled positions, and can expect lower wages than
men and ethnic Macedonians with similar characteristics. Keeping constant educational and
socio-economic characteristics and correcting for low labor force participation, employed
women in Macedonia earn less on their jobs than men, although inequalities have been reduced
over time.21 Similarly, among all working women in Macedonia, 17 percent are employed as
family workers, whereas this value stands at only 6 percent among men. Since family workers
are often paid a very low wage or no wage at all, this pattern exemplifies the low expectations
that women may have regarding potential earnings. In turn, this could help explain why women
are more likely to become inactive, and exhibit a lower propensity to want to re-enter the labor
force once out. This was clearly seen during the economic crisis: between 2008 and 2011,
unemployed women were almost twice as likely as men to drop out of the labor force. Those

Wages are also lower for ethnic minorities, especially Roma (Figure 3-3). One important
driver of this effect is a gap in education between men and women, particularly among ethnic
minorities, which gets partly reflected in self-selection of ethnic minorities into lower skilled,
lower paying occupations (Figure 3-4). Among ethnic Macedonians, the largest proportion (44
percent) of the population work as skilled workers, while among their Roma neighbors, this
figure falls to 21 percent. By contrast, 12 percent of ethnic Macedonians work as unskilled or
landless workers, while among the Roma, this figure stands at 48 percent, four times greater.
The Roma are also the least likely among all groups to be civil servants or business owners, and
only 4 percent of the Roma population work as managers or other types of professionals (18
percent among ethnic Macedonians).

People’s expectations and labor market decisions are also likely to be shaped by their
aspirations and views on what makes a job desirable. Figure 3-5 shows focus group
participants’ job preferences: Almost three quarters of participants preferred a public to a
private job; more than 90 percent preferred a full time job and employment in the formal sector
to their alternatives. This job preference reflects both a concern for job security and actual
higher wages in the public sector, even after controlling for differences in workers’ education
levels in the public and private sectors (World Bank, 2013). This holds particularly for women,
as public sector jobs pay women at levels that are on par with their male colleagues, which is
often not the case in the private sector. Indeed, women often want to work, but only desire jobs
in the public sector.

Focus groups indicate that applying for desirable public sector jobs in particular is
viewed as an unfair and discouraging process. Focus group discussions also confirm that
private sector jobs are seen as undesirable by many. Among both genders, focus group
participants have highlighted a perceived unfairness in the application process for public jobs, as
well as a relatively high cost involved in applying for such jobs. Reasons for this include the

                                                                              26
perception that public sector job vacancies are often fake and already filled prior to the
publication of job advertisements. Such views are more prevalent in smaller towns, where
people know each other well. Hence, interested candidates are often discouraged from applying
in the first place. The costs of public sector applications is also a deterring factor, as applications
require spending on notarization of documents, photocopies, and so on (World Bank, 2008).
Private sector jobs, by contrast, are generally considered to be undesirable, mainly due to
employers’ reported disrespect of existing labor regulations or harassment, especially among
women. 22

These job preferences and aspirations are very consistent across ethnic groups. Figure 3-6
illustrates that by far most Roma, both male and female, would prefer a secure, low-paid job
over an insecure, higher paid job. Similarly, most would prefer a secure job over a flexible job.
These preferences are very similar to those displayed by non-Roma neighbors.

Moreover, women aged 35 or older, as well as newlywed women and young mothers are
particularly likely to face rejection when looking for jobs, resulting in very low
expectations among these groups in particular. Women aged 35 and over report that they
find it difficult to find work due to the strong preference of employers for younger workers.
Young, newly married women, or women with small children, are also often discouraged as
private employers regularly express unwillingness to hire them. Such women often decide to
leave the labor market until their children grow older (World Bank, 2008).

Finally, and related to low expectations of gainful employment in Macedonia, many men
express a strong desire to move abroad. Those who do express a desire to migrate have
generally completed higher-than-average levels of education. A recent paper on migration in
Macedonia estimates the annual number of emigrants to be approximately 10,000 individuals,
which amounts to roughly 0.5 percent of the overall Macedonian population (Bornarova and
Janeska, 2012). In a community in Skopje, young men claim that: “Because the state won’t help
us… That’s why we must migrate?23. Their ethnic Albanian urban and rural peers tend to agree:
“Migration is a good way to have a normal life and secure one’s family and oneself, so that’s why
young men see migration as a solution and best option?. Similarly, young Roma men explain:
“Most of the young Roma people want to go abroad; they think there is a better future.? Some,
though not all, young women also consider migration to be a crucial factor for getting ahead. For
instance, a young urban woman stated: “I would rather emigrate than try to succeed here, because
I believe that the highly educated people have a better chance at succeeding abroad than here.
Even the professors at my college keep telling us to move abroad. If someone offered me to leave, I
wouldn’t think twice, and I wouldn’t waste time on packing either.? Ethnic Albanian rural women
seem to share the same view: “From what I see, those who live abroad have a better life…?. Yet, for
women, migration is still less common than for men.

In short, low expectations and possibly higher reservation wages associated with job
preferences are likely to be one explanatory factor behind low labor force participation in
Macedonia, especially among women and ethnic minorities.

3.1.2 Labor Taxation and the Benefit System
3.1.2.1 Taxes
Despite labor taxation reforms in the past decade, the Macedonian tax and benefit system
still has elements that could be a barrier to employment. There are potentially important
work disincentives associated with moving out of social assistance or the unemployment
registry and into (formal) employment when taxes on labor and forgone benefits are taken into
account. This is clearly illustrated by the response of a woman receiving social assistance, when
asked why she did not work: “I can earn 3000 dinars a month working in a manufacturing
factory; from all social assistance programs, I receive 2300 dinars. For 700 dinars a month, I will
not leave my family and children.?24 Such disincentives are often particularly severe for the
members of society for whom employment could have important social spillovers, such as low-
wage and second- earners.

Macedonian labor tax rates are not exceptionally high compared to other countries in the
region, but they are markedly less progressive than in other European countries. The tax
wedge increases with wages, but less than in Western Europe. Average effective tax rates in
2010 stood at 73 percent of gross labor income for people earning half of the average wage,
decreasing to 54 percent of gross labor income at the average wage (Figure 3-7). This is partly
the result of disproportionately high social contribution rates for low-wage earners, through the
so-called reference wage25. Low progressivity in labor taxes results in disincentives for low-
wage earners to work (formally), as well as making them relatively more expensive to hire.

23 World Bank: Qualitative interviews (2013).

25 The reference wage is a wage floor for reporting social contributions. In Macedonia, it is set at 50

percent of the average wage.

                                                  28
Those who are most likely to be low-wage or part-time workers are most affected: as shown
earlier in this report, these are often women, youth and ethnic minorities.

3.1.2.2 Social Assistance
Macedonia has a number of non-contributory social assistance programs, covering a total
of 6.9 percent of all Macedonian households.26 These include means-tested benefits, such as a
last resort program called Social Financial Assistance (SFA), Permanent Financial Assistance
(PFA), and targeted non-contributory disability benefits. They also include a means-tested child
allowance, a one-off monetary payment for newborn children, and a parental allowance. Lastly,
Macedonia has personal, family, and disability allowances for war veterans, civilians
handicapped during war, and participants in the war.

Social assistance benefits are not very generous compared to other countries in the
region. Hence, based simply on generosity, any disincentives to work would be unlikely. A
jobless woman from a village near Tetovo explains: “The help that [the] state gives is very small
considering the needs that a family has. But without this assistance the family is in a much worse
situation, so it is welcomed“.27 Among the poorest quintile, social assistance benefits account for
an average of 24 percent of total household post-transfer consumption. This is relatively low in
comparison to many other countries in the region. In fact, many beneficiaries of social
assistance are “working poor?: employed individuals who, in spite of their jobs, fall below the
poverty line.28 Employment agency officials recognize this situation, and agree that social
assistance alone is not enough to survive. Many argue that households would benefit from a
situation in which they could find formal employment, without their benefits being cancelled
immediately.29

Reflecting high poverty rates and joblessness, many Roma depend on social assistance,
although they often lack access to this safety net. Data from the regional Roma survey
suggest that households with labor income receive hardly any social benefits: on average, only
12 percent of their total adult equivalent income is made up of social benefits in the case of
Roma, whereas this is 62 percent for Roma households that do not earn any income from
employment or other types of labor (Figure 38). For non-Roma neighbor households, this
pattern holds as well, although the share of income made up of social benefits is smaller than for
Roma in both groups. These findings point, on the one hand, to widespread poverty among the
Roma: on average, adult equivalent income among Roma households is 49 Euros per month,
whereas this is 118 Euros for non-Roma neighbors. On the other hand, they also underscore the
low employment rates found among the Roma population. At the same time, when keeping
background characteristics constant, achieving at least some education seems to reduce the
likelihood of depending on social benefits; this effect is actually much higher among Roma than
among the non-Roma (Annex 1, Model set 3).

Notes: Data are not nationally representative, but reflect rates in neighborhoods and communities where one can find
a higher-than-national concentration of Roma (see Annex 1). ‘Social assistance’ also includes child allowance and
unemployment benefits.

This said, incentives to work (formally) could be strengthened. Thirty one percent of all
individuals receiving social assistance could be categorized as able to work, but remain out of
the labor force. Among individuals in households receiving these benefits, 54 percent are of
working age, not disabled, and not engaged in full-time study or training. Within this group,
however, approximately 57 percent does not participate in the labor force. This amounts to
almost one third (31 percent) of all individuals receiving social assistance. A comprehensive
latent class analysis exercise has shown that a sizable group among these inactive social
assistance beneficiaries is made up of women: about 27 percent are poor, inactive women, often
living in households with young children. Childcare responsibilities are one of the most
prominent barriers to labor force participation for this group. Incorporating complementary

child care services in activation programs could, therefore, be helpful in increasing incentives to
work.

Source: Arias et al. (2014), based on OECD and World Bank calculations.
Notes: Calculations are based on one-earner couples with two children. They measure the share of gross income of the
accepted formal job—including in-work benefits—that is taxed away through personal income tax, social security
contributions, and lost benefits (social assistance, family, and housing benefits).

In particular, the design features of Macedonia’s Last Resort Social Assistance program—
the SFA— can be improved, especially in areas that are likely to have a disproportionate
effect on women and ethnic minorities. On the one hand, beneficiaries of SFA receive special
support in terms of job search (for example, personal action plans and monitoring job search).
Benefits also decrease over time, and entry into the pool of recipients is relatively restrictive and
based on a comprehensive evaluation of household welfare. These features are likely to
encourage, and make it easier to, search for a job. On the other hand, there is no maximum
duration to receiving the benefit, and sanctions for non-compliance are not strictly enforced. In
addition, SFA beneficiaries are entitled to other special provisions, such as a reimbursement for
energy bills, which increase the net value of monthly benefits received, and hence, make
termination of the benefits a financially unattractive option. Finally, although a number of
employment training- and incentive schemes are provided, in addition to job-search coaching,
the financial incentives to start working when initially receiving SFA are sub-optimal: when
accepting a low-wage job, there is only a limited possibility to top up the wage earnings with the
cash transfer30. These income disregards could be expanded or converted into a negative income
tax, in order to increase the expected net gains from a formal job. Since women and ethnic
minorities are disproportionately likely to go to these low-wage jobs, it is likely that these design
features of the SFA are particularly restrictive to labor force participation among these groups.31

In terms of unemployment insurance and benefits, design features could be improved but
their low prevalence makes it unlikely that they have a large effect on aggregated

unemployment. Being registered as unemployed is only possible when certain conditions are
met: the individual may not be holding a job, must be able and willing to work and “actively
searching for a job?, and must be ready to accept work offered by the Employment Agency
(World Bank, 2014). However, the definition of active job searching is rather flexible: an
individual who regularly renews his or her registration with the employment agency is
considered to be an active job searcher32, even if the same individual does not engage in any
direct job-search activities. The Government has recently implemented reforms to separate
active and passive job seekers to try to get a clearer picture of the actual registered unemployed.

Despite these design issues, only a fraction – less than 10 percent - of those registered as
unemployed actually receive the unemployment benefit33: many others are ineligible for the
benefit, as conditions for receipt include a record of at least 9 months of continuous work in the
past, or 12 months with breaks in the last 18 months (by default excluding new labor market
entrants). Moreover, the benefit has a maximum duration of 18 months, which is in stark
contrast with the long-term joblessness confronting many Macedonians. For example, among
both Roma and their non-Roma neighbors, more than 90 percent of all working age, inactive
women have been jobless for at least 2.5 years, whereas among men, this is only slightly below
90 percent.34

3.1.2.3 Pensions
Pensions, while providing supporting income, could also reduce labor market
participation, among working age individuals who retire (early). This holds for women in
particular. Pensions are widespread in Macedonia: they are received by 42 percent of all
Macedonian households. Even among households with at least one member of working age (15-
64), 36 percent receive pensions.35 While the official retirement age stands at 62 for women and
64 for men, a substantial share of inactive men and women below these ages report that they are
not looking for jobs because of retirement (Figure 3-10). This share is particularly high among
women. This partly reflects financially attractive early retirement schemes, and relatively lax
eligibility rules not linked to employment conditions for those below retirement age. Moreover,
retirement at the official retirement age is compulsory for those employed in the private sector,
further driving up inactivity rates among older workers.




32 Re-registration is required every 30 days for those receiving the unemployment benefit, and every 60
days for the remainder of registered individuals (World Bank, 2014).

the number of registrants to this day.

Households with pensioners also have significantly lower participation rates among the
remaining household members than households without pensioners. A woman living in a
household with at least one pensioner is much less likely (almost 6 percentage points) to
participate in the labor force than a woman living in a household without pensioners. Among
men, a slightly weaker correlation exists. Among both Roma men and Roma women, these
correlations are stronger for both genders (Annex 2, Model set 3). It should be noted, however,
that for the Roma in particular, these effects may be less relevant at the aggregate level than for
the rest of the population. The Roma receive, on average, a much smaller share of their income
from pensions compared to non-Roma neighbors, especially in households with no income from
work: among these households, only 7 percent of total adult equivalent income comes from
pensions (Figure 3-11). More in-depth work would be needed to better understand what the
mechanisms are through which pensions may impact labor force participation.

3.1.3 Labor Market Regulations
Several gender equality and anti-discrimination laws, as well as related governmental
action plans, have recently been implemented in Macedonia. As such, the basic legislative
framework underpinning gender-equality and non-discrimination based on ethnicity are
currently in place.36 However, in more subtle ways, certain laws and other labor market
regulations may still actively contribute to unequal labor market outcomes.

In 2005, the Labor Relations Act was implemented, providing a legislative framework for
various forms of employment contracts. Reforms focused on four key issues. First, more
flexibility was introduced in the types of labor contracts permitted and clarified the language of
provisions governing part-time and fixed-term contracts. Second, more flexibility was built into
overtime provisions. Third, they simplified redundancy procedures to make compliance easier
and less costly. Fourth, they made changes to the collective bargaining framework, including
reforms that secured the law’s compliance with International Labor Organization standards
(Kuddo, 2013: 11). In 2012, reforms were also enacted to make seasonal contracts more
effective. Table 3-1 provides an overview of key labor regulation indicators.

However, in spite of these recent reforms, key sources of rigidity remain linked to a firm’s
limited ability to hire and fire staff, and treatment of female employees. Severance pay is
high by international standards, affecting a firm’s ability to fire and hence hire new employees.
Further regulations linked to duration of staff probationary periods and layoffs can especially
hamper the dynamism of small firms (Kuddo, 2013). Women in particular are affected; labor
laws intended to protect women, for example through the provision of relatively long maternity
leave, limited working hours, and lower retirement ages, can affect a firm’s decision to hire
female employees (World Bank, 2013).

Still, overall hiring and firing legislation in Macedonia has become relatively flexible over
the years. As Figure 3-12 shows, overall legislation governing hiring and firing is considered
relatively flexible by the private sector, when compared to other countries in the region. That
said, private sector firms do complain about uncertainty in the interpretation of legislation, and
unevenness in its application (Kuddo, 2013). Hence, strengthening labor inspectorates, tackling
information asymmetries in terms of rules and regulations and improving transparency remain
important parts of the reform agenda in Macedonia.

3.2 Education and Skills
Levels of education remain a key determinant of labor market participation and earnings
in Macedonia. Regression analysis shows that people with primary education are 22 percentage
points more likely than those without completed primary education to participate in the labor
market. Completion of secondary education has a similar correlation with labor force
participation, and completion of tertiary education raises this figure to 29 percentage points
(Annex 2, Model set 1). Indeed, a majority of newly created jobs benefit those with higher levels
of education (Figure 3-13). Furthermore, and despite a tremendous expansion in tertiary
education in recent years, returns to education, in the form of higher wages, have increased
more for the tertiary educated as compared to less skilled workers, emphasizing the divergence
between educated/higher earning and less educated/lower earning groups (Figure 3-14).

For those who are jobless and do not have the appropriate levels of education, getting a
job would not be easy even if the economy were creating jobs. Analysis shows that the
education profile of the unemployed does not match the profile of jobs that the Macedonian
economy has created in recent years (Figure 3-15). While those with tertiary and secondary
education would find jobs, those with less education would not be able to find any jobs. Skills
upgrading is, therefore, critical, as the country moves forward.

While education is critical for accessing economic opportunities, women and ethnic
minorities have less formal education. A far lower share of women than men completes at
least some education: most women, a total of 51 percent, does not go beyond primary education
(Figure 3-16). In addition to the potential direct effect of low education levels on participation –
i.e. a lack of job-relevant skills, there seems to be a second restriction: traditional norms
preventing integration into the workforce generally have a more potent effect on women with
low education levels. Indeed, among individuals with tertiary and secondary education, the
gender gap in participation disappears or becomes much smaller (Gamberoni and Posadas,
2012). The good news here is that educational attainment has increased significantly among
women in recent years: younger generations of women are increasingly well educated (Arias,
et.al, 2014).

In terms of ethnicity, the regional Roma survey shows that Roma attain much lower levels
of education than their non-Roma neighbors (Figure 3-17). More than half of all Roma
surveyed have not completed primary education, as compared to 28 percent of their non-Roma
neighbors. Conversely, only 1 percent of Roma have completed tertiary education, compared to
14-15 percent of their non-Roma neighbors. Education levels are also lower among Roma
women as compared to Roma men, with a much stronger gender gap than that found among
both non-Roma neighbors and the general population. This affects both their expectations for

employment (see Section 3.1.1) and the jobs that they are qualified to attain. Among youth,
many are not only jobless, but are also out of school (Box 3-1).

                    Box 3-1: NEET among Roma and Non-Roma Neighbors in Macedonia


In other countries in the region, like in Macedonia, Roma households still face extremely
high levels of insecurity in relation to very basic needs. In Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, more than two third of all Roma describe their economic
situation as ‘unsafe’. Similarly, many Roma families depend on social assistance. This lack of
economic safety reflects low levels of disposable income and employment. Across countries in
the region, the Roma have a per capita disposable income that is less than half of the average
disposable income in these countries – and as little as 26% in Romania. As for employment rates,
it stands out that in all countries surveyed, the Roma are lagging behind as compared to the
general population. This gap is particularly large among women. Roma women in Macedonia
have an extremely low employment rate, with only Slovakia showing an even slightly lower
outcome for this group.

Among young Roma aged 15-19, only 50 percent is either in school or has a job. The
remaining half is either unemployed (8 percent) or inactive (42 percent). Among non-
Roma neighbors of the same age, as much as 76 percent are in school or working (Figure
3-18). 15 to 19 year old Roma in Macedonia show the second highest level of inactivity,
excluding those enrolled in school, among Eastern European countries surveyed. Non school-
related inactivity rates are also significantly higher among the Roma in the 15 to 19 year age
bracket compared to non-Roma neighbors within Macedonia, for which this figure is only 18
percent. Among 20 to 24 year olds, this gap narrows to 11 percentage points (44 percent of
Roma and 33 percent of non-Roma report non school-related inactivity). Moreover, it should be

noted that differences between Roma and non-Roma that are not in school show up mainly in
terms of labor force participation, whereas levels of unemployment are very similar.

Mainly for women, this pattern among younger age groups sets in motion a cycle of
inactivity throughout the rest of their lives: among both male and female Roma, the share
of individuals that is Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET), increases with
age. However, for men, this increase is largely driven by unemployment, whereas for
women, the main driver is inactivity (Figure 3-19 & 3-20). The percentage of individuals
who are NEET increases with advancing age for both men and women. Among this group of
NEET individuals, between the ages 15-54, the proportion of men who are unemployed
increases much more than among women. For NEET women, inactivity increases from 50
percent to 65 percent over this period, whereas unemployment remains low. Above the age of
54, the proportion of men and women who are in education and / or employment, or are
unemployed, decreases drastically, while the proportion of men and women who are inactive
increases. Compared to the general population, Roma women are much more likely to be
inactive and not in school across all age groups. For men, non-school related inactivity and
unemployment are both higher among Roma as compared to the general population.

Overall, ethnic Macedonians achieve higher levels of education than any other ethnic
group. For ethnic Albanians and the ethnic Turkish, the share of the population with at least
secondary education is approximately 20 percent: for ethnic Roma, it is just over half that figure,
at 12 percent. As shown in Figure 3-21, the gender gap in labor force participation is much larger
among those who did not go beyond primary education. Women with only primary education or
less are 2.5 times less likely than men with the same level of education to participate in the labor
force, whereas this number shrinks to approximately 1.2 times for those with incomplete or
complete secondary education. An increase in the level of education appears to have a greater
impact on female than on male labor force participation; among those with tertiary education,
the gender gap is almost non-existent. Indeed, when controlling for background characteristics,
education has a much stronger correlation with women’s likelihood to participate in the labor
force than with men’s. For both completion of secondary and tertiary education, this effect is
almost four times as big for women as it is for men (Figure 3-22). This could potentially be
related to the fact that women without any education have poorer employment prospects and
are also more likely to accept and adhere to traditional gender norms.

Roma with low levels of education are particularly unlikely to participate in the labor
force. This holds primarily for Roma women and to a lesser extent for Roma men. Among
working age Roma women who have not completed primary education, 70 percent does not
participate in the labor force. This drops to 29 percent among Roma women with tertiary
education. At the same time, unemployment rates among those with tertiary education are
extremely high, for both Roma men and Roma women.

Among Roma, the most prominent reason to leave school before completion of secondary
education appears to be linked to school costs (Figure 3-23). The families of 80 percent of
Roma boys and 61 percent of Roma girls who stopped attending school between the ages 8 - 12
reported this reason; these figures drop to 55 percent of boys and 50 percent of girls among
those aged 17 - 20. More Roma boys report this reason across all age groups compared to Roma
girls. On the other hand, Roma girls are more likely to quote other reasons: 6 percent of Roma
girls between the ages 8-12 indicate that they stopped going to school due to safety concerns,
while no Roma boys in the same age group see this as a reason to stop school. Among older girls,
a substantial proportion stopped attending school due to marriage – 7 percent of 13-16 year
olds and 11 percent of 17-20 year olds. Another commonly reported reason for leaving school
among 13-16 and 17-20 year olds of both genders is that they are judged to be sufficiently
educated (17 percent of 13-16 year old Roma boys and 22 percent of 17-20 year old Roma
boys; 9 percent and 15 percent among Roma girls, for the respective age groups). Addressing
these constraints will be key in improving the chances of younger generations of Roma.

Being a well-educated worker in the 21st century requires more than formal educational
attainment, and this could be particularly important for traditionally disadvantaged
groups. In Macedonia, like in many other countries, employers not only look for technical skills,
but also for soft skills. Employers in Macedonia report that, across ethnic groups, both men and
women lack certain essential skills despite increasing levels of formal education (Figure 3-24).
Over 35 percent of firms reported that young people lacked responsibility and reliability, while
over 30 percent indicate that young workers needed to show more motivation and commitment
(World Bank, 2013). A lack of such fundamental skills can be expected to seriously impair career
prospects, especially as the economy modernizes and skills demanded by employers become
less routine and more complex, requiring workers that are adaptable and with transferable
skills. These skills of the ‘new economy’ are complex cognitive skills but also socio-emotional
ones such as grit, discipline, ability to work in teams, manage relationships with clients, showing
up on time, etc. Critically, the international evidence suggests that the gains from improving
these socio-emotional sills can be particularly important for disadvantaged groups, such as
youth out of school and work or those with lower levels of education.37

Specific types of skills acquired by women may be less in demand among employers,
which may result in their departure from the labor force over time. Women tend to achieve
qualifications in different subjects than men, generally with a less quantitative focus. In total, 70
percent of women choose to study either a general program, or a program in a social science
related field such as business or law. Contrastingly, only 54 percent of men choose to study these
subjects. By contrast, three times more men than women choose to study engineering,
production, or construction (Figure 3-25). Both men and women who complete general
programs have lower employment and participation rates than those who complete other fields
of study: the employment rate among women who complete general programs is 19 percent, and
the participation rate is 27 percent among this group. This is much lower than for other fields –
employment rates for women who study other fields range between 42 and 53 percent, while
participation rates range between 62 and 76 percent (Figure 3-26).

Once out of the formal education system, few men and women undertake further training.
One of the key reasons for not furthering one’s education in the past month, for both men and
women, is a lack of interest. In addition, significantly more women than men cite ‘family
obligations’ as a primary reason not to undertake educational activities in the past month (18.5
percent among women and 1.8 percent among men) (Gamberoni and Posadas, 2012). Men and
women also appear to have differing attitudes to additional training. In focus groups, ethnic
Macedonian, Roma, and ethnic Serbian women with various levels of educational attainment
seemed very open to the idea of additional training, provided that their prospects of future
employment would improve – some noted that they would need to have a guarantee of
employment or free training, as they are unable to take on the financial burden. Younger, more
educated ethnic Albanian women were also enthusiastic towards training, but others were
hesitant, citing that they believed they may not get approval from their husbands, that they
would not have time for training in addition to their domestic responsibilities, or that they do
not actually want to work.38

Moreover, women of all ethnicities generally have low awareness of the training
opportunities available to them. Most women in focus group discussions were aware of the
importance of languages and computer literacy, but few were involved in training in these areas.
Women from ethnic minorities in the sample were often unaware of the possibilities for
professional enhancements available to them, frequently at no cost. Several participants noted
that they did not even attempt to enroll in training organized for free by the Macedonian
government, as they are certain that only members of the political parties in power would be
invited to participate. However, should they be available, low skilled participants (especially
ethnic Albanian and ethnic Turkish women) felt most comfortable visiting training sessions
organized by local female NGO’s rather than other organizations (World Bank, 2008).

Lack of work experience and the skills that are gained on the job are additional obstacles
to employment, which are more likely to affect women and ethnic minorities. In 2011, for
example, 33 percent of men, and 34 percent of women, participating in the labor force, were
unemployed. However, among women, a much larger share of the unemployed has never had a
job than among men (71 percent versus 49 percent). Hence, it is likely that a lack of relevant
skills obtained through work experience is much more constraining for women than for men.

Recent policy-measures have improved access to tertiary education, but important steps
remain to be taken to complete the transition to an ‘access for all’ model, especially at
lower levels of education. Secondary education has recently been made compulsory (Angel-
Urdinola, 2008), and local university branches have been established in the smaller towns and
cities, broadening access to those in the countryside. As pointed out by an urban ethnic Albanian
woman, “Nowadays, going to university is a trend and everyone enrolls?. Young Roma women
noted that Roma students have a possibility to obtain free books and there are scholarships for
Roma students to enroll in university. Young Roma men confirmed that: “In recent years there is
bigger number of people who finish high school and university?. Focus group participants across
communities also noted that increasingly, women actually achieve higher levels of education
than their male counterparts39. While these trends have an important effect on the gender-
norms that used to keep women out of the labor force, there is also a darker side to this

development: although educational institutions are available, many youth still do not manage to
find work after they graduate. This is fueled by both a mismatch in skills, as described earlier,
and a generally low demand for workers. Macedonian rural women participating in a focus
group discussion underlined this: “They [men] work at [a] car wash after finishing college...?, and
a young man from Skopje added: “It’s under-appreciating… no one would like to work a hard-
labor job if he finished economics…?. In spite of the fact that gender norms seem to be changing
slowly, the norm is still that when a girl graduates, she should either look for work, or get
married, especially in rural and poor urban communities – and most girls continue to join the
second group40. We now turn our attention to these other barriers to work.

3.3 Barriers to Work
Various barriers to participation exist among women and ethnic minorities including
social norms, a lack of flexible work arrangements, limited child and elderly care options,
and limited access to professional networks and productive inputs(see Box 3-2), . For
example, the gender gap in labor market participation seems to be driven, in part, by women
who, within their households, are held responsible for taking care of the family. The following
sections will discuss these various barriers, and the interactions between them.


             Box 3-2: Examples of Barriers to Work among Women and Ethnic
             Minorities


Women of different ethnic minority backgrounds report different reasons for not looking
for work. Focus group discussions indicate that being married and advanced age are
discouraging factors specific to ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Serbian women, while ethnic
Albanian women are hampered by the attitudes of their families and husbands toward female
employment (Gamberoni and Posadas, 2012; Angel-Urdinola, 2008). Discussions also revealed
that women’s preconceived notions discouraged them from participating in the labor market:
for example, ethnic Turkish and ethnic Albanian women with lower education stated that they
did not believe they would get jobs with their qualifications. Meanwhile, educated women of
these ethnicities in the focus groups indicated that they were only willing to work under certain
conditions, namely in public sector jobs with full benefits (Gamberoni and Posadas, 2012). Some
ethnic Albanian, ethnic Turkish, and Roma women find that issues related to their ethnicity limit
their employment possibilities (Angel-Urdinola 2008). Key issues included traditional norms
limiting women to household work and preventing education, and discrimination.

3.3.1 Social Norms and Discrimination
Many women leave the labor force, or do not join it in the first place, due to household-
and family care responsibilities. “It is more difficult for a woman, especially with a young child.
She is responsible for the childrearing, the domestic activities. Men don’t face these barriers?41 (48
year old mother of two from a community in Skopje)42. Close to half of all inactive women report

40 World Bank: Qualitative interviews (2013).
41 World Bank: Qualitative interviews (2013).
42 Roma women in particular often feel a strong pressure to marry young and bear children soon

afterwards. Reports on whether or not women have a say in decisions on family formation are mixed. On
average, sampled Roma individuals expect girls to marry by the age of 21, and have children by 22 years
old, while their non-Roma neighbors expect, on average, girls to bear children two years later, at the age of

                                                     47
that they are inactive because of family reasons, compared to only a few percent of men. Among
women aged 30 - 44, this share rises to 92 - 93 percent of all women outside the labor force
(Figure 3-27), and inactive women citing this reason comprise just under half of the entire
female population between the ages 25 - 49. By contrast, men often exit the labor force to study
or – among older age cohorts – to retire. In addition, women often cite their marital status as a
restrictive factor to working or looking for work (Gamberoni and Posadas, 2012).

These gender roles are buttressed on strong social norms, which also affect many
employed women and women who are not (yet) married. Even among the employed,
women spend more time on family obligations than men. The largest disparity exists between
couples whose youngest child is 0-6 years: on average, Macedonian women in such
circumstances spend five more hours per day on housework than men (Figure 3-28). Even
among unmarried women, participation in the labor market may not be approved by the family:
“If she is married, her husband may not allow her to work, so that is the main reason why young
girls here in [the village] will not be looking for a job. In some cases, the parents of the young
woman may also not allow her to work?43 (young woman from a Roma community in Skopje).

Traditional gender roles are often more strongly entrenched among ethnic minorities in
Macedonia. In focus group discussions, many men of Roma and Albanian ethnicity express
strong approval of traditional gender relations Especially in ethnic Albanian communities, the
family patriarch has a strong influence and is able to impact issues such as who will be educated,
who will work, and which professions are ‘suitable’ for women. The practice of men or elderly
family members deciding on female employment issues also remains in some Roma and
ethnically Turkish families. In focus groups, ethnic Albanian and ethnic Serbian women indicate
that they are most discouraged from work by traditional norms in their community, and the
corresponding restrictive attitudes of their marital partners. At the same time, focus group
discussions show that many ethnic Macedonian men do not see female employment as
contradictory to women’s domestic tasks, and believe that female employment should be
supported for reasons of financial security (World Bank, 2008).

Women’s own beliefs regarding their place in society may act as a barrier to participation,
especially for some ethnic minorities. Some women in these communities do not even
consider the possibility of working, due to their belief that their primary responsibility is to be a
good housewife. Low skilled women from ethnic Albanian and Roma communities in particular
report to feel less comfortable working outside their homes and communities, though they do
not object to working per se, since they consider their domestic tasks to be work (World Bank,
2008).

In addition to social norms that govern attitudes towards female employment generally,
these norms also affect what types of jobs are considered appropriate for women. For
example, men are deemed fit for physically demanding jobs, whereas women are often seen as
only qualified for lighter types of work, preferably in a closed environment. This distinction is
much more pronounced among the poor44. Similarly, some men indicate that they believe
women should only work for a few hours a day and not full time (Government of Macedonia,
2008). Often it is not well regarded for women to fulfill low-skilled occupations such as a
waitress, cleaner, or bus driver. Women themselves may be willing to work in such roles, but the
threat of community disapproval is a strong deterrent to employment. Matching these
traditional gender roles, many also believe that women are less suitable for starting a business
than men45. Tellingly, some men, especially among ethnic Albanian, ethnic Turkish, and Roma
communities, report that they would allow their wives to work if they were working alongside
their husbands, for example, in running a joint business, or if they were highly educated, as long
as they did not have many contacts with men and were able to find appropriate transport
(World Bank, 2008).

Although social norms can take time to change, they can change. In focus group discussions,
across ethnic communities it becomes clear that traditional gender norms are more strongly
supported by older generations, including older women. Similarly, gender roles also differ
significantly by levels of education (World Bank, 2008).

Beyond traditional social norms, discrimination remains an issue for women in general.
Despite appropriate legislation against discrimination, survey results show discrimination
towards women in the job market in Macedonia: in 2001, 43 percent of survey respondents
agreed that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce.

Discrimination based on ethnicity also exists. One third of Roma report feeling discriminated
against in the last 12 months due to their ethnicity, while only one in ten of their non-Roma
neighbors report feeling the same (Figure 3-29). In addition, Roma men report higher levels of
discrimination than Roma women (38 percent of men and 31 percent of women)46. When
background characteristics are taken into account, statistical analysis shows that Roma are still
25 percentage points more likely to feel discriminated against compared to their non-Roma
neighbors (Annex 2, Model set 5).

(15+) individual per surveyed household.

Discrimination on the labor market remains an important issue for Roma. Just over a
quarter of all Roma who looked for a job in the past 12 months reported experiencing
discrimination. Of these, men were more likely to report discrimination than women – 28
percent of men reported experiencing discrimination, compared to 18 percent of women (Figure
3-30). Discrimination when searching for a job is much more prevalent in urban than rural
areas, with 25 percent of respondents reporting discrimination in the last 12 months among
urban Roma, as compared to 12 percent among rural Roma. Once at work, discrimination
continues to be reported: 21 percent of Roma report experiencing discrimination at work in the
last 12 months on the basis of ethnicity. Women are more affected than men, with 22 percent of
working Roma women reporting ethnic discrimination in the last year, compared to 20 percent
of men.

46This gender difference may be explained by the fact that Roma women often remain in the home and in
the community more than their male counterparts, and as such, may have less contact with other
communities.

Few incidents of discrimination are reported to the authorities, however. Only 5 percent
of Roma who report discrimination in the last 12 months while searching for a job reported the
incident to officials. This figure rises to 11 percent among Roma who experience discrimination
at work. Such low levels of reporting may be due to the mistaken assumption among the Roma
that they have no recourse in cases of discrimination. 40 percent of Roma surveyed believed that
no laws exist in Macedonia forbidding discrimination. A majority (65 percent) of Roma also do
not know of any organizations that can provide support in cases of discrimination.

3.3.2 Availability of Affordable Child and Elderly Care Options
Child and elderly care options are often limited. A large proportion of ethnic Albanian
women, as well as a smaller number of women from other ethnic communities, notes that their
care responsibilities do not allow them to work. These women are generally responsible for the
care of small children or of ill or elderly family members, or both (World Bank, 2008). Preschool
enrollment rates also remain low in Macedonia, standing at only 25 percent compared to an
average enrollment of 75 percent in Europe and Central Asia47. Furthermore, qualitative data
shows that even when children do attend preschool, women are still expected to stay at home, in
case the children are unable to attend, for example due to illness48. Similarly, focus group
discussions show that Macedonians are generally unsatisfied with the help provided for older
community members: for example, one focus group participant remarked that “social assistance
for an older person cannot help you a lot, because that money is not enough for medicine […] and
you have other necessary things to buy or to provide for an older person?49.

This lack of affordable child and elderly care options can also a barrier to participation
for women. This can be binding, especially where gender-norms are relatively flexible and
would allow women to work if they found adequate solutions for child and elderly care (World
Bank, 2013).

3.3.3 Flexible Work Arrangements
Flexible and part-time work arrangements are largely lacking in Macedonia, affecting
women in particular. Part-time labor makes up 6 percent of employment in Macedonia, much
lower than the EU-27 rate of 20 percent. The disparity in these figures is driven by a large

                                                          51
difference in rates of part time employment among women: in 2011, 32 percent of employed
women in EU-27 were employed part-time, as compared to only 7 percent of Macedonian
women50. This low prevalence of part-time employment may arise from a combination of tax and
benefit incentives, labor regulations and social attitudes towards work that favor full-time
employment.

Encouraging flexible work arrangements in Macedonia would allow more women to enter
the work force. Part-time or home-based work allows women to combine a job with taking care
of their families or with studies. It can also help women transition into full time work should
they decide to do so (Arias et al., 2014). At present, no laws exist in Macedonia to give employees
with minor children the right to request part time or flexible work51. Such provisions would also
help keep older workers active for longer (Arias et al., 2014).

3.3.4 Mobility and Access to Networks / Inputs
Internal labor mobility, i.e. the movement of workers to cities and regions where most job
opportunities exist, is limited in Macedonia. Among the overall Macedonian population,
about 40 percent of those aged 18-64 indicates a willingness to move to another city for work,
but only slightly more than 10 percent did indeed move for work in the past two decades (Arias
et al., 2014)52. This low internal mobility rate stands in contrast with the relatively high
differences in labor market conditions across regions in Macedonia. For example, compared to
an average unemployment rate of 31 percent for the country as a whole, the region with the
highest unemployment rate, the Northeast, stood at 53 percent in 2012, whereas the lowest
regional unemployment rate, recorded in the Southeast, was 14 percent53. With these gaps, one
would expect more people to move from regions with high unemployment rates to regions with
low unemployment rates.

Access to transportation in particular is seen as a constraint, both for internal mobility of
workers and for commuting within the city or area of residence. This is clearly an issue
among Roma54. Infrastructure is also particularly problematic for women living in larger cities
like Skopje and Bitola, or in nearby villages. The lack of (affordable and safe) transportation is a
constraint to commuting. In Bitola, women in focus groups explain that the lack of bus stations in
the area means that they are more likely to remain at home as caregivers. Ethnic Albanian men
note that one of the reasons why their wives do not work is the lack of adequate transportation –
namely women-only buses, as social norms dictate that women should not ride in buses with
men (World Bank, 2008).

As discussed in Arias et al. (2014), barriers to internal labor mobility—in addition to fear
of losing personal connections— are usually associated with the poor functioning of
housing and rental markets, mortgage and credit markets, the existence of administrative
barriers or difficulties in accessing social benefits when moving. In Macedonia, the
traditional geographic concentration of ethnic groups may also be a factor contributing to low

Macedonia. See, for example, Bornarova and Janeska (2012). Here, we focus mostly on internal labor
mobility, a much less studied area.

internal mobility. Although some of the barriers to internal mobility have been researched, more
detailed analysis is needed to fully determine what restricts Macedonians in moving internally
for work-related reasons.

Even if people move to the most dynamic areas, personal and political networks are seen
as critical for getting a job. Macedonians of all ethnicities and both genders cite a lack of
personal connections, nepotism, and a lack of affiliation with the political parties in power as a
reason for inactivity (World Bank, 2008; Angel-Urdinola, 2008): “Hard working men, capable,
skilled, seeking work and who really need a job to raise their families cannot get a job only because
of the political parties. The people in position first employ their family, then relatives, then friends,
and at the very end if something is left it is for those people,?55 (Key Informant from a village near
Ki?evo). With this in mind, young people often become members of political parties, in the hope
that this will lead to employment.

Strong connections are also considered pivotal to gain employment in private companies:
employment prospects are considered poor unless one is a close friend or relative of the
employer56 (World Bank, 2008). Employment Agency officials confirm that companies primarily
recruit their staff through “informal channels and … contacts with relatives and friends?57,
sidelining recruitment agencies as a potential source of hires. Ethnic minorities, such as the
Roma and ethnic Albanians, particularly report suffering from a lack of connections (World
Bank, 2008).

Beyond personal and professional networks, limited access to productive inputs –
especially capital – can be a constraint to labor market participation, in particular among
women, youth and ethnic minorities. Both men and women highlight a lack of capital as the
main reason for business failure, though once in business, there does not appear to be a
difference between genders in the ability to access credit (Gamberoni and Posadas, 2012). In
addition, qualitative research highlights the risk of debt as an additional factor that discourages
potential entrepreneurs58.



4 Increasing Labor Force Participation: Policy Entry
  Points
This report has highlighted a number of features of labor force participation in
Macedonia, emphasizing gender and ethnicity gaps. Furthermore, the report has identified a
number of causes for these patterns, including policy-induced incentive structures, skills gaps,
and group-specific barriers. Among the incentives analyzed, the lack of progressivity in the tax
system and the impact of pensions stand out as particularly influential. Skills and educational
constraints are also limiting, and are likely to become increasingly so as the Macedonian
economy modernizes. Among the group-specific barriers, social norms and discrimination stand
out. Importantly, many of the other barriers faced by (ethnic minority) women are somehow
induced or reinforced by commonly accepted gender norms. This is the case for childcare and
elderly care options, flexible work arrangements, and access to relevant inputs and networks.

In this light, the current section identifies a number of key priorities for public policy to
increase labor force participation among disadvantaged groups. These cover measures
aimed at (i) improving work incentives for individuals and employers; and (ii) broadening
access to training and jobs for women and ethnic minorities. Some of these policy
recommendations can have important fiscal implications, and their desirability needs to be
balanced against other priorities and fiscal sustainability goals. We highlight when a fiscal
assessment is particularly important.

4.1 Improving Work Incentives for Individuals and Employers
Recommendation 1: Rationalize existing schemes aimed at subsidizing employment of
vulnerable groups. Macedonia has multiple programs in place that subsidize employment
among youth, those with low levels of education and those receiving social assistance. Yet, these
programs are very fragmented and often show overlap. This increases costs and complexity, and
makes it difficult to determine which programs or elements of programs really work. While
employment subsidies can play a role in providing workers obstructed by weak social or
professional ties or by social stigma with an entry point into the labor market, they can also have
a displacement effect. Moreover, these programs can be expensive, making monitoring and
evaluation of their success, and of any displacement effects, all the more crucial. A first step in
establishing priorities and clear objectives for these programs could consist of a critical
assessment of what exists, followed by the design of mechanisms to measure which programs
are most cost-effective. Fiscal savings could then be redirected at other priority areas.

Recommendation 2: Increase the level of progressivity of labor taxation. There are two
major benefits to introducing a more progressive tax system in Macedonia. First, this would
incentivize second earners and part-time workers (who are usually low wage earners) to enter
the labor force instead of remaining inactive. Second, this measure could reduce informal
employment, if combined with a strengthening of the Public Revenue Office and the offering of
useful business services conditional on formalization. A detailed fiscal assessment to determine
appropriate rates and tax bases is necessary. Concretely, the government could consider
relaxing the current reference wage system. To limit underreporting of wages and hours, the
government could try a ‘double reporting’ system as in the Netherlands, letting both the
employer and the employee report the number of hours worked and earnings independently
from one another. Finally, the government can explore options for establishing either a negative
income tax or an earned income tax credit that essentially reduce tax liabilities for people who
work but have low earnings. The US and the UK have these tax credits, which have been shown
to increase participation especially among women59.

Recommendation 3: Raise awareness of the benefits of formalization, and reduce the
costs associated to the informal-formal transition, especially for start-ups and other small
businesses. Almost 55 percent of formal businesses in Macedonia currently identify their
competition with informal businesses as a major constraint60. Almost 3 out of 4 formal
businesses face competition from informal businesses. An initial reduction in tax rates over the
past few years has been associated with more hiring in formal firms, and a reduction in wage


59 These tax credit schemes are discussed in a number of papers: see Blundell and Brewer 2000; Blundell,
Duncan, and Meghir 2002; Chetty and Saez 2009; Hotz and Scholz 2001; Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001; and
Trampe 2007.

arrears (Kuddo, 2013). However, the costs of formalization could be decreased further. This
could be accompanied by incentives for currently informal firms to transition, such as a one-time
tax benefit upon formalization, combined with business services of use to the firms. On the side
of workers, allowing families to combine social benefits with work at low wages, at least for
some time, upon transitioning to formal work may be a powerful incentive. In particular, income
disregards which are new in Macedonia remain small, and could be expanded. Mojsoska
(forthcoming) examines the particular case of the Earned Income Tax Credit in Macedonia,
including different possible structures and their fiscal and labor force participation implications.

Recommendation 4: Equalize the retirement age for men and women. With the current
two-year gap in retirement age for men as compared to women, there are strong incentives for
women to leave the labor force much earlier than men. Increasing the official retirement age
would allow women to remain active for longer. In order to lower government expenses related
to retirement, a proxy-means test based pension structure could be considered (Schwarz and
Arias, 2014). Savings from this and extended working lives could be then redirected to other
priorities.

Recommendation 5: Reduce the costs associated with hiring and firing. Reducing severance
pay, in combination with a strengthening of the unemployment benefit system, could induce
firms to hire more workers formally while still providing workers with appropriate protection.
As discussed in Kuddo (2013), there are many different ways in which countries have gone
about accomplishing these twin goals, including in the presence of large informal sectors. In
addition, the government could consider rethinking the legal framework governing
apprenticeships, in order to give youth an entry point into the world of work. As we have argued
in this report, this could be particularly beneficial for youth from disadvantaged backgrounds.
See Kuddo (2013) for a detailed discussion on labor regulation options for Macedonia.

Recommendation 6: Introduce more strict enforcement of discrimination laws and
regulations on labor conditions, particularly in the private sector. Private sector violations
of worker’s rights are widely recognized among Macedonians61, and cited in the relevant
literature (e.g. Kuddo, 2013). Weak enforcement of discrimination laws and labor regulations in
the private sector exerts significant downward pressure on workers’ motivation to look for jobs
outside the government. Regarding labor inspections in particular, adequate recruitment,
staffing and resources – including training – are crucial. Moreover, the inspection-burden on
businesses could be reduced by integrating various types of risk-based inspections, and
compliance could be facilitated through a more elaborate focus on prevention and education
(Kuddo, 2013). With respect to discrimination, an accessible channel to report offences, with
adequate follow-up procedures that include disciplinary action towards the offender could be a
welcome first step.

4.2 Broadening Access to Training and Jobs for Women and Ethnic
    Minorities
Recommendation 1: Continue to reform the education sector, to become more inclusive
with respect to both women and ethnic minorities. Recent trends in increased educational
enrolment are welcomed, but further improvement is needed to give women and ethnic
minorities a fair chance on the labor market. This starts with access to preschool and early-

childhood education. Compulsory attendance of primary and secondary education is a step in
the right direction. Implementation would further benefit from a critical analysis of potential
cost barriers to education, including the opportunity cost associated with not contributing to the
household’s overall income. Macedonia’s Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program has proven
to be successful in increasing secondary school enrollment among families receiving social
assistance, and especially among older youth who usually drop out before finishing (Armand
and Carneiro, forthcoming). Ensuring resources for this program, beyond ongoing World Bank
support, will be an important challenge. So will be linking this program with an effective
transition to the labor market for beneficiaries (see more on this below). Beyond enrollment,
there is also an important agenda in monitoring quality, especially gaps in quality across
relevant socio-economic groups. The participation of Macedonia in the Program for
International Student Assessment (PISA), starting in 2015, will be an important opportunity to
identify critical inequalities in terms of the quality of the more ‘technical’ aspects of education.
At the same time, socio-emotional skills, such as independent learning or organization skills, are
not yet measured.

Recommendation 2: Within education and training systems, increase the focus on job-
relevant skills – i.e. not only cognitive and technical, but also socio-emotional skills. A
well-educated worker today is one that can quickly adapt to a changing labor market: employers
increasingly cite skills such as discipline, client orientation, teamwork and perseverance as
critical for productivity and employment. In designing policies that tackle these issues,
Macedonia can look to many other countries that face the same problems, and have come up
with innovative approaches. As discussed in Mourshed, Farrell and Barton (2012), innovative
and effective programs around the world have two important elements in common. First, they
share a strong collaboration between education providers and employers. Employers might help
to design curricula and offer their employees as faculty, for example, while education providers
may have students spend half their time on a job site, and secure them hiring guarantees.
Second, employers and education providers work with their students early and intensely,
sometimes with employers committing to hire youth before they are enrolled in a program to
build their skills.

This agenda also calls for the design training programs that target the specific
employability constraints of youth from disadvantaged backgrounds. Several programs
aimed at youth from disadvantaged backgrounds have been carefully evaluated, especially in
Latin America. These programs combine technical training with interventions specifically
designed for the target group and focus, for example, on building networks or self-esteem. The
example of such a ‘Jovenes’ program in the Dominican Republic could be useful (Box 4-1).


            Box 4-1: Juventud y Empleo


Aiming to improve the employability of youth at risk, the Dominican Republic started
implementing a labor market insertion program in 2002, called Juventud y Empleo. It
provides life- and technical skills training combined with private sector internships. The target
individuals are young Dominicans aged 16-29 who dropped out of school before finishing
secondary education. To qualify, these youth must be unemployed, underemployed or inactive
and below a certain poverty threshold, defined based on their residential area and household


                                                56
income. The program consists of 225 hours of in-class training, divided into Life Skills training
(75 hours) and Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET, 150 hours), complemented
by 2 months (224 hours) of on-the-job learning through and internship. The life skills module
focuses on four competencies: motivation (self-esteem, interpersonal relationships and self-
fulfillment), life at work, social skills and job search. The courses offered in the TVET
immediately relate to a specific job family, like salesman, beautician, waiter or pharmacy clerk.
These courses are matched to private sector demand. The average cost per participant is
estimated to be USD 400, which includes a daily stipend, transportation subsidies and medical
and accident insurance. The COS (Centros Operativos del Sistema), pre-certified private training
providers, and the Ministry of Labor are in charge of implementation.

From the pool of eligible applicants, participants are selected randomly for two different
treatments, and some are assigned to a control group: the first group receives only the life
skills training while the second group benefits from both the life skills and the TVET modules.
Additionally, some applicants are left aside from the intervention and considered the control
group. Juventud y Empleo incorporated its random design from the very beginning, allowing for
rigorous impact evaluations. Given that there are two treatment groups, the effects from both
learning modules can be isolated. The effects can be estimated by comparing ‘baseline
information’, gathered at the moment of application to the program, to the data collected from
three longitudinal phone interviews, as well as from a final household survey.

The availability of impact evaluations allowed for continuous improvements according to
the lessons learned from previous cohorts. As of today, three impact evaluations have been
conducted: Card et al. (2011) studied the effects of the program on the 2004 cohort, Ibarraran et
al. (2012) analyzed the 2008 cohort and Vezza, Cruces and Amendolaggine (2013) studied the
2008-2009 cohorts. For example, after the first impact evaluation showed limited impact on
employment and wages, the program was modified, focusing on the key components identified
by employers, such as closer collaboration with the private sector and a stronger life skills
component.

The impact evaluation conducted by Vezza, Cruces and Amendolaggine on the 2008-2009
cohorts found that Juventud y Empleo had heterogeneous effects, both by gender and
between the short and the medium run. In the short run, women were found to benefit the
most, experiencing an increase in probability to be employed as well as in their job satisfaction
and expectations to improve their quality of life. Additionally, the probability of having a child
decreased for women participating in both life skills and TVET modules. On the other hand, for
men, increased participation in the labor market was observed in the short run, but this change
was translated into higher unemployment rates for the participants in the life skills module. No
effects were found on the weekly hours worked or on the monthly income for those individuals
who were already working. In the medium run, the impact on labor market participation faded
out and the lower probability to have children for women was reversed. Informality among
working men raised but there was an increase in the expectations to progress both
professionally and economically. Other programs with similar characteristics that have been
implemented in Latin America are Chile Joven, Jóvenes en Acción in Colombia and PROJOVEN in
Peru.




                                               57
Lastly, incentivizing men and women to participate in training programs that counter existing
gender norms could facilitate a change in these normative beliefs62.

Recommendation 3: Use the recent improvements in activation programs as a starting
point for an integrated social protection model that prioritizes activation, building in
conditionalities where needed. A recent World Bank study has highlighted important
limitations to Macedonia’s current activation policies and programs (Box 4-2). Recent
improvements in the functioning of Macedonia’s public employment agency – including more
communication with, and mediation between, employers and job seekers – could provide a good
starting point to change this. By creating an integrated model for social protection, in which any
individual seeking social benefits first goes through a screening to explore possibilities to seek
work, these recent improvements could be leveraged to connect more people to jobs and/or job-
relevant training. Various initiatives implemented in other European countries, such as the UK’s
‘Jobcentre Plus’ model could be seen as examples.


             Box 4-2: Macedonia’s Public Employment Agency: the Road to Active
             Mediation


There is significant room to build on recent reforms in the public employment agency in
Macedonia. In recent focus group discussions, the Public Employment Agency was only rarely
perceived as a meaningful partner in finding a job. In most cases, focus group participants
evaluate the agency as ‘inefficient’. The Employment Agency (EA) representatives are usually
aware of their image among Macedonian citizens, and identify the roots of the problem in the
past inefficiency of the Agency. As the EA representative from a community in Skopje noted:
“There is [a] huge number of people who do not respond to our invitations (…). The problem is that
they still do not trust the Agency: the credibility of the agency has been ruined in the past and we
have to fix this problem. But we are on the right track.? Furthermore, the EA representatives
express dedication to “a new phase in which we are active mediators in the process of employing.
Companies start to believe in us as a good roster for potential workers,?63 (EA representative,
Skopje).

A new World Bank report highlights a number of areas in which the Employment Agency could
make further improvements (World Bank, 2014), and suggests policy measures in these areas:

1)      Tackling the issue of understaffed local offices
2)      Reducing staff time spent on administrative issues
3)      Increasing input from local offices in evaluating the EA’s effectiveness
4)      Setting up evaluations of specific programs offered by the EA
5)      Differentiating cost models by locality
6)      Increasing the accuracy of job descriptions of EA staff
7)      Increasing the focus on interaction with employers
8)      Increasing possibilities for the outsourcing of placement services



62 Additional recommendations in the area of skills development and education can be found in Arias, et al.
(2014).
63 World Bank: Qualitative interviews (2013).


                                                    58
9)      Increasing cooperation with social welfare centers (SWC’s), and more frequent data
        sharing between these two institutions.

Recommendation 4: Initiate a partnership between government, educational institutions
and employers, to: 1) build a national job-search database, including information on
required skills and job orientation strategies, 2) actively assist with skills development.
Based on examples from across Europe and around the globe, Macedonia could consider
building a national job-search database, linking job seekers to useful resources (including
websites where vacancies can be found) and providing them with information on job orientation
and skills requirements for specific functions and industries. Using an integrated approach,
schools could apply this material in the classroom, raising awareness among students on how to
go about making educational and labor market decisions, and what kind of training to look for
during or after upper secondary school. Employers could assist by identifying relevant skill-sets.
In addition, job-search skills, including interviewing techniques and tips for writing resumes
could be helpful.

Recommendation 5: Increase the professionalization and transparency of public
employment. Institutionalizing public service and increasing transparency in the posting and
filling up of public employment positions, with clarity in terms of job requirements, can be an
important step in improving meritocracy in the system. At the same time, it can also reduce rent-
seeking in job search, and improve perceptions of fairness in the distribution of public jobs.

Recommendation 6: Address entrepreneurship constraints that particularly affect
women. More in-depth work is needed to better understand which constraints to
entrepreneurship are the most binding in Macedonia. Globally, many microfinance schemes have
attempted to tackle credit-related constraints, often with success. Examples of these include the
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the Kashf Foundation in Pakistan, and the MI-BOSPO in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Recent evidence in this area suggests that credit has a larger effect when credit
amounts are sufficiently large, and when loan disbursement is combined with business training
– covering the fundamentals of accounting and running a business. Moreover, successful
examples of female entrepreneurs can contribute to a change in commonly held beliefs on the
‘desirability’ of female entrepreneurship64. Entrepreneurship as a skill [also] needs to be more
specifically developed within the national curriculum, not necessarily as a separate subject, but
throughout different subject areas. The curriculum needs to be gender sensitive, discuss the
existent gender stereotypes with regards to entrepreneurship and include examples of
successful female business owners. In addition, accreditation systems could be put in place for
individuals who have skills related to crafts, enabling women who cannot work outside the
home to earn an income (Angel-Urdinola, 2008: 1; see World Bank, 2008).

Recommendation 7: Incentivize work among married women and women with children,
through awareness-raising and provision of care facilities outside the home. Raising
awareness among women on the benefits of work, for both their own welfare and the financial
status of the household, could be an important first step. An important complement to these
awareness-raising activities is the provision of affordable care facilities for children and the
elderly, which could decrease women’s care obligations in the household. Vouchers or subsidies
for low-income families could be helpful in ensuring that disadvantaged groups have access.

64‘Miss Entrepreneur Africa’ is an example of a project that achieves such a ch ange in gender norms. See
http://missentrepreneurafrica.net/.

                                                   59
Moreover, such facilities would create welcome new jobs. A thorough fiscal assessment and
study of different models for the provision of child care would be the first step.

Annex 1: Methodology and Data Sources

The Regional Roma Survey

The regional Roma survey, referenced in this report as UNDP/World Bank/EC regional
Roma survey (2011), is a comprehensive survey that is representative of approximately
88 percent of the Macedonian Roma population, including Roma living in mixed,
separated and segregated neighborhoods. The survey questionnaire was designed by the
World Bank and UNDP in partnership, and implemented by UNDP through the IPSOS polling
agency in May-July 2011 on a random sample of Roma living in communities with concentrated
Roma populations in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic Hungary, Macedonia, Romania and Slovakia.
The European Commission DG Regional Policy financed the survey. In each of the countries,
approximately 750 Roma households, including over 3,500 individuals, and approximately 350
non-Roma households living in the same neighborhoods or vicinity were interviewed. More
detailed sampling information on Macedonia specifically can be found in Table A1-1. The sample
is not representative of all Roma in these countries, but rather includes those communities
where the share of the Roma population equals or is higher than the national share of Roma
population. This covers 88 percent of the Roma population in Macedonia. Once identified, a
random sample of these areas was drawn, and households were randomly sampled within these
enumeration areas.

The regional Roma survey data provide reliable estimates of the conditions in which the
vast majority of the Roma in Macedonia live, compared to the conditions of their non-
Roma neighbors. Comparisons with non-Roma living nearby provide a crucial frame of
reference, since the sampled non-Roma households live in the same or proximately located
municipalities, and thus share local labor markets, community-, school-, and health facilities as
well as other services and collective infrastructure. Hence, if we observe differences in e.g.
education, or employment between Roma and non-Roma households, these are highly likely to
reflect particular disadvantages faced by Roma.

Qualitative surveys on “Jobs, Mobility and Gender?

The qualitative surveys cited in this paper, referred to in the text as “World Bank:
Qualitative interviews (2013)?, refer to data collected in the framework of the cross-
country project “Qualitative Assessment of Economic Mobility and Labor Markets in ECA:
A Gender Perspective?. Macedonia was one of nine countries where the qualitative survey (a
mix of focus groups, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews) took place between May
and August 2013. Two rural and four urban communities were covered in Macedonia, and

Comparison between Model Set 1 and Model Set 2: Labor Force
Participation, 2011 and 2006, General Population
In the 2006 model, some of the marginal effects obtained were found to differ from those
obtained for 2011 due to the inclusion of regions, urban / rural location and regional
unemployment rates for specific levels of education. The table below reports increases and
decreases in effect size of the 2006 model as compared to the 2011 model, as well as changes in
significance of marginal effects. In summary, the following changes occurred:
  1) Older age groups were found to be less likely to participate in the labor market in the 2006
       model as compared to the 2011 model;
  2) Primary education was found to make less of a difference in the 2006 model;
  3) The effect of living in a household with (young) children, mainly on labor force
       participation among women, became less pronounced in the 2006 model;
  4) The effect of living in a household with pensioners became more pronounced in the 2006
       model;
  5) The effect of living in a household with at least one other employed household member
       disappeared in the gender specific models, and became much less pronounced in the
       aggregated model.

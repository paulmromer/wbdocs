Executive Summary

Program-for-Results Financing

1.      Program-for-Results (PforR) is a World Bank lending instrument that provides support to
the member countries to improve the design and implementation of their development programs
in infrastructure, education, health, and other sectors, in local government (LG) and community
development, and in cross-sectoral areas such as public sector management and private sector
development. PforR places more direct emphasis on development results by linking
disbursements to results or performance indicators that are tangible, transparent, and verifiable.
PforR works directly with the Program’s institutions and systems and, when appropriate, seeks to
strengthen those institutions’ governance and their capacities and systems over time.

The Uganda Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers Program for Results

2.       The Program Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the adequacy and equity of
fiscal transfers and improve fiscal management of resources by LGs for health and education
services. Addressing the amount and distribution of resources is necessary but not sufficient to
significantly improve Education and Health sector outcomes. The same can be said of
management of these resources to ensure the processes and systems governing their use are
efficient. The overarching objective of this operation is to establish the preconditions for
subsequent education and health reforms directly impacting sector outcomes.

   3. The first dimension of UgIFT will deliver results on enhancing adequacy of fiscal
      transfers for education and health services from the Central Government . International
      Development Association (IDA) resources will help to secure the required annual
      increases in LG health expenditures:
           Annual increase in sector conditional grants (wage, non-wage recurrent, and
              development) to LGs for education (four-year moving average) will reach 7.5
              percent by 2021/22.
           Annual increase in sector conditional grants (wage, non-wage recurrent, and
              development) to LGs for health (four-year moving average) will reach 13.25
              percent by 2021/22.
   4. The second dimension of the Program will deliver results on enhancing equity of
      fiscal transfers for education and health services. The additional funding will be
      targeted to the least funded LGs using objective and equitable allocation formulae. This
      will achieve the following results over the lifetime of the project (Figure 6):
    For the education non-wage recurrent conditional grant, which supports the running costs
      of schools, allocations per child of school-going age for the 20 least funded districts will
      increase from 33 percent to 46 percent of the levels allocated to the 20 best funded. For
      the education development grant, which funds the equipping, rehabilitation and
      construction of school infrastructure, 21 percent of development grant transfers will be
      provided to the 30 least funded districts.
    For health sector non-wage recurrent conditional grant which, among others, supports the
      running costs of health facilities, per capita allocations for the 20 least funded districts
      will increase from 22 percent to 38 percent of the levels allocated to the 20 best funded.



                                                5
       For health sector development grant, which funds the equipping, rehabilitation and
       construction of health infrastructure, 35 percent of development grant transfers will be
       provided to the 30 least funded districts.

   5. The target ratios for reducing the horizontal inequities in allocations per beneficiary were
      chosen in a way consistent both with the new formulae for the grants and with the
      planned enhancement of their adequacy, which, in turn, is consistent with the Program’s
      expenditure framework and with the GoU’s plan for uplifting transfers. These ratios are
      more conservative compared to what the projected allocations according to the formulae
      would imply, to allow for an impact of unforeseen change in the variables affecting the
      allocations.

    6. The third dimension of the Program will deliver results in terms of improvement in
        fiscal management of education and health services delivery by LGs as their
        resources are being increased. Enhanced fiscal management of resources is achieved
        through the introduction of an organizational performance assessment system; creating
        incentives through linking grant allocations to the results of the performance assessment;
        and targeted performance improvement programs.
7.      The third dimension targets the procedures and systems used by LGs to efficiently
manage education and health resources. It does not purport to directly change sector outcomes.
Rather it should be viewed as necessary action which will focus specifically on outcomes. It
establishes managerial preconditions for improving access to health and education services,
quality service delivery and quality infrastructure. Significant improvements in education and
health outcomes – among others, access to primary schools, reduced repetition and drop out,
improved learning and pass through to higher levels and access to well-staffed and resourced
clinics and hospitals which follow accepted medical protocols—will require additional
Government programs

8.      Beyond the development objectives of UgIFT, it is envisaged that more equitable,
adequate and efficient financing of health and education services will ultimately lay the
foundation for improved service delivery outcomes. In doing so it will complement other sectoral
programs including World Bank operations in health and education and planned governance
operations. The impact of UgIFT on service delivery outcomes will depend on these operations
as well as other interventions. The final beneficiaries of UgIFT will be consumers of health and
education services at the local level. Those who will benefit the most will be those living in the
most underfunded districts and municipalities.

9.      Results achieved by the Program are likely to be sustained after its completion. The
results related to adequacy of financing are likely sustainable because increase in transfers to
LGs will be financed primarily with the GoU own resources. The annual increase in government
financing during the period covered by the Program will be approximately equal to the annual
disbursement of IDA funds, and the share of IDA funding in program expenditures is expected to
decline from 44.5 percent during the first year of Program implementation to 25.3 percent during
the last year. The results related to equity of financing are likely to be sustained because by the
end of the Program formulae for the grants will be fully phased in, so that they could be
reasonably expected to be followed in the future. Similarly, the system for improving



                                                6
institutional capacities and incentives of the LGs to manage their resources is expected to be
fully operational and well tested by the end of the Program period.

10.     Research shows that additional spending tends to have greater impact where existing
levels of spending are low. The Program will take advantage of this opportunity by immediately
increasing funding levels to underfunded LGs (especially through development grants), with the
intended positive impact on these districts’ social indicators. The Program also intends to ensure
that real per capita funding levels steadily increase in the poorer LGs. Over the longer run, the
Program will provide a steady stream of enhanced incentives and funding to support the roll-out
of more efficient and equitable formulae for allocating fiscal transfers. These formulae will
correct the chronic disparities in allocations between LGs and thereby enhance equity and
efficiency of the financing of decentralized social services. The Program approach will also
create incentives for LGs to perform better in service delivery because the allocation of resources
will be based in part on an assessment of their performance. The Program also intends to make
the selected fiscal transfers a “reform model,? which will create a demonstration effect leading to
spillovers of good practices in financing decentralized service delivery through other grants to
LGs.

11.     To address this serious issue impeding Uganda’s long-term development, the proposed
Program will partially fund implementation of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Reform
Program (IFTRP). The IFTRP covers all fiscal transfers to LGs which together fund the bulk of
local administrative costs and service delivery in six sectors. These sectors include agriculture
and trade, works and transport, education, health, water and environment and social
development. There are up to three conditional grants per sector. Within this, UgIFT will focus
on health and education sector expenditures on conditional non-wage recurrent and development
grants. While World Bank funding support will not go directly to infrastructure investments,
these grants will lead to the rehabilitation and construction of primary schools and health clinics.
These structures are small in footprint and potential environmental and social risk.

Program-for-Results Environmental and Social Requirements

12.     For each proposed PforR operation, the World Bank requires a comprehensive
assessment of the government systems in place for managing environmental and social effects
(including benefits, impacts and risks) against the World Bank Policy, Program-for-Results
Financing. This Policy sets out core principles and key planning elements intended to ensure that
PforR operations are designed and implemented in a manner that maximizes potential
environmental and social benefits while avoiding, minimizing or otherwise mitigating
environmental and social harm.

ESSA Methodology

13.    The Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) is crucial to ensure that
PforR operations are designed and implemented in a manner that maximizes potential
environmental and social benefits. ESSA assesses the borrower’s authority and organizational
capacity and performance to date, to achieve the social and environmental objectives associated
with the Program, and stipulates supplementary actions as necessary.




                                                 7
14.    According to and as per the requirement of the Bank's Operational Policy/World Bank
Procedure (OP/BP) 9.00 an Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) was
undertaken by the Bank team. The ESSA was prepared in collaboration with relevant officials
and technical staff members of IFTP implementing agencies.

15.    The preparation of the ESSA has been carried out in a participatory manner involving
feedback and inputs from a number of key stakeholders, including national and county
government.

16.     The assessment was carried out through a comprehensive review of relevant government
policies, legislations, institutional roles, program procedures and an analysis of the extent these
are consistent with Bank's OP/ BP 9.00. Field reviews and consultations with key informants
from relevant national and LG authorities (where visits were made to approximately one-quarter
of all districts) formed a crucial part of the methodology for undertaking the assessment. These
focused on the practical implementation of social and environmental safeguards in LG projects,
and placed special emphasis on the education and health sectors that are central to the PforR
support. A summary of the field assessments is included as an Annex.

17.     The findings of the assessment were used to inform options for the overall Program
Action Plan (PAP) with key measures to improve environmental and social management
outcomes of the Program. The findings, conclusions, and opinions expressed in the ESSA are
those of the World Bank. The recommendations contained in the analysis were discussed through
public consultations, involving all stakeholders, held in Kampala during project appraisal.

Findings

Uganda’s Environmental Systems

Environmental Assessment and Management

           The ESSA documents that Uganda’s legal, policy, and regulatory framework and
            existing national level systems for managing environmental impacts – both broadly
            and for the key sectors of education and health -- are relatively robust. Systems for
            screening projects, ensuring that adequate environmental and social assessment are
            conducted for projects, for holding public consultations on projects and their
            impacts, and gathering feedback and complaints are fairly well developed. As noted
            in the field assessments, the quality of policy implementation on environmental
            assessment does vary at the LG level, however, and will be strengthened in the
            Program Action Plan.
           Uganda also has established regulations, guidelines and standards for waste
            management including hazardous wastes where health care wastes are categorized
            under. Uganda also has a national policy for injection safety and health care waste
            management, Health Care Waste Plan (HCWP 2012) and national guidelines for
            management of health care wastes from safe male circumcision procedures.




                                                8
           NEMA has developed sector guidelines for EIA development including sectors like
            health which is one of the two key sectors for focus under the Program.
           NEMA has developed a user manual to guide Sector Working Groups, Agencies and
            LGs to appropriately budget for mainstreaming environmental issues in their
            respective plans. Unless this is properly done, the issues integrated in the plans will
            remain unattended to during implementation. As will be noted in this ESSA, this is a
            relevant factor for the Program.
Conservation of Natural Habitats

           Uganda has established policies, legal and regulatory framework as well as
            institutions, which protect natural habitats from degradation and conversion
            including Uganda Wildlife Act; National Forestry and Tree Planting Act; Public
            Health Act; Local Government Act; and Land Act.
Workers and Public Health and Safety

           The Occupational Health and Safety Act protects workers and public to occupational
            related hazards by requiring developers to safeguard the health and safety of workers
            and the public in the places of work.
Resources and Capacity

           National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) is the principal institution
            which has a significant national mandate to ensure environmental protection.
            NEMA, already have significant capacity to manage risks appropriately with a
            robust system for environmental assessment and management which provides for
            screening of projects to determine the level of environmental analysis. Screening at
            the local level, however, is more significant for the IGFT program, and at least half
            of surveyed Districts do take on this key step.
           There is a specific department in NEMA dedicated to environmental assessment and
            management with a pool of limited technical experts. NEMA has also gazetted a
            total of 375 environmental inspectors who undertake environmental inspections and
            monitoring on behalf of NEMA. Given the local implementation nature of this
            Program, however, the capabilities of District-level environmental officials are
            especially relevant.

Uganda’s Social Systems

Land Acquisition

           The policy, legal and institutional framework in Uganda governing land acquisition
            and resettlement is fairly strong and compares well with the World Bank ESSA core
            principles. The Land Act, Land Acquisition Act, Uganda Land Commission Act and
            Local Government Act all address impacts associated with involuntary resettlement
            and provide for compensation for loss of assets based on replacement cost approach.




                                                9
          The Constitution of Uganda also protects the rights of individuals to property
           ownership and only advocates for land acquisition when projects are for the public
           good. Livelihood restoration as a result of land acquisition is addressed by the Land
           policy.

Grievance Redress

          The Local Government Act and Local Council Courts Act establish Land Boards
           (LBs) and District Land Tribunals for grievance redress on land related issues at
           municipal and district levels.
          The Uganda Land Commission (ULC) mission is to effectively hold and manage all
           Government land and property thereon and resolve all historical land injustices as
           well as resettle persons displaced as a result of Government actions, natural disasters
           or any other cause through outright compensations or provision of alternative land.
          The Equal Opportunities Commission Act establishes the Equal Opportunity
           Commission (EOC) which plays a key role in grievance redress by providing an
           avenue and platform for Uganda citizens to do so. The EOC also has powers to hear
           and determine complaints by any person against any action, practice, usage, plan,
           policy programme, tradition, culture or custom which amounts to discrimination,
           marginalization or undermines equal opportunity. The EOC has developed rules and
           regulations for lodging complaints on a matter of discrimination, marginalization,
           inequality or any act which undermines or impairs equal opportunities against a
           person or a group of persons.
          The Uganda Human Rights Commission The UHRC is Uganda’s national human
           rights institution created by the Constitution, with mandate, amongst others, “to
           investigate violations of human rights and to monitor government compliance with
           its human rights obligations detailed in the Constitution.?

Indigenous Peoples

          The Constitution of Uganda recognizes the presence of indigenous people in Uganda
           and refers to them as “ethnic minority?. The Constitution offers no express
           protection for indigenous peoples but Article 32 places a mandatory duty on the state
           to take affirmative action in favor of groups who have been historically
           disadvantaged and discriminated against.
          Equal Opportunities Commission Act duly protects the rights of indigenous peoples
           in Uganda through its recognition of “ethnic minority? groups in Uganda and being
           cognizant of their marginalized status, and fulfilling its mandate to address
           discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all persons in Uganda
           irrespective of gender, age, physical ability, health status or geographical location;
           and to promote affirmative action in favor of marginalized groups.
          It is important to note that the Ik people (one of IPs in Uganda) have their first
           Member of Parliament in the 10th Ugandan Parliament in 2016.

Social Accountability and Transparency

           Uganda’s decentralized system provides for social accountability and transparency.
            Participatory planning is the adopted approach by LGs where all stakeholders,
            beneficiaries, technical staff and donors come together to carry out analysis of the
            existing situation, determine the desired future, decide on appropriate action and
            implementation strategies, discuss and agree on roles and responsibilities and agree
            on appropriate time schedules and milestones. Planning begins at the community
            level through a bottom up approach.
           In Uganda’s decentralized system, the planning process is at sub-county level where
            the sub-county development committees collect and prioritize all sub-counties plans.
            The priorities of all the sub-counties are thereafter presented to the county
            development committee, which in turn prioritize the draft plans for onward
            transmission to the district development committee for deliberations. All the
            approved proposed plans are then compiled into the draft district development plan
            for onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
            Development (MoFPED) for preparation of the district development plan.

Public Participation

18.     To ensure that communities are empowered to take responsibility for their own health
and well-being, and to participate actively in the management of their local services, the
Government of Uganda has initiated a number of measures: (i) developed guidelines for
community capacity building for effective participation in resource mobilization and in the
monitoring of activities; (ii) promoted the establishment of sector committees (health, education
etc.) with an appropriate gender balance at each of the different levels of the LG system. In
addition, the Local Government Act provides has several structures for ensuring accountability
to the public and to sector stakeholders. To the general public, the decentralized system provides
space for the participation of all districts and local authorities in the Annual Sector Assemblies.
At these assemblies, national- and district-level political leaders, national level CSOs working in
the different sectors, the media, and development partners receive performance feedback about
sector performance, and generate priorities for the district in the subsequent fiscal year.

Affirmative Action

19.     Uganda has different sets of laws, policies, guidelines, and administrative practices
intended to end and correct the effects of discrimination on gender and marginalized groups.
They include the National Gender Policy and Older People Policy, the National Youth Council
Act, Vision 2025, the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), the Social Development Sector
Strategic Investment Plan, and the Equal Opportunities Commission.

Resources and Capacity

20.     Although the structures for environmental and social accountability are well-established
at the national level, mostly we found weak or non-existent performance management systems at
the local levels. The problem is somewhat more significant for social issues as contrasted with


                                                11
environmental issues. For example, just over half (i.e. 15 of 26) of the visited Districts carry out
screening of government-funded projects for environmental risks. The number of Districts that
carry out screening for social risks is considerably less (i.e. 3 of 26); in fact, being by far the
exception rather than the rule. Oversight or supervision of such projects is also proportionally
weaker than screening, and typically consists of desk reviews given the lack of transportation
and other resources for field assessment. Districts have few resources and have received little
guidance on how to provide effective supervision and feedback downstream in such a
constrained situation.

Specific Environmental and Social Risks and Recommendations

21.     The ESSA concludes that the existing environmental and social management framework
at the national level should, in theory, provide adequate means for reducing risks from program
elements supported by the IFTP. Nevertheless, in actual practice, the ESSA identified potential
issues related to the capacity of LGs to carry out nationally derived processes. These areas are
summarized below, and considered in the options for inclusion under the Program Action Plan.

Social Risks

22.     The ESSA concludes that the existing environmental and social management framework
at the national level should, in theory, provide adequate means for reducing risks from program
elements supported by the IFTP. Nevertheless, in actual practice, the ESSA identified potential
issues related to the capacity of LGs to carry out nationally derived processes. These areas are
summarized below, and considered in the options for inclusion under the Program Action Plan.

23.    The investments supported by the PforR – including the rehabilitation and construction of
additional primary/secondary schools and health clinics infrastructure – typically pose modest
risk when screening and supervision is carried out correctly by national authorities.

Social Risks

24.     Nevertheless, the actual experience in Uganda and observed deficiencies in LG capacity
suggests a comparatively higher risk for social considerations. These risks particularly stem from
the likelihood of influx of construction workers from larger urban centers into smaller
subdivisions (Parishes and Sub counties) specifically targeted by the Program, and generally
lacking local capacity to carry out construction of facilities such as maternity/general wards,
operating theatres, and etc. – And to absorb and manage influx of workers. Concerns include: (i)
the spread of HIV/AIDS, (ii) instances of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Violence Against
Children (VAC), and (iii) labor related issues, including Child Labor. Land acquisition and
resettlement is not expected to pose significant risks given the small scale of investments and the
likelihood of construction being carried out on existing facilities’ footprints, though it is
important that these processes are properly tracked.

25.    A number of these civil works will also be implemented in areas where communities are
not always duly consulted during project preparation or lack access to adequate grievance redress
mechanisms. The World Bank is taking special precautions on current and proposed investments
in Uganda where two World Bank projects have recently either been suspended or cancelled
because of these of types of violations being associated with contractors hired to perform civil


                                                12
works in rural areas. While the scale of those investments (and consequent risks) is considerably
greater than in the case of the IFTP, appropriate due diligence is needed and included. As the
field exercises have revealed important deficiencies in terms of availability and capacity
(technical and material) of relevant District social staff, the government has agreed to mitigation
measures in the Program Action Plan.

Environmental Risks

26.     The assessment establishes that environmental risks associated with the construction and
operation of education and health facilities as envisaged by this Program, are modest, and can be
managed through adherence to established procedures for screening, contracting, and supervision
during implementation. Unfortunately, in almost half of surveyed Districts, good screening is not
carried out, and in the majority of Districts, staff and material shortages hamper both screening
and especially supervision. There have been advances in health waste management in the country
though again, adherence at the local level may be problematic.

Local Government Capacity

27.     The current framework accurately addresses the planning, budgeting and financial
management. However, the questions of capacity of the LG to deliver efficient services to the
communities with respect to environmental and social management still merit empirical
evaluation. There exist several constraints arising from the LG capacity and the availability of
infrastructure at the decentralized units. Recommendations for strengthening are highlighted
below.

Recommendations

28.    Based on the findings of the ESSA, the Government will be including certain measures to
mitigate critical environmental and social risks at the local implementation level in the Program
Action Plan. These include:

           Revising environmental and social screening forms (developed for previous health
            and education projects supported by the Bank) for the specific types of investments
            supported by the PforR. Augment such forms with newly emerging concerns, such
            as recognizing and avoiding Gender-Based Violence, and further advancing good
            medical waste management. Provide training for responsible District officials, and
            technical assistance during Program implementation.
           Ensuring that key Districts reach their full complement of environmental and social
            safeguards staffing. Set up prioritization based on such factors as the scale of
            planned investments, overall District social risk, relative proportion of staffing gaps,
            etc.
           Seeking creative and cost-effective solutions in filling other gaps at the LG level,
            including the widespread lack of Grievance Redress Mechanisms and providing
            transport for conducting supervision missions; This could include the use and
            strengthening of existing structures such as Local Councils, School Management
            Committees, and Health Management Units


                                                13
   Tasking national line ministry specialists to support local officials with targeted
    supervision of a select number of schools and clinics constructed under the Program.
   Augmenting the work program of current program implementation units in relevant
    sectors (for donor-supported projects) to conduct targeted supervision as a means for
    supporting mainstreaming of risk reduction.

I. Introduction

Program-For-Results as Financing Instrument

1.     “Program-For-Results Financing? (PforforR) is a relatively new World Bank lending
instrument that aims to support a borrower’s “programs? – a flexible term that encompasses a
wide-range of potential government-led development initiatives with a national, subnational,
multi-sectoral, or sectoral scope. PforR operations can be used to finance investment-lending
types of activities that have notable risks, i.e., ‘Category B’ projects.

2.      PforR is a “results-based? instrument: disbursements are largely tied to achievement of
agreed “development linked indicators? rather than to preparation and expenditures for inputs, as
is typically the case with more traditional project lending. Financing is provided to the
borrower’s overall expenditure program budget rather than linked to individual transactions
(such as scheduled purchases of goods and services required for the project). Development
linked indicators are identified initially by the borrower, and approved by the Bank.

3.      PforR lets the borrower determine what, if any, information related to activities funded
through PforR operations is made publicly available or available directly to potentially-affected
local communities. In other words, the public has assured access to information related only to
‘program level’ activities – not necessarily to activities funded through the Program. The World
Bank considers P4R a third core component of its suite of lending instruments: Development
Policy Lending (DPL) to finance government policy reforms and actions, PforR for program-
level operations, and Investment Lending (IL) for projects.

4.      P4R enables the World Bank to extend the reach of its advice and financial support to
entire national programs despite providing a relatively small share of a Program’s operating
budget. PforR also represents a further fragmentation of the Bank’s approach to ensuring that its
financing does not contribute to environmental and social harm. Unlike project-based lending,
PforR financing is not subject to the Bank’s environmental and social “safeguard? policies.

5.       Instead, PforR operations rely on the borrower’s systems for avoiding and mitigating
potential impacts, with potential capacity strengthening of the systems during the operation.
World Bank staff are to utilize a set of PforR-specific environmental and social principles to
guide an assessment of the “adequacy? of a borrower’s systems, and World Bank standards do
not apply to activities funded through these systems – even when these are the same types of
activities to which World Bank safeguards apply when funded through investment lending
operations at the Bank. DPLs are also not subject to the Bank’s safeguard policies.

6.     The key features of the new instrument are as follows:
           Financing the expenditures of specific borrower development programs;
           Disbursing on the basis of the achievement of key results (including prior results)
            under such programs;
           Using and, as appropriate, strengthening the Program systems to provide assurance
            that Program funds are used appropriately and that environmental and social impacts
            are adequately addressed by such programs; and


                                               15
            Strengthening, where appropriate, the institutional capacity necessary for such
             programs to achieve their intended results.

ESSA Core Principles

7.     To guide the ESSA analysis, there are six core principles that must be benchmarked in
the preparation and utilization as required in the Program-for-Results financing guidelines. The
ESSA six core principles are briefly described below:
            Core Principle 1 - General Principle of Environmental and Social
             Management- This core principle aims to promote environmental and social
             sustainability in Program design; avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts, and
             promote informed decision-making related to the Program’s environmental and
             social impacts.
            Core Principle 2 - Natural Habitats and Physical Cultural Resources: This core
             principle aims to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts on natural habitats
             and physical cultural resources resulting from the Program.
            Core Principle 3 - Public and Worker Safety: This core principle aims to promote
             public and worker safety with respect to the potential risks associated with: (i)
             operation of facilities or other operational practices under the Program; and (ii)
             exposure to toxic chemicals, hazardous wastes, and other dangerous materials under
             the Program.
            Core Principle 4 - Land Acquisition: This core principle aims to manage land
             acquisition and loss of access to natural resources in a way that avoids or minimizes
             displacement, and assists affected people in improving, or at the minimum restoring,
             their livelihoods and living standards.
            Core Principle 5 -Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups: This core
             principle aims to give due consideration to the cultural appropriateness of, and
             equitable access to, Program benefits, giving special attention to the rights and
             interests of the Indigenous Peoples and to the needs or concerns of vulnerable
             groups.
            Core Principle 6 -Social Conflict: This core principle aims to avoid exacerbating
             social conflict, especially in fragile states, post-conflict areas, or areas subject to
             territorial disputes.

ESSA Scope and Methodology

ESSA Scope

8.    This Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) was undertaken by the
World Bank team for the Program as per the requirement of the Bank's Operational Policy/World
Bank Procedure (OP/BP) 9.00 PforR Financing. This ESSA was developed based on:

       (a) A review of existing policies, state development plans, acts, regulations, frameworks
           and guidelines;


                                                16
       (b) Consultations, meetings and interviews with key relevant stakeholders at the
           National and LG level, particularly with those involved in the environmental and
           social assessment as well as planning, implementation and monitoring of projects in
           the health and education sector;
       (c) An assessment of relevant environmental and social management systems relative to
           the PforR principles;
       (d) An assessment of the capacity and performance of the environmental and social
           management procedures and processes relevant to IFTP;
       (e) Development of an action plan to enhance environmental and social management
           capacity and performance of the IFTP PforR; and
       (f) Development of performance monitoring and implementation support plan.

9.     Environmental and social management procedures and processes are designed to (a)
promote environmental and social sustainability in the Program design; (b) avoid, minimize, or
mitigate against adverse impacts; and (c) promote informed decision-making relating to a
program’s environmental and social effects.

ESSA Objectives

10.    The purpose of the Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) is to: (i)
document the environmental and social management rules and procedures and institutional
responsibilities that are being used by the Government for the IFT Program (ii) to assess
implementing entities’ institutional capacity including performance to date to manage the likely
environmental and social effects in accordance with Uganda’s own requirements under the
Program; and (iii) to recommend specific actions for improving counterpart capacity during
implementation.

11.     The PforR financing does not support programs or activities within programs that could
cause significant harm to the environment or which would have significant adverse social
consequences. Excluded from PforR financing would be investments in new or major expansion
of large-scale infrastructure or other investment activities that would be considered
Environmental Category A under conventional World Bank investment lending criteria. All
PforR operation proposals will be screened for such effects at an early stage of preparation, and
if such activities occur within a Program, they should be flagged and be subject to investment
lending policies.

12.    The PforR approach to environmental and social management uses a step-wise approach
to adapt activity to the program context. The three steps are:

           System assessment. The World Bank task team prepares assessments of the
            proposed Program, including a system assessment of environmental and social
            management capacity and practice. The system assessment reviews existing
            regulations and policies, institutional capacity, and the effectiveness of
            implementation in practice. The World Bank together with the implementing agency
            identifies and considers the potential range of environmental and social effects that



                                               17
            may be relevant to the Program. The World Bank task team then assesses the
            capacity for effective environmental and social management, in light of performance
            to date (or proposed arrangements and resource availability for new Programs) and
            in light of potential effects. Findings of the system assessment are subsequently
            factored into the overall Program-for-Results Integrated Risk Assessment.
           Agreement with the borrower on actions to enhance environmental and social
            management capacity and performance. Based on assessment results, measures to
            strengthen institutional capacity, as well as any measures to generate the desired
            environmental and social effects if required, are then agreed between the World
            Bank and implementing agency. These actions are incorporated into the Program
            Action Plan, which is then discussed and agreed with the client. If the assessment
            concludes that the Program capacity is adequate given the risks to be managed, no
            actions are necessary. However, if strengthening measures are deemed necessary,
            they may include either specific actions to strengthen organizational performance or
            specific environmental or social mitigation measures consistent with Program-for-
            Results.
           Performance monitoring and implementation support. The borrower and the task
            team collaborate in monitoring Program performance, especially with regard to any
            specific organizational improvements, mitigation or enhancement measures agreed
            with the implementing agency. Program performance is monitored against a set of
            mutually agreed on quantitative or qualitative indicators devised for Program
            purposes, and against regular periodic review of complaints registered through
            established grievance procedures. The task team supplements monitoring
            information with periodic field visits to the Program activities and offers any further
            implementation support that may be agreed on between the borrower and the World
            Bank.

ESSA Process and Methodology

13.      The ESSA is a World Bank document prepared by World Bank staff and consultants
through a combination of reviews of existing Program materials and available technical
literature, interviews with government staff, and consultations with key stakeholders and experts.
Findings of the assessment will be used for the formulation of an overall Program Action Plan
with key measures to improve environmental and social management outcomes of the Program.
The findings and conclusions and opinions expressed in the ESSA document are those of the
World Bank.

Detailed and In-depth Literature Review

14.    In preparing this ESSA, a review of relevant literature material was undertaken and
helped in gaining a deeper understanding of environmental and social management procedures,
standards and institutional responsibilities that will apply to the proposed Program

15.     The literature review covered existing regulations and policies and analyzed their legal
and practical applicability at the Program level, and the effectiveness of implementation in
practice.


                                               18
Institutional Analysis

16.      An institutional analysis was carried out to identify the roles, responsibilities, structure
and relations of the relevant institutions responsible for implementing the PforR funded
activities, including coordination between different entities at the national, regional and local
levels. Sources included: existing assessments of key institutions focusing on environmental and
social assessment and management processes. Available literature and documents were also
consulted to assess health care waste management system’s capacity and performance and access
to health care services in the country.

Key Informant Interviews

17.     Semi-structured interviews took place with GOU officials and technical experts involved
in environmental and social management.

18.       At the national level, the team interviewed staff of:

              Ministry of Local Government
              Ministry of Health
              Ministry of Education
              National Environment Management Authority
              Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC)

19.       At the LG level, the team interviewed relevant staff of the district and municipal councils.

Field Visit

20.    Consultative field visits were conducted in the following Districts which were selected to
include some that (i) hosted Vulnerable and Marginalized Groups (Batwa and Ik), (ii) were
newly formed/older, and (iii) some that were historically well/underfunded. In addition,
geographic location was considered to facilitate teams’ travel logistics.

         Ntungamo                 Kakumiro                Bukedea             Koboko

         Nakaseke                 Luwero                  Pallisa             Nyadri
         Isingiro                 Kayunga                 Namutumba           Apac
         Rakai                    Kaabong                 Mayuge              Kiryandongo
         Kanungu                  Amuria                  Adjumani            Nakasongola
         Rubanda                  Nakapiripirit           Amuru
         Sembambule               Manafwa                 Pader




                                                    19
Stakeholder Consultations

21.    The ESSA process includes stakeholder consultations on the draft ESSA and disclosure
of the ESSA Report following the World Bank’s Access to Information Policy. Details on the
consultation process are included in Annex 3.

II. Program Description

Background and Context

22.    The Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Reform Program (IFTRP) has been
developed to address the challenges in the functioning of the national government’s
financing of LG service delivery. The IFTRP has five objectives:
           Restore adequacy and equity in allocation of funds for service delivery.
           Shift the focus away from fragmented input-based conditions toward accountability
            for budgetary allocation decisions, expenditures, and results.
           Increase discretion to enable LGs to deliver services in line with local needs while
            ensuring that national policies are implemented.
           Allow new national policies to be funded via the transfer system, at the same time
            avoiding future fragmentation of transfers and reduction in discretion.
           Use the transfer system to provide incentives to improve institutional and service
            delivery performance.

23.     The IFTRP furthers the implementation of the GoU’s Fiscal Decentralization
Strategy (FDS) and Second National Development Plan 2015/16-2019/20 (NDP-II). The FDS
was adopted by Cabinet in 2002 to address concerns about increased fragmentation and reduced
discretion in LG financing. The FDS seeks “to strengthen the process of decentralization in
Uganda through increasing LGs’ autonomy, widening local participation in decision-making and
streamlining fiscal transfer modalities to LGs in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness
of LGs in service delivery.? The implementation of the FDS required additional resources.
However, the shift of budget priorities towards economic infrastructure since the mid-2000s
meant that FDS was implemented only to a limited extent, which in turn made it more difficult
for the LGs to fulfill their mandates. The IFTPR is under the purview of the Minister of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development, anchored in the NDP-II and the FDS (approved by the
Parliament and the Cabinet, respectively).

24.      The FDS agenda was given renewed impetus by Uganda’s Second National
Development Plan (NDP-II) 2015/16-2019/20. In response to the declining trends in LG
financing, the NDP-II includes objectives to “increase financing and revenue mobilization of
[LGs] to match the functions of [LGs]? which commits the Government to “redesign the fiscal
decentralization architecture to provide for adequate and sustainable LG financing? and “review
grants allocation formulae to promote adequacy in financing of decentralized service[s]? (NDP
II, p. 235).

25.    An interim step prior to the development of the IFTRP, took place in 2015-16, with
the consolidation of the earmarked transfers. Under the consolidation, the number of
earmarked transfers to LGs was reduced from 46 to 20. This consolidation was a necessary first
step because it helped increase LGs’ flexibility in the use of their fiscal resources, and opened
the way to developing rational formulae for the allocation of the grants. It was also intended to
reduce transaction costs associated with the grants planning and monitoring. It has also made the
reform process more transparent and understandable for the LGs.


                                                21
26.     The IFTRP covers all fiscal transfers to LGs which together fund the bulk of local
administrative costs and service delivery in six sectors. These sectors include agriculture and
trade, works and transport, education, health, water and environment and social development.
There are up to three conditional grants per sector (Table 1). Within this, UgIFT will focus on
health and education sector expenditures on conditional non-wage recurrent and development
transfers.

objectives. These are set out in Table 2.

    which target action to improve performance in LGs and areas which
    where performance is weak.

28.     The first dimension of the IFTRP involves consolidating and redesigning sectoral
and discretionary transfers to LGs. This includes developing more objective and equitable
allocation formulae within agreed principles and guidelines which focus on the performance and
accountability of LGs, rather than on input-based conditions. Formulae have been developed for
non-wage and recurrent grants to reduce horizontal inequity (for example, seeking to reduce
inequities in per capita funding in the health and education sectors whilst catering for other
factors such as the variable costs of delivering services). New sector grant guidelines have also
been developed. Grant input-based conditions have been replaced by sectoral performance
budgeting and accountability requirements to promote a more efficient management of resources
by LGs. Revisions to sector guidelines for facilities and for required infrastructure investments
are also planned.

29.    The second dimension involves estimating the cost of adequately financing LG
service delivery mandates relative to the overall budget and reviewing the fiscal


                                                      23
decentralization architecture. This involves estimating the cost of fully funded capitation grant
policies at the school level nationwide, and adequately funding health facilities for their
operational costs, for example. This will be followed by a review of the fiscal architecture
governing overall budget allocations to LG transfers and local revenue assignments.

30.     The third dimension involves introducing a framework of performance incentives in
the grant system and targeted performance improvement to drive improved institutional
and service delivery performance and accountability. This involves assessing LG institutional
and service delivery performance at three levels: (a) adherence to adequate budgeting and
accountability requirements, (b) core and sectoral institutional performance, and (c) facility
performance. An LG Performance Assessment Manual has been drafted and performance
assessments have been piloted. The results of the performance assessments will help inform the
appointment of accounting officers and be linked to the size of development grants. The reform
will also involve the establishment of a mechanism of targeted support to poorly performing LGs
through the agreement, validation, and implementation of performance improvement programs.

31.      IFTRP sets out institutional arrangements to manage the strengthened process and
systems being established. The approach involves consolidating and strengthening existing
institutions and coordination mechanisms to deliver the reform, rather than the creation of
parallel processes. This includes a high level IFT Steering Committee, an IFT technical
committee, and a series of task forces dealing with grant management, assessment and targeted
support.

32.    As part of the IFTRP, a medium-term plan for uplifting intergovernmental fiscal
transfers is being developed, covering all grants to LGs. Implementation of the plan over
several years will enable the phased implementation of the new non-wage recurrent and
development allocation formulae and the restoration of the adequacy of funding for service
delivery. MoFPED has developed an Online Transfer Information Management System
(OTIMS)1 to ensure transparency and rules-based implementation of the new formulae. The
additional administrative costs of managing the transfers, carrying out performance assessments
and targeted performance improvement plans have also been costed as part of the IFTRP
medium-term plan.

Program Development Objective/s (PDO) and Key Results

33.     The Program Development Objective (PDO) is To improve the adequacy and equity
of fiscal transfers and improve fiscal management of resources by LGs for health and
education services. Addressing the amount and distribution of resources is necessary but not
sufficient to significantly improve Education and Health sector outcomes. The same can be said
of management of these resources to ensure the processes and systems governing their use are
efficient. The overarching objective of this Program is to establish the preconditions for
subsequent education and health reforms directly impacting sector outcomes.

    34. The first dimension of UgIFT will deliver results on enhancing adequacy of fiscal
        transfers for education and health services from the Central Government . International
        Development Association (IDA) resources will help to secure the required annual
        increases in LG health expenditures:
             Annual increase in sector conditional grants (wage, non-wage recurrent, and
               development) to LGs for education (four-year moving average) will reach 7.5
               percent by 2021/22.
             Annual increase in sector conditional grants (wage, non-wage recurrent, and
               development) to LGs for health (four-year moving average) will reach 13.25
               percent by 2021/22.
35.     Figure 2 illustrates the projected impact of these increases on the Program expenditures
per beneficiary.

           Source: MoFPED.
    36. The second dimension of the Program will deliver results on enhancing equity of
        fiscal transfers for education and health services. The additional funding will be
        targeted to the least funded LGs using objective and equitable allocation formulae. This
        will achieve the following results over the lifetime of the project (Figure 6):
     For the education non-wage recurrent conditional grant, which supports the running costs
        of schools, allocations per child of school-going age for the 20 least funded districts will
        increase from 33 percent to 46 percent of the levels allocated to the 20 best funded. For
        the education development grant, which funds the equipping, rehabilitation and
        construction of school infrastructure, 21 percent of development grant transfers will be
        provided to the 30 least funded districts.
     For health sector non-wage recurrent conditional grant which, among others, supports the
        running costs of health facilities, per capita allocations for the 20 least funded districts
        will increase from 22 percent to 38 percent of the levels allocated to the 20 best funded.
        For health sector development grant, which funds the equipping, rehabilitation and
        construction of health infrastructure, 35 percent of development grant transfers will be
        provided to the 30 least funded districts.
    37. The target ratios for reducing the horizontal inequities in allocations per beneficiary were
        chosen in a way consistent both with the new formulae for the grants and with the
        planned enhancement of their adequacy, which, in turn, is consistent with the Program’s
        expenditure framework and with the GoU’s plan for uplifting transfers. These ratios are
        more conservative compared to what the projected allocations according to the formulae
        would imply, to allow for an impact of unforeseen change in the variables affecting the
        allocations.
38.     The third dimension of the Program will deliver results in terms of improvement in
fiscal management of education and health services delivery by LGs as their resources are
being increased. Enhanced fiscal management of resources is achieved through the introduction
of an organizational performance assessment system; creating incentives through linking grant
allocations to the results of the performance assessment; and targeted performance improvement
programs.

39.    The third dimension targets the procedures and systems used by LGs to efficiently
manage education and health resources. It does not purport to directly change sector
outcomes. Rather it should be viewed as necessary action which will focus specifically on
outcomes. It establishes managerial preconditions for improving access to health and education
services, quality service delivery and quality infrastructure. Significant improvements in
education and health outcomes – among others, access to primary schools, reduced repetition and
drop out, improved learning and pass through to higher levels and access to well-staffed and
resourced clinics and hospitals which follow accepted medical protocols—will require additional
Government programs.

40.     Beyond the development objectives of UgIFT, it is envisaged that more equitable,
adequate and efficient financing of health and education services will ultimately lay the
foundation for improved service delivery outcomes. In doing so it will complement other
sectoral programs including World Bank operations in health and education and planned
governance operations. The impact of UgIFT on service delivery outcomes will depend on these


                                                26
operations as well as other interventions. The final beneficiaries of UgIFT will be consumers of
health and education services at the local level. Those who will benefit the most will be those
living in the most underfunded districts and municipalities.

41.      Results achieved by the Program are likely to be sustained after its completion . The
results related to adequacy of financing are likely sustainable because increase in transfers to
LGs will be financed primarily with the GoU own resources. The annual increase in government
financing during the period covered by the Program will be approximately equal to the annual
disbursement of IDA funds, and the share of IDA funding in the Program expenditures is
expected to decline from 44.5 percent during the first year of Program implementation to 25.3
percent during the last year. The results related to equity of financing are likely to be sustained
because by the end of the Program formulae for the grants will be fully phased in, so that they
could be reasonably expected to be followed in the future. Similarly, the system for improving
institutional capacities and incentives of the LGs to manage their resources is expected to be
fully operational and well tested by the end of the Program period.

III. Uganda’s Environmental Management Systems

Constitution of Uganda and Environmental Management

42.    The Constitution of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) is the supreme law of Uganda. It
imposes obligations on the Government of Uganda to promote sustainable development and
environmental protection, and it obliges the state and citizens to endeavor to preserve and protect
public property and Uganda’s heritage. The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda of 1995
provides among its National Objectives, (Objective No. XXVII) that:
       (a) Utilization of natural resources shall be managed in such a way as to meet the
           development and environmental needs of the present and future generations of
           Uganda, particularly taking all measures to prevent or minimize damage and
           destruction to land, air, and water resources resulting from pollution or any other
           kind of natural resource degradation.
       (b) The state shall promote sustainable development and public awareness of the need to
           manage land, air and water resources in a balanced manner for present and future
           generations.

43.     Article 39 provides that every Ugandan has a right to a clean and healthy environment.
Article 237(b) in turn, provides that the government or LG as determined by Parliament by law
shall hold in trust for the people and protect natural lakes, rivers, wetlands, forests, game and
forest reserves, National Parks and any land to be reserved for ecological and to touristic
purposes for the common good of all citizens. This right carries with it the duty of the citizen to
protect the environment.

National Environment Management Policy, 1994

44.     The overall goal of this policy is the promotion of sustainable economic and social
development mindful of the needs of future generations and the EIA is one of the vital tools it
considers necessary to ensure environmental quality and resource productivity on a long-term
basis. It calls for integration of environmental concerns into development policies, plans and
projects at national, district and local levels. Hence, the policy requires that projects or policies
likely to have significant adverse ecological or social impacts undertake an EIA before their
implementation. This is also reaffirmed in the National Environment Act, Cap 153 which makes
EIA a requirement for eligible projects (Third Schedule).

45.     The NES provides for public in-put in EIA, and environmental audits through the rights
to participate, to information and the general right to bring actions to prevent or discontinue an
activity or project with effects that are harmful to the environment. It also empowers local
environmental committees to take action to redress local environmental concerns. The Statute
creates a duty on the developer to take all measures necessary to seek the views of the people in
the communities, which may be affected by the project during the process of conducting the
study.

46.    Major provisions for the EIA process in the NES are contained under part V that defines
and sets out the role and procedures of the EIA process for all activities likely to harm or have an
impact on the environment.


                                                 28
National Environment Management Policy (1994)

47.     Uganda has a well-developed legal and regulatory framework for environmental
management. It flows from National Environment Management Policy (1994) that aims to
promote sustainable economic and social development. Among the provisions of the policy is a
requirement for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be conducted for any policy or
project that is likely to have adverse impacts on the environment.

National Policy for Conservation and Management of Wetland Resources (1995)

48.     This policy establishes the principles by which wetland resources can be optimally used
now and in future. It calls for the application of EIA to all activities to be carried out in a
wetland, and aims at ensuring that the environmental goods and services provided by wetlands
are safeguarded and integrated in development considerations.

National Water Policy (1999)

49.     This policy’s objective is the management and development of the water resources of
Uganda in an integrated and sustainable manner. The policy requires EIA for all water related
projects and integration of water and hydrological cycle concerns in all development programs. It
covers water quality, water use, discharge of effluents and international cooperation on trans-
boundary water resources.

National Medical Equipment Policy, 2009

50.   The objective of the policy is to ensure equipment and furniture are managed
economically, efficiently, effectively and sustainably through guided:
           Acquisition of medical equipment and furniture,
           Utilization, regulation and quality assurance of medical equipment and furniture,
           Maintenance of medical equipment and furniture,
           Monitoring and evaluation of performance of medical equipment and furniture and
           Proper disposal of medical equipment and furniture.

National Health Policy, 1999

51.      The overall objective of health sector policy is to reduce mortality, morbidity and
fertility, and the disparities therein. Ensuring access to the minimum health care package is a
central strategy to this goal.

National Policy on Injection Safety and Health Care Waste Management, 2004

52.    The policy aims at ensuring safe injection practices and proper management of healthcare
waste through appropriate procurement, distribution and monitoring of equipment/ supplies and
increased awareness.

National Environmental Act, Cap 153

53.     The most important of the Ugandan environmental laws relevant to development of urban
infrastructure in Uganda is the National Environment Act, Cap 153. This law established the
National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) and provides tools for environmental
management. It sets requirements for management of various aspects of the environment,
including wetlands, waterways and shorelines, forests, and hillsides. It authorizes NEMA to set
environmental standards in consultation with cognizant line ministries. It makes Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) mandatory for certain types of projects.

54.     The National Environment Act (Chapter 153 of Laws of Uganda) establishes and defines
functions of NEMA as a body responsible for management, monitoring and supervision of all
environmental conservation activities (Section 4). This act provides for various strategies and
tools for environment management, which also includes the EIA (Section 19) for projects likely
to have significant environmental impacts.

55.     The Act also mandates NEMA with a leading role to review environmental impact
statements. NEMA sets multimedia environmental standards (Sections 24-32) to prevent
contamination of air, water and soil resources. The Act also mandates NEMA with responsibility
for in-situ and ex-situ conservation of biological fauna and flora resources either on land or in
water (Sections 42 and 43).

56.      Section 48 empowers NEMA, district environment committees and local environment
committees to be responsible for monitoring of local land-use plans, which should be in
conformity with national land-use plan. Section 106 outlines provisions to enable compliance
with obligations of international environmental conventions. Section 35 entrusts NEMA, lead
agencies and LG environment committees with powers to protect the environment from human
activities that could adversely affect it. Section 56 prohibits discharge of hazardous substances,
chemicals, oil, etc. into the environment except in accordance with guidelines prescribed by
NEMA.

57.    The Act outlines principles of environmental management and rights to a decent
environment and also sets out principles for:
           Institutional arrangements;
           Environmental planning;
           Environmental regulations;
           Environmental standards;
           Environmental restoration orders and easements;
           Records, inspection and analysis;
           Financial instruments;
           Offences;
           Judicial proceedings; and



                                                30
           International obligations.

58.    The Third Schedule of the National Environment Act (Cap 153) does not specifically list
healthcare facilities under scheduled projects, nonetheless, two sections thereof related to
function or waste management mean that these facilities are not exonerated from the general EIA
process. Section 12 on the Schedule requires that projects related to: a) Sites solid waste
disposal; b) Sites for hazardous waste disposal; c) Sewage disposal; d) Atmospheric emissions;
e) Offensive odours; should undertake a full EIA. This Act also formed the basis for enactment
of the Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines, 1997 and Environmental Impact
Assessment Regulations, 1998 which together prescribe the EIA process in Uganda.

59.   A number of regulations have been issued to implement the National Environmental Act.
Those most relevant for IFTP are described below.

Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1988

60.    National Environment (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1998 define the
role of EIA as a key tool in environmental management, especially in addressing potential
environmental impacts at the pre-project stage. The regulations define the EIA preparation
process, required contents of an EIA, and the review and approval process including provisions
for public review and comment. EIAs and related documents such as project briefs, terms of
reference, hearing reports and comments are defined as public documents. Regulation 31(2)
requires that a developer carries out an environmental audit within a period of 12 months and not
more than 36 months after the completion of a project or the commencement of its operations.
The Third Schedule lists the types of projects for which EIA is mandatory and the circumstances
under which EIA is mandatory for project types not listed. The regulations are interpreted for
developers and practitioners through the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in
Uganda (1997).

The National Environment (Conduct and Certification of Environment Practitioners)
Regulations 2003.

61.     Following concern about the quality of EIA s done by Practitioners, and in order to
provide for a uniform system of certification and registration of EIA practitioners, the National
Environment (Conduct and Certification of Environment Practitioners) Regulations, 2003 were
gazetted and set minimum standards and criteria for qualification as an EIA Practitioner. The
Regulations also establish an independent Committee of Environmental Practitioners whose roles
include, among others, to regulate the certification, registration, practice and conduct of all
environmental impact assessors and environmental auditors. The Committee also has powers to
take disciplinary action as it finds necessary for ensuring the maintenance of high professional
standards, ethics and integrity of environmental Practitioners in the conduct of EIA and
Environmental Audits.

National Environment (Noise Standards and Control) Regulations, 2003

62.   State the permissible noise levels for day/night in five types of area: institutional (45/35
dB(A)), residential (50-35 dB(A)), mixed residential and commercial (55/45 dB(A)), residential



                                               31
with industry and commerce (60/50 dB(A)), and industrial (70/60 dB(A)). It is important that
these standards are written into contract documents for construction and enforced, they should
also be used to guide the location of potentially noisy developments, including taxi and bus parks
and markets and as a basis for follow-up monitoring.

National Environment (Standards for Discharge of Effluent into Water or on Land) Regulations
1999

63.    Promulgate discharge standards for 54 chemical and physical constituents of waste water.
These standards should be adhered to for discharge from liquid waste management plants and
included in ESMPs and follow-up monitoring.

National Environment (Wetlands, River Banks and Lake Shores Management) Regulations, 2000

64.     Highlight the importance of wetlands and other water bodies in the maintenance of a
healthy ecosystem and state that they should be protected from the negative effects of
development projects. Under Regulation 5, EIA is mandatory for all activities in wetlands that
could have an adverse impact. Regulation 8 provides for declaration of certain wetlands as fully
protected wetlands because of national or international importance for biodiversity, ecology,
natural heritage or tourism, and it prohibits all activities in such wetlands except for research,
tourism, or restoration or enhancement. Various of the regulations require protection zones of
between 30 and 200 meters along riverbanks and lake shores and state that no activity shall be
permitted in the protection zones without the approval of the NEMA Executive Director. LG
environmental officers have a duty to assist in implementation of the regulations.

National Environment (Waste Management) Regulations, 1999

65.     Aim to prevent waste from being generated or minimize that fraction that is likely to be
generated. They also address the issues of effective storage, transportation and general handling
of waste once it has been generated. Regulation 15(1) states that an EIA is required before a
license can be issued for operation of a waste treatment plant or disposal site.

Water Act, Cap 152

66.    Provides for the management of water resources and the protection of the water supply.
The act regulates public and private activities that may influence the quality and quantity of
water available for use and establishes the Water Policy Committee to maintain an action plan
for water management and administration. It gives general rights to use water for domestic
purposes, fire-fighting or irrigating a subsistence garden. A permit is required to use water for
constructing or operating any works or to discharge wastewater. Pertinent regulations issued to
implement the Water Act include:
           The Water (Water Resources) Regulations (1998) that describe the water permit
            system; and
           The Water (Waste Discharge) Regulations (1998) that regulate effluent and waste
            water discharges, and require discharge permits to be acquired.




                                               32
National Forestry and Tree Planting Act (2003)

67.     Provides for the conservation, sustainable management and development of forests and
establishes the National Forestry Authority (NFA). It defines forest reserves and specifies what
actions can and cannot be carried out in them. The Act commits government to protect and
sustainably manage the Permanent Forest Estate (PFE), set aside permanently for conservation of
biodiversity and environmental services and sustainable production of forest produce.

Uganda Wildlife Act (1996)

68.     In general, activities in national parks are limited to biodiversity conservation, recreation,
scenic viewing, scientific research and other economic activities. Activities permitted in wildlife
reserves include those for national parks plus “regulated extractive utilization of natural
resources.? Wildlife sanctuaries are declared for the protection or a particular plant or animal
species, and activities that will not be destructive to the species or its habitat are permitted. The
Act states in Section 15 that: “Any developer desiring to undertake any project which may have a
significant effect on any wildlife species or community shall undertake an environmental impact
assessment.? Section 18 describes various types of wildlife conservation areas, including
national parks, wildlife reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, and community wildlife areas, and defines
permissible activities in each type.

Historical Monuments Act Cap 46

69.      Allows a minister to declare any object of archaeological, ethnological, traditional or
historical interest to be a preserved or historical object, and to acquire any land necessary for
preserving it on behalf of the Uganda Land Commission. It also provides protection of historical
sites in development.

70.    This Act provides for the preservation and protection of historical monuments and objects
of archaeological, paleontological, ethnographical and traditional interest. According to this Act,
the responsible Minister may, by statutory instrument, declare any object of archeological,
paleontological, ethnographical, traditional or historical interest to be a protected object.

71.    Once thus declared, the Act adds, no person whether owner or not shall do any of the
following:
            Cultivate or plough soil so as to affect to its detriment any object declared to be
             preserved or protected;
            Make alteration, addition to, or repair, destroy, deface or injure any object declared
             to be preserved or protected; Sub-section 12(1) requires that any portable object
             discovered in the course of an excavation shall be surrendered to the Minister who
             shall deposit it in the Museum.
            However, the Act adds that, notwithstanding provisions of the subsection, where any
             object is discovered in a protected site, place, or monument, the owner of the
             protected site, place, or monument shall be entitled to reasonable compensation.




                                                 33
Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2006

72.     Addresses the duty of the employers to safeguard the health and safety of employees and
the public in the workplace. Section 13 of the Act states that: “it is the duty of an employer to
take, as far as is reasonably practicable, all measures for the protection of his or her workers and
the general public from the dangerous aspects of the employer’s undertaking at his or her own
cost.? Section 18 of the Act tries to safeguard the environment by requiring employers to monitor
and control the release of dangerous substances into the environment when handling chemicals
or any dangerous substance that is liable to be airborne or to be released into rivers, lakes or soil
and that is are a danger to animal and plant life.

Pest Control Products Act

73.     The Control of Agricultural Chemicals Statute 8/1989 was established to control the
manufacture, storage, regulate the trade in use importation, exportation and distribution of
agricultural chemicals through labelling, advertising, classification and licensing. The National
Drug Authority (NDA) is the body responsible for registering all insecticides in Uganda. This
involves ensuring the insecticide to be used complies with all safety requirements through
appropriate transportation, labeling, packaging, use and disposal.

Local Governments Act, Cap 243

74.    The Local Government Act (LGA) was enacted to give effect to the policy of
decentralization and devolution of functions, powers and services; and to provide for
decentralization at all levels of LG to ensure good governance and democratic participation in,
and control of decision making by the people. The Local Government Act provides for the
system of LGs, which is based on the district. Under the district there are lower LGs and
administrative units. This system provides for elected Councils.

75.   The chairman nominates the executive committee of each council. The functions of this
committee include:
           Initiating and formulating policy for approval of council;
           Overseeing the implementation of the Government and Councils’ policies, and
            monitor and coordinate activities of Non-Government Organizations in the district;
            and
           Receiving and solving disputes forwarded to it from lower LGs

76.     According to the second schedule to the LGA, the Central Government is responsible for
water resources and the environment (Part I, Second Schedule of the Local Government Act).
The Lower Local Government Councils (sub-county or division) are responsible for the
protection and maintenance of local water resources (Part 4). It is the function of the various
executive committees, including the parish or village executive committees, to generally monitor
projects and other activities undertaken by government, LGs, and non-governmental
organizations in their area (Section 50(8)).




                                                 34
Public Health Act, Cap 281

77.    provides local authorities with administrative powers to take measures for preventing or
dealing with any outbreak of infectious, communicable or preventable disease. It imposes a duty
on the local authority regarding pollution of the drinking or domestic water supply, and directs
where to locate waste disposal facilities in relation to settlements and food points.

78.     The Public Health Act aims at avoiding pollution of environmental resources that support
health and livelihoods of communities. It gives local authorities powers (Section 103) to prevent
pollution of watercourses in interest of public good.

Physical Planning Act, 2011

79.     This Act replaced the Town and Country Planning Act, Cap 246 which was enacted in
1951 and revised in 1964 but is now inconsistent with contemporary government system in
Uganda. The 1951 Act was enacted to regulate and operate in a centralised system of governance
where physical planning was carried out at national level through the Town and Country
Planning Board. Implementation of the Act was supervised by LGs, especially the urban LGs.
Uganda has since gone through many social, political and economic changes. For example,
promulgation of the 1995 Constitution established a decentralised system of governance which
divulged powers and functions including physical planning, finance and execution of projects
from the central government to LGs. This therefore created a need to enact a physical planning
legislation which is consistent with this Constitutional requirement.

80.    The Physical Planning Act, 2011 establishes district and urban physical planning
committees, provides for making and approval of physical development plans and applications
for development. Section 37 of the Physical Planning Act, 2011 requires an EIA permit for
developments before they are implemented, stating: “Where a development application related to
matters that require an environmental impact assessment, the approving authority may grant
preliminary approval subject to the applicant obtaining an EIA certificate in accordance with the
National Environment Act?.

Institutional Framework for Environmental Systems Management Relevant to Project

Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources

81.    The Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE) is the line ministry responsible for the
formulation and implementation of water and environment-related policies, laws and regulations
in Uganda. NEMA, NFA and DWRM all fall under the oversight of MoWE. Its main functions
include:
           Mobilization of resources required to run and implement environmental related
            projects and related issues;
           Overall responsibility for environmental policy formulation and implementation;
            introduction of new draft laws and regulations to Parliament and draft amendments
            of existing laws and regulations; and
           Coordination with LGs on environment related issues.


                                               35
The Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Heritage (MoTWH)

82.    The Department of Wildlife liaises with the Uganda Wildlife Authority and the
Department of Museums and Monuments has the responsibility of protecting physical cultural
resources and is a line Ministry called in by NEMA when required.

Ministry of Local Government

83.     The Ministry is mandated to carry out a number of responsibilities in the Local
Government Act, including to inspect, monitor and offer technical advice, support supervision
and training to all LGs, to coordinate and advise LGs for the purposes of harmonization and
advocacy, to act as a liaison ministry with respect to other Central Government Ministries and
other institutions and to research and develop national policies on all taxes, fees, etc., for LGs.

Municipal and District Councils

84.    Municipalities and districts are responsible for development planning and for oversight of
environmental impact management within their boundaries. The key person for environmental
management is the Environmental Officer (MEO/DEO).

The National Forest Authority

85.     Was established by the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act. It is mandated to ensure
the conservation, sustainable management and development of the national forest estate. Under
the 1993 Local Government (Resistance Councils) Statute, co-ordination of development
programs, including forest management, were decentralized to the district level. The NFA is thus
responsible for 506 central forest reserves (CFR), with District Forest Service (DFS) responsible
for local forest reserves (LFRs) – although these amount to less than one per cent of the total
forested areas.

86.     EIAs are required for all developments within gazetted forests, which will be reviewed by
NFA as a Lead Agency. Directorate of Water Resources Management (DWRM). Under the
MOWE, it has the mandate to “promote and ensure rational and sustainable utilization, effective
management and safeguard of water for social and economic welfare and development as well as
for regional and international peace?. It is responsible for managing, monitoring and regulating
water resources through issuing water use, water abstraction and wastewater discharge permits.

National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)

87.    NWSC is state-owned utility within the Ministry of Water and Environment. It is
responsible for construction and operation of water supply and sewerage facilities in much of
Uganda, because these functions have not been decentralized to LGs.

Uganda Wildlife Authority

88.      Was established by the Uganda Wildlife Act. It monitors regulatory compliance of
activities in wildlife protected areas (national parks and reserves); harmonizes national and
international performance standards on wildlife protected areas; monitors impact of development


                                                36
activities on wildlife protected areas; and participates in evaluation of EIAs and environmental
audits, mandatory where development takes place within a protected area, but also will be called
in by NEMA for EIA review in cases where wildlife might be affected outside of protected areas.

Wetlands Management Department

89.     Wetlands Management Department (WMD) is mandated to manage wetland resources
and its goal is to sustain the biophysical and socio-economic values of the wetlands in Uganda
for present and future generations. WMD has over the years built the capacity of LGs to assess
wetland resources, plan and implement activities for their proper management.

National Environment Management Authority

90.     The National Environment Management Authority, which became operational in 1996,
was created as the principle agency responsible for oversight, co-ordination, supervision and
monitoring implementation and compliance to the EIA requirements and also to champion EIA
capacity building in Uganda. Section 6(1) (f) of the Environment Act provides that the Authority
is charged with the function to review and approve environmental impact assessments submitted
in accordance with the provisions in the Act or any other law.

91.    The main functions of NEMA include the following, among others:
           To ensure the integration of environmental concerns in overall national planning
            through coordination with the relevant ministries, departments and agencies of
            government;
           To liaise with the private sector, government agencies and NGOS on issues relating
            to the environment;
           To propose environmental policies and strategies to the Policy Committee;
           To initiate legislative proposals, standards and guidelines on the environment in
            accordance with the National Environment Act;
           To review and approve Environmental Impact Assessments submitted in accordance
            with the National Environment Act or any other law;
           To promote public awareness through formal, non-formal and informal education
            about environmental issues;
           To undertake such studies and submit such reports and recommendations with
            respect to the environment as the government or the Policy Committee may consider
            necessary;
           To ensure observance of proper safeguards in the planning and execution of all
            development projects, including those already in existence that have or are likely to
            have significant impact on the environment;
           To undertake research, and disseminate information about the environment;
           Promote, encourage and ensure enforcement of environmental standards, regulations
            and the National Environment Statute, 1995.


                                               37
92.     Within NEMA is found the Department of Environment Monitoring and Compliance,
which is responsible for environmental monitoring and ensuring compliance to environmental
regulations and standards. The department also provides technical guidance on EIA matters and
coordinates review of EIAs with other sectors/lead agencies, and provides advisory services to
developers on EIA matters. The department is also responsible for preparation and issuance of
EIA certificates and also implements a follow up program to ensure that mitigation measures as
contained in the EIAs and approval conditions stated in the certificates of approval are
implemented. The department also carries out training and capacity building on EIA.

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process in Uganda

93.    The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) is the central EIA authority
in Uganda. NEMA is responsible for the review of all EIAs and the issuance of EIA guidelines.

Decentralization of EIA Mandates

94.     In Uganda, decision-making regarding EIA partly also takes place at the local level. In
general, decision-making falls under the responsibility of the executive director of NEMA at
national level. Nevertheless, before taking the decisions, local authorities are consulted for
projects that fall within or across their boundaries. Moreover, screening decisions are taken by
local authorities. The EIA process in Uganda is shown schematically in Figure 3 below.

Basic Steps in the Uganda EIA Process.

95.    The basic steps in the Ugandan EIA process include the following:

Step I: The developer submits a project brief to NEMA and to any other appropriate lead
agency. The Project Brief outlines basic information on the proposed activity/project to establish
whether or not the activity is likely to have significant impact on the environment.

Step II: Based on the contents of the Project Brief, the Authority (NEMA), in consultation with
an appropriate lead agency (ies), carries out screening to determine adequacy of the Project
Brief, in terms of the extent it addresses the environmental issues or level of EIA required if it
has not been done.

96.     The premise of the screening phase is that not all development projects may necessarily
cause adverse effects on the environment due to differences in scale of the operation, nature of
the proposed project and its location. Thus, not all proposed projects requiring EIA shall
necessarily undergo the same level of assessment. The objective of the screening phase therefore
is to determine the level of EIA required depending on whether the project has or does not have
significant impacts.

97.    Only projects listed in the third schedule of the National Environment Cap 153 are
subject to EIA. The list contains no minimum thresholds or location criteria. NEMA may also
screen projects that are not listed in the third schedule but are likely to be out of character with
the surroundings, and conclude that these are subject to EIA. The process begins with the
proponent submitting a Project Brief to the Executive Director of NEMA for review. If the brief
meets the prescribed requirements set in the EIA regulation, it is sent to the lead agency and any


                                                38
other relevant stakeholders for comments. The Executive Director, after review of the Project
Brief and the comments from other stakeholders may issue a certificate of approval for the
activity if:
       (a) No significant impacts are expected or;
       (b) Sufficient mitigation measures are proposed.

98.     In case the review of the Project Brief reveals that the proposed project is likely to have
significant negative impacts for which no adequate mitigation measures are prescribed, then a
detailed EIA is requested.

Step III: The developer is informed of the findings and decision whether further assessment is
necessary or not. If the Project Brief adequately addresses environmental concerns, approval can
be issued without the need for further assessment.

Step IV: If the Project Brief is not adequate, a full Environmental Impact Study will be required
and scoping to determine the likely significant environmental Impact is done and based on the
scoping output, Terms of Reference (TORs) are prepared for approval by NEMA,

Step V: The Environmental Impact Study is then carried out based on approved TORs

Step VI: After the assessment, the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is submitted to
NEMA for review in consultation with other relevant lead agencies and stakeholders. Depending
on the nature of environmental impacts at hand, the review process may include holding of a
public hearing especially where there are controversial issues, impacts of a trans-boundary nature
or very outstanding social concerns.

Step VII: Based on the review of the EIS, a final decision is then taken on the environmental
aspects of the project. Such a decision shall be contained in a Certificate of Approval of the
Environmental Impact Assessment issued by the Authority. The EIA process also provides for
subsequent post EIA monitoring after approval has been granted. This provides for both self-
monitoring by the developer.

Stakeholder Consultation in EIA Process

99.    Stakeholder consultation is mandatory at scoping, Terms of Reference preparation,
during the environmental study, and preparation of the draft Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS).

Monitoring, Compliance and Enforcement

100. Monitoring is a requirement both for the state of the environment during the operation of
the activity and for compliance with the conditions of approval. The proponent is required to
undertake an initial environmental audit (by a specified date, which is between 12 to 36 months
after commencement of the project) carried out by persons whose names and qualifications have
been approved by the Executive Director of NEMA. Subsequently, the Executive Director may
require other audits at any other time. After each audit, an environmental audit report shall be
prepared by the developer and submitted to the Executive Director. The Environmental Audit
Regulations (2006) specify the auditing requirements.


                                                 40
External Monitoring

101. There are possibilities for external monitoring. Inspectors, "gazetted" by NEMA, may
conduct inspections at any time. In addition, inspection can be undertaken by lead agencies for
areas under their jurisdiction. The public may, after showing reasonable cause, request that an
environmental audit be carried out.

Non-compliance Penalties

102. The Executive Director may cancel the certificate of approval when: there is no
compliance with the conditions of the certificate, there is a substantial modification of the
activity during implementation, where these is a substantive undesirable effect not in the
approval. Where the proponent fails to implement the mitigation measures, an inspector may
issue a notice of improvement, to order a cessation of the activity unless improvement is
realized. The Environmental Act of 1995 states that any person who fails to submit a project
brief, or an EIA report or who gives a false statement in the EIA process is liable to an offence
and if prosecuted may be imprisoned for 18 months and fined between 180,000 and 18,000,000
UGX or both (1USD=2000UGX).

Role of LGs in Environmental Assessment and Management

103. Section 15 of part 2 of the second schedule of the 1997 Local Government Act, provides
that municipal and district councils are responsible for, among other things, assisting
“government to preserve the environment through protection of forests, wetlands, lake shores,
streams and prevention of environmental degradation? (RoU 1997). Elsewhere in the schedule, it
is stated that councils are responsible for vector control, environmental sanitation, entomological
services and vermin control, and forests and wetlands. However, according to the same schedule,
forests and game policy remain the preserve of the central government. Part 4 of the Local
Government Act 1997, details functions and services that may be devolved by the district council
to lower LG councils.

Executive Powers

104. The District and Municipal Council’s executive powers also include powers to raise taxes
and approve annual budgets and estimates. These are important powers in terms of the
environment because they give the council some autonomy in allocating resources for
environmental management. Lower-level LGs also have executive committees.

105. Within the local council structures, there are elected representatives at all levels—LC1 to
LC5—who serve as secretaries in charge of production and environment. These are supposed to:
[be contact persons] on behalf of the community on environment issues, organize public
meetings to educate and mobilize residents on proper environment management, e.g. good
sanitation, good farming practices, tree planting and proper use of wetlands; collect and
disseminate information on environment; link communities with extension staff, NGOs/CBOs
and other support agencies; act as an overseer and inform relevant authorities on activities that
may be destructive to the environment and well-being of the community and enforce government
laws and bylaws to ensure that members of the community in his or her area follow such laws
[e.g. cleaning wells or homesteads, and prevention of soil erosions]. (NEMA 1995: 22).


                                                41
106. The law provides that councils, using guidelines provided by NEMA, appoint
environmental officers (DEO/MEOs). The EOs have several functions; they are required to:
[advise] the Environment Committee on matters relating to the environment; liaise with NEMA
on matters relating to Environment, promote environmental awareness through public
educational campaigns, assist Local Environmental Committees in the performance of their
functions; gather and manage information on the environment and the utilization of natural
resources in the jurisdiction; serve as secretary to the Environment Committee; assist the district
to incorporate environmental and land-use concerns in district development plans; increase
community participation in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
environmental activities; and assist the district and NEMA in gathering environmental
information (NEMA 1995: 18).

Technical Planning Committees

107. Technical Planning Committees are established at different levels in line with the Local
Government Act and have environmental assessment and management related roles. District
Technical Planning Committees (DTPC) and lower LG technical planning committees are
responsible for the following actions:
       (a) District Technical Planning Committee (DTPC)
                Initiate, implement and report on implementation of plans and budgets.
                Co-ordinate and integrate all Sectoral plans
                Co-ordinate and integrate plans for sectors within the area of lower local
                 councils into the SDP
                Appraise individual investment projects before presentation to the council
                Appraise Parish Project
                Submit the integrated plan to the Council through the Executive committee for
                 consideration
                Facilitate Parish level planning meetings
                Give technical support to PDC's on planning and budget issues
       (b) Lower LG Technical Planning Committees
                Responsible for coordinating the planning process in their areas of jurisdiction
                 (LGA).
Use of Screening Forms

108. Where an EIA is not required, the DTPC with the assistance of the MEO review the
Environmental Social and Screening Form (ESSF) and make a decision on whether the results of
the screening process reports are acceptable and then recommend for approval to the local
council if sub project complies with all requirements.




                                                42
Environmental Committees

109. The Local Government Act requires establishment of environmental committees at the
following levels; -
       (a) District Environmental Committees
       (b) Municipal Environmental Committees
       (c) Divisional Environmental Committees
       (d) Village Environmental Committees
       (e) Cell Environmental Committees

110. The table below shows the roles and services expected from the central, local and village
and community levels.

Table 3. Roles and services expected from the central, local and village and community levels of government




Resources and Capacity

LG Environmental Staffing

111. The National Environment Management Authority was established under the National
Environment Act, as the principal agency responsible for monitoring, supervising and


                                                    43
coordinating all activities in the field of environmental management in Uganda. In order to
improve the capacity of Government in ensuring sustainable use of natural resources,
Government through NEMA put in place a number of environmental regulations.

112. The implementation of the regulations including monitoring an enforcement, is the
responsibility of the District Authorities and relevant Lead Agencies while NEMA’s role is to
provide oversight on enforcement of the regulations. Local communities and resource users have
a key role to play in the protection and sustainable use of natural resources. Figure 4 shows the
institutional framework for environmental assessment and management implementation.

    Figure 4. Institutional framework for environmental assessment and management implementation.




Staffing and qualifications (District/Municipal Environmental Officers)

113. Details of the field assessment are summarized in annex 1 - The Environment Officer is
the key local officer in charge of a large number of tasks in natural resource and environmental
management at the district or municipal level. Generally, this one administrative officer alone is
responsible for fulfilling these tasks, although he or she is expected to collaborate with other
technical staff at the district level and with the Local Environmental Committee.

114. However, qualified and motivated staff are hard to find, especially for the more remote
districts. This search is even further complicated by the high turnover among DEOs. This
problem seriously hampers effective local environmental policy.

115. Even though there is supposed to be an environmental officer at the level of the district or
municipal councils but given the size and sheer volume of sub-projects being planned and
implemented at lower level, the technical back up to lower LGs is generally unavailable.
According to NEMA, districts and municipal councils are under staffed and require at least 8
officers to effectively implement required tasks and functions.

116. The Department of Natural Resources at district and municipal council which is
responsible for environmental protection is required to have other technical officers who handle
other related aspects of the environment. These complimenting positions to that of the DEO are
rarely fully staffed as with the case of Ntungamo District where critical posts including District


                                                 44
Natural Resource Officer; Environment Officer; Forestry Officer, and Senior Land Management
Officer remain vacant. The department has only seven officers (Senior Environment Officer,
Physical Planner, Staff Surveyor, Office Typist, Assistant Records Officer, Forest Guard and
Cartographer.

117. In Kabale Municipality, in the Natural Resource Department, out of 17 required staff,
there only 9 post that have been filled including; -Municipal Engineer, Superintendent of Works,
Water Officer, Physical Planner, Environment officer, Assistant Engineer Officer (Mechanical),
Office Attendant, driver, Plant Operators and Porters. The following posts (8) remain vacant to
date namely: - Senior Assistant Engineer Officer (Civil), Senior Assistant Engineer Officer
(Building), Land supervisor, 2 Assistant Engineer Officer (Electrical), Pool stenographer,
Foreman of works, plumber and Land Patrol man driver.

118. Some Municipal Councils are too huge for instance Kabale Municipality (visited during
the study) and thus the need to have Environment Officers at divisional level as well but have
none with only an MEO at the municipal level which as a matter of fact is in need for an
additional staff to work hand in hand with the current environment Officer

Tensions Within LGs

119. Tensions between administrative staff and politicians in the district are the consequence
of the different kinds of legitimacy they invoke for their choices and decisions. Nominated
technocratic and administrative personnel such as the Resident District Commissioner (RDC),
the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), and the DEO generally base their decisions on national
laws and guidelines as well as on professional information, whereas local politicians (notably the
District Chairperson [DCP]) are elected officials and have legitimate claims to represent their
constituencies (Kabumba 2007).

120. Unsurprisingly, elected (local) leaders are often not very inclined to enforce
environmental laws when they are (expected to be) inconvenient to their voters; to do so is to
risk not being re-elected. These constituencies are, for instance, not always supportive of the
introduction and implementation of local environmental protection measures (Caulfield 2006)
such as prohibitions on the use of wetlands or forests. Bazaara (2003) found that councilors have
difficulty enacting environmental legislation or enforcing laws that would create electoral
difficulties or that are not in their personal interests. In other cases, however, local councilors
may receive support from their electorate to make decisions that are beneficial to the
environment.

Budget Resources/Financial Capacity

121. The budgetary allocation for environmental management by the Ministry of LG to local
and municipal councils is very little compared to what would be required to ensure
environmental management. Different policy goals compete heavily for resources available in
the district’s general budget, and the environmental sector is relatively weak in this competition.
While some areas secure resources through dedicated funding from the central government, this
is not the case for environmental protection.




                                                45
122. For example, Ntungamo district (one of the districts visited during the ESSA field study)
budgetary provision is below average as per the department plan. The department requested for
UGX 45,430,000 in the financial year (FY) 2016/2017. This is distributed quarterly via
disbursement of 11,357,500 UGX. However, in the first and second quarter the disbursements
were UGX 4,375,000 and 4,378,064 respectively accounting for 38.5% of the required
disbursement by December 31, 2016.

123. In Kabale Municipal Council, there is budgetary provision for the planned departmental
activities but is insufficient. In the previous financial year (FY) 2015/2016, the department had
planned to use 70,543,000 UGX for the compliance monitoring but the department was given 50,
167, 920 UGX; this accounted for 70.11%. Effective implementation is hampered by the lack of
financial and human resources at the local level.

National Environment Management Authority

124. Uganda has a fairly robust legal framework for environmental management, known as the
Environmental Management Act which provided for the establishment of NEMA as well as other
institutions responsible for the protection and management of the environment. NEMA is
mandated as the principal agency in Uganda for the management of the environment. It co-
ordinates, monitors and supervises all activities in the field of the environment. In carrying out
its mandate, it regulates and is expected to ensure that the principles of environment management
stipulated in the Act are observed. NEMA is organized into five Departments, each headed by a
Director.

125. Environment Monitoring and Compliance Department: The department is
responsible for environmental monitoring and ensuring compliance by the regulated community.
It ensures development and effective implementation of procedures and guidelines and provides
technical guidance in the area of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). It coordinates issuance
of EIA Certificates and Permits on protected/regulated areas to developers. It implements a
follow up program to ensure that mitigation measures are put in place as well as training and
capacity building for ElAs. The department also carries out environmental audits and inspections
to ensure compliance with environmental standards and regulations, and provides technical
guidance in ecosystems and natural resource management.

126. District Support Coordination and Public Education Department: The department is
responsible for initiating and coordinating activities and initiatives that support districts,
communities and the public to address environmental issues. The major objective is to ensure
integrated and multi-sectoral environmental planning at the district and community levels. The
department also promotes the integration of environmental issues in the formal and non-formal
education sectors and the production and dissemination of environmental education materials.
The department is further responsible for promoting the development of adequate environmental
management skills and awareness to ensure sustainable utilization of the country’s environment
and natural resources.




                                               46
Environmental Monitoring and Impact Assessment

127. Under the Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines two systems of monitoring are
specified as:- self-monitoring whereby the developers themselves are encouraged to monitor the
impact of their activities and; enforcement monitoring done by government agencies such as
NEMA through environmental inspectors (S. 23(2))

Public Awareness and Participation

128. The need for popular awareness is a key requirement for enforcement of legislation.
NEMA is given the mandate to carry out education and awareness campaigns to ensure that the
public participates in environmental decision making and enforcement.

Staffing

129. NEMA Uganda has less than 50 technical staff and this fact makes it very challenging for
the institution to monitor and enforce as well as conduct public awareness campaigns. In an
effort to address the staffing gap, NEMA has gazetted Environmental Inspectors to help in
monitoring. Presently, 334 environmental inspectors are gazetted by NEMA but that is still
considered inadequate.

Budget Resources/Financial Capacity

130. NEMA has faced a challenge of underfunding. There has also been delayed and
inadequate funding for timely activity implementation especially compliance and enforcement of
environmental law, regulations and projects.

131. Inadequate finance for managing the increasing demands for environment management
from the increasing number of LGs, Central government/Lead Agencies, Civil Society and the
Private Sector is a perennial problem and concern for NEMA. The absence of adequate funding
is interfering with the mandate of NEMA to provide: Support to LGs to establish effective
systems and build capacity to coordinate environment management via functioning District
Environment Committees.

132.   The inadequate funds curbs NEMA’s mandate to among others;
       1.   Assist new districts to designate and to operationalize District Environmental
            Committees of the District Councils.
       2.   Conduct national workshops to sensitize all District political and technical
            leadership
       3.   Train District Technical Planning Committees (DTPCs), DECs and selected NGOs
            on roles of various LG officials/organs in decentralized environment management
            and development of action plans.
       4.   Arrange and put in place to provide financial resources to each focal district DEC to
            facilitate its activities.




                                               47
       5.   Undertake ecosystems management planning sessions (barazas) held in the selected
            priority sites.
       6.   Sensitization and awareness raising in lead agencies.
       7.   Building enforcement capacity within the Lead Agencies and assisting them to use
            economic instruments in environment management.
       8.   Integrating environmental concerns in the policies, plans, programs, projects and
            budgets of Lead Agencies.

Insufficient Role in Land Boards

133. According to NEMA, the absence of environmental officers as full members of the
district land boards is a significant contributor to environmental degradation especially of
wetlands where LGs have been issuing land titles in designated wetlands in total contravention of
existing laws on environment conservation.

Summary of Environmental System Performance

134. This assessment establishes that environmental risks associated with the construction and
operation of education and health facilities as envisaged by this Program, are modest, and can be
managed through adherence to established procedures for screening, contracting, and supervision
during implementation. Nevertheless, in almost half of surveyed Districts, good screening is not
carried out, and in the majority of Districts, staff and material shortages hamper both screening
and especially supervision. There have been advances in health waste management in the country
though again, adherence at the local level may be problematic.

IV. Uganda’s Social Management Systems

The Constitution of Uganda and Involuntary Resettlement

135. The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) provides government and local
authorities a statutory power of compulsory acquisition of land in public interest, and makes
provision, inter alia, for the “prompt payment of fair and adequate compensation? prior to the
taking of possession of any privately-owned property. Such compensation is assessed in
accordance with the valuation principles laid out in Section 78 of the Land Act (Cap 227), briefly
outlined below:
           The value for customary land is the open market value of unimproved land;
           The value of buildings on the land is taken at open market value for urban areas, and
            depreciated replacement cost for rural areas;
           The value of standing crops on the land is determined in accordance with the district
            compensation rates established by the respective District Land Board. Annual crops
            which could be harvested during the period of notice to vacate given to the
            landowner/ occupier of the land are excluded in determining compensation values;
           In addition to the total compensation assessed, there is a disturbance allowance paid
            of 15% or, if less than six months’ notice to vacate is given, 30% of the total sum
            assessed.

Constitution of Uganda and Indigenous Peoples

136. The overall legal framework for ethnic minorities (also known as indigenous peoples) is
derived from the Constitution of the Republic Uganda 1995 (as amended), the Equal
Opportunities Commission Act 2007, international and regional conventions, treaties, protocols
and declarations to which Uganda is party that relate to or are relevant to the protection of ethnic
minorities socially, politically, economically and environmentally.

137. The Constitution offers no express protection for indigenous peoples but Article 32
places a mandatory duty on the state to take affirmative action in favor of groups who have been
historically disadvantaged and discriminated against. The Constitution also mandated Parliament
to enact appropriate laws, including laws for the establishment of an Equal Opportunities
Commission (EOC), for the purpose of giving full effect to Article 32.

138. According to the Uganda National Housing and Population Census 2014, conducted by
the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, there are 75 ethnic groups in Uganda that make a total
population of 34,142,417 (male 16,595,014; female 17,547,403). Of the total ethnic groups, 25
registered a population below 47,700 (1.4% of the total population). These include the Vonoma,
Mening, Mvuba, Bahehe, Ngikutio, Batwa, Leri, Nyangia, Banyabutumbi, Shana, Gimara, Ik
(Teuso), Basongora, Banyabindi, Aliba, Lendu, So (Tepeth), Napore, Nubi, Chope, Batuku,
Babukusu, Baamba, Kuku and Banyala.




                                                49
139. It is important to note that the Ik people have their first Member of Parliament in the 10th
Ugandan Parliament in 2016. The Ik people live in the mountains that make up Morungole,
which is on the border with Kenya and in the Kidepo Valley Park region of northeastern Uganda.
The Ik people are a small tribe in number.

Ugandan Vision 2025

140. The long term national development framework is the Uganda Vision 2025. Pertinent
aspirations of this Vision include harmonizing co-existence that promote social inclusion among
the people of Uganda; effective governance through a democratic process; a healthy well
educated society with a high quality of life and equal opportunities, empowerment and economic
prosperity for all. This Policy therefore helps promote these aspirations.

National Land Policy 2013

141. This new land policy addresses the contemporary land issues and conflicts facing the
Country. The vision of the policy is: “Sustainable and optimal use of land and land-based
resources for transformation of Ugandan society and the economy? while the goal of the policy
is: “to ensure efficient, equitable and sustainable utilization and management of Uganda’s land
and land-based resources for poverty reduction, wealth creation and overall socio-economic
development?.

142. Access to Land for Investment: Section 4.16 of the Policy (86) states that government
shall put in place measures to mitigate the negative impacts of investment on land so as to
deliver equitable and sustainable development. While part 90 of the same section positions
government to protect land rights, including rights of citizens in the face of investments with
measures for clear procedures and standards for local consultation; mechanisms for appeal and
arbitration; and facilitate access to land by vulnerable groups in the face of investments.

143. Measures for Protection of Land Rights: Section 4.18 (93) of the Policy recognizes the
inability of the majority of Ugandan to afford the cost of formally securing land rights and
therefore government will put in place a framework that would ensure that land rights held by all
Ugandans are fully and effectively enjoyed.

144.   Rights for Minorities: As regards land rights of ethnic minorities, the Policy states that:

(a) Government shall, in its use and management of natural resources, recognize and protect the
right to ancestral lands of ethnic minority groups;
(b) Government shall pay prompt, adequate and fair compensation to ethnic minority groups that
are displaced from their ancestral land by government action.

145. To redress the rights of ethnic minorities in natural habitats, Government will take
measures to:
       (a) establish regulations by Statutory Instrument to:
               recognize land tenure rights of minorities in ancestral lands;




                                                50
               document and protect such de facto occupation rights against illegal evictions or
                displacements;
               consider land swapping or compensation or resettlement in the event of
                expropriation of ancestral land of minorities for preservation or conservation
                purposes;
               detail terms and conditions for displacement of minorities from their ancestral
                lands in the interest of conservation or natural resources extraction;
       (b) pay compensation to those ethnic minorities that have in the past been driven off
           their ancestral lands for preservation or conservation purposes;
       (c) deliberate and specify benefit-sharing measures to ensure that minority groups
           benefit from resources on their ancestral lands rendered to extractive or other
           industry;
       (d) recognize the vital role of natural resources and habitats in the livelihood of minority
           groups in the gazettement or degazettement of conservation and protected areas.

National Gender Policy, 1997

146. The government adopted a National Gender Policy of 1997, a tool to guide and direct the
planning, resource allocation and implementation of development programs with a gender
perspective. The adoption of the gender policy has facilitated Uganda’s gender mainstreaming
programs in all sectors of the economy (implying, the planned works project should equally
integrate gender into the implementation of works.

National Policy For Older Persons 2009

147. This policy is clearly set within the framework of the Constitution of the Republic of
Uganda and other laws that promote the rights of older persons among other vulnerable groups.
It provides a framework for enhancing the recognition of the roles, contributions and potentials
of older persons in the development process among others. The policy targets older persons aged
60 years and above with special emphasis on the vulnerable. Section 3.4 states that, “All
stakeholders will ensure that issues of older women and men are included in planning and
implementation of programs.?

National Disaster Preparedness and Management Policy (2010)

148. The policy provides a framework that details mechanisms and structures for the effective
and practical management of disasters. The policy covers the broad subjects of vulnerability
assessment, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, which constitute “comprehensive
disaster management?. It networks all the lead sectors, LGs, international development and
humanitarian partners, the private sector and the NGOs under the principle of a multi?
disciplinary and multi?skilled consultative approach. It also presents an institutional framework
under which the partners coordinate their operations. It further recognizes the need to place
emphasis on the vulnerable groups in drought-prone areas.




                                               51
Land Act Cap 227

149. Land Act, Cap 227 The Land Act principally addresses four issues namely; holding,
control, management and land disputes. As regards tenure, the Act repeats, in Section 3,
provisions of Article 237 of the Constitution which vests all land in the citizens of Uganda, to be
held under customary, freehold, mailo or leasehold tenure systems. However, the Land Act
provides for acquisition of land or rights to use land for execution of public works. Regarding
control of land use, the Act reaffirms the statutory power of compulsory acquisition conferred on
the government and local authorities under articles 26 (2) and 237(2) (a) of the Constitution
(Section 43). Since the Act does not repeal the Land Acquisition Act No. 14 of 1965, it is
assumed that this legislation, meets requirements of Article 26(2) of the Constitution that
requires a law to be in place for the payment of compensation and access to the courts. The Act
also requires that landowners manage and utilize land in accordance with regulatory land use
planning (Sections 44 and 46). Section 77(2) of the revised edition (2000) of the Land Act 1998
provides for a disturbance allowance on top of the computed compensation amount as follows:
           30% of compensation amount if quit notice is given within 3 months.
           15% of compensation amount if quit notice is given after 6 months.

150. The Land Act will govern all aspects related to land taken by the project and its
compensation either by replacement with physical land parcels or cash payments.

151. The rights of spouse and children are protected under the Constitution of Uganda and the
Land Act (Cap 227). The consent of spouse and children must be acquired prior to any
transaction by the head of household on land on which the family ordinarily resides. Section 40
of the Land Act, 1998 requires that no person shall:
       (a) Sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease any land; or enter into any
           contract for the sale, exchange, transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease of any land;
       (b) Give away any land inter vivos, or enter into any transaction in respect of land:
                In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her
                 spouse, and from which they derive their sustenance, except with the prior
                 written consent of the spouse;
                In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her
                 dependent children of majority age, except with the prior written consent of the
                 dependent children of majority age;
                In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her
                 dependent children below the majority age, except with the prior written
                 consent of the Committee;
                In the case of land on which ordinarily reside orphans below majority age with
                 interest in inheritance of the land, except with prior written consent of the
                 Committee.

152. Section 27 thereof provides a basis for the nullification of all customary practices that
undermine the rights of women, children and persons with disability on land. The Act creates


                                                52
equitable distribution of land as a resource and nullifies all those land transactions, which are
discriminatory against marginalized groups and violate articles 33, 34 and 35 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Uganda 1995. Section 39 thereof provides for protection of rights of family
members on family land. The Act further provides for representation of women on the Uganda
Land Commission and District Land Boards.

The Land Regulations, 2004

153. Section 24(1) of the Land Regulations, 2004 states that the District Land Board shall,
when compiling and maintaining a list of rates of compensation, take into consideration the
following: a) Compensation shall not be payable in respect of any crop which is illegally grown;
b) As much time as possible shall be allowed for harvest of seasonal crops; c) The current market
value of the crop and trees in their locality will form the basis of determining compensation; d)
For buildings of non-permanent nature, replacement cost less depreciation will form the basis of
compensation.

The Land (Amendment) Act 2010

154. Section 76(1) (a) of the Land (Amendment) Act 2010 states that the jurisdiction of the
District Land Tribunal shall be to determine dispute relating to the grant, lease, repossession,
transfer or acquisition of land by individuals, the commission or other authority with
responsibility relating to land.

Land Acquisition Act (1965)

155. This Act makes provision for the procedures and method of compulsory acquisition of
land for public purposes whether for temporary or permanent use. The Minister responsible for
land may authorize any person to enter upon the land and survey the land, dig or bore the subsoil
or any other thing necessary for ascertaining whether the land is suitable for a public purpose.
The Government of Uganda is supposed to pay compensation to any person who suffers damage
as a result of any action. Any dispute as to the compensation payable is to be referred to the
Attorney General or court for decision. The Land Acquisition Act stops at payment of
compensation. It is not a legal requirement to purchase alternative land for the affected people by
the project. Once they are promptly and adequately compensated, then the obligations stop there.
The Government through the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban development will pay the
compensation to the affected persons.

Local Government Act (1997)

156. Local Government Act 1997 provides for the system of LGs, which is based on the
District. Under the District there are lower LGs and administrative units. This system provides
for elected councils that have both legislative and executive powers. Thus the district councils
play an important role in land administration; land surveying, physical planning, and
management of municipal resources that are not the responsibility of the central government.

157. This act provides for a district based system of LGs. They are therefore charged with the
crucial role of acquisition of land for development/construction purposes and in the sensitization
and mobilization of the local communities. This system also provides for elected Councils


                                                53
whereby chairmen nominate the executive committee of each council, functions of which
include: i) Initiating and formulating policy for approval by council; ii) Overseeing the
implementation of Government and Council policies, and monitor and coordinate activities of
Non-Government Organizations in the district; and iii) Receiving and solving disputes forwarded
to it from lower LGs. The Act empowers districts administrations to develop and implement
district rates upon which compensation for crops and non-permanent structures is based.

The Town and Country Planning Act (1964)

158. The Town and Country Planning Act of 1964 gives broad powers to planning authorities
at the national and local level to take land, against compensation, for public purposes within an
approved planning area. Further, such authorities can determine set back lines “beyond which no
building may project? into a roadway including the road reserve area.

Local Council Courts Act

159. The Local Council Courts Act establishes Local Council Courts for the administration of
justice at the local level, defines the jurisdiction, powers and procedures of the established courts
and for other related matters. The legal jurisdiction of Local Council Courts includes matters
related to; land disputes, domestic violence, children related cases, assaults and battery,
conversion, damage to property, trespass and adultery.

Land Tenure System

160. Article 237 of the Constitution, 1995, vests land ownership in citizens of Uganda and
identifies four land tenure systems, namely: customary; freehold; mailo; and leasehold. These
systems are detailed under Section 4 of the Land Act (Cap 227) and outlined below:

Customary Tenure

           Land is owned in perpetuity;
           This tenure is governed by rules generally accepted as binding and authoritative by
            the class of persons to which it applies. In other words customary regime is not
            governed by written law;
           Customary occupants are occupants of former public land and occupy land by virtue
            of their customary rights; they have proprietary interest in the land and are entitled
            to certificates of customary ownership which may be acquired through application to
            the Parish Land Committee and eventual issuance by the District Land Board.

Freehold Tenure

           This tenure derives its legality from the Constitution of Uganda and its incidents
            from the written law;
           It enables the holder to exercise, subject to the law, full powers of ownership.
           It involves the holding of land in perpetuity or for a period less than perpetuity fixed
            by a condition.


                                                 54
Leasehold Tenure

           This tenure system is created either by contract or by operation of the law;
           The tenant has security of tenure and a proprietary interest in the land;
           A form under which the landlord of lessor grants the tenant or lessee exclusive
            possession of the land, usually for a period defined and in return for a rent;

Mailo Tenure

161. The Mailo land tenure system is a feudal ownership introduced by the British in 1900
under the Buganda Agreement. "Mailo" is a Luganda word for “mile? as the original grants
under the agreement were measured in square miles. Prior to the 1975 Land Reform Decree,
Mailo land was owned in perpetuity by individuals and by the Kabaka (hereditary King of
Buganda). All Mailo land parcels have title deeds. Persons who buy portions (kibanja) on Mailo
land are protected by Ugandan law to live on and use the land, but they are obliged to pay certain
annual royalties to the Mailo owner (currently UgShs 1000 about US 60 cents per household per
year according to land law).

162. No title deed is associated with kibanja purchase: the Mailo owner would simply write a
sale (purchase) agreement witnessed by village local leaders (LCs), giving the kibanja buyer full
rights to own and use the purchased portion of Mailo land. Such a buyer can sell his/her kibanja
to a new owner but notify Mailo owner and local leaders about the changed ownership. In cases
of compensation, an apportionment of land value of 60% and 40% share of the market value is
given to the landlord and kibanja owners respectively, depending on developments invested on
the affected land. For example, a kibanja owner who has a permanent structures or perennial
crops is entitled to a 60% share of the compensation value while one with only temporary
structures or annual (seasonal) crops is entitled to only 40%. The Mailo tenure system:

           Derives its legality from the Constitution and its incidents from the written law;
           Involves holding of land in perpetuity.
           Permits separation of ownership of land from the ownership of development on land
            made by a lawful or bona fide occupant.
           Enables the holder to exercise all the powers of ownership, subject to the rights of
            those persons occupying the land at the time of the creation of the Mailo title and
            their successors.

163. Although only these latter forms of tenure are legally defined under the Land Act, the
context of common law also recognizes “Licensee? or “Sharecroppers?, these terms having
similar meanings in practice. Licensees are persons granted authority to use land for agricultural
production. Traditionally, such production would be limited to annual crops and not perennial
types. Licensees have no legal security of tenure or any property right in the land and their tenure
is purely contractual.




                                                55
164. In compensation and resettlement, rights of spouses and children are protected under the
Constitution of Uganda and the Land Act (Cap 227). The consent of spouse and children must be
acquired prior to any transaction by head of households on land on which the family lives.

165. Section 40 of the Land Act, 1998 requires that no person shall: a). Sell, exchange,
transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease any land; or enter into any contract for the sale, exchange,
transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease of any land; b). Give away any land or enter into any
transaction in respect of land:

           In the case of land on which ordinarily reside orphans, whom are still minors, with
            interest in inheritance of the land, except with prior written consent of the
            Committee.
           In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her spouse, and
            from which they derive their sustenance, except with the prior written consent of the
            spouse;
           In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her dependent
            children (minors) except with the prior written consent of the
            Committee11;(11“Committees “are defined under Section 65 of the Land Act; they
            are Parish Land Committees)
           In the case of land on which the person ordinarily resides with his or her dependent
            children (minors) of majority age, except with the prior written consent of the
            dependent children (minors).

Land Acquisition Process in Uganda

166. Both The Constitution, 1995 and The Land Act, Cap 227 gives the government and LGs’
power to compulsorily acquire land. The Constitution states that “no person shall be
compulsorily deprived of property or any interests in or any right over property of any
description except? if the taking of the land necessary “for public use or in the interest of
defense, public safety, public order, public morality or public health.?

167. The Land Acquisition Act, 1965 makes provision for the procedures and method of
compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes. The Land Acquisition Act, 1965 states that
the minister responsible for land may authorize any person to enter said land to survey the land,
bore the subsoil, or any other examination necessary for determining whether the land is suitable
for a public purpose. Additionally, once the assessment officer takes possession, the land
immediately becomes vested in the land commission. Any dispute as to the compensation
payable is to be referred to the Attorney General or court for decision.

Valuation

168. Section 77 of the Land Act gives valuation principles for compensation; i.e. crops are
compensated at rates set by the District Land Boards; the basis of compensation for land is open
market value. The value of buildings is to be taken at open market value for urban areas and
depreciated replacement cost in the rural areas. In addition, a 15% or 30% disturbance allowance
must be paid if six months or less notice is given to the owner. The Land Act gives powers to


                                               56
District Land Tribunals to determine any dispute relating to the amount of compensation to be
paid for land acquired compulsorily.

Principles and Polices for Land Acquisition

169. Compensation shall aim to enable PAPs to restore their pre-project incomes and standard
of living by the end of the project.

Principle of Severance

170. Used when the government exercises its power to take private property for public use
through the right of Eminent Domain. If only part of the property is taken and the value of the
remaining property depreciates because of the government’s proposed use of the taken share, the
owner is entitled to compensation called severance damage.

Principle of Injurious Affection

171. Loss or damage to non-physical nature to land remaining with a dispossessed owner after
a partial compulsory acquisition. Excludes any sentimental value; e.g. (i) Direct, physical
interference or obstruction; (ii) loss of view or loss of privacy

Human Rights and Compensation

172. Ugandan land laws make provision for compensation when development projects affect
people’s land, property, or livelihoods. It also details the rights and privileges of citizens in
dealing with the government and the compulsory acquisition of property.

       (a) Economic Well-being and Social and Cultural Values
           The Constitution states that, where the government compulsorily acquires land, and
           where the government will resettle PAPs, it will fairly and promptly compensate
           displaced PAPs or resettle them on suitable alternative land with due regard for their
           economic well-being and social and cultural values.
       (b) Prompt and Adequate Compensation
           The Constitution states that the government may only compulsory acquire property
           if a law exists that provides for the prompt payment of fair and adequate
           compensation (Constitution, Article 20). The Lands Act emphasizes the payment of
           compensation to the victims of acquisition made under the Act. The basis of the
           compensation should be either the market value or replacement value. Additionally,
           compensation amounts must take into account the cost of disturbance and incidental
           expenses or other damage suffered because of the resettlement.
       (c) Damage or Loss
           The government Lands Act also makes provision for compensation for any person
           who suffers any loss or damage due to “the carrying out of any survey, as a result of
           installation, construction, inspection, maintenance, replacement, or removal of any
           specified work.? The DLB will base the amount of compensation on any loss or
           damage, and may take into account how much the person’s land has increased in
           value as a result of the installation or construction of the works.


                                               57
Equal Opportunities Commission Act, 2007

173. The Act makes provision in relation to the Equal Opportunities Commission pursuant to
articles 32 (3) and 32 (4) and other relevant provisions of the Constitution; to provide for the
composition and functions of the Commission; to give effect to the State’s constitutional
mandate to eliminate discrimination and inequalities against any individual or group of persons
on the ground of sex, age, race, color, ethnic origin, tribe, birth, creed or religion, health status,
social or economic standing, political opinion or disability, and take affirmative action in favor
of groups marginalized on the basis of gender, age, disability or any other reason created by
history, tradition or custom for the purpose of redressing imbalances which exist against them;
and to provide for other related matters. Regulation 14 2(a) states on the functions of the
commission being to investigate or inquire into, on its own initiative or on a complaint made by
any person or group of persons, any act, circumstance, conduct, omission, program, activity or
practice which seems to amount to or constitute discrimination, marginalization or to otherwise
undermine equal opportunities. While all matters relating to land acquisition, compensation and
resettlement are managed within the provisions of the above legislation, the most decisive
document in this regard is the Land Act of 1998, as amended.

National Youth Council Act Cap 319 Laws 2000

174. This establishes the National Youth Council, the object of which is to organize the youth
of Uganda in a unified body, engage the youth in activities that are of benefit to them and the
nation and protect the youth against any kind of manipulation.

National Women’s Council Act Cap 318 Laws 2000

175. This establishes the National Women Council whose object is to organize women of
Uganda in a unified body and engage the women in activities that are of benefit to them and the
nation.

Children Act Cap 59 Laws 2000

176. Section 5(2) thereof provides for a duty of a person having custody of a child to protect
the child from discrimination, violence, abuse and neglect. Section 10 thereof provides for
protection of children with disabilities. It is the duty of the parents of the child with disability and
the state to take appropriate steps to see that children with disabilities are assessed as early as
possible, offered appropriate treatment and afforded facilities for rehabilitation and equal
opportunities to education.

National Council on Disability Act, 2003

177. This establishes the National Council for Disability. The objective of the National
Council for Disability among others is; to promote the implementation and equalization of
opportunities for persons with disability, monitor and evaluate the impact of policies and
programs designed for equality and full participation of persons with disability.




                                                  58
Access to Information

178. The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda provides for the right of access to
information in Article 41 and states: ‘Every citizen has a right of access to information in the
possession of the state or any other organ or agency of the state except where the release of the
information is likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of the state or interfere with the
right to the privacy of any other person.’

179. The Access to Information Act, 2005 provides for the right of access to information
pursuant to article 41 of the Constitution; prescribes the classes of information referred to in that
article; the procedure for obtaining access to that information, and other related matters. Article
5, Right of access indicates that - Every citizen has a right of access to information and records
in the possession of the State or any public body, except where the release of the information is
likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of the State or interfere with the right to the
privacy of any other person. Further, Article 29, Protection of safety of persons and property
provides that: An information officer –
       (a) shall refuse a request for access if the disclosure of the record could reasonably be
           expected to endanger the life or physical safety of a person; or
       (b) may refuse a request for access to a record of the body if the disclosure of the record
           is likely to prejudice or impair the security of -
                 a building, structure or system, including, but not limited to a computer or
                  communication system;
                 a means of transport; or
                 any other property.

180. However, the Access to Information Act exists on paper and has not been implemented
due to undefined responsibility centers and therefore no financial and human resources available
for its operationalization.

181. If implemented, this policy would help in clarifying on information related to land to be
acquired for public use and the procedures to be followed including the responsible agencies.

Workers Compensation Act, 2000.

182. This law provides for compensation to be paid to workers (or their dependents) for
injuries suffered and scheduled diseases incurred in the course of their employment.

Employment Act

183. Gives authority to labor officers to engage in inspections and enforce legal provisions
relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers. Labor officers, either at Ministry or
at LG level are also empowered to issue improvement orders or to close down a work place or
discontinue any work if he or she is of the opinion that there is imminent danger to the health or
safety of workers. However, there are only 35 officers at District LG, with none in the



                                                 59
municipalities, and severe resource constraints in the parent Ministry, so there is little chance of
this Act being enforced at present.

Poverty Eradication Action Plan

184. This is a framework to guide public action to eradicate poverty. Under the Pillar on
human development, the PEAP spells out priority action areas to support, mobilize and empower
marginalized groups to participate in the economic growth and social development process. This
policy ensures that marginalized groups fully participate and benefit from the PEAP initiatives.

Social Development Sector Strategic Investment Plan

185. This addresses inequalities, inequity, exclusion, unemployment and low productivity
among the population with emphasis on the marginalized groups. It articulates interventions for
promoting participation, access and utilization of basic services by the different groups. The Plan
focuses on strengthening coordination mechanisms and inter-linkages among relevant
stakeholders at all levels.

Peace, Recovery, and Development Plan (PRDP2)

186. The development interventions in Northern and North Eastern Uganda are aligned to the
Peace, Recovery, and Development Plan (PRDP2) that provides strategic planning framework at
the regional level. The PRDP2 will be succeeded by PRDP3 expected effectively in the FY
2015/2016. The PRDP3 prioritizes improvement of household income in line with the NDP2 to
address the socio-economic imbalances. In the same vein, Government provided guidance to the
proposed successor project that will be implemented under the PRDP3 framework to focus on
improving incomes and livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable communities and contribute to the
revitalization of the local economy.

Institutional Framework for Social Systems Management Relevant to Project

Equal Opportunities Commission

187. The Act makes provision in relation to the Equal Opportunities Commission pursuant to
articles 32 (3) and 32 (4) and other relevant provisions of the Constitution; to provide for the
composition and functions of the Commission; to give effect to the State’s constitutional
mandate to eliminate discrimination and inequalities against any individual or group of persons
on the ground of sex, age, race, color, ethnic origin, tribe, birth, creed or religion, health status,
social or economic standing, political opinion or disability, and take affirmative action in favor
of groups marginalized on the basis of gender, age, disability or any other reason created by
history, tradition or custom for the purpose of redressing imbalances which exist against them;
and to provide for other related matters. Regulation 14 2(a) states on the functions of the
commission being to investigate or inquire into, on its own initiative or on a complaint made by
any person or group of persons, any act, circumstance, conduct, omission, program, activity or
practice which seems to amount to or constitute discrimination, marginalization or to otherwise
undermine equal opportunities. While all matters relating to land acquisition, compensation and
resettlement are managed within the provisions of the above legislation, the most decisive
document in this regard is the Land Act of 1998, as amended.


                                                 60
Ministry of Gender, Labor & Social Development

188. The Ministry’s mandate is to empower communities to harness their potential through
cultural growth, skills development and labor productivity for sustainable and gender responsive
development. The vision of the Ministry is “a better standard of living, equity and social
cohesion, especially for poor and vulnerable groups in Uganda.? The mission of the ministry is
“promotion of gender equality, labor administration, social protection and transformation of
communities.?

189. This ministry also sets policy direction and monitoring functions related to labor, gender
and general social development. Its Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) unit in the ministry
is responsible for inspection and mentoring of occupational safety in workplaces and should be
involved during project construction and operation of the facilities.

Uganda Human Rights Commission

190. The Uganda Human Rights Commission is Uganda’s national human rights institution
created by the Constitution, with mandate, amongst others, “to investigate violations of human
rights and to monitor government compliance with its human rights obligations detailed in the
Constitution.? This is in addition to making recommendations to Parliament on measures to
promote human rights. The Commission has since its establishment played a very important role
in highlighting human rights violations in the country and making recommendations for
rectification. The Commission has on several occasions investigated and published its findings
with regard to the human rights problems of marginalized groups and made recommendations on
how these could be rectified. A good example is the intervention during the Karimojong
disarmament exercise in 2005.

District Land Tribunals

191. The Land Act, Cap 227 states that land tribunals must be established at district level. It
empowers the District Land Tribunals to determine disputes relating to amount of compensation
to be paid for land acquired compulsorily. The affected person may appeal to a higher ordinary
court. The Land Acquisition Act allows for any person to appeal to the High Court within 60
days of the award being made. All land disputes must be processed by the tribunals, before the
case can be taken to the ordinary courts. The act also states that traditional authority mediators
must retain their jurisdiction to deal with, and settle, land disputes.

Local Council Courts

192. The Local Council Courts Act establishes Local Council Courts for the administration of
justice at the local level, defines the jurisdiction, powers and procedures of the established courts
and for other related matters. The legal jurisdiction of Local Council Courts includes matters
related to; land disputes, domestic violence, children related cases, assaults and battery,
conversion, damage to property, trespass and adultery.

193. There are three levels of the Courts – LCC III at the sub county/Town/Division Council
(level 3); LCC II at the parish/ward (level 2) and LCC I at the village. Appeals from the highest
of the Committees, (Sub-county executive) lie to the Chief Magistrate.


                                                 61
194. If the appeal involves a substantial question of law or appears to have caused a
substantial miscarriage of justice, then appeals would go to the High Court.

195. The LCCs being part of the elaborate court system are to exercise judicial power in
Uganda in the name of the people and in conformity with the values, norms and aspirations of
the people. Therefore, performance of LCCs in the administration of local justice is a major
factor for legitimacy of the lower LG system and promotion of good governance.

Parish and Village Councils

196. Are required (Rural Councils) to have executive committees comprising a chairperson, a
vice-chairperson, a general secretary and secretaries for information, education, security, finance,
production and environmental protection. There is also a disabled persons’ council, a youth
council and a women’s council whose respective chairs are appointed as secretaries for their
representative group to the main council. Parishes are responsible for monitoring service delivery
at that level.

Ward and Cell Councils

197. Are required to have executive committees comprising a chairperson, a vice-chairperson,
a general secretary and secretaries for information, education, security, finance, production, and
environment protection. There is also a disabled persons’ council, a youth council and a
women’s council whose respective chairs are appointed as secretaries for their representative
group to the main council. Parishes are responsible for monitoring service delivery at that level.

LG Participatory Planning Process

198. This is a planning process where all stakeholders, beneficiaries, technical staff and donors
come together to carry out analysis of the existing situation, determine the desired future, decide
on appropriate action and implementation strategies, discuss and agree on roles and
responsibilities and agree on appropriate time schedules and milestones.

Phase 1: Situation Analysis

199. This is the first stage of the LG development planning cycle. During this stage, districts
and Sub-Counties review the existing situation and review previous strategies and activities to
determine what worked or did not work and to identify better ones for the following year.
Participants in this process include relevant district staff or Sub-County staff.

Phase 2: Strategic Planning

200. Step 1: Community Participatory Planning. The process of planning starts at the
community level, and is participatory, involving community members in order to ensure that the
activities undertaken are demand responsive, and to provide a basis for sustainability of facilities.

Phase 3: Formulation of the Budget Framework Paper




                                                 62
201. Step 1: Local Government Budget Call. Between October and November of each year,
the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MOFED), in preparation for the
budget process sends out “budget call circulars to all Ministries. The call is disseminated to the
district LGs, who ensure these reach the lower LGs. This call kick starts the budget preparation
process for the subsequent year.

202. Step 2: Regional LG Budget Framework Paper Conference: The Local Government
Budget Framework Paper (LGBFP) conference (sometimes referred to as the LGBFP workshop)
is held in October/November. This comprises several regional workshops attended by
representatives from District LGs, central Government, line ministries, Civil Society and
development partners. At the workshops, the following is done:
           Review sector performance
           Specify medium-term objectives and outputs for the sectors in view of the available
            resources
           Identify funding sources

203. Once District LGs have been made aware of the medium term objectives and outputs,
they start the process of prioritizing what they plan to achieve in all sectors given the indicative
resource envelope for their Districts. The sector Budget Framework Papers (BFPs) provide
detailed sector priorities and activities geared towards achieving sector objectives in line with the
National Development Plan and sector Strategic Investment Plans.

204. Step 3: District Budget Conference/Consultations and Drafting of the District
LGBFP: Immediately after the regional workshops, each DLG holds its own Budget
Conference. The Districts/Municipalities organize their budget conferences bringing together
stakeholders from the different levels of LG and civil society. Key activities during this
conference include:
           Explaining and discussing the implications of the policy guidelines from the
            MoFPED in relation to local needs and priorities
           Dissemination of indicative planning figures to the sub counties

205. At this level also, District/Municipality level meetings are held with the various Sectoral
Committees of the Council, for the purpose of both preparing of the sector components of the
Local Government Budget Framework Paper, and updating the District Development Plan
(DDP). It is important to emphasize that the DDP is prepared taking into account the resources
available over the medium term. The Planning units and the District Technical Planning
Committees play a crucial role in coordinating this process.

206. Step 4: Community Level Consultations and Prioritization of Plans: After the district
Budget Conference, lower LGs hold planning meetings and their own budget conference to
discuss their priorities in the different sectors for both recurrent and development activities,
taking into consideration community requests. Key activities during these processes include:
           Parishes and Sub-Counties identifying investment activities to be carried out in the
            next financial year and in the medium term, taking into account the resources


                                                 63
            available and the medium term indicative planning figures On the basis of these
            discussions the parishes and sub counties should update their Development Plans
            and forward them to the Districts/Municipalities, along with any sector issues
            relating to recurrent expenditures
           Sub-Counties should review the plans submitted by the Parish Development
            Committees (PDCs) against the budget allocated to them
           Sub-Counties select the communities in which they will undertake water source
            improvements
           After the Sub-County council has debated its budget (revenue and expenditure,
            recurrent and development) estimates, they should be submitted to the DTPC to be
            integrated into the district development plan and budget.
           The budget estimates debated and approved by the Sub County councils and with
            guidance from the DTPC are included in the DLG annual work plan and budget.

207. The planning schedule, as outlined above, allows Sub-County governments to incorporate
the plans of parishes, and for the Sub-County plans to be integrated into district plans. Planning
activities take place throughout the FY.

Resources and Capacity

Management of Social Safeguards at LG Level

208. At District level, the Department of Community Development Services (CDS) is
mandated to handle social safeguards issues. Currently their roles include:
       (a) Mobilizing communities for government development programs,
       (b) Gender mainstreaming through sensitization to mitigate gender inequalities and
           improve relations,
       (c) Empowering communities to form groups and start income generating activities
           from grants provided by Government- Youth Livelihood Program and the Women
           Entrepreneurship Program,
       (d) Empowering women to develop skills and do business from funds provided by
           Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development, and
       (e) Providing child protection services by handling cases of domestic violence against
           children, child neglect, early marriages and school drop outs.

209.   Normal staffing levels for CDS include the following seven (7) Officers;

       (a) District Community Development Officer,
       (b) Senior Community Development Officer,
       (c) Senior Probation Officer,
       (d) Senior Labor Officer,



                                               64
       (e) Probation Officer,
       (f) Labor Officer and
       (g) Community Development Officer (CDO)

Inadequate Staffing Issue

210. LGs are understaffed with respect to social development technical capacity. A case
example is Ntungamo District which was visited during the ESSA study and is currently covered
by only two (2) Officers; (i) a Senior Community Development Officer who is acting as the
department head, and (ii) a Senior Probation Officer also acting as Gender, Labor, OVC and
Human Rights Officer.

Use of Environmental Social Screening Form

211. District level staff lack adequate knowledge in using the ESSF. They are generally not
involved in project preparation and only tend to be called upon when social issues arise during
project implementation or when project affected persons have grievances; And in those cases,
they often lack the capacity to properly respond due to lack of knowledge on what actions to take
and lack of funds. In addition, there are no clear guidelines on involvement/inclusion of
Indigenous People or members of vulnerable Groups into projects.

Budgetary Allocation

212. Community Development Departments is most of the districts and municipalities are
under resourced thereby hampering their ability to implement projects, as well as supervise and
monitor social aspects of on-going projects. Social impact assessments are generally not
budgeted for as the bulk of funds in the districts are allocated for the support of the office of
Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Chairperson, and Council sittings. Overall, the
Departments at District and Sub-county levels are inadequately resourced in terms of supplies
and equipment.

213. In Kabale, the study found that the Community Development Department is the least
funded of the District with less than 2% of the total district’s budget. Budgets for Youth and
women activities can be as low as 100,000 UG Shillings (+/- US $30.00) for a whole fiscal year.
A CDO at sub/county level is allocated a total budget of 957,000 UG Shillings (+/- US $ 275.00)
for a whole fiscal year to monitor and supervise activities.

214. For instance, in Kabale, the CDS department has activity plans that include mitigation of
social risks for government funded projects but they are generally constrained by limited
budgetary allocations. Currently their planned budget is 138,436,000 UG Shillings (+/- US $
40,000) for non-wage activities including Youth Livelihood Program and 46,493,000 UG
Shillings (US $ 3,300) for wages.

215. Women activities have a 1,200,000 UG Shillings (+/- US $ 350) annual budget. In
addition, the Municipality receives the following from central government: 820,000 UG
Shillings (+/- US $240) for the Women Council, 820,000 UG Shillings (=/- US $ 240) for the
Youth Council and 2,100,000 UG Shillings (+/- US $ 600) for Persons With Disabilities (PWD).


                                               65
These funds are disbursed quarterly and make it difficult to plan and fund activities such as
supervision and monitoring in a consistent manner. The department receives no further
assistance from local revenue and is expected to fund all activities from the above budget.

216. Currently department staff lacks transportation means to carry out various activities,
computers, and basic office furniture.

Supervision/Monitoring

217. In Kabale, the department’s biggest constraint was reported to be lack of transportation
means to carry out supervision during project implementation since most of these projects are
implemented in remote areas. Currently, the District heavily relies on the Health Management
Committees and the School Management Committees to carry out monitoring and supervision
but these tend to focus on quality of works, rather than the identification of environmental and
social risks for which they lack capacity.

Land Acquisition

218. Land acquisition and resettlement is not expected to pose significant risks given the small
scale of investments and the likelihood of construction being carried out on existing facilities’
footprints, though it is important that these processes are properly tracked. Moreover, because of
limited financial resources at District level, authorities generally avoid implementing projects
that require land acquisition; when unavoidable, they rely on local communities to voluntarily
donate land. Titling of these donated plots however is often problematic, as District staff has
generally limited influence on processes at central level.




                                               66
V. Determination of Potential Environment and Social Impacts

Beneficial Impacts

219. Districts cover mostly rural areas and are responsible for delivery of a broad range
of services. These include education, healthcare, infrastructure (roads, water supply), natural
resources, and agricultural extension. Grants from the central government finance services in all
these sectors as well as local public administration and community services but the PforR is
specifically targeted to the health and education sectors.

220. The Program will support two CPF objectives. These are “Enhancing Economic
Governance and Fiscal Management? and “Improving Social Service Delivery?. Reduction in
horizontal inequities in per beneficiary spending on social services across districts will directly
contribute to achieving one of the CPF objective indicators. The Program’s focus on improving
service delivery, enhancing value for money, and reducing inequities in public spending on
social services will help to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.

221. This project will involve helping to achieve in a course of several years (i) more
equitable allocation of resources through transfers from central to LGs, particularly in the social
sectors; (ii) more efficient functioning of the transfers system, and (iii) increased capacity and
accountability of LGs for managing public funds.

222. Adoption of the Program for Results instrument will help to achieve lasting results
by leveraging finance to strengthen institutions and to build capacity. Implementation of
effective fiscal decentralization reforms will result in fiscal savings and improvements in value-
for-money that could be quite substantial.

Adverse Environmental Impacts

223. Enhancing Economic Governance and Fiscal Management and Improving Social Service
Delivery in the health and education sector at the LG level in Uganda is likely to lead to adverse
environmental and social impacts. Improvement of service delivery in the health sector could
entail;
       (a) Implementation of the National Health Policy;
       (b) Planning and management of district health services;
       (c) (Provision of disease prevention, health promotion, curative and rehabilitative
           services;
       (d) Control of other communicable diseases of public health importance to the district;
       (e) Vector control;
       (f) Health education;
       (g) Ensuring provision of safe water and environmental sanitation; and
       (h) Health data collection, management, interpretation, dissemination and utilization.



                                                67
224. In the education sector, under the local Government Act of 1997, nursery, primary
schools, special schools and technical schools fall under the administration and management of
District Councils. Each district has the authority to formulate, approve, and execute its own
development plan. Activities and strategies could include expansion of classrooms, houses, and
other facilities, including what is needed to improve hygiene and safety.

225. The activities and strategies in both sectors are likely to adversely affect the environment
(biophysical and socio-economic) as a result of construction/civil works as well operation and
decommissioning of related services.

Construction Impacts

226. The construction of new facilities, rehabilitation or improvement is likely to adversely
affect different aspects of the environment. These types of impacts, however, are generally site-
specific, reversible, limited in scope and magnitude and in most instances temporary in nature.
These impacts are and can be for the most part can be prevented or mitigated with standard
operational procedures and good construction management practices. These procedures will be
included in the Program Operation Manual, and be a standard part of environmental management
plans included in bidding documents for contractors.

Water Pollution

227. The project civil works are likely to alter the water quality in the local water mainly due
to site clearing and the disruption of the natural drainage patterns. Impacts on water resources
during the construction; operation and decommissioning of the Project will arise in two main
ways:

           Exploitation of local water resources to provide water during construction and
            operation; and
           Contamination of water          resources    from    construction,   operation    and
            decommissioning activities.

228. During construction, the runoff from the construction site is a source of water pollution.
Such pollution may persist entirely during the initial phase of construction when site grading and
excavation for foundation and back filling would be in progress. During this stage the rainwater
runoff would carry more soil/silt than normal and this would cause silting problem in the
receiving water bodies. The other source of water pollution is expected from the sanitary
waste coming from the temporary accommodation of the construction workers if envisaged.

Natural Resources Degradation

229. Natural habitats could be altered as a result of borrow pits for aggregate materials. Land
clearance for works could result in clearance of grass and trees, and road widening works could
have similar impacts as well as displacing substantial amounts of soils. If not properly managed,
borrow pits for construction materials pose perhaps the greatest potential negative impacts on
natural habitats and land degradation if abandoned without proper reclamation.


                                               68
230. Construction of public facilities could entail clearing vegetated areas and tree felling.
Mitigation measures would consist of re-vegetation and tree planting after construction.
Reforestation, afforestation and grass replanting in project areas and at time tree nurseries are
some of the proposed mitigation measures.

Soil Pollution

231. Construction activities are anticipated to impact on soil and geology of the project site in
several ways including: disturbances to soil subsequently resulting in erosion, soil contamination
by oil leaks from vehicles.

Noise Pollution

232. The major sources of the noise pollution due to construction activity is from the earth
moving, levelling and compacting, trucks for transportation of construction materials, concrete
mixers, asphalt mixing and laying equipment all add to the general noise level.

233. The source of noise impacts during construction is likely to include local temporary noise
from construction plant activities, including ground clearance, piling, and concreting and
equipment installation.

Air Quality

234. The construction activities are likely to generate short-term increases in fugitive dust and
combustion emissions. The primary sources of fugitive dust emissions include increased vehicle
traffic and excavation activities.

235. The main sources of emissions during construction include dust related to site clearing,
earthworks, traffic movements, loading and unloading of materials, stock piling of spoil. Dusts
emissions may also be generated at material borrow pits and the concrete processing plant. In
addition, exhaust emissions from the contractor’s machinery and vehicles could contribute
to air pollution. The sources of combustion emissions (e.g., SO2, NOx, CO, and particulates)
will be mainly operations of diesel powered survey equipment and vehicles. The changes to air
quality may affect the residents, agricultural crops as well as the natural flora

Waste Impacts

236. Waste streams generated during construction of the Project are likely to consist of the
following:
             Excavation spoil;
             Construction waste;
             General waste; and
             Sewage and wastewater.




                                               69
Excavation Spoil

237. By far the largest quantity of waste arising from the Project will be spoil generated from
the excavation of the terraces to create level platforms for the installation of infrastructure and
other items and equipment.

Construction Waste

238. This will comprise a variety of non-hazardous materials including wood (used timber),
excess concrete, vehicle tires and packaging materials (plastic, card, etc), together with a small
amount of hazardous wastes such as used oils (from vehicles and machinery), paints, vehicle
batteries, fluorescent light bulbs and contaminated containers (paint tins, etc.). There will also be
packaging waste such as wooden pallets, plastic, paper, and cardboard from the delivery of the
equipment and machinery to be used by the Project. In addition, there will be empty tins and
other containers from lubricating oils and hydraulic oils.

239. Maintenance of the plant and machinery used during construction is likely to also give
rise to a range of potentially hazardous wastes including:
           Used oils - lubricating and hydraulic oils;
           Filters – air and oil filters;
           Batteries – mainly lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and other machinery; and
           Washout water from concrete mixing plant
           General Refuse General refuse, similar in nature to domestic waste, will be
            generated by the construction workforce at the work site. This will comprise a range
            of mainly non-hazardous materials including food residues, paper, used containers
            (bottles, cans, etc.), packaging and broken furniture.

Sewage/Wastewater

240. Again, this will be generated by the welfare facilities provided for the construction
workforce. Septic tanks will be installed and used for the treatment of sewage generated at the
construction site.

Physical Cultural Resources

241. Construction activities related to rehabilitation, expansion or establishment of new
infrastructure could adversely affect physical cultural resources.

Occupational Health and Safety

242. Construction activities involve some inherent dangers related to exposure to hazardous
materials, noise and operation of equipment among others. In the absence of sufficient
management of health and safety issues, the workforce may suffer injury or death. The general
public is also exposed to construction related hazards of projects if adequate measures to protect
them are not put into place.


                                                 70
Operational Impacts

Pesticide/Chemical Waste Management

243. Integrated Vector Management (IVM) for the control of the malaria vector population
involves the use of four primary interventions, insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spray,
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), and intermittent preventive treatment for
pregnant women (IPTp).

244. The Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Health has been implementing Indoor Residual
Spraying (IRS) as one of the interventions in Malaria Control through its National Malaria
Control Program (NMCP).

245. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is being implemented in the target districts of Agago,
Amuru, Apac, Gulu, Kitgum, Kole, Lamwo, Nwoya, Oyam, Pader, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka,
Bugiri, Butaleja, Dokolo, Kaberamaido, Kibuku, Lira, Namutumba, Otuke, Pallisa, Serere, and
Tororo.

246. Indoor Residual Spraying involves spraying a liquid insecticide with long lasting residual
activity on indoor wall surfaces where mosquitoes usually rest. The pesticide then dries up and
leaves a crystalline deposit on the sprayed surface. A lethal dose of the insecticide is absorbed
when the mosquito rests on the surface for a sufficient length of time.

247. The broad categories of pesticide hazard are release and exposure to humans and
domestic animals, and releases causing environmental damage. Release and exposure may occur
at any point from the production or importation of the pesticide through transportation, storage,
distribution, pesticide make-up, spray application, clean-up, and final disposal, as well as post-
spray due to improper spray deposition on household articles, or improper behavior of
beneficiaries regarding sprayed surfaces.

248. In humans, pesticides used in IRS can produce cholinesterase depression if the proper
protective measures are not utilized, and exposure results. Cholinesterase inhibition results in
overstimulation of the nervous system, with symptoms that include nausea, dizziness, confusion,
respiratory paralysis, and even death at very high exposures (U.S. EPA, 2000b).

249. In the environment, most of the WHO-recommended insecticides are highly toxic to fish
and other aquatic organisms. Similarly, apart from DDT, all the approved insecticides are highly
toxic to bees. In mammals, all the insecticides approved by WHO for IRS carry low-to medium
toxicity. In avi-fauna, IRS insecticides are categorized as highly toxic.

250. Specific hazards include exposure during handling (transporting or spraying),
environmental release through vehicular accidents during transportation, and the possibility of
fire causing combustion of pesticides, in storage or in transportation.




                                               71
Health Care Waste Management

251. Health care waste is defined as all waste generated during medical activities. It includes
two major categories of waste: hazardous (with potential to cause harm) and non-hazardous
(with less potential to cause harm).

252. There are several types of hazardous waste that need to be managed appropriately to
avoid risks of endangering health workers, patients, communities, and the environment. These
include:

           Sharps waste: materials that can puncture skin, such as needles, blades, and broken
            glass.
           Infectious waste: contains agents that are infectious to humans and animals.
           Highly infectious waste: contains significantly high numbers of infectious agents.
           Pathological waste: includes body organs that are removed from the body because
            they are diseased, and tissue as well as blood and other body fluids that are removed
            from the body for lab tests to determine the underlying cause of disease.
           Anatomical waste: comprises recognizable body parts such as limbs (e.g., legs,
            fingers) that have been cut off for a medical reason.
           Pharmaceutical waste: includes all active agents and chemicals meant for
            prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of diseases among humans and other animals.
            Examples include expired medicines, condoms, lab reagents, and banned medicines.
           Radioactive waste: includes all liquids, gases, and solids contaminated with
            ionizing radiations, which can affect human genes.
           Effluents: fluids generated from medical services, such as washing equipment used
            on patients, or waste water from washing linens used during labor.
           Heavy metals: mercury, silver, and other metals used in the health sector; these
            metals can be toxic, corrosive, flammable, reactive, explosive, shock sensitive, or
            even damaging to human genes.
           Metal scrap: includes all metals that are deemed to be of no further use to the health
            facility, such as surgical forceps, scissors, needle holders, and scalpels.

253. Unsafe health care waste management poses risks to health workers, patients,
communities, and the environment. Transmission of HIV and hepatitis B in the health care
setting can occur through unsafe handling of sharps, including needle stick injuries, and health
care waste-related exposure to blood.

254. Patients, health workers, and the surrounding community are all at risk of infection from
unsafe injections and improper health care waste management (HCWM) practices. As a result of
improper management of medical waste the following negative impacts could also result:

           Soil Pollution: There is a high potential for infection and contamination of soil,
            particularly from liquid wastes flowing into the soil. The potential of contamination


                                               72
           from untreated sharps, anatomical and infectious wastes buried or dumped
           indiscriminately may lead to the entry of pathogens and chemicals into the food
           chain.
          Surface and Groundwater Contamination: There is a high potential for infection
           and contamination of streams and rivers from effluents from healthcare facilities
           flowing into drains and run-off from soil during rains following dumping of
           infectious and chemical wastes. The potential for groundwater contamination from
           buried infectious wastes, sharps and body parts is also significant.
          Occupational Health and Safety Hazards: Most waste handlers are unaware of the
           potential risks involved in handling medical waste; in most cases they do not have
           adequate protective clothing and disinfectants. They are exposed to a high potential
           infection following injuries from sharps, handling of infectious materials and human
           parts.
          Air Pollution and Groundwater Contamination Due to Open Burning: Open
           burning poses significant environmental pollution concerns due to the emission of
           nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, carbon monoxides and suspended particulates
           matters. Smoke and dioxin inhalations can pose occupational health hazards. There
           is the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination from the ash and leachates
           from open burning when combustion is incomplete and also from burial.
           Groundwater contamination could result in high levels of ammonia, total dissolved
           solids (TDS), chloride and biological oxygen demand (BOD), and possibly
           pathogens.

Status of Health Care Waste in Uganda

255.   The following major problems have been identified with health care waste in Uganda:
          Technical problems: lack of equipment for proper handling, transportation, and
           treatment of waste; and poor infrastructure and inadequate procurement procedures
           for waste handling services.
          Environmental and public health problems: most health care waste is disposed of
           in waste dumps which represents risks to the environment (contamination of land
           and groundwater as well as risk to public health).
          Occupational health problems: when health staff and waste handlers lack adequate
           equipment, education, training, and awareness.
          Institutional and legislative problems: inadequate funding due to the lack of
           detailed legislation and an institutional framework for management of health care
           waste.

Adverse Social Impacts

Resettlement Impacts

256. Construction of and rehabilitation of or expansion of educational and health facilities and
related infrastructure could require land hence leading to resettlement related impacts including
loss of assets and livelihoods due to physical and or economic displacement.

Indigenous Peoples

257. Resettlement and environmental degradation tend to disproportionately impact the
vulnerable and marginalized groups. It is possible that the program activities could adversely
affect vulnerable and marginalized groups specifically the ethnic minority as they are referred in
Uganda through degradation of their natural environment or displacement.

Child Abuse and Gender Based Violence

258. Construction activities and establishment of construction camps are likely to lead to
sexual abuse in certain cases on children by construction employees. It has been noted that
construction projects funded by multilateral institutions can expose children and communities
living around the construction sites to many negative impacts associated with displacement,
including loss of livelihoods, school dropouts, sexual exploitation, abuse, early marriage, and
child labour.

259. The influx of workers employed by the construction company, along with those looking
for jobs with the construction company, is widely associated with an increase in sexual abuse and
assault of girls in the area.

Labour Issues

260. Labour related concerns and violation of workers’ rights is a potential likely and adverse
impact in construction sites. The main issues could include; -low pay; lack of adequate housing;
health and safety issues, in particular with regard to pesticide spraying; sexual harassment, in
particular by supervisors; lack of severance pay; short-term contracts; lack of maternity leave;
unfair dismissal; excessive overtime; deductions from pay; lack of freedom of association; lack
of contracts; social security payments not met and abusive supervisors among others.

VI. Assessment of Program System Consistency with Core Principles

261. This section provides an assessment of the extent to which the applicable systems are
consistent with the core principles of World Bank Policy, Program-for-Results Financing and
key planning elements. This section provides an assessment of where the Program system is
inconsistent with relevant core principles and the significance of these gaps.

262. Overall, the existing system in Uganda is consistent with the core principles of World
Bank Policy. This section presents the environmental and social benefits, risks and impacts of the
Program.

                     Table 4. Country Systems and OP/BP 9.00 Core Principles Comparison
Core Principle 1: General Principle of Environmental and Social Management
OP 9.00: Environmental and social management procedures and processes are designed to (a) promote
environmental and social sustainability in Program design; (b) avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts; and (c)
promote informed decision-making relating to the Program’s environmental and social effects.
BP 9.00: Program procedures will:
     Operate within an adequate legal and regulatory framework to guide environmental and social impact
        assessments at the program level.
     Incorporate recognized elements of environmental and social assessment good practice, including (a) early
        screening of potential effects; (b) consideration of strategic, technical, and site alternatives (including the “no
        action? alternative); (c) explicit assessment of potential induced, c umulative, and trans-boundary impacts; (d)
        identification of measures to mitigate adverse environmental or social impacts that cannot be otherwise
        avoided or minimized; (e) clear articulation of institutional responsibilities and resources to support
        implementation of plans; and (f) responsiveness and accountability through stakeholder consultation, timely
        dissemination of program information, and responsive grievance redress measures.
Applicability: Applicable by the fact that funds channeled to Ministry of Health and Education when
disbursed to the LGs (municipal and district councils) are likely to be used to among others;-construction,
rehabilitation or expansion of health facilities; construction, rehabilitation or expansion of educational
facilities; management of health care wastes;

Core Principle 2: Environmental Considerations – Natural Habitats and Physical Cultural Resources
OP: Environmental and social management procedures and processes are designed to avoid, minimize and mitigate
against adverse effects on natural habitats and physical cultural resources resulting from Program.
BP 9.00: Program procedures will:
     Includes appropriate measures for early identification and screening of potentially important biodiversity and

Core Principle 3: Environmental Considerations – Public and Worker Safety
Environmental and social management procedures and processes are designed to protect public and worker safety
against the potential risks associated with (a) construction and/or operations of facilities or other operational
practices developed or promoted under the program; (b) exposure to toxic chemicals, hazardous wastes, and
otherwise dangerous materials; and (c) reconstruction or rehabilitation of infrastructure located in areas prone to
natural hazards.
Promotes community, individual, and worker safety through the safe design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of physical infrastructure, or in carrying out activities that may be dependent on such infrastructure
with safety measures, inspections, or remedial works incorporated as needed.
     Promotes the use of recognized good practice in the production, management, storage, transport, and disposal
       of hazardous materials generated through program construction or operations; and promotes the use of
       integrated pest management practices to manage or reduce pests or disease vectors; and provides training for
       workers involved in the production, procurement, storage, transport, use, and disposal of hazardous
       chemicals in accordance with international guidelines and conventions.
     Includes measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate community, individual, and worker risks when Program
       activities are located within areas prone to natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other
       severe weather or climate events.
Applicability: Applicable by the fact that activities by the LG in the health and education sector may include
construction, rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure which would expose workers and public to
construction health and safety hazards; health facilities are likely to generate health care wastes which are
categorized as hazardous; implementation of vector control measures (malaria program) including Indoor
Residual Spraying (IRS) and use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) will not only expose workers and public
to potential hazards during application but also generate hazardous wastes. Pesticides used in vector control
are categorized as toxic chemicals.

Core Principle 4: Social Considerations – Land Acquisition
OP: Land acquisition and loss of access to natural resources are managed in a way that avoids or minimizes
displacement, and affected people are assisted in improving, or at least restoring, their livelihoods and living
standards.
As relevant, the Program to be supported:
     Avoids or minimizes land acquisition and related adverse impacts;
     Identifies and addresses economic and social impacts caused by land acquisition or loss of access to natural
        resources, including those affecting people who may lack full legal rights to assets or resources they use or
        occupy;
     Provides compensation sufficient to purchase replacement assets of equivalent value and to meet any
        necessary transitional expenses, paid prior to taking of land or restricting access;
     Provides supplemental livelihood improvement or restoration measures if taking of land causes loss of
        income-generating opportunity (e.g., loss of crop production or employment); and
     Restores or replaces public infrastructure and community services that may be adversely affected.

Article 237 of the Constitution, 1995, vests land
ownership in citizens of Uganda and identifies four land
tenure systems, namely: customary; freehold; mailo; and
leasehold.
The amendment (2009) to the Land Act included clauses
to protect the poor land tenants who do not own the land
from which they derive their livelihoods.
The Land Act seeks to protect the rights of tenants,
squatters, refugees and women, making it easier for
them to register land and hence use it as collateral to
secure loans.
Measures for Protection of Land Rights: Section 4.18
(93) of the Policy recognizes the inability of the majority
of Ugandan to afford the cost of formally securing land
rights and therefore government will put in place a
framework that would ensure that land rights held by all
Ugandans are fully and effectively enjoyed.
The rights of spouse and children are protected under the
Constitution of Uganda and the Land Act (Cap 227).
The consent of spouse and children must be acquired
prior to any transaction by the head of household on land
on which the family ordinarily resides.

Due consideration is given to cultural appropriateness of, and equitable access to, Program benefits giving special
attention to rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples and to the needs or concerns of vulnerable groups.
As relevant, the Program to be supported:
     Undertakes free, prior, and informed consultations if Indigenous Peoples are potentially affected (positively
        or negatively) to determine whether there is broad community support for the Program.
     Ensures that Indigenous Peoples can participate in devising opportunities to benefit from exploitation of
        customary resources or indigenous knowledge, the latter (indigenous knowledge) to include the consent of
        the Indigenous Peoples.
     Gives attention to groups vulnerable to hardship or disadvantage, including as relevant the poor, the disabled,

The Local Government’s Act Cap 243 Laws of Uganda
2000 provides for representation of marginalized groups
at all LG levels. Section 10 specifically provides for 2

The Constitution offers no express protection for
indigenous peoples but Article 32 places a mandatory
duty on the state to take affirmative action in favor of
groups who have been historically disadvantaged and
discriminated against.
Article 180 (2) c of the 1995 Constitution provides for
the LG to enact laws to provide for affirmative action for
all marginalized groups referred to in article 32 of the
same constitution.
The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda stipulates
that certain groups in the society are marginalized and

action in favor of groups marginalized on the basis of
gender, age, disability or any other reason created by
history, tradition or custom for the purpose of redressing

The National Equal Opportunities Policy aims at
promoting equality of opportunities for all persons in
Uganda, irrespective of gender, age, physical ability,
health status or geographical location, in all activities,
programs, plans and policies of Government, private

provides a framework for enhancing the recognition of
the roles, contributions and potentials of older persons in
the development process among others. The policy
targets older persons aged 60 years and above with
special emphasis on the vulnerable. Section 3.4 states
that, “All stakeholders will ensure that issues of older
women and men are included in planning and
implementation of programs.?
National Youth Policy-2004. Its goal is to provide an
appropriate framework for enabling youth to develop
social, economic, cultural, and political skills so as to
enhance their participation in the development process.
It therefore forms the framework for all stakeholders to
address issues of youth empowerment.
National Orphan and other Vulnerable Children’s
Policy-2004 The mission of the policy is to provide a
framework for the enjoyment of rights and
responsibilities of the orphans and other vulnerable
children.
The rights of spouse and children are protected under the
Constitution of Uganda and the Land Act (Cap 227).
The consent of spouse and children must be acquired
prior to any transaction by the head of household on land
on which the family ordinarily resides.
Land Policy and Rights for Minorities: As regards land
rights of ethnic minorities, the Policy states that:

   (a) Government shall, in its use and management of
       natural resources, recognize and protect the right
       to ancestral lands of ethnic minority groups;
   (b) Government shall pay prompt, adequate and fair
       compensation to ethnic minority groups that are
       displaced from their ancestral land by
       government action.
To redress the rights of ethnic minorities in natural
habitats, Government will take measures to:
   (a) establish regulations by Statutory Instrument to:
        recognize land tenure rights of minorities in
         ancestral lands;
        document and protect such de facto
         occupation rights against illegal evictions or
         displacements;
        consider land swapping or compensation or
         resettlement in the event of expropriation of
         ancestral land of minorities for preservation
         or conservation purposes;

       to ensure that minority groups benefit from
       resources on their ancestral lands rendered to
       extractive or other industry;
   (d) recognize the vital role of natural resources and

VII.   Environmental and Social Risks and Recommendations to Program Action Plan

263. Based on the findings of the ESSA, the Government will be including certain measures to
mitigate critical environmental and social risks at the local implementation level in the Program
Action Plan. These include:
           Revising environmental and social screening forms (developed for previous health
            and education projects supported by the Bank) for the specific types of investments
            supported by the PforR. Augment such forms with newly emerging concerns, such
            as recognizing and avoiding Gender-Based Violence, and further advancing good
            medical waste management. Provide training for responsible District officials, and
            technical assistance during Program implementation.
           Ensuring that key Districts reach their full complement of environmental and social
            safeguards staffing. Set up prioritization based on such factors as the scale of
            planned investments, overall District social risk, relative proportion of staffing gaps,
            etc.
           Seeking creative and cost-effective solutions in filling other gaps at the LG level,
            including the widespread lack of Grievance Redress Mechanisms and providing
            transport for conducting supervision missions.
           Tasking national line ministry specialists to support local officials with targeted
            supervision of a select number of schools and clinics constructed under the Program.
           Augmenting the work program of current program implementation units in relevant
            sectors (for donor-supported projects) to conduct targeted supervision as a means for
            supporting mainstreaming of risk reduction.

of Local Government (MoLG), Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Education and Sciences,
Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development (MoGLSD), National Environment
Management Agency (NEMA), Local Government Finance Commission (LGFC), Urban
Authorities Association Uganda (UAAU), and the Overseas Development Institute. A number of
other government agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) were invited but did
not attend. The list of participants is attached as (Appendix 1).

Proceedings:

3.      Franklin Mutahakana (Senior Operations Officer – World Bank) welcomed the
participants on behalf of the Uganda World Bank Country Office, and briefly explained the
importance of establishing an efficient environmental and social impact management systems in
PforR programs. He also urged them to actively participate and contribute to the consultations.

4.      The Task Team Leaders (Anton Dobronogov, Senior Economist and Tim Williamson,
Senior Public Sector Specialist), further explained the purpose of the workshop and requested the
various stakeholders provide feedback on the ESSA findings and recommendations. They also
provided an overview of Program’s development objectives, implementing arrangements and
other supporting information.

5.      The presentation on the overall ESSA approach, and the environment and social system
assessment findings and recommendations were made by the World Bank’s Senior Social
Development Specialist (Boyenge Dieng). The presentation covered the social context and
issues, the stakeholder analysis, potential social impacts, risk/assumptions, various acts and
regulations which govern social issues, and current practices of the Government of Uganda in
handling the social issues and management of identified social issues. Additional comments on
environment systems were provided by the Bank’s Environment Consultant (Ron Hoffer).

6.      Following the presentation, the participants contributed significantly during discussions.
In general, they were of the opinion that the ESSA study had correctly identified existing issues
and potential risks faced by agencies responsible for the Program, and also that it outlined
practical approaches to address these impacts and mitigate risks.

7.   Some of the key feedback points from the participants were:

        Processes
         o    There is need to strengthen institutional collaboration across NEMA, MoES,
              MoH, MoLG, MoGLSD among others, with emphasis in coordinating policy,
              legal and institutional factors.
         o    Implementation issues need to be clarified, including how subprojects will be
              identified, since LGs are currently supposed to take a bottom up approach in
              prioritizing projects. There is need to confirm this because it is better to involve
              communities right at the beginning.
         o    The program should include a social mitigation component to address risks,
              including gender-based violence, and other vulnerable group issues.
         o    There is need for multi-sector collaboration during project planning to avoid
              duplication of roles. Both the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health
              have construction departments, and how the project envisages involving these
              should be clarified.
         o    There is a need to ensure specific environment and social parameters are
              included in the Program Operation Manual to ensure that at the time of
              monitoring, all parameters are considered.
         o    Environment and social performance guidelines should be provided so that all
              districts follow uniformly including standardized environment and social
              screening checklist.
         o    The suggested inclusion of environmental and social issues in the overall LG
              performance tracking and improvement approach is interesting though
              somewhat unclear at this point (i.e. until the Program Operations Manual is
              produced).
        Staffing at Local level
         o    Filling the large number of staff vacancies for environmental and social
              compliance at the LG level is a key priority area and is being looked at by the
              Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development together with
              Ministry of Public Service. The government is taking the necessary steps to
              address the observed gaps but recognizes a number of challenges remain; for
              example the long lead time to hire staff, and challenges in. maintaining staff in
              rural areas.
         o    Recruitment of dedicated staff (environmentalists and Community
              Development Officers) remains problematic mostly due to long procurement
              processes - and this is particularly true for those at government level. NEMA
              and MGLSD should be used effectively but will the Program enable the entities
              to adequately perform their roles?
         o    There is a need for the bring on board key ministries specifically Ministry of
              Works and Ministry of Local Government to ensure that staffing gap is filled at
              different District Local Governments.


                                            102
            Budgeting for activities
             o    As noted in the ESSA, additional funds to LGs for supervision of
                  environmental and social compliance is clearly required; why not use existing
                  guidelines to try and provide those.
             o    The Program should set funds aside for environmental and social monitoring
                  logistics, as Districts have a supervisory role during implementation.
            Other Issues
             o    The suggested approach to use the existing school committees to monitor the
                  projects and enhance their capacity to address a wider range of issues. Senior
                  school teachers (woman and man), for example, can be helpful in the
                  identification and prevention of gender based violence, child labour, and other
                  issues.
             o    Health Unit Management Committees are currently use to monitor projects. But
                  do these committees have the capacity to monitor environment and social
                  impacts?
Next Steps

8.       The ESSA will remain posted on the World Bank website for a period of two weeks after
the consultations to allow for any additional comments/inputs from stakeholders. A final version
of the report will be reposted a month after the initial consultations which will take into account
to the extent possible, comments raised at the meeting and in the review period that follows
initial posting.

                                                          110
categorized as a B, this sub-program cannot be funded.

2) The sub-program has been assigned the environmental category: B1: Implementation of the
environmental mitigation measures as proposed in the Environmental and Social Checklist (with
amendments as appropriate) and as per Environmental Guidelines for Contractors and Clause 8
contained in the Bidding Documents will suffice.

3) The sub-program has been assigned the environmental category B2: The sub- program will
require a
separate Environmental Impact Assessment to be reviewed and approved by NEMA.
4) The sub-program has been assigned the environmental category C: The sub-program does
not require any additional environmental work and therefore can be implemented immediately.

In the event that a sub-program requires land acquisition, please prepare and implement a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) consistent with SDP Resettlement Policy Framework.

Please note, that land acquisition and land use impacts have been identified, civil works cannot
commence until appropriate actions through preparation and implementation of a RAP have
been completed to the satisfaction of the World Bank and the affected persons. MoES and its
partner implementing agencies are required to provide evidence of the land ownership.

Annex 5. Example of Guidelines for Social Impacts Mitigation

I.     Risk of GBV

1.     The Team recommends the following mitigations to the risk of GBV: Making sure that
any physical infrastructure upgrading provides safe access for girls.
           Separate latrines for girls and boys, make sure they are built in physically different
            locations of the school, build latrines with locks on the doors, and limit spaces that
            are dark and hidden away in order to enhance child protection.
           Make sure that school staff, parents and teachers have access to and know of and
            report abuse using the national child abuse hotline 611. The existence of the hotline
            can be displayed throughout the school, community and construction site
           Work with construction companies on establishing zero tolerance policies and codes
            of conduct related to violence against women and girls (VAWG). Make construction
            sites areas free of violence against women and girls. All employees must be made
            aware of the zero tolerance policy and codes of conduct for employees. In addition,
            display signs throughout the site making it clear that the work site is a violence free
            zone and VAWG will not be tolerated. Codes of conduct should be linked to
            national laws on VAWG.
           All workers should receive adequate briefing and education on the laws against
            defilement and other sexual offences.
            Note: In the regulatory framework, the client should cite/include the policies on
            ending violence against children policy and the GBV, how they could be upheld and
            potentially implemented by this project. Ministry policies in respect to these issues
            should also be sited.

II.    Child Protection:

2.     For each Lot, it is necessary to provide a stronger context on child rights violations in the
areas of coverage i.e. Location specific or district data on child abuse including rates of
defilement in the area, teenage pregnancy rates, early marriages, forms and rates of child labor
and factors affecting school completion and transition rates for both boys and girls (this is
usually available in the district probation and welfare office or with the MGLSD). If there are
any key interventions in the project area, they can be stated as well.

 On the contractors’ side:

           Planning of civil works: To the extent possible, works that require high numbers of
            casual laborers (>20) should take place during the long holidays. Use of mechanized
            equipment such as large motorized mixers etc. should be adopted to expedite works
            within the schools, guarantee quality and to minimize large labor force requirements.
           Securing the work site: The work site should be safely closed off by fencing (which
            is standard good practice) to ensure controlled interaction between children and
            workers, with a well manned common access to monitor movements of both


                                                112
           children and workers. The aim here is to minimize disruption of school activities and
           prevent children from trespassing into the work site and vice versa. Workers
           movements should also be restricted within the work site.
          Screening of workers: Priority for employment on the work sites should be given to
           local laborers who are known within the school catchment area/community. Each
           worker should a present a national ID (a copy to be kept by the school board/PTA
           and the contractor). A national ID should be a requirement for recruitment into the
           labor force. The contractor should in addition ensure that adequate background
           checks are done by the police within reach of the school for each worker recruited.
           This will help weed out workers with a criminal background, send a signal on
           discipline requirements to those who pass the screening process and enhance
           traceability of workers who commit any crimes within the school and catchment
           area, thus contributing to averting crime.
          Code of conduct: As recommended above, the code of conduct of workers is key and
           should in no unclear terms indicate zero tolerance of any forms of child abuse
           including sexual abuse of women and girls. This should be read out to each worker
           at recruitment, explained and signed by the workers as part of their contract. In
           addition, zero tolerance for child abuse public messages should be visible for the
           duration of the works. These messages should be visible enough for the workers and
           the children/teachers with examples of common forms of abuse and what actions
           should be taken in case of suspected or actual abuse. With the help of the District
           Labor officers, messaging on zero tolerance for child labor should be displayed.
          Close surveillance of workers conducts: Contractor should ensure that mechanisms
           for close monitoring of worker’s behavior/conduct are in place e.g.
           contractor/schools could discreetly engage the police to identify anonymous
           informers from among the workers to monitor and report any negative behavior by
           the workers including child abuse related misconduct, display a call line or
           suggestion box where the school community can provide feedback on workers
           behavior.
          Tool Box Talks: Regardless of number of workers, weekly tool box talks are
           strongly recommended. The Child and Family Protection unit of the local Police and
           the District Labor officer and Probation and welfare officers invited at least once a
           month or more to address the workers.
On the school side:

          Already designed and approved school based life skills interventions should be
           implemented and supervised
          Orientation of CCTs (center coordinating tutors), head teachers, senior women and
           senior men teachers: The client through the Primary Teacher’s Colleges (PTCs) -
           Deputies in charge of Outreach, should ensure that all center coordinating tutors
           (CCTs) are fully oriented to the labour force related risks for children and female
           teachers in all the 55 schools under the project.




                                             113
           Activating the school based PIASCY program: All CCTs mapped to the schools
            should in turn strengthen and intensify the already existing and tested “whole school
            approach model? for safety of children under the PIASCY program. This will
            include reactivating weekly assembly briefs, updating and reviving talking
            compound messages, Life skills clubs, skits and activities, edutainment around
            potential child abuse risks, peer support groups, suggestion/information boxes,
            encouraging children to walk in groups to and from school, identifying support
            community volunteers who can enhance protection of children on their way to and
            from school etc
           School talks on child protection: talks by relevant guests (including the police) on
            child protection should be encouraged and appropriately scheduled, including
            continuous popularization of the child help line 116. Parents/guardians should be
            sensitized to strictly follow the school routine and held accountable for children
            leaving and arriving home before dark.
           Curriculum and co-curricular interventions: Teachers should be encuraged to utilize
            both curriculum and co-curricular entry points for life skills education. These
            opportunities include essay writing competitions, storytelling, messaging through
            Art, poetry, music dance and drama, assembly skits etc. These have been identified
            by the CCTs across the country. They just need to be implemented with intensity
            and continued even after construction works are completed given the high risks
            around children.
III.   HIV/AIDS:

On the Ministry’s side

           As part of the project brief under the social baseline context data on the prevalence
            and incidence of HIV and AIDS in the project area would be helpful. This should
            include the known risk factors and drivers of the epidemic in the area. The aim
            should be to inform the response to the existing epidemic and for the contractor to
            build an HIV/AIDS work programme informed by behavioral factors, structural
            drivers and biomedical interventions.
           The Ministry should ensure that the contractor’s contract specifications include an
            HIV/AIDS workplace program (WPP) commensurate to the number of employees
            with requisite capacity to support the program.
On the contractors’ side:

           Access to counselling and testing: Through the HIV/AIDS work place program, all
            the workers should be reached with knowledge on the importance of knowing their
            HIV status and that of their sexual partners as well as where they can seek the
            necessary testing and counseling services. The contractor should ensure that workers
            have paid time off for HIV related activities including accessing biomedical
            services.
           Sensitization and education on HIV transmission: Education on HIV transmission
            should include improving the understanding of workers on existing risks and drivers


                                              114
    of HIV transmission in the area including the links between sex work, and existence
    of construction workers (mobile men with money) in an area. The zero tolerance
    message on sexual harassment and abuse of children and women should be
    reinforced through the HIV and AIDS sensitization program.
   Efforts by the contractor to establish a peer education program are encouraged,
    including support for adherence to treatment for workers living with HIV. This
    should include flexible work hours for those living openly with HIV/AIDS.
    Mechanisms to periodically assess effectiveness of the program should be inbuilt in
    the program.
   The contractor is encouraged to collaborate with the respective District Health
    Officers for each District and District HIV Focal Point Officers as well as seek
    necessary support from the Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC) and Ministry of
    Health AIDS Control program (MOH/ACP) for minimum standards and guidance
    that ensures a well-structured and supported program.

Western Balkans
Labor Market Trends 2017
Western Balkans Labor Market Report 2017 highlights:

   Western Balkan countries have increased employment by creating roughly 300,000 jobs since
    2010, from an estimated 5.5 million in 2010 to 5.8 million in 2016. However, this rate of job
    creation is not enough to address the many challenges confronting Western Balkan labor
    markets.
   Unemployment declined during this period by an estimated 200,000 people, from 23 to 21
    percent, but inactivity remains high, especially among women, the low-educated, and youth. In
    addition, informal employment and long-term unemployment remain a significant challenge in
    the region.
   The winners among the recent employment recovery are workers aged 55 and older as well as
    the highly educated. The losers, on the other hand, are the low-educated, especially low-
    educated youth. Overall, youth unemployment levels remain critically high.
   No significant impact of economic growth on employment growth is currently observed in the
    aftermath of the financial crisis in the Western Balkans, and the impact of growth on
    unemployment is small. Therefore, the Western Balkan countries are not yet in a situation
    whereby the current levels of economic growth guarantee a return to job growth; the transition
    to modern market economies is not yet complete, and many structural issues remain to be
    addressed.

1. Introduction
Labor markets in the Western Balkan countries—comprising Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia—are characterized by low employment rates and
high unemployment. High and persistent long-term unemployment has become a salient feature of
the labor markets of the region. Substantial informal sector activities are another prominent feature
of these economies. International migration plays an important role in cushioning the problem of
unemployment and has become an important source of income. In addition, almost the entire
region is facing an aging and shrinking population due to low birth rates and high emigration.1 Given
these unfavorable demographic and labor market conditions, interest in labor market data and
analysis features highly on the agenda of regional policy makers.

In this report, labor market developments in the Western Balkan countries in the period 2010-
2016 are presented and compared with selected member states of the European Union (EU). All
Western Balkan countries aspire to become EU members in the near future. So, as comparators, the
report uses four countries that joined the EU at different times over the last 25 years, namely Austria
(1995), Hungary (2004), Bulgaria (2007), and Croatia (2013). Each of these comparator countries,
representing their respective accession “wave”, is geographically close and similar in population size
to the Western Balkan countries. Therefore, this group of countries, arguably, most closely
resembles a possible path of future development for the six Western Balkan countries, with Croatia
as the most recent country to join the EU being just one step ahead of Western Balkan countries,
and Bulgaria, Hungary, and Austria arguably representing one further step each.

The report is based on a new regionally comparable database on labor market indicators. The
database uses labor force survey (LFS) data provided by the Statistical Offices of the individual
Western Balkan countries and by Eurostat for the EU comparator countries and is available online at
the South-East Europe Jobs Gateway (http://SEEJobsGateway.net).2 The objective of this report is to
showcase these data and present a few insights on how labor markets in the Western Balkans have
developed over the last six years to a general, non-technical audience.

The report finds that the Western Balkan countries have increased employment by roughly
300,000 jobs since 2010, from an estimated 5.5 million in 2010 to 5.8 million in 2016. However, this
rate of job creation is not enough to address the many challenges in the Western Balkan labor
markets: unemployment declined by an estimated 200,000 people—or from 23 to 21 percent of the
labor force—and inactivity remains high, especially among women, the low-educated, and youth.

The unexpected winners among the recent employment recovery are—even if not by much—
adults who are close to retirement, but also—less surprisingly—the highly educated. This is
partially explained by the fact that the 55-64 age group is growing considerably overall. Fortunately,
employment rates in this group have also increased significantly, suggesting a genuine structural
improvement. Higher education is, more than ever, a pathway into the labor markets and stable

    Only Albania and Kosovo are still characterized by a high share of young people, but United Nations (UN) population
    projections, suggest that the aging of populations will persist in all six Western Balkan countries in the medium and long-
    term. See https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/

employment, including for young people. The proportion of women in employment has also
increased during the recent economic recovery, although progress toward decreasing the gender
gap in employment is slow.

The losers, on the other hand, are clearly the low-educated, especially low-educated youth.
Overall, youth unemployment levels remain critically high—for example, the unemployment rate is
57 percent in Kosovo—although the relationship between overall unemployment and youth
unemployment seems to be in line with other countries. This suggests that youth are not necessarily
at a particular disadvantage in the Western Balkan labor markets; rather, the high levels of youth
unemployment are driven by the overall challenging situation of Western Balkan labor markets.
Nevertheless, because youth employment represents a more flexible segment of the labor market,
with a higher share of temporary contracts and informal employment, reforming labor regulations
and labor taxation could have a positive impact on youth employment. In addition, there are also
other important constraints, like skills mismatches, low levels of entrepreneurship skills and access
to productive inputs as well as social norms and attitudes, particularly regarding care
responsibilities. On a positive note, youth unemployment rates fell faster than the overall
unemployment rate in some Western Balkan countries in recent years. However, the share of long-
term unemployed in the labor force is highest among the youth cohort, which indicates that there
are significant risks of skills degradation of young people and subsequent labor market challenges
later in their careers.

Informal employment remains a significant challenge, although data are scarce. In those countries
where data are available, such as Albania, FRY Macedonia, and Serbia, a decrease in informal
employment was observed between 2010 and 2016. However, in Serbia, where informal
employment is measured comprehensively, roughly half of the new jobs created recently have been
in the informal sector, suggesting a strong pro-cyclical relationship between growth and informal
employment.

Overall, the evidence suggests that the jobs challenge in the Western Balkans is structural, and
growth alone will not be sufficient to create the number and types of jobs needed in the labor
market. No significant impact of growth on employment has been observed in the aftermath of the
financial crisis in the Western Balkans, and the impact of growth on unemployment is small. This is in
stark contrast to central European EU countries, where a significant positive relationship between
growth and employment also prevailed after the Great Recession. This suggests that the Western
Balkan countries are not yet in a situation where current economic growth will guarantee a return to
jobs growth; the transition to modern market economies is not yet complete, and many structural
issues remain to be addressed.

This report focuses on the key labor market trends (activity, employment, unemployment)
between 2010 and 2016, with a special focus on the link between economic growth and labor
markets. The report starts by discussing recent economic developments (Section 2), which is
followed by an overview of demographic developments and levels of activity and inactivity in the
population (Section 3). Sections 4 and 5 discuss employment and unemployment respectively.
Section 6 highlights the link between economic growth and labor market developments, and Section
7 presents a summary of the report’s findings. An extensive statistical annex on key labor market
indicators for each of the countries can be found at the back of this report. .

2. Economic environment
Following a decline in 2009 as a consequence of the financial and economic crisis, GDP growth in
the six Western Balkan countries started to recover in 2010, declined again in 2012, only to
rebound steadily thereafter. In 2015, GDP grew by 2.2 percent, thanks to rising investments and an
improved external environment. As illustrated in Figure 1, developments differed across countries:
Albania and Kosovo reported GDP growth over the entire 2010-2015 period; all other countries
recorded a decline in 2012, with Serbia also registering a downturn in 2014. In three EU peer
countries—Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary—GDP increased throughout the period under review,
whereas Croatia faced six years of recession and only returned to growth in 2015. In terms of
employment, FYR Macedonia and Montenegro experienced employment growth throughout the
entire period, while job creation in the other countries picked up at different points in time (for
example, in Serbia in 2013 or in Albania in 2014). Kosovo experienced a significant reduction in
employment in 2014 and 2015.

Labor productivity3 developments varied across the Western Balkans. A remarkable increase in
labor productivity took place in Kosovo as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYR Macedonia,
albeit at a lower rate. Productivity growth advanced unevenly in Montenegro and Serbia, with
alternating increases and decreases, while in Albania there was a reversal of the positive trend in
2015.

What has been driving those productivity trends? Labor productivity growth in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Kosovo has been driven by shrinking employment combined with a higher GDP
growth, while in FYR Macedonia and Montenegro it has been driven by higher GDP than
employment growth, which has also been the case for Bulgaria and Croatia (see Figure 1).

    Labor productivity is measured as GDP in real terms per person employed, according to LFS statistics. This measure has
    however some limitations such as not accounting for hours worked and changes in the structure of employment by type and
    sector.

3. Population
Almost the entire region is facing either a demographic contraction or stagnation, driven by high
outward migration and declining birth rates. Since 2010, the population of the Western Balkan
countries has declined by about 246,000 persons, standing at 18.2 million in 2015. The only country
to report a significant population increase was Kosovo (+8.2 percent), while Serbia recorded the
largest decline (-3.2 percent). The population also decreased in the EU peer countries, except for
Austria. These declines were most pronounced in the under 25 age group, while the number of
those aged 55-64 and over 65 increased significantly (Figure 2). Despite the resulting changes in the
population structure, the share of the younger population in the Western Balkans is still higher and
the share of those over 65 is lower than in the EU peer countries (Figure 3).

With the exception of FYR Macedonia and Kosovo the working age population fell in all Western
Balkan countries. Between 2010 and 2016 the strongest declines were reported for Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Albania, while Montenegro and Serbia followed a similar pattern to Croatia and
Hungary (Figure 4). Positive developments were seen in Kosovo and Macedonia and particularly in
Austria—mainly due to a net inflow of migrants. The shrinking of the working age population could
imply lower GDP growth in the future if not compensated by higher corresponding productivity
growth. Furthermore, the continuous rise of the dependency ratio in the coming years will have
implications on the fiscal system as well as placing a burden on social welfare systems.

ACTIVITY RATES
In 2016, activity rates (15-64) surpassed the 2010 level or remained at least stagnant in all Western
Balkan countries, except for Kosovo. Activity rates also increased in the EU peer countries,
particularly in Hungary. While the activity rate was 60 percent in 2015 in the Western Balkans-6,4
there were significant differences between countries. Levels were low in Kosovo (38.4 percent) and
Bosnia and Herzegovina (54.2 percent), while reaching about 65 percent in Albania, the FYR
Macedonia and Serbia, which compare well with Croatia, but are far less than Austria (Figure 5).

Activity rates in the Western Balkans are suppressed because of low female labor market
participation. Male activity rates in Albania, FYR Macedonia and Serbia compare well with those of
the EU peer countries, while female participation in the labor market is significantly lower across the
region. Differences are particularly noticeable in Kosovo, where less than 20 percent of women are
active in the labor market and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the figure stands at 42 percent
(Figure 5). Indeed, the gender gap in activity rates—that is, the difference between lale and female
activity—is high, reaching 38.6 percentage points in Kosovo, 5 25.5 percentage points in FYR
Macedonia and 23.3 percentage points in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016. Montenegro has the
narrowest gender gap in activity rates (11.3 percentage points). By comparison, the gap varies in the
EU peer countries between 7.8 percentage points in Bulgaria and 13.1 percentage points in Hungary.

Gender inequality with regard to labor market participation in the Western Balkans may reflect
cultural or religious factors, patriarchal family structures or challenges in the career development of
women. 6 Furthermore, the prospect of (much) lower salaries for women with low levels of
educational attainment compared to men with a similar educational background, may discourage
women from entering the labor force (Reva, 2012). However, between 2010 and 2016 the gender
activity gap diminished gradually in most Western Balkan countries, but widened in FRY Macedonia
and Kosovo—as was the case in Hungary. Box 1 elaborates further on gender differences in labor
market outcomes across the Western Balkans.

    Box 1 / Gender differences in labor market outcomes

    Labor market outcomes of women are weak in the Western Balkan countries. Women face lower activity
    and employment rates than men and are consequently more likely to be inactive. In three out of six
    Western Balkan countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia), the incidence of unemployment is
    higher for women than for men. Explanations for these disparities are manifold and can be attributed
    factors that include the following: religious and cultural reasons; and traditional roles assigned to women,
    such as staying at home to take care of children and other family members, especially in a region with
    larger gender gaps in relation to wages and with limited availability of care facilities. In addition, the
    reliance on remittances and the widespread informal economy are considered to decrease employment
    incentives, resulting in low labor force participation, especially among women (UNDP, 2016; EC, 2016a;
    Petreski et al. 2017). Furthermore, labor taxation and the social benefit system are seen as one of the
    causes of inactivity, due to the potential disincentive effects for many of those seeking employment
    (Koettl, 2012). For example, in Montenegro the introduction of life-long benefits for mothers of at least
    three children in 2016 resulted in more than 15,000 women applying for this benefit, ‘effectively pushing
    many of them out of the labor market’ (EC, 2016b).

INACTIVITY RATES
Inactivity is primarily a phenomenon of women, young people and people with low education.
Despite declining in most countries—with the sharpest drops in Montenegro and Serbia—the
inactivity rate in the Western Balkans-6 was 40 percent in 2015 and thus considerably higher than in
the EU peer countries (25-35 percent). The share of people outside the labor market was highest in
Kosovo (61.8 percent) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (45.4 percent) and lowest in FYR Macedonia and
in Albania, where it was close to 36 percent in each country (Figure 6). In some countries (FYR
Macedonia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina), female inactivity is twice as high as the male rate.
The incidence of inactivity in the peer countries is also higher for women than for men, although the
differences are much smaller. Inactivity rates fell for both sexes in most countries of the region
during the period covered by this report.

Across the Western Balkans-6, the lack of participation in the labor market is most acute among
young people (15-24 years), with this age group reporting an inactivity rate of 71 percent in 2015.
Young women are more likely to be inactive than men (78 percent versus 64 percent respectively),
partly because young women’s participation in education tends to be higher in the Western
Balkans.7 Inactivity is lowest for the prime age group (25-54 years) in all countries of the region
(Figure 7), where almost 20 percent were outside the labor market in 2016,8 representing a higher
proportion than in the EU peer countries. People aged 55 to 64 years are less inactive in the labor
market than the younger age groups. Despite declining, inactivity in all Western Balkan countries
among this age group is well above the rates of the comparator countries.

Inactivity is more likely for the low educated both in the Western Balkans-6 and in the EU peer
countries. FYR Macedonia and Serbia compare well with Bulgaria and Hungary, with inactivity rates
among the low educated reaching around 60 percent (Figure 8). Inactivity in this educational group
is high in Kosovo (over 80 percent), followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro where it
has remained almost unchanged over recent years. With the exception of FYR Macedonia, inactivity
among people with medium education exceeds those in the peer countries. Only Montenegro and
FYR Macedonia have recorded inactivity rates similar to the peer countries with respect to the highly
educated.

There are several explanations for high inactivity, which relate to subdued growth, social benefits,
taxation, early retirement but also higher educational attainment and migration. Generally, lower
economic growth as compared to the EU-Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries combined with
no or poor job creation have caused inactivity. Yet, there are also several specific reasons. For
example, these include: (i) a high number of war veterans in Bosnia and Herzegovina; (ii) more
generally, people who are either disheartened or discouraged from seeking employment,9 such as

    Kosovo is an outlier: in 2015 more than half of the prime age group (25-64 years) were out of labor force.

older workers who lost their jobs during the process of privatization and restructuring; and (iii) those
who found ‘loopholes in the system and entered early retirement as beneficiaries of disability
pension schemes’ (Arandarenko et al., 2012; Sanfey et al., 2016). In addition, rising enrolment rates
in universities could indicate that young people stay longer in education. Another cause of inactivity,
as already mentioned above, is the joint effect of labor taxation and the social benefit system is also
considered to be one of the causes of inactivity, since (formal) work would not pay off well enough
for many of those inactive (Koettl, 2012). With regard to women, those who are inactive tend to be
young, low educated, or take care of children and other family members. Further, remittances are
considered to be one of the major reasons of (female) inactivity, particularly in Kosovo (UNDP, 2016)
and FYR Macedonia (Petreski et al. 2017).


4. Employment
The economic rebound in recent years has translated into rising employment from 2014, more for
women than men. In 2016 an estimated 5.8 million people were employed in the Western Balkan
countries—roughly 300,000 more than in 201010—representing an increase of about 5 percent. Over
that period the number of newly created jobs for women was higher than for men. Employment
grew in all countries with two exceptions: Albania11 and Bosnia and Herzegovina (Table 1). In
absolute numbers, employment increased most in Serbia and in FYR Macedonia. Among the peer
countries employment fell in Bulgaria and in Croatia—the latter suffering from a deep and long-
lasting recession—while employment gains were reported for Austria and Hungary.12

Somewhat surprisingly, employment increased significantly for older workers aged 55 to 64 in all
Western Balkan countries. Employment in this age group increased by more than 20 percent in
most countries, and by 67 percent in Albania. Part of this increase is explained by a cohort effect, as
this particular age group has seen a considerable population growth (see Figure 3)—but
employment growth has been even higher. As will be discussed later (Figure 11), there was also a
structural change because employment rates have also been increasing among that age group. In
the prime age group (25-54 years), employment has also been increasing (except in Bosnia and
Herzegovina) but there have been no employment increases for young people, especially in Albania,
but also in Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYR Macedonia. However, this can also be partially explained
by a cohort effect (fewer young people overall), and partially by the fact that young people stay
longer in education—which is a positive trend as youth unemployment and inactivity is concentrated
among low educated youth.

     Employment data for Kosovo are estimated for 2010 and 2016 respectively.
11
     However, in 2015 and in 2016 Albania reported high employment growth (4.8% and 6.8% respectively), mainly as a result
     of the national campaign fighting the informal economy.

     In Hungary the introduction of a public works programme in 2011 has contributed significantly to the strong employment
     increase/unemployment decrease over recent years. In the final quarter of 2016, public works accounted for slightly more
     than 5% of total employment. https://www.ksh.hu/docs/eng/xftp/gyor/fog/efog1612.html

In terms of education, in all Western Balkan countries—except Montenegro—the low skilled were
most affected by decreases in employment levels. The decline in employment among the low
skilled ranged from 23 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 9.6 percent in FYR Macedonia. In
Austria, Bulgaria and particularly in Croatia, employment also fell sharply among the low educated,
but increased quite considerably (18.5 percent) in Hungary. The number of medium skilled persons
dropped in most of the Western Balkan countries, with the main exceptions being FYR Macedonia
and Serbia. Among the peer countries only Hungary reported employment increases among this
educational group. By contrast, the number of high skilled workers rose in the entire region and in all
peer countries.

The share of the highly educated among the employed increased in the entire region between
2010 and 2016, but remained below the proportions reported in Austria and Bulgaria. Only
Montenegro compares well with these two peer countries (Figure 9). FYR Macedonia and Serbia
reported shares of the highly educated among the workforce that are comparable with Croatia and
Hungary. Albania is a special case, exhibiting the highest share of low skilled (46.7 percent) and the
lowest share of high skilled people in the Western Balkans.

EMPLOYMENT RATES
Increasing the employment rate is one of the major goals of the South East Europe (SEE) 2020
Strategy. In 2015 the employment rate based on the working age population (15+), which was used
as the main labor market indicator in the strategy document, stood at 39.9 percent—which is still far
below the target rate of 44.4 percent. With respect to individual countries, Serbia and FYR
Macedonia are closest to the country targets set in the strategy, while others, like Albania and
Kosovo, are lagging far behind.

Employment rates based on the working age population of 15-64 years increased in all Western
Balkan countries and exceeded the 2010 level in 2016, but were still lagging far behind those of
the EU peer countries. This increase resulted from both rising employment and a shrinking of the
working age population. In 2015 the Western Balkans-6 employment rate stood at 46.9 but there
were substantial variations across countries, ranging from 25.8 percent in Kosovo to 55.1 percent in
Albania. By comparison, in 2016 the employment rate was 71 percent in Austria and 65.7 percent in
Hungary (Figure 10). Employment rates increased for both sexes, with the highest gains being
reported in the oldest age group (55-64 years).

Despite increasing, female employment rates remain low compared with EU peer countries. They
are particularly low in Kosovo (11.9 percent) and in Bosnia and Herzegovina (29.5 percent), ‘leaving
an ample amount of human potential unused, misused or underused’ (UNDP, 2016). In Kosovo, this
employment rate is lowest for young women (15-24 years), at 3.8 percent, while it is highest for the
prime age group (25-54 years), at 16 percent. In terms of education, women with low education face
the lowest employment rate at 3.8 percent, whereas it stands at 43.2 percent for highly educated
women. Similar patterns with respect to female employment rates are observed in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

With the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYR Macedonia, the gender employment gap
has narrowed between 2010 and 2016, but there are variations between countries. The biggest
differences were reported for Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the gender gap was as
high as 27.5 and 22.1 percentage points respectively (Figure 12). Differences between male and
female employment rates are much lower in the peer countries (about 7 percentage points on
average) where they have declined, the only exception being Hungary (12.7 percentage points).

Employment rates increased for all age groups, with the largest gains among the older followed by
the prime age group, while the employment rate for young people grew only marginally.
Employment rates among the older (55-64 years) grew most in Serbia, FYR Macedonia and in
Montenegro, which could be as a result of pension reforms. Regulations on early retirement in
Serbia have been restricted gradually since 2011 and became even more restrictive from 2015. The
retirement age of women in Serbia has also been extended.13 The low employment rates of the
young might be driven by more education and training, similar to EU countries (Figure 11).

Employment rates of the medium and highly skilled youth remain well below those of the peer
countries. A more detailed look at youth employment rates by educational attainment, as illustrated
in Figure 12, shows that the employment rates of highly skilled young people increased in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and in Serbia between 2010 and 2016. Employment rates among the low skilled within
this age group fell in all countries, with the exception of Serbia, comparing well with the peer
countries. Austria is an exception here, where youth employment rates among the low skilled
exceed the employment rates for the high skilled in the Western Balkan countries, with the
exception of FYR Macedonia. The employment rate for the medium skilled increased between 2010
and 2016, particularly in Albania and Serbia, but also in FYR Macedonia; in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
the rate remained stagnant. In general, youth employment rates of the medium and high skilled are
well below those in the peer countries.

INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT
Informal sector employment is another important feature of the Western Balkan labor markets.
Informal employment is only covered regularly by labor force surveys in Albania, FYR Macedonia and
Serbia. However, only Serbia and FYR Macedonia use the comprehensive International Labour
Organization (ILO) definition of informal employment.14

In Serbia the share of informal employment fell between 2010 and 2012 in accordance with total
employment and increased quite significantly over the two following years, while the proportion
decreased continuously in Albania and Macedonia during the entire period. Between 2012 and
2014 more than half of the total employment increase in Serbia was due to a rise in informal
employment, with its share in total employment rising from 17.5 percent in 2012 to 21.2 percent in
2014. In 2015, a reversal in the trend was observed, with a decline in informal sector employment,
both in the level and the share in total employment, suggesting an improvement in the quality of
jobs (Arandarenko, 2016). In FYR Macedonia informal sector employment fell from 25 percent in
2011 to 22.5 percent in 2012, remaining at that level for three years and subsequently dropping to
19.9 percent in 2015. In Albania, informal employment also decreased from 51.3 percent in 2014 to
46.8 percent in 2015.

     Accordingly, informal employment covers (1) workers in unregistered firms, (2) workers in registered firms but with no
     written contract and with no health or pension insurance paid and (3) unpaid family workers.

Young people, women and the older age group are most affected by informal employment.
Overall, men are more affected by informal employment than women in FYR Macedonia, while the
reverse is the case in Albania and Serbia. With respect to age, young people (15-24 years) account
for the highest share of informal employment (young men in particular) in all three countries where
information is available; the same applies for the prime age group. By contrast, among the older,
women are more likely than men to accept informal sector employment in all three countries. More
detailed information from the Serbian LFS shows that in 2015, most (42 percent) of the informally
employed were unpaid family workers, about one third were self-employed without employees, and
about one quarter were employees. The majority (27.2 percent) of informal workers lived in
Sumadija and Western Serbia, followed by South-Eastern Serbia (24.7 percent), Vojvodina (17
percent), while only about 8 percent resided in Belgrade (Figure 13).

Apart from complex tax and social security systems and strict labor market institutions,
remittances are considered as one of the drivers of informality. Using a large survey from six
transition economies (including Serbia and FYR Macedonia), Ivlevs (2014) found that people
receiving remittances are more likely to work informally than people with similar characteristics but
who do not receive remittances. Accordingly, ‘remittances provide the household with a capital to
start a new business or become self-employed—a type of employment which is often informal—and
remittances represent a safety net encouraging remittance-receivers to choose less secure, but
more lucrative, informal work’.

5. Unemployment
Unemployment fell by about 200,000 people, from an estimated 1.7 million in 2010 to 1.5 million
in 2016, corresponding to a decline in the unemployment rate from 23 percent to 21 percent.15
Unemployment rates are on the decrease in the entire region, except in Albania (Figure 14). In 2016
the unemployment rate varied between 25.4 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 17.1 percent in
Serbia. Depending on the country, recovery started from 2013/2014 onwards. In Albania and Croatia
this process only began in 2015. In Bulgaria and particularly in Hungary, a noticeable downward
trend in unemployment was also observed. It was only in Austria, starting from a comparatively low
level, that the unemployment rate increased slowly but steadily to 6.2 percent in 2016. Croatia
reported the highest unemployment rate among the peer countries (14.1 percent in 2016).

Gender differences in unemployment rates are much less evident than in employment rates.
However, there are large differences across the countries covered in this report. In 2015 the gender
gap in the unemployment rate was most pronounced in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo (4.9
percentage points each). The incidence of unemployment was also higher for women than men (by
2, 1.3 and 0.4 percentage points; respectively) in Serbia, Croatia and Hungary. In all other countries
the male unemployment rate exceeded the female rate. Gender differences in unemployment are
likely the result of more women being outside the labor force, probably due to traditional roles, as
already mentioned, such as mothers staying at home because of care duties, especially in a region
with larger gender gaps in relation to wages and with limited childcare facilities available (OECD,
2015).

Unemployment rates fell for the low and medium skilled, while the decline was notably smaller
for the highly skilled (Figure 15). However, these developments differed substantially between
countries. Between 2010 and 2016 unemployment rates increased in all three educational groups
(that is, low, medium and highly educated) in Albania, Kosovo and Austria. By contrast, declines in
unemployment were registered in all categories in Montenegro, FYR Macedonia and Hungary. All
other countries reported a combination of both. For example, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
reported increases in unemployment for the highly educated and a decline for the low and medium
educated while in Bulgaria, it rose for the low educated and fell for the medium and high educated.
In 2016 the unemployment of the low and medium educated ranged between 13.6 percent (17.8
percent) in Albania and 46.6 percent (32.6 percent) in Kosovo. Rates for the highly educated varied
between 11 percent in Montenegro and 20.3 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
In most Western Balkan countries the unemployment rate for people under 25 years shows a
similar pattern as in the EU peer countries, at levels about twice as high as overall unemployment
rates. However, whereas the relative gap is the same, in absolute levels young people in the
Western Balkans are at a much greater disadvantage since the unemployment rate itself is much
higher than in the peer countries. Across the Western Balkans the youth unemployment rate fell on
average from 50.8 percent in 2010 to 47.7 percent in 2015. Data for the first two quarters of 2016
point to a further decline, but unemployment among the young remains stubbornly high by
European standards and is subject to major fluctuations (Figure 16).

Youth unemployment rates fell faster than the overall unemployment rate in some Western
Balkan countries (Figure 16). In both Albania and Austria the reverse was the case, with youth
unemployment rising more than unemployment for all ages. This would suggest that youth
unemployment is more responsive to the business cycle (see World Bank 2016a). In addition, the
youth lack work experience or their skills do not match with employers’ requirements (see Box 2 for
a summary of policy challenges on youth employment in the Western Balkans). The high rates of
57.6 percent in Kosovo, 54.3 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and close to 50 percent in
P a g e | 18


Macedonia indicate that young people are faced with a fairly critical situation in the Western Balkan
labor markets.

Gender differences in youth unemployment are apparent, but differ across countries . Historically,
the incidence of unemployment has been higher for young women than for men in Serbia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina and in Kosovo, a pattern which was also evident in Croatia and Albania from 2013
and 2015 respectively (Figure 16). Unemployment rates for young women were below the rates for
men during most of the 2010-2016 period in Montenegro, FYR Macedonia as well as the peer
countries.

The Western Balkan countries exhibit youth unemployment ratios—the ratio of unemployed to all
youth—that are almost four times higher than in Bulgaria and Hungary and twice as high as in
Austria. FYR Macedonia had a similar youth unemployment ratio to Croatia. The youth
unemployment ratio offers another insight into youth unemployment since it takes into account the
share of young people still enrolled in education. In all Western Balkan countries, unemployment
affects a relatively large share of the 15-24 age cohorts, with ratios of 16.4 percent and 14.6 percent
recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYR Macedonia respectively. Ratios of 11-12 percent were
observed in Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Croatia.

Youth unemployment declined most for the highly skilled in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and
Kosovo, while unemployment of the low educated either grew in Albania and Kosovo or remained
stagnant in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in FYR Macedonia (Figure 17). Serbia was the only country
to report a decline in the unemployment of low skilled young people. Developments among the
medium skilled were mixed. Youth unemployment in the EU peer countries fell in all educational
groups in Hungary and probably in Bulgaria, while the most striking increase was reported for the
highly educated young people in Croatia.

  Box 2 / The policy challenges of youth employment and unemployment in the Western Balkans

  A recent report on youth employment in the Western Balkans (World Bank 2016a) finds that many young
  people are idle—that is, neither in employment nor in training—and that young women, in particular, have
  a weak attachment to the labor market. The labor market outcomes of youth are especially closely linked
  to the business cycle, leading to higher job losses during downturns, but which also benefit more during
  economic booms. This is partially explained by the fact that youth employment represents a more flexible
  segment of the labor market, with a higher share of temporary contracts and informal employment.
  Reforming labor regulations and labor taxation could have a positive impact on youth employment, but
  there are also other important constraints, like skills mismatches, low levels of entrepreneurship skills and
  access to productive inputs as well as social norms and attitudes, particularly regarding care
  responsibilities.

LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT
In 2015 more than 70 percent of the unemployed in the Western Balkans-6 were out of work for
more than a year on average. Long-term unemployment was highest and even increased in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (85 percent), FYR Macedonia (84 percent) and Montenegro (78 percent). Serbia
and Albania are the only countries in the region where the share of long-term unemployed fell
between 2010 and 2016, but still accounted for about two-thirds of total unemployment. The
proportion of long-term unemployed also decreased in Hungary and most noticeably in Croatia, but
increased somewhat in Austria and Hungary. The proportion of long-term unemployed women was
very close to that of men in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and in Serbia, which was also the
case in Hungary. In FYR Macedonia the share of men exceeded the share of women, which was also
the case in Austria and Croatia, while the female share was higher in Kosovo, Albania and in Bulgaria.

In 2016 the long-term unemployment rate—measured as the share of long-term unemployed
among the labor force—varied between 10 percent in Albania and Serbia and 21.6 percent in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Having started with high levels, long-term unemployment has gradually
declined since 2014 in most Western Balkan countries. As shown in Figure 18 (based on quarterly
data), in FYR Macedonia the decline had already started at the beginning of 2012, continuing
P a g e | 20


throughout the entire period under review, but was still high at 19.8 percent in the second quarter
of 2016. In Albania and Serbia the rates fell to about 10 percent, while Montenegro observed an
uneven development. In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo, which do not provide quarterly
data, the long-term unemployment rate also decreased in 2015/2016. These developments compare
well with the peer countries (which reported much lower rates, however), with the exception of
Austria, where the long-term unemployment rate increased slightly to 2.5 percent in the second
quarter of 2016. The incidence of long-term unemployment was higher for women than for men
throughout the reporting period in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo as well as in
Croatia between 2013 and 2015. In all other countries men were more affected by long-term
unemployment than women.

More than half of the total long-term unemployed in the Western Balkan countries (and in the EU
peer countries) are men. Their share has been even increasing over recent years in the Western
Balkans, except in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia where it either fell or stagnated (Figure 19). In
both the Western Balkans and in the EU peer countries, the proportion of older people in the total
number of long-term unemployed increased since 2010, while the share of the young people was on
the decline.

Long-term unemployment rates are highest for the young people and lowest for the older. This
resembles the patterns for the EU peer countries: Bulgaria, Croatia and Hungary. It differs, however,
to the situation in Austria, where the oldest age group is most affected by long-term unemployment.
Among the young, long-term unemployment affects men more than women in Albania, Montenegro
and FYR Macedonia, while the reverse applies in Serbia and particularly in Kosovo. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which reports the highest long-term unemployment rates, both sexes are equally
affected. With regard to the prime age group, the picture is somewhat different: long-term
unemployment is more prevalent among women in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo,
while men are more affected in FYR Macedonia. In Albania and Montenegro there is no difference in
the incidence of long-term unemployment between men and women. The oldest age group shows a
uniform picture for all countries in the region, with men more likely to be affected.

High and persistent shares of long-term unemployment illustrate the structural nature of
unemployment in the Western Balkans. Those affected run the risk of a degradation of skills,
declining motivation to find a job, and possiblythe exiting the official labor market altoghether in the
logn run. The problem of long-term unemployment is much more severe in the Western Balkans
than in the peer countries, with the proportion of those affected far higher and of a long-term
nature.


6. Special Spotlight: The impact of growth on
   labor markets
The relationship between economic growth, employment and unemployment dynamics is among
the most challenging issues in the Western Balkan economies. The international financial crisis
severely hit the economies of Western Balkan countries. The effect was so strong that the GDP
growth rates of the Western Balkans contracted on average16 by more than 6 percentage points:
from an average real GDP growth rate of 5.3 percent prior to 2009, down to -1.5 percent in 2009. In
parallel, unemployment rates increased on average by 4.7 percentage points and employment levels
dropped by 2.7 percent. On average, the labor force participation rate dropped by 1 percentage
point, down to 51% in 2009. Similarly, the EU-CEE economies were also hit hard by the international
financial crisis, with the economies of this region contracting by 2.6 percent in 2009.

The post-recession period, 2011-2015, was shaped by GDP growth that recovered slowly and
strengthened slightly from 2013. This protracted recession and the weak economic growth have
been accompanied by particularly meagre effects on employment growth in the Western Balkans,
though a rebound was observed from 2014. For the EU-CEE countries, performance in terms of
growth and its effect on employment was low, with GDP growth rates ranging between -3 percent
and +3.8 percent in the Western Balkans (like, for example, in FYR Macedonia) and between -3

percent and 5 percent in EU-CEE countries (like in Poland). The effects on employment were modest
at 0.5 percent on average in the Western Balkans and 0.2 percent in EU-CEE.

In the following section, the relationship between employment, unemployment and GDP growth
is examined in detail. In particular, it compares Western Balkan countries with EU-CEE countries
which have undergone similar transitional transformations. Specifically, so-called ‘employment
elasticities’ to changes in output are estimated for different sub-periods, indicating how strongly
employment growth reacts to GDP growth (see Box 3 for a methodological explanation). Though this
method has some limitations it allows an assessment of the quantitative response of employment to
GDP growth. These limitations mostly arise: from measuring labor input in the LFS (that is, not
properly capturing the movement of informal labor); or from the omission of other variables which
might affect employment, volatility or fluctuations over time; or from a relatively small number of
observations for different sub- periods (see also IMF, 2014).

For the Western Balkan countries, the employment-GDP growth relationship was only positive and
significant for the period 2006-2010. During this time, employment growth reacted positively to
GDP growth with an elasticity of 0.4 (that is, a one percentage point increase in GDP growth is
related to a 0.4 percentage point increase in employment growth). However, for the subsequent
period from 2011 to 2015, this positive relationship was no longer significant (see Table 4 and Figure
20).17 A positive and significant employment-GDP growth relationship is also confirmed for the EU-
CEE countries, especially during the 2001 to 2005 period when it was exceptionally high at 0.61. The
relationship was also strong in the other periods, with elasticities between 0.35 to 0.4. In principle,
one would expect a stronger growth-employment relationship in the Western Balkans because the
higher levels of unemployment should result in higher labor supply elasticities; however, in reality,
no such relation has been observed after the crisis for the Western Balkan countries. Generally, the
meagre recovery rate both in the Western Balkans and EU-CEE has been insufficient to generate new
jobs. Instead, labor productivity growth might have benefited at the expense of employment
growth, for example through investments in new technologies rather than creating new jobs.

Despite the positive link between growth and employment, a higher GDP growth was needed in
the Western Balkans than in the EU-CEE to keep the employment levels constant. Usually, positive
GDP growth rates combined with an employment elasticity below one but greater than zero tend to
be associated with both employment and labor productivity growth, and at the same time higher
employment than labor productivity growth. As argued by Kahn (2001), less developed economies
need high employment elasticities of around 0.7 and GDP growth rates of 5 percent in order to be
able to generate employment growth above labor force growth. Therefore, as the Western Balkans
are labor abundant economies, a higher threshold GDP growth is required to ensure that
employment levels remain constant.

     The employment-GDP growth relationship was found to be insignificant also for 2001-2005 period but such results suffer
     from the small number of observations.

                                 Specifically in the Western Balkan countries, a threshold GDP growth rate of almost 4 percent
                                 might be needed to keep the employment level stable. This threshold growth rate is lower in the
                                 EU-CEE countries where a GDP growth of 2.2 percent has been sufficient to keep employment at a
                                 constant level. This indicates that the Western Balkan countries have needed much higher GDP
                                 growth rates to achieve positive employment growth.

                                      The employment-GDP growth relationship is analyzed over the periods 2000-2010 and 2011-2015 separately for the
                                      Western Balkan countries (Kosovo is not included) and eight EU-CEE countries. The dependent variable is the growth rate
                                      in employment levels between time t and t-1. The independent variable corresponds to real GDP growth rate at time t. The
                                      employment elasticity of growth has been estimated running panel data regressions counting for country fixed effect.

With regard to the relationship between the unemployment rate and GDP growth, an increase in
the GDP growth rate of 1 percentage point was accompanied by a 0.37 percentage point decline in
the unemployment rate in the Western Balkans and a 0.25 percentage point decline for the CEE
countries for the 2001-2010 period. In the subsequent period, the relationship between the
negative unemployment rate and GDP growth was confirmed for the EU-CEE but not for the
Western Balkans. For the latter, the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth was a
0.36 percentage points decrease in the unemployment rate (see Table 3 and Figure 21).

In conclusion, the positive relationship between employment and GDP growth, which was
observed in both the EU-CEE and Western Balkans before and during the recession, seems to be
less discernible during the recovery period. In particular, the impact of growth on employment, but

     The dependent variable is the unemployment rate change between time t and t-1. The independent variable is
     corresponding real GDP growth rate at time t. We have been running panel data counting for country fixed effect.
                                                                                              P a g e | 25


also unemployment, remained inconclusive during the recovery period, which has been
characterized by modest or jobless growth in the Western Balkans.

 Box 3 / Estimating the employment and unemployment elasticity of growth

 The relationship between the growth of output and employment is analyzed by estimating panel
 regressions including country fixed effects. This shows the employment elasticity of growth, i.e. the
 sensitivity of employment growth on output growth. Formally, the following specification is estimated:

                             EMPgrowthit = β0 + β1 GDPgrowthit +  + εit

 where EMPgrowthit denotes the annual growth rates of employment and real GDP, respectively. The
 regression has been estimated for the two groups of countries separately. Based on the estimated
 coefficients, the (average) hypothetical threshold GDP growth, i.e. the GDP growth rate that would be
 required to keep employment unchanged, can be calculated by setting employment growth to zero and
 rearranging:

                                                                   β0
                                     GDPgrowth_thresholdit = −
                                                                   β1

 The following specification is used to test the relationship between the change in the unemployment rates
 and GDP growth (known as Okun’s law) for the Western Balkan countries in comparison with the EU-CEE:

                              UNRchangeit = β0 + β1 GDPgrowthit + + εit

 where GDPgrowthit denotes the growth rate of real GDP and UNRchangeit is the change in the
 unemployment rates in percentage points. The regression is estimated by running fixed effect regressions
 for the two periods separately for the Western Balkans and CEE countries.

 The (average) GDP growth rate that would be required to keep unemployment rate from rising can be
 calculated by setting unemployment rate change to zero and rearranging:

                                                                   β0
                                     GDPgrowth_thresholdit = −
                                                                   β1

7. Conclusions
This report shows that a few harmonized labor market indicators can contribute significantly to
the understanding of labor market trends and main drivers of results. All the analyses in this report
have been carried out using the harmonized indicators for the Western Balkans and selected EU
countries, which are available at the SEE Jobs Gateway website (http://SEEJobsGateway.net). Most
notably, it was possible to calculate from the database that roughly 300,000 jobs have been created
in the Western Balkans since 2010. The analysis of the key labor market indicators also shows that
unemployment declined slightly (from 23 to 21 percent), and that the winners of the recent recovery
were adults close to retirement age and the highly educated, while the losers continued to be the
low-educated, especially the low-educated youth.

The analysis of the impact of growth on employment indicates that the jobs challenge in the
Western Balkans is structural, and growth alone—at least at current growth levels—will not be
sufficient to create enough jobs. No significant impact of growth on employment was observed in
the aftermath of the financial crisis in the Western Balkans, and the impact of growth on
unemployment is small. The Western Balkan countries have not yet returned to a situation where
economic growth will translate into significant jobs growth; the transition to modern market
economies is not yet complete, and many structural issues remain to be addressed.

On the labor supply side, there is a need to strengthen employment policies and the effectiveness
of intermediation in the labor market. All Western Balkan countries have embarked on a journey to
model their public employment services (PES) and active labor market programs (ALMPs) after good
practices in EU countries. The European Commission is committed to supporting the Western Balkan
countries in these efforts, as outlined in various Economic Reform Programmes (see, for example,
Government of the Republic of Kosovo, 2016). This means that active labor market programs—
ranging from training to start-up support, wage subsidies, and public works—need to be better
designed and targeted. This applies especially for the most vulnerable and the youth, as the latter
represent a profitable investment from a fiscal perspective. The capacities of PES to implement
these programs, but also to match employment seekers with job vacancies faster and more
efficiently, needs to be further developed. Furthermore, the potential of private providers to
intermediate and implement programs needs be tapped into.

On the labor demand side, there is a need to further strengthen competitiveness, while also
enabling new segments in the labor market to flourish. Most countries have made great strides
towards better investment climates, but more needs to be done to change the growth model of the
Western Balkans from one that relies on domestic consumption to one that relies on exports and
investments (World Bank 2014). However, the high level of informal employment, even outside
agriculture, indicates that it is also necessary to unlock the potential of certain segments in the labor
market that do not currently operate in the formal sector. This requires deregulation and tax
reforms to foster a new labor market that also allows for flexible, low-paying part-time jobs—
atypical and sometimes precarious jobs, but jobs that might be more accessible for the most
vulnerable groups, such as the low-educated, as well as women seeking part-time opportunities
(Koettl 2012).
                                                                                           P a g e | 27


Finally, this report has shown that an increase in the quantity and quality of the data is an
important step towards strengthening our knowledge on the Western Balkans labor market—but
better data and more research are still needed. The new regional database is a first attempt and
comprises a limited, but important number of key labor market indicators to fill this knowledge gap.
For the future, it will be important to maintain this database and ensure that it is up-to-date, as well
as expanding it to include more data, like on informal employment, atypical employment, wages,
economic sector, and occupation data. The data should be easily accessible not only to policy makers
and academics, but also to the general public, including journalists and advocacy groups. Finally, the
data should inspire more research on how the Western Balkan countries can overcome their many
labor market challenges.

Statistical Annex
The tables in the statistical annex provide data on key economic indicators as well as labor market
indicators, according to the labor force survey (LFS) methodology for the six Western Balkan
countries and for four EU peer countries.



Disclaimer

All data presented in this report and online have been collected directly from national statistical
offices of the six Western Balkan countries and Eurostat, with the objective of harmonizing data as
much as possible across countries. The data have been collected in the framework of the SEE Jobs
Gateway and, as such, are not official World Bank estimates.



SEE Jobs Gateway Database

All time series presented in the Statistical Annex are available in the SEE Jobs Gateway Database at
http://SEEJobsGateway.net.

This database covers a unique and detailed set of labor market indicators based on LFS data for the
Western Balkan countries. The dataset is harmonized across indicators, age groups and educational
attainment. Overall, the database covers three parts: I. Key economic indicators, II. Labor market
indicators, and III. Labor market data on a sub-national level.

The database contains both raw and derived statistics. The underlying basic employment data (in
thousand persons) are provided by the statistical offices on a quarterly basis (raw data, 3 decimal
places). All rates and shares on a quarterly basis have been calculated based on these raw data.
Annual data (in thousand persons) provided in the database are calculated as the average of the
available observations on a quarterly basis. All annual rates and shares provided are then calculated
out of these annual averages. In case of missing quarters, annual data are partly estimated (and
correspondingly flagged). Future updates of the database will seek to remedy this. Further flags in
the database are used to symbolize if the data are less accurate or inaccurate and should allow for a
careful interpretation of the data.

Major breaks in series:
The LFS in the Western Balkans have steadily improved and are harmonized with EU and ILO
definitions, implying that breaks in the time series are unavoidable. Most of the breaks in the series
occur for any of the following reasons: change in survey design, change in survey questionnaire,
change survey frequency, revisions of the data series based on updated population census results for
2011, and reclassification of education attainment. Specifically, the following changes affect the
comparability over time and across countries for the data series:

   Introduction of a continuous quarterly survey producing quarterly results: Albania from 2012
    (before 2012 the survey was carried out once a year – 2010: Sept-Oct, 2011: July – Sept), Serbia
                                                                                       P a g e | 31


    from 2015 (in 2010-2013 the survey was carried out twice a year in April and October, in 2014 a
    quarterly survey with a fixed reference week was conducted).
    Amendment: In Bosnia and Herzegovina the survey is still carried out once a year in April. In
    Kosovo the survey is already based on a continuous quarterly survey; so far the data are
    available on an annual basis only and start from 2012.

   Updated population census results 2011: Albania and Montenegro from 2011 (data 2010 are not
    fully comparable), Serbia from 2013 (low impact on growth rates in comparison to the previous
    year).
    Amendment: In Bosnia and Herzegovina the 2013 census is not yet applied; in Macedonia the
    2002 census is applied.
   Methodological change in survey: Serbia from 2014 (2014 is a recalculation of the changes
    initially introduced in 2015: enlarged sample size, continuous survey, new data collection
    system – data are not comparable with the previous year).
   Ecucational attainment: Indicators showing the educational attainment are based on the
    International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 1997 or ISCED 2011). In the following
    tables as well as in the SEE Jobs Gateway Database the definition of low skilled, medium skill
    and high skilled refer to ISCED 2011. Any deviations are described in the metadata.

In the SEE Jobs Gateway Database, all methodological breaks in time series and definitions are
defined in the metadata.



Western Balkans-6 aggregate:
This country grouping is the sum of the six countries only when data for all these countries are
available. Time series therefore start from 2012 (because data for Kosovo are not available prior to
this). The methodological break in Serbia (2013/2014) is therefore reflected in the aggregate. The
Western Balkan-6 aggregate data are only available on an annual basis.

Conventional signs:

Notes: For country-specific methodological notes on employment see footnotes to the following tables. The figure for Albanian
employment growth in 2011 disregards the break due to census 2011, however, the growth rate seems to be plausible. The Serbian
employment growth in 2014 is comparable according to the previously applied methodology. Western Balkans-6: Employment data reflect
the sum of the six countries only when data for all countries are available, break for Serbia in 2014 considered. GDP growth rates are
weighted averages, inflation is a simple average.

Notes:
In 2010 and 2011 the labor force survey was carried out once a year (2010: Sept-Oct, 2011: July-Sept), continuous quarterly survey
thereafter. Census 2011 is applied from 2011, data 2010 are therefore not fully comparable. Education groups refer to ISCED 1997.

Notes:
Data are based on a continuous quarterly survey, but are available on an annual basis only. The dataset for Kosovo excludes persons
without any school education and therefore slightly deviates from the officially published data in the LFS publications. Census 2011 is
applied throughout. Education groups refer to ISCED 1997.

Notes:
Labor market data for the Western Balkans is the sum of six countries only when data for all these countries are available. Time series
therefore start from 2012 (because data for Kosovo are not available prior to this). The methodological break in Serbia in (2013/2014) is
therefore reflected in this aggregate. The Western Balkan-6 aggregate data are only available on an annual basis.

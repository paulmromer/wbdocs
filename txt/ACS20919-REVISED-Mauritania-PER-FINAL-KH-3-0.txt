Executive Summary


1.      Mauritania’s economic growth has been largely driven by high commodity prices, leaving the
country vulnerable to shocks. From 2009 to 2015, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an
average of 4.2 percent a year, primarily driven by rising commodity prices. The value of its exports more
than doubled between 2009 and 2013. The mining boom and extensive foreign investment in the sector
have boosted growth in the construction, utilities, transport, and communications sectors while
agriculture and fisheries have fallen behind. Growth has been dominated by capital formation, with total
public and private investment averaging 28 percent of GDP over the period 2000–14. The end of the
commodity “super-cycle? in the second half of 2014 and the collapse in iron ore prices have slowed
growth. In addition, Mauritania has also suffered a series of domestic and external shocks shaping its
budgetary outcomes, notably a political crisis in 2008/09, a drought in 2011, a refugee crisis in 2012, and
increasing threats from Islamic terrorism.
2.       Despite this, Mauritania has seen a remarkable reduction in poverty between 2008 and 2014
from 44.5 percent to 33.0 percent. This decline is much larger than in previous periods and it’s also
higher than comparator countries. In addition, the Gini Index decreased from 35.2 in 2008 to 31.9 in
2014, suggesting a decrease in inequality as well. The decline in poverty is driven by developments in
rural areas, notably increased productivity, prices and incomes in the irrigated agriculture and livestock
sectors. Urban areas have seen less of a reduction in poverty, with Nouakchott actually experiencing an
increase. The very poor have done particularly well over the period – extreme poverty was essentially
halved, from 10.8 to 5.6 percent. Progress has also been achieved on non-monetary measures of
wellbeing such as literacy rates, school enrollment, child mortality nutrition and overall living standards
including access to electricity and increase in asset ownership such as home ownership, car, telephone,
television, fridge, etc. In addition, subjective perceptions of poverty have improved: while 79 percent
considered themselves poor in 2008, only 61.2 percent felt the same way in 2014. The 2016 World Bank
Poverty Assessment finds that recent growth has been pro-poor - Mauritania had the fourth highest
poverty elasticity to GDP growth in Africa, after South Africa, Madagascar and Botswana.
3.       Public Financial Management reforms have brought some results in recent years . Notably,
budget execution has been improved; tax reforms led to significant increased revenues; a new
procurement law and institutions have increased controls; undocumented salary payments were
eliminated; land titles for Nouakchott were scanned and verified; and most public financial information
systems are now in place. However, many of the reforms will need to be fully implemented in order to
bring about the desired impact. Budget execution needs to be accompanied by greater budget
credibility and the reduction of discretionary expenditure; second stage tax reforms should focus on
broadening the tax base; the land registry is still dysfunctional and complex, and most poor people are
unable to obtain land titles; finally, the various Government Financial Management Information Systems
are not fully integrated, leading to incomplete administrative or financial data which again limits its use
in effectively monitoring budget implementation.
4.       Tax reforms have not been enough to offset the effect of falling commodity prices. Domestic
revenues have been volatile in the last five years, raising concerns over the government’s ability to use
fiscal policy to cushion the impact of shocks and ensure macro stability. Tax is the largest source of
revenue in Mauritania, and tax reforms since 2011 have boosted government revenues from just over
12 percent of GDP to 17.4 percent on average in 2012-15. However, they have not been enough to stave
off the severe decline in domestic revenues that began with the end of the super-cycle. Official
development assistance is high in per capita terms, but this can also be a volatile source of finance. The

                                                    1
national oil fund was created to help insulate expenditure against volatile commodity prices, but weak
governance could limit its effectiveness.
5.       Public spending has increased steadily between 2009 and 2015 . Domestic financing is the
primary source of social spending, while most foreign assistance is directed towards infrastructure.
Although the government has strengthened its human resource management systems in recent years,
the official wage bill represents almost half of Mauritania’s tax receipts—the actual share would be even
higher as the payroll excludes temporary workers. The large parastatal sector imposes a significant
burden on the national budget, with transfers and subsidies rising from US$17.2 million in 2005 to over
US$240 million in 2013 and dividend payments decreasing to 3.4 percent of revenues in 2015 and
estimated 2.3 percent in 2016 from a high of 16.5 percent of revenues in 2012. Government guarantees
for SOEs debt reached 9 percent of GDP. The government lacks the capacity to monitor the financial and
technical performance of these SOEs and Agencies and to push for corporate governance reforms where
necessary.
6.       Budget execution has improved as actual spending has started to match budgeted amounts
more closely in recent years. However, the overall figures disguise much greater discrepancies in
individual line items, with significant variance even in relatively straightforward areas such as debt
servicing. Public spending on social sectors remains below regional levels, health and social affairs grew,
while the share of justice and sector ministries declined. However, a large share of expenditure remains
discretionary and unidentified: 30 percent of total expenditures are reported as “unspecified expenses?
and are not classified by economic category, which greatly complicates public expenditure monitoring
and proper expenditure recording. Mauritania should enhance the transparency and quality of its fiscal
data by: (i) auditing the national oil fund, (ii) increase budget credibility and discipline by minimizing
“unspecified expenses? and by properly recording all expenditures (iii) reviewing public-sector staffing
(iv) keeping its public financial database (BOOST) up to date to reflect its original and revised budgets,
and (v) strengthening financial oversight of SOEs through regular performance monitoring and
publication of annual financial audits.
7.       Even if commodity prices recover, structural reform will be needed to avoid unsustainable
deficits. Without reforms to widen the tax base, losses due to declining commodity prices and lower
growth will lead to unsustainable deficits. Even if prices improve somewhat, the deficit is likely to
remain above the debt stabilization threshold of 4.1 percent of GDP. The government will need to rein in
spending, especially the wage bill and transfers, and expand the tax base by (i) reviewing its current tax,
expenditure, and fiscal incentive regime; and (ii) developing a program to increase existing revenue
sources and find new sources that are less volatile and dependent on extractives.
8.       With the total public and publicly guaranteed debt-to-GDP ratio projected to reach 91 percent
of GDP by end-2016, Mauritania is at high risk of debt distress. Mauritania’s debt sustainability path is
highly sensitive to GDP growth and changes in the external environment. However, the concessional
nature of the debt stock1, with low debt service obligations and long maturities, mitigates these risks.
Also, public investment has been critical in stimulating growth and reducing poverty, especially through
infrastructure in rural areas. However, its high level remains a major concern for macro instability and
no major cuts are foreseen. Implementation of the government's fiscal consolidation program will be
vital to ensure medium-term debt sustainability, but institutional weaknesses could prevent successful
implementation. The recent merger of the ministries of economy and finance, and the installation of
the debt information opens the door for promising programmatic reforms in the area of debt
management.

1
    The net present value of the public debt stock is estimated at 56.8 percent of GDP due to the concessional nature of the debt.

                                                                  2
9.      Mauritania’s investment budget has increased significantly between 2010 and 2015 from 5.4
to 14.2 percent of GDP. High mineral prices have allowed the country to more than double domestic
funding for investment, and it is now on par with investments from external resources. The execution
rate of the investment budget has also improved considerably from 62 to 85 percent over the period,
driven by the high execution rate of the domestically financed portion. While roads, ports, and water
continue to receive the bulk of investment, there have also been significant increases in other areas
such as industrial development which almost quadrupled and rural development which doubled.
Investment in human development (health, education, justice, and culture) has also increased but it
continues to be underfunded relative to the country’s needs. Almost half of externally funded
investment goes on basic infrastructure (electricity, housing, roads and water). However, investment
budget expenditures are not easily categorized. As with current expenditures, the largest share of the
investment budget expenditures (26 percent) is not categorized at all.
10.     Less progress has been made with public investment management (PIM). Like in the previous
PIM assessment carried out in 2010 there are still few formal project appraisals unless carried out by
development partners, no independent reviews of project appraisals, and no clear criteria for including
projects in the national budget. Government strategies only inform the investment budget in a limited
manner. Indeed, project selection seems to work in reverse: the government first seeks funding for a
project, and then adjusts its Public Investment Program and Budget (PIP/BCI) to include it once the
funding is secured. There is little coordination with recurrent budget planning to ensure there is enough
money to run the facilities after completion. Poor coordination amongst institutions involved in
investment budget preparation and implementation has led to a lack of data and analysis, and weak
oversight and monitoring of public investment projects, which could lower their returns. The 2016
merger of the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) and the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) provides an opportunity to bring greater coherence to investment budget preparation
and monitoring as well as to public investment management.
11.     Despite rapidly growing public investment expenditures, their impact on Mauritania’s
economic growth has been lower than expected. The overall quality of its infrastructure is low, which
can act as a drag on productivity growth, therefore getting a higher return on its public investments will
be increasingly important as Mauritania’s fiscal space shrinks. An analysis of the macroeconomic impact
of the PIP for 2014-16—estimated to cost MRO 615 billion (US$ 2 billion2), or 11-14 percent of GDP per
annum—finds its impact on economic growth to be around 3.2 percent of GDP, while the initial impact
on prices and imports is modest. The PIP is financially and economically viable, as long as financing
continues to be obtained largely on concessionary terms, and the financial internal rate of return is
expected to be around 6 percent while the economy-wide rate of return is 14 percent. However, poor
project management, cost overruns, delays and other forms of wastage (including corruption) could
reduce returns to zero, limiting its impact and leaving it financially unviable.
12.    Public investment could be made more efficient by clearly prioritizing public expenditures,
and improving monitoring and evaluation. Areas for reform include (i) improving investment budget
and project data, (ii) developing a clear strategy for public investments based on an understanding of
the economic and social impacts and financial viability, (iii) improving investment project preparation
and preliminary appraisal, (vi) clarifying roles and considering introducing an independent review of
investment decisions, and (vi) monitoring and supporting project implementation. The Bank’s first
development policy operation is supporting the authorities’ ongoing reforms to the PIM system, notably
by creating the institutional framework for evaluating, selecting and executing public investment

projects and through the preparation of a first integrated public investment budget with combined
domestic and foreign financed projects.
13.      Recent public procurement reforms have only brought about limited results. In 2010
Mauritania modernized its procurement system to make the system more transparent, efficient, and
accountable in accordance with international standards. It set up several new public agencies to
separate procurement, control and regulation, and a recent assessment found that the legislative
framework of the procurement system was relatively strong, but that the system had room for
improvement in other areas. The new agencies lack leadership and coordination, their procedures are
not always well designed, efficiency is hampered by a lack of capacity among staff, and there are
weaknesses in both internal and external audit. The risk of fraud and corruption in procurement is high.
The procurement process should be improved by (i) consolidating the public procurement code and
adopting a comprehensive set of regulations, (ii) increasing the efficiency and transparency of the
independent procurement bodies, (iii) developing the capacity of public and private stakeholders, and
(iv) putting in place effective oversight mechanisms.
14.      Participation in primary and secondary education have increased—with 90 percent of both
boys and girls now attending primary education. Achievement continues to be low, suggesting
inefficiencies in the system and adult literacy rates have barely improved. Mauritania suffers from a
shortage of qualified teachers and frequent changes in curriculum and education policies. Although
spending has risen to 3.2 percent of GDP, it is still low for the region except at primary level, which
receives about half of all education funding, and investment is concentrated in the tertiary sector. The
poorest children receive the least benefit from education spending, with only 2 percent of those from
the poorest quintile completing secondary education. Spending per student is also biased towards the
wealthier regions.
15.      Redistributing education spending could help to raise quality and effectiveness . Over
80 percent of recurrent spending goes to salaries, rising to 96 percent at primary level, and half of all
investment has been concentrated on tertiary education. Key areas for reform include: (i) improving
school quantity and quality to meet the priority goal of universal primary education, including spending
more on maintenance and teacher training, and enforcing teachers’ attendance in the classroom; (ii)
addressing equity issues to ensure students of all socio-economic backgrounds at least pass the primary
certificate; (iii) strengthening the vocational education and training sector, including increasing
resources for basic vocational and literacy programs for those who dropped out of education; (iv)
reviewing the current scholarship program to target low-income students and tertiary courses with high
employment potential; and (v) investing in the education information management system to make it
functional.
16.      Mauritania’s progress on meeting its health goals has been solid but unequal access remains
an issue. Vaccination coverage has improved, malnutrition fallen to below the 2015 Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) target, and child and maternal mortality rates have improved, although more
than half of all babies in rural areas are still delivered without skilled care. However, government health
priorities are not entirely reflected in spending allocations. Health spending, including on primary care,
has risen from a low base in recent years but remains below average and unequal distribution of
spending and health care staff is likely to exacerbate health inequalities. The poor and rural households
have the least access to health care facilities. Private spending and health insurance are becoming
increasingly significant while donor funding—which has largely funded preventative health programs—
declines.
17.       As budget constraints take hold, devolution and prioritization of health spending will be
critical. Key areas of reform for the government will be to: (i) prepare a universal health coverage policy

                                                    4
focusing on protecting people from financial risks, improving the quality of health services, and
addressing external health risk factors such as smoking; (ii) improving health care staffing levels by
recruiting and retaining skilled health workers through an attractive incentive scheme; (iii) reinforcing
the most cost-effective interventions, putting more emphasis on outcomes rather than inputs, and
concentrating on those healthcare interventions with the greatest possible benefits, such as maternal
care and preventable diseases; (iv) strengthening budget management; and (v) reviewing its
accountability mechanisms.
18.     The irrigated and mechanized agriculture and livestock sectors have seen increased
productivity, prices and incomes in recent years. This is in fact one of the principal drivers of the
dramatic reduction in rural poverty since 2008. However, the impact of public programs in agriculture
could be improved. Although the government has produced an agriculture strategy, it faces challenges
in mobilizing the investment it needs to implement it and spending is increasingly dependent on donor
funding. Public investment has increased to make up three-quarters of the sector budget, but it remains
below estimated needs to further increase agricultural productivity. Subsidies introduced in the wake of
a severe drought in 2011 averted a potential humanitarian crisis but some elements of the program —
including the Boutiques Emel, selling subsidized food—have continued after the emergency has passed.
Weak capacity and a top-heavy centralized administration have affected the quality of service delivery
to farmers.
19.      Better targeting of subsidies and more cost-effective administration could free up resources
for productive investments. The government has recently adopted a decree eliminating rice subsidies.
This provides an opportunity to implement a new approach to agriculture including: (i) developing a
transition strategy from a publicly controlled market system to a market-oriented one; (ii) assessing the
impact on the poor of eliminating rice subsidies and designing measures to mitigate it; (iii) reviewing
options for time-bound smart subsidies, targeted as effectively as possible at resource-poor farmers; (iv)
gradually closing the Boutiques Emel and reprioritizing safety-net interventions aimed at the poorest
populations; (v) increasing sustainable investments in the agriculture sector with the resources freed up
from winding down subsidies; (vi) encouraging private-sector investment through public-private
partnerships; (vii) fully deconcentrating farmers’ extension and advisory services; and (viii) effectively
monitoring and evaluating all public expenditures and programs.
20.     Mauritania has made significant progress in increasing and diversifying the supply of energy
but access for rural populations remain a challenge. Mauritania has gone from chronic electricity
shortages in 2008 to generating an exportable surplus in 2014, with renewables making up 16 percent of
total capacity. Although access to energy has improved it remains below the Sub-Saharan Africa
average, with only 4 percent of the rural access. Subsidized electricity and free butane gas were
intended to give low-income households access to clean energy, but have instead largely benefited
higher income segments. With high fuel cost, the electricity tariff sells energy below cost, subsidizing
consumers who could pay more and creating a drain on the sector, contributing to substantial financial
losses of the national electricity company, SOMELEC, which also suffers from weak management and
corporate governance.
21.     The government has become dependent on external assistance for investment, creating
problems of planning, coordination and insufficient consideration of ongoing maintenance costs. A
very small proportion of the investment has benefited rural electrification. Reforms of the sector should
concentrate on (i) urgently reducing SOMELEC technical and commercial losses, (ii) reducing reliance on
imported fuel oil by investing in alternative energy sources and pushing ahead with the Banda gas to
power project, (iii) revising SOMELEC’s tariff structure, (iv) targeting subsidies to mitigate the impact of
revised tariffs on the poor, (v) promoting rural electrification, (vi) developing electricity networks

                                                     5
particularly in the Senegal River Valley, (vii) improving SOMELEC’s governance and management, and
(viii) encouraging public-private partnerships for investments in new infrastructure.
22.      The exact costs of implementing the recommendations outlined in this report are difficult to
estimate. Some recommendations could imply very significant costs, such as improving school quantity
and quality, addressing equity issue in education, or increasing funding for vocational training.
Mitigation measures to protect the poor for an eventual electricity tariff revision could also be costly.
But the exact costs would depend on the scale of implementation. In reality, the authorities would need
to conduct further work to determine the realistic levels of expanding certain programs or services and
given their own fiscal constraints. Yet again, many recommendations that could have a significant
impact would imply little or no costs, and many are already financed by the authorities or donors.
Others, such as the phasing out of the boutiques Emel would imply significant savings of around 1-2
percent of GDP. This is also the case for a review and adjustment of the scholarship program for higher
education, which would generate savings that could be used to expand vocational training for example.
Many of recommendations require reallocations within sectors and might not imply overall increases to
the sectoral budget allocation. A list of all 42 recommendations, as well as their costs/fiscal implications
are included as an annex (Annex A5) to this report.

Recent Growth Has Largely Been Driven by High Commodity Prices…
1.      Mauritania’s growth has been generally robust in the last six years. From 2009 to 2015, real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 percent a year, on a par with Sub-Saharan Africa.
With an annual population growth averaging 2.5 percent, GDP per capita has risen by 5.9 percent per
year, a notable improvement from the 90s when GDP growth averaged only 2.7 percent, thus
preventing any improvement in per capita GDP. However, this growth has continued to be volatile, due
to a combination of droughts, political instability, and price shocks in extractive industries (Figure 1.1).

2.       Mauritania’s stronger growth performance has been driven primarily by the rising value of its
mineral exports. The rising prices of commodities,3 particularly between 2009 and 2013, has led to a
jump in the value of its exports4 from MRO 265 billion (US$ 883 million) to MRO 646 billion (US$ 2.1
billion), and to substantive gains in the country’s terms of trade despite generally stagnating
production5. Driven by the mining boom, non-tradable domestic sectors, such as construction, utilities,
transport, and communications have been the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Taken together,
these sectors have grown at an annual rate of almost 6.2 percent since 2009.6 Meanwhile, agriculture
and fisheries have made the largest contribution to GDP growth due to their overall size, despite having
grown more slowly than the economy as a whole. Their share of GDP has fallen steadily from 31.8

percent in 2009 to 29.9 percent in 2014.7 The small manufacturing sector (7.2 percent of GDP)
maintained its share of the economy during that period.
3.      Extensive foreign investment in mining and the expansion of the construction sector mean
Mauritania’s GDP growth has been dominated by capital formation, which has increased almost three
times as fast as consumption. The ratio of investment to GDP has grown significantly from less than
43.6 percent in 2009 to over 61 percent in 2014.8 It averaged 28 percent of GDP over the period 2000–
14, well above the averages for Sub-Saharan Africa (19 percent) and North Africa (22 percent). Private
investment, driven by foreign inflows, has increased even faster than public investment. Mauritania
broadly reflects trends in Sub-Saharan Africa, which displays a greater dependence on capital than any
other region in the world. With the end of the commodity super-cycle9 in the second half of 2014 and
the collapse of iron ore prices,10 pressures on growth have started to appear in Mauritania. In 2015,
economic activity slowed down and GDP growth is now estimated at a mere 3 percent. If not addressed,
this combination of slower growth, an undiversified economy and external shocks from low
international commodity prices is expected to have a detrimental effect on macro and fiscal stability.

... Leaving Budgets Vulnerable to External and Domestic Shocks
4.        Mauritania’s budgetary outcome has been largely shaped by a series of domestic and external
shocks. Between 2009 and 2015, the budget deficit fluctuated between -4.9 percent of GDP and -0.1
percent (Table 1.1). Many domestic shocks have led to this outcome. These include the violent political
crisis in 2008/09 that saw a withdrawal of donor support, and the drought in 2011 that reduced harvests
by more than 50 percent causing an acute food crisis and pushing the government to launch the
National Solidarity and Emel Programs. Together these initiatives ended up costing 150 billionn MRO
during 2011-15 (US$500 million), equivalent to 7 percent of expenditures over the period. Regional
instability compounded these challenges. The Malian refugee crisis in 2012 and the rise of the terrorist
network, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), in the remote desert areas11 has added further
budget pressure on both security and emergency relief spending. External shocks have also dominated
the economy. The end of the commodity super-cycle and the sharp drop in the international prices of
iron, copper, and oil have had a severe impact on domestic revenues. This has led to a worsening deficit,
notably in 2014 and 2015, which is threatening the macroeconomic stability of the country. Even the
budget surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 was largely due to a one-time receipt of large fishing
royalties (4.0 percent of GDP) and of donor grants (1.6 percent of GDP) to support the humanitarian
needs of Malian refugees.

5.      The volatile fiscal position raises concerns over the ability of Mauritanian fiscal policy to
reduce the impact of shocks and ensure macro stability. With a high concentration of domestic
revenues coming from the mining and oil sectors, and intermittent pressures on public spending to cope
with security and emergency situations, fiscal policy has so far been reactive and failed to build much-
needed fiscal buffers. Given the likelihood of a reduced fiscal envelope in the future, the emphasis must
be on mobilizing revenue and improving the quality of spending so as to ensure a sustainable growth
and achieve Mauritania’s development objectives. In the sections that follow, this chapter examines
revenue and expenditure trends, and identifies rigidities in the Mauritanian fiscal policy. It then looks at
the medium-term fiscal outlook in a post super-cycle environment and highlights the need for a more
proactive fiscal policy to ensure macro stability. Box 1.1 briefly covers issues of data and governance.

Tax Reforms Have Brought Results, But Not Enough to Offset the Effect of Falling Commodity
Prices
6.      Domestic revenues have been volatile in the past five years. Between 2009 and 2015, domestic
revenues fluctuated between 20.4 and 31.2 percent of GDP, rising sharply in 2012 as exports prices
spiked and improvements in tax administration boosted collection rates (Table 1.2). Tax is the largest
source of revenue in Mauritania. It consists primarily of taxes on goods and services (50.3 percent) and
income taxes (32.5 percent).12 Taxes on goods and services are linked to the development in the
extractives sector as they encompass both a unique tax and a value-added tax (VAT) on the imports of
the National Mining Company (Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière de Mauritanie; SNIM), and a tax
related to petroleum products.13 Non-tax revenues averaged 8.4 percent of GDP, including receipts from
the fisheries and mining sectors14 along with dividends from public enterprises such as SNIM and the
telecom company, Mauritel. Finally, revenues from the petroleum industry average 1.4 percent of GDP
and include both direct taxes on oil companies and all types of royalties and fees.

7.       Mauritania has embarked on a series of tax reforms since 2011 that have boosted government
revenues at the end of the commodity super-cycle. Major reforms included15 (i) the elimination of
corporate income tax exemptions and the cancellation of the minimum tax16 in 2012, (ii) the elimination
of the global income tax in 2012 and the introduction of a withholding tax of 15 percent on any payment
to nonresidents in 2013 that limits profit shifting to foreign companies, and (iii) reforms in the VAT
reimbursements regime in 2011 that supported formalizing the economy and collecting more taxes.17 As
a result, tax revenues increased rapidly from slightly over 12 percent of GDP on average over the period
2000–11 to 17.4 percent of GDP on average in 2012–15. By 2012 domestic revenues were significantly
larger than in comparable countries and substantially exceeded the Sub-Saharan Africa average (Figure
1.2).

8.       However, these reforms have not been enough to stave off a severe decline in domestic
revenues that started in 2014 with the end of the super-cycle. Revenues in Mauritania remain highly
dependent on developments in the extractives sector. Iron ore, copper, and oil prices have fallen by 59,
25, and 51 percent respectively in the past two years. As a result, domestic revenues dropped by an
accumulated 5 percent of GDP, driven primarily by heavy falls in dividend receipts from SNIM and
revenues from the oil sector. Those losses demonstrate the volatility of these revenue resources and the
negative effect it can have on attempts to build fiscal buffers for future spending on physical and human
capital. This highlights the need to have a more stable and wider revenue base.
9.     The national oil fund could provide a good buffer for counter-cyclical fiscal policies, but poor
governance hinders this role. The national oil fund was established in 2006. Although recent production

   The minimum tax revenue was 2.5 percent on turnover.
17
   Firms in the formal sector, especially exporters, have an incentive to make purchases from formal suppliers that provide
proper VAT invoices so that they can claim VAT credit. This is particularly the case for mining companies, which are mostly
exporters and taxed at zero rate.

                                                                          10
volumes were well below expectations, the fund gradually but consistently increased through 2014,
supported by rising international oil prices. The fund is an important step forward as, in theory, it
constitutes a good mechanism for fiscal stabilization under a proper set of fiscal rules.18 Indeed, the fund
provides a tool to conduct counter-cyclical fiscal policy and help smooth external shocks by insulating
key expenditures, such as investment in physical and human capital, against volatile commodity prices.
However, several governance issues hinder its proper functioning. This includes the absence of any
audit, the opaque selection process of projects to be funded, and the excessive drawdown of the funds
during periods of economic growth.
10.      The legal structure, updated in 200819 defines the nature of the revenues that replenishes the
fund and the mechanisms organizing its linkage with the state budget. In effect, the legislation requires
that any transfers be recorded in the budget and that a financial viability study accompany each
withdrawal. The law also tasks the minister in charge of finance with the primary responsibility to
manage the Fund, with the Governor of Central bank playing a deputy manager role and having the final
decision in terms of FX transaction. A consultative investment committee for the fund has been set-up
to assist the minister and provide him with all the technical inputs regarding investment decisions and
management of the assets. Finally, quarterly and yearly reporting on the financial and performance
situation of the oil fund are mandated. These are regularly published on the MEF Treasury website. The
requirement of yearly auditing by the Courts of Account and independent auditors are also specified in
the text. It is unclear though whether these requirements are being fulfilled on timely basis. However, it
should be noted that as the revenues from oil have failed to materialize based on the earlier
expectations, the fund has been severely draw-down (used to finance the growing PIP) and is now
rather irrelevant. Its structure though remains important and can be replicated for broader extractives
receipts.
11.     Grants have contributed significantly to Mauritania’s fiscal envelope. On average, the country
received around 1 percent of GDP in grants each year for the period 2009–15. This is a significant
amount for a country of its population. Official development assistance per capita exceeds that of most
comparator countries and is almost twice the average for developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
(Figure 1.3). However, it is another volatile source of revenue (Table 1.2 above) and depends on external
shocks that hit the country. Indeed, in 2012/13 the country received strong international support to
shore up food security and manage the inflow of Malian refugees. As a result, grants should be treated
with caution for fiscal policy planning purposes and are not a substitute for domestic revenue
mobilization.

                                          Box 1.1: Budget Data and Governance
Until early 2016 the Ministry of Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED)
shared responsibility for budget management, and their overlapping mandates compromised the quality of
data collection and analysis. Investment projects were recorded in two different information systems operated
by the MEF and MAED. These two systems used different classifications for the same projects, and there was no
official method for reconciling these differences, which greatly complicated fiscal management and introduced
substantial uncertainty into budgetary analyses.
As in many developing countries, foreign-financed projects are not properly accounted for in budget
documents. If an externally financed project is co-financed domestically, the national budget only records the
domestic contribution, both during the planning and execution phases. Projects that are entirely foreign
financed are excluded from the budget altogether. While MAED does record some data on external financing, it
does not use the same classifications as the national budget. Donor records are also inconsistent with national
accounting systems, and many development partners do not provide timely financial information on execution.
Absent, partial, or incompatible data on external financing jeopardize the comprehensiveness of the budget and
compromise the ability of analysts, both within and outside the government, to identify spending patterns and
evaluate their impact on Mauritania’s development objectives.
In this context, information technology (IT) systems provide a valuable opportunity to enhance the
comprehensiveness, quality, and reliability of budget data. The Treasury Department currently posts a range
of public financial information on its website, including the Table of State Financial Operations (Tableau des
Opérations Financières de l’État; TOFE), as well as monthly Treasury statements, oil profit reports, and updates
on the Budget Law and its execution. However, this information is not consolidated, much of it is highly
aggregated, and is presented in a format that does not facilitate access or analysis by non-specialists.
Nevertheless, this PER relied on the TOFE and the statistical bulletins of the National Statistics Agency to
examine broad expenditure trends, as the best available source of long-term data.
The implementation of the BOOST database and the Electronic Expenditure Chain System (Réseau
Automatisé de la Chaîne des Dépenses; RACHAD) represent two major steps forward in information
management. BOOST is designed to improve access to public financial data and enhance the quality of
expenditure analysis. It compiles disaggregated data from multiple sources and organizes them into three
categories: institutional data, functional data, and economic data. This PER uses BOOST as its main source for
data on approved budgets, investment spending, and (to the extent possible) foreign-financed development
expenditures. Within the government, RACHAD complements BOOST by consolidating the financial information
reported by multiple agencies into a single system. Annex A2 provides further details on BOOST and RACHAD.
Despite notable improvements in recent years, the quality of expenditure data continues to suffer from
serious weaknesses. Expenditure data are sourced from both the original and revised Budget Laws, and
information on commitments and obligations is readily available. However, data on executed expenditures are
often subject to long delays. Data on actual executions (payments) have not yet been incorporated into BOOST,
as they appear not to be fully consolidated at the national level. This analysis therefore considers the closest
phase of the budget cycle to the actual payment: the payment order at the Treasury. This information gap likely
reflects the overlapping reporting responsibilities of the different departments, including the MAED and the
MOF, involved in the budget process.
Expenditure Planning
Mauritania’s experience with medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) has been mixed due to
weaknesses in planning capacity and interagency coordination. MTEFs are meant to improve budget
management by strengthening links between the policy, planning, and budgeting processes. This is especially
critical in environments with limited fiscal space, where scarce resources need to be used as efficiently and
effectively as possible. In Mauritania, the MAED produces an annual “global MTEF? in close collaboration with


                                                                 12
the MOF. Sectoral MTEFs have not been produced since the early 2000s, mostly due to a lack of capacity in the
sector ministries. In principle the MTEF should align short-term macroeconomic stabilization and service
delivery objectives with the government’s long-term strategy for investment and growth. This requires: (i) an
accurate appraisal of the fiscal resources that will be available during the MTEF’s implementation period, (ii) an
understanding of both the initial and future costs of investment projects and recurrent spending programs, and
(iii) a systematic decision-making process that reconciles point (ii) with point (i). In practice, however,
Mauritanian authorities are often unable to effectively estimate the long-term costs of public spending plans or
select and prioritize projects to match the available resources.
Although it continues to be regularly produced, the global MTEF does not serve its primary functions of
informing the annual Budget Law and aligning it with the government’s broader development strategy.
Ideally, the preparation of each global MTEF should begin no later than March of each year and be completed
by August, when work on the following year’s Budget Law begins. In reality, however, the Budget Law and the
global MTEF are almost always prepared at the same time, both beginning in August. Moreover, investment
planning is not in line with the budgetary calendar, and investments are planned during the budget year instead
of at the beginning of each annual cycle.


Capital Expenditure Has Tripled and Public Spending Increased Steadily Overall
12.      While public spending increased steadily between 2010 and 2015, patterns of current and
capital expenditure differed significantly. Table 1.3 shows the composition of central government
expenditures by economic classification, including wages, operations and maintenance, subsidies and
transfers, capital expenditure, and special accounts. Current expenditure fluctuated from between 16.6
and 20.4 percent of GDP, due in part to the temporary spending demands of recent crises. The wage bill
typically accounted for the largest share of current expenditure, averaging 7.0 percent of GDP between
2009 and 2015, followed by goods and services procurement at 4.1 percent of GDP, subsidies and
transfers at 4.1 percent, and debt-service payments at 1.2 percent. This section explores the trends for
some of the major spending items, and briefly outlines some of the key constraints to consolidation in
each category.
13.      The wage bill in Mauritania is underreported and accounting issues complicate its analysis.
The TOFE reveals that the wage bill averaged 39.7 percent of recurrent spending between 2009 and
2015. While this figure is broadly in line with Sub-Saharan African countries,20 it does represent 48.2
percent of tax receipts. This is a relatively high proportion especially when compared to the convergence
criteria set for West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries at 35 percent. The
actual wage bill may be significantly higher than the budgeted figure. In addition to Mauritania’s 38,000
full-time civil servants, approximately 8,500 “non-permanent staff? are employed by the public sector.
These temporary workers are not tracked in the human resources management system, and their
compensation is not included in the wage bill.21 Instead, it falls under “goods and services
procurement.? Moreover, many temporary staff are recruited without any formal vetting or verification
process, raising important transparency concerns.22 Despite the government’s notable progress in
strengthening human resource management in recent years,23 proper wage-bill accounting continues to
present a significant challenge.


20
   According to the World Development Indicators, the average for the continent was 36.7 percent.
21
   These temporary workers are often hired at lower wages than civil servants. The Ministry of Finance estimates their
remuneration costs at around MRO 1 billion – US$ 3.3 million.
22
   The figures above do not reflect also the number of staff recruited by state-owned enterprises or public agencies.
23
   In 2015 the government started implementing a control system that eliminates duplications in the wage bill. The government
is now in the process of finalizing a biometric census for all civil servants in order to issue a single identification number.

  A Large Parastatal Sector Poses Fiscal Risks
  14.     The Parastatal sector is large and imposes a substantial burden on the national budget. The
  SOE sector has grown in recent years to approximately 150 institutions—50 state-owned enterprises
  (SOEs) and 100 autonomous government agencies. The combined revenue of non-extractives SOEs in
  2014 was 15.8% percent of non-extractives GDP and they held assets worth 56% of non-extractive GDP.
  The largest mining SOE (SNIM) alone has had an average turnover of over 17 percent of GDP in recent
  years, which puts the size of the commercial SOEs at close to a third of GDP on average. This changed in
  2015 with the dramatic reduction in SNIM revenues to 95 billion MRO (318 million USD) from 212 billion
  MRO (706 million USD) in 2014 and a high of 421 billion MRO (1.4 billion USD) in 2011. As of 2015 the
  15 largest SOEs made up 94 percent of total SOE turnover, which stood at 292 billion MRO (974 million
  USD) or 17 percent of GDP (see figure 1.10).

  15.     The state depends on some of the largest SOEs for a significant part of its revenue but have
  seen a dramatic reduction in dividend payments in 2015. Dividend payments have varied between 0.5
  to 16.5 percent of total revenue between 2000 and 2015, averaging 6 percent. SNIM has been by far
  the largest contributor followed by Mauritel, BCM and the Ports of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. In

                                                                         14
addition to dividend payments, SNIM has also paid between 40-30 billion MRO per year in a special tax
and VAT payments (8-10 percent of revenues). However, a lack of dividend payments by SNIM in 2015
has dramatically reduced their contribution to the national budget from a high of 16.5 percent of
revenues in 2012 to just 3.4 percent of revenues in 2015 and a projected 2.3 percent in 2016.

16.      On the other hand, subsidies and other transfers to Parastatals are high and weigh on a
shrinking budget. Budget transfers to EPAs are on average 8.8 percent of non-oil revenues, having
decreased from a high of 14 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2014 and 9.4 percent in 2015. While EPAs
are essentially extensions of the public sector, they enjoy great financial autonomy, receiving block grant
transfers from the state, with very little accountability for results and very weak financial reporting on
the use of these funds. Explicit subsidies to commercial SOEs were on average 3.7 percent of revenues
in 2010-14, with a strong surge in 2011 and 2012, up from just under 6 billion MRO to 18 billion MRO
(2.2 to 4.8 percent of revenues). In addition to the explicit subsidies, around 26.8 billion MRO was spent
on capital injections to state owned enterprises through share purchases (19 billion MRO) or as loans or
advances (7.8 billion MRO) in 2011-13. Subtracting the subsidies received from the dividends and taxes
paid by SOEs to the state, the net fiscal impact of SOEs was negative in 2015 (15 MRO billion or 3.5% of
revenues), mainly due to the lower dividend payments.

 17.      The performance of commercial SOEs vary greatly, but overall the sector has seen net positive
 results in 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1.9). While data for 2015 is incomplete, there are indications of very
 significant losses, led by SNIM which alone lost a reported 58 Bn MRO (3.6 percent of GDP). However,
 even the positive 2014 result masks very large differences between companies. Of the 50 companies,
 22 lost a combined 20 Bn MRO, while 24 companies made a combined 29 Bn MRO in 2014. The largest
 profits were made by Mauritel, the national social insurance fund (CNAM) and the port of Nouakchott,
 while the largest losses were seen in the electricity and water utilities (SOMELEC and SNDE) and the oil
 company (SMH), in addition to SNIM. SOEs have increased their capital investments significantly in
 recent years. Fixed assets doubled between 2010 and 2014 to 414 Bn MRO (1.3 Bn USD) and
 construction in progress increased by 150% to nearly 400 million USD (Figure 1.5). Total assets doubled,
 reaching 710 Bn MRO (2.36 Bn USD), over 55% of non-extractive GDP. Another notable growth area for
 SOEs was the increase of groups and associates, which went from 2 to 36 Bn MRO over the period (7 to
 123 million USD). Depreciation and impairments averaged 37 percent of total assets over the period.
 Salary expenses in SOEs increased in nominal terms by 50% from 2010, reaching 31.8 Bn MRO in 2014
 (106 Million USD).

19.     Until recently very little information was
                                                                         SOMELEC,

terms of service delivery and operational
efficiency. Fortunately, this is beginning to change,
with the preparation of the first complete SOE
report underway. The government has made some effort to improve oversight of parastatals, but
progress has thus far been limited. Sector ministries are expected to monitor the performance of
parastatals in their respective areas, but they typically lack the administrative capacity to do so
effectively. Moreover, the designated oversight offices at the sector ministries tend to focus on financial
accountability, and largely ignore technical performance. Although the government’s legal framework
includes performance-based agreements with parastatals, in practice few agreements have been
prepared and no information exists on enforcement. Processes for selecting the leadership of SOEs are

often unclear, and the competence of leaders is rarely assessed. The authorities are aware of these
issues and have recently established a general SOE directorate which is receiving capacity building
support from the World Bank with a view to strengthen oversight and monitoring and to rationalize the
sector.
20.     Capital spending increased strongly in the past five years as revenues from extractives and tax
reforms increased. In a context of high export prices and important reforms in tax and customs
administration, the authorities focused on increasing public investment. The ratio of capital to current
spending has increased continuously since 2010, and this trend accelerated over time. Between 2009
and 2015, capital expenditures more than doubled in nominal terms and as a share of GPD, rising from 6
to 14.2 percent of GDP. Domestically financed spending dominated this rise, reflecting the government’s
decision to allocate further resources towards sustaining its development agenda. The future
sustainability of such spending will be tested as international commodity prices fall and revenues from
the extractives sector slow down. The efficiency and value for money of the executed projects are also
in question. The average incremental capital to output ratio (ICOR),24 a metric of physical capital
productivity which assess the marginal amount of investment capital required for a country to generate
growth, has been evaluated at 10.4, well over the benchmark ratio of 3 which is the average for sub-
Saharan Africa, indicating a highly inefficient deployment of capital.25

Overall Execution Rates Disguise High Volatility Within Spending Categories...
21.     Actual spending has matched budget expectations more closely in recent years. On aggregate,
budget execution rates have improved over time from 86 percent in 2009 to 99 percent in 2015.26 This
reflects a number of reforms in public financial management, such as the implementation of the
development assistance database and reforms in the areas of budget preparation, cash management,
and payment systems although there is great variance within categories. Subsequent chapters of the
PER will examine these reforms more closely.
22.      Nevertheless, notable discrepancies appear once spending is considered at a more detailed
level. Table 1.4 reveals that public spending on items such as loans, advances, subsidies and transfers,
and interest payments have been volatile. The category of Loans, advances and equity investments was
overspent by 211 percent in 2012 and 227 percent in 2015, while underspending 31 and 21 percent in
2011 and 2014 respectively. Subsidies and transfers was overspent by 266 percent in 2011 and 62
percent the following year.27 These are signs of continuing gaps in the budget preparation process and
coordination failures between budget actors. A stark example is the underspending on debt
amortization and interest payments, which is are relatively a straightforward budget items to estimate
since the debt profile and maturities are generally known and documented.28 In many instances the
underspending has not translated into a decline in the deficit but large reallocations within budget items
towards public investment29 especially in the years following the last coup d’état between 2010 and
2013.

   The ICOR is computed as growth in capital stock or public investment divided by the growth in real GDP. This average is for
2010–14 and is computed using National Accounts data. The year 2009 was dropped as it represents an outlier due to the
political shock that year. National accounts figures for 2015 are only projections so were also not included.
25
   A higher ICOR value indicates that the country’s deployment of public investment (or capital) is inefficient.
26
   No data were available for 2015.

   As a rule of thumb, outturns below 5 percent are generally considered acceptable.

   This raises concerns over the area of debt management in Mauritania.

23.      Capital investment spending has increased while falling short of budgeted amounts. Capital
investment spending shows a strong under-execution of 34 percent in 2010, improving to a 3 percent
over-execution in 2011 before falling to 14 and 13 percent under-execution in 2012 and 2013 and 29
percent under-execution in 2015 averaging a 15 percent under-execution between 2010 and 2015 for the
domestic funding of capital investment projects. The significant variance in outturn rates is again a sign of
poor investment planning. The budget revision which takes place in the third quarter of the year reduces
these variances significantly, but expenditure outturn variance is still above 5% on average for the
categories of interest payments (-13 percent), acquisition of fixed and intangible assets and loans (-11
percent), and advances and equity payments (-8 percent) for the period. Total capital expenditure nearly
tripled from 32 billion MRO (US$ 106 million) in 2010 to a high of 90.3 billion MRO (US$ 300 million) in
2014.

…While a Large Proportion of Government Expenditure Remains Opaque and Discretionary
24.      Sectoral allocations have remained relatively consistent over time, although nominal spending
has increased erratically. Between 2011 and 2015, public spending increased on average by 11
percent30 a year, but with large jumps in 2011 (17.6 percent) and 2012 (26.7 percent). This is partly due
to emergency spending after the 2011 drought, which saw soaring growth especially in 2011–13.31
Emergency programs and food security expenditures averaged 8 percent of expenditures over the
period from 2011. Health and social affairs witnessed an increase from 4.1 to 5.5 percent of
expenditures and Infrastructure from 5.9 to 8.7 percent. High Constitutional Offices such as the
Presidency, Prime Minister’s office and Parliament also saw an increase from 3.5 to 6.7 percent of
expenditures. Meanwhile, the justice sector and the economic and sector ministries have seen their
shares decline. Funding for Decentralization and regional development remained significant with an
average of 12 percent of spending, as did Defense with over 11 percent. While erratic changes in
nominal spending do not appear to have adversely affected service quality, expanding the use of fiscal
rules32 could mitigate volatility and ensure that the evolution of sector budgets clearly and consistently
reflects the government’s development priorities.

   Nominal values.

25.      But the largest share of expenditure remains discretionary and difficult to classify. Data on the
functional classification of spending33 (Table 1.5) indicate that between 2010 and 2015 about 24.7
percent of total resources were allocated to the social sectors, including education, public health and
emergency programs, while a combined 19 percent went to infrastructure and decentralization and
regional development, and a relatively high 11 percent to national defense. The single largest category is
“other expenses? which makes up a remarkable 27.4 percent of total expenditures. In reality this
category supports a number of economic and sector categories and various special accounts and funds.
For example, around 4.7 billion MRO (US$ 15.6 million) was provided as budget support to the fisheries
sector in the 2011-13 period. Other expenditure items include that of the special assistance and
intervention fund for development (Fond d’Assistance et d’Intervention pour le Developpement – FAID)
which spent 14.9 billion MRO (US$ 49 million) between 2011 and 2013. The fund was established in
2010 for the purpose of financing basic infrastructures and services for the poor, and it has several
financing sources, including donor funding, grants from the state and the private sector, as well as
special taxes on telecommunications and petroleum products. The fund provides no information on any
of its activities. Finally, around 26.8 billion MRO (US$ 89 million) was spent on capital injections to state
owned enterprises through share purchases (19 billion MRO – US$ 63 million) or as loans or advances
(7.8 billion MRO – US$ 26 million) in 2011-13. In sum, a quarter of government spending is highly
discretionary and is not properly categorized, which greatly complicates budget preparation and
expenditure tracking.

    financing (Figure 1.15). Education, on the other hand, only received 4 percent of external financing while
    health and social affairs accounted for a mere 1.4 percent. This reflects the government’s policy of
    channeling development aid and concessionary financing towards physical capital.

    27.     Spending on social sectors remains below Mauritania’s regional peers. Education is one of the
    largest expenditure categories in Mauritania, accounting for about 12.5 percent of domestic spending.
    Nevertheless, spending is low relative to comparable countries and the Sub-Saharan Africa average
    (Table 1.6). The picture for public spending on healthcare is similar: while the health sector accounts for
    6.5 percent of total spending, it remains far from the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 12.5 percent.36
    Low investment in human capital is expected to have enduring effects on long-term growth and

are high by the standards of comparable countries. It should be noted that the “unspecified expenses?
category is the only one that was significantly underspent. Those unidentified and discretionary funds
are hence reallocated during the fiscal year and used for arbitrage between various expenditure items in
a way that not only reduces transparency, but also increases spending volatility. The recurrence of such
practices could have negative effects on macro stability.

Debt is Rising but is Highly Concessional…
                        Total = -2%
29.      The current composition of Mauritania debt is foreign but on concessional basis. Mauritania
has no access to international capital markets. Its foreign debt represents 95% of total PPG debt and is
largely concessional39. Its domestic debt (5% of total) is in its entirety is short term, namely Treasury
Bonds (TBs) of less than 6 months. Two types of TBs exist: banking TBs held by commercial banks, and
Non-banking TBs held by non-bank agents mostly SNIM the public mining company (1 month TBs). This
latter type of debt has been rising steadily over the past years and grew from 22% of domestic debt
(1.7% of GDP) to 76% (3.2% of GDP). By end 2015, public debt had reached 95.8% GDP, up from 95.6% in
2014.
30.      The high level of public investment has been one of the major causes for the rapid rise in
public debt. Public investment has been critical in stimulating growth and reducing poverty, especially

through infrastructure in rural areas. However, its level remains a major cause of macro instability. In
effect, the ambitious PIP, with a 35.6% component that is externally financed, puts significant pressure
on the primary deficit and consequently on debt levels40. The absence of fiscal buffers and the
recurrence to further bilateral and less-concessional financing have worsened debt sustainability41.

in metal prices persist. No major deceleration in debt accumulation is envisaged42 and current policies

do not provide a counterforce to the terms of trade deterioration. This situation was also exacerbated
by depreciation in the exchange rate vis-à-vis the US$ and the debt became more expensive. In the 2014
DSA, only the baseline PV to debt-to GDP ratio breached its threshold. In the most recent DSA (2016),
the breaches for baseline projections are large and sustained over the long run. As a result, Mauritania’s
risk of debt distress remains high.
32.     Debt policy is also constrained by governance problems related to debt management. The
functions of debt management are fragmented across several departments43. Such sub-optimal
structure prevents a holistic view of debt issues. The recent merger of the ministries of economy and
finance, and the installation of the debt information system DEMFAS 6.0 in August 201544 open the door
for promising programmatic reforms in the area of debt management. Reforms that have a potential to
reduce costs and risks associated with a growing stock of debt.

Going Forward, Even if Commodity Prices Recover, Structural Reform Will be Needed to Avoid
Unsustainable Deficits
33.     The end of the commodities super-cycle and more subdued economic growth have worsened
the outlook for Mauritania. International iron ore and copper prices, Mauritania’s largest commodity
exports,45 have already declined by 42 and 20 percent year-on-year respectively in 2015.46 They are
projected to continue their decline in 2016-1847 (Table 1.7). The same trend is expected for oil where the
average price is set to decline from US$51 per barrel (US$/bbl) in 2015 to 37 US$/bbl in 2016 before
gradually recovering by 2018. These prices remain very far from the 100 US$/bbl mark set between
2011 and early 2014. Low international prices coupled with a weaker domestic demand will lead to
more subdued economic activity. Growth is therefore not expected to exceed 4.5 percent in the
medium term. This is much lower than the government’s own projections.48
34.     In this unfavorable external and domestic context, public revenues are expected to take a
large hit. Revenues in Mauritania are largely linked to economic growth, and iron and oil prices. A
slowdown in growth directly affects income and consumption taxes,49 and also to a certain extent
receipts from the fisheries sector. A drop in iron prices reduces royalties and fees from the extractives
industry and cuts dividends shared by the SNIM. All these sources are classified under non-tax
revenues.50 It also affects taxes on goods and services because of losses incurred on VAT linked with
extractive companies’ imports51 and the unique tax on SNIM. The impact of oil prices is similar.
However, it is laid out more explicitly in the MTEF. As a result, it is projected that Mauritania could lose
up to 3.4 percent of GDP in domestic revenues52 cumulatively by 2018, with the bulk of the hit (3.0
percent of GDP) to come in 2016 (Table 1.7). The decline is primarily linked to losses in non-tax revenues
(2 percent of GDP), losses in tax on goods and services (0.6 percent of GDP) and revenues from

       Revenues from petroleum are expected to stabilize and slightly increase as international oil prices recuperate. The largest

35.     Without reforms to widen the tax base and improve revenue mobilization, such losses will
lead to unsustainable deficits. If the government wants to maintain its current level of public
investment (over 11 percent of GDP)—even assuming it undertakes some measures of fiscal
consolidation, such as stabilizing the wage bill and slightly reining in recurrent spending—the overall
budget deficit will exceed 5 percent of GDP (Table 1.7).54 Such a deficit level is unsustainable and will
lead to a sharp rise in public debt ratios. Indeed, for Mauritania to stabilize the current debt-to-GDP
ratio we calculate that it will have to record a primary deficit of no more than 3.3 percent of GDP in
2016. Currently, the country is a long way from this target. The situation will worsen further if foreign
grants do not materialize, as the current outlook suggests.55
36.      While the fiscal outcome could change if the external environment improves, simulations
show that structural reforms remain necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis to estimate the fiscal impact of changes in both international iron ore and oil prices.56
Results indicate that, keeping other parameters constant, a 10 percent annual increase in international
iron ore prices over the outlook period (2016–18)57 could bring in up to 1.5 percent of GDP in
accumulated revenue savings by 2018. This reduces the expected primary deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP.
However, that figure remains above the debt stabilization threshold of 4.1 percent of GDP—the
simulations suggest that the government would need a yearly increase in iron ore prices of around 13
percent to achieve that target. The story for oil prices is similar: a 10 percent yearly increase would lead
to an accumulated gain of only 0.3 percent of GDP in budgetary revenues. These findings indicate that
structural reforms are indispensable in order to reduce dependence on commodity prices and the
budget volatility that price fluctuations bring. These reforms include fiscal consolidation policies that
rein in recurrent spending, especially those related to the wage bill and to transfers, and reforms to
expand the tax base and boost revenue mobilization.

The Government Needs to Strengthen its Public Financial Management Systems in Order to
Improve the Impact of Public Spending
37.      The Government of Mauritania has undertaken a number of reforms of their Public Financial
Management systems in recent years and some results have been achieved; budget execution has
been improved through a reduction in the time it takes to execute payment orders, aided by an
electronic expenditure chain system (RACHAD); tax revenues increased by 160% in 2013 from 2011
resulting from a fiscal census and improved tax collection measures; a new procurement law and
institutions has increased controls; a staffing census helped eliminate undocumented salary payments;
an electronic land registry for Nouakchott was set up and land titles were scanned and verified, with a
number of double and false titles detected and eliminated. Finally, various electronic financial
management (GFMIS) systems are now largely up and running, with most ministries and modules in
place.


54
   In 2018, the budget deficit is projected to reach 6.2 percent if no reform measures have been taken (Table 1.7).
55
   The decline in foreign grants is estimated at 0.8 percent of GDP in 2016 and 0.4 percent thereafter. The nominal figures for
2016 are taken from the 2016 Budget Law.
56
   The analysis is based primarily on elasticities between changes in each commodity price and the tax or non-tax revenue item
it affects. This relationship is weighted so as to account for the effect of growth. For example: 80 percent of dividends are linked
to extractives, and hence iron ore prices, while the remaining 20 percent is linked to growth. Also 15 percent of consumption
taxes are linked directly to iron ore while the rest is determined by oil prices, growth and inflation. Weights are based on
historical average.

   A 5 percent increase on top of the current baseline.

                                                                       25
38.     However, many of the reforms have not been fully implemented with the result that real
changes in practices and outcomes are limited. There has been a gradual improvement in the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating over the past three years, and Mauritania now scores
above the average for both Sub-Saharan Africa and IDA borrowers. But the 2014 Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) analysis shows very little progress on PFM reforms since 2008 and even a
deterioration in some areas. Notably, the budget suffers from low credibility and few links with stated
policy policies. The scores on external control and audits was also weaker in 2014. The PEFA program
scores are summarized in Figure 1.5 below and a detailed comparison is included in Annex A1.
39.      In Mauritania, budget preparation is largely a bureaucratic exercise, which essentially just
repeats prior years’ allocations without real consideration of policies and strategic government
programs, and without using many of the tools at the government’s disposal such as the M TEF, the
mining sector fiscal model, or sectoral strategies for projections and planning. Budget preparation is also
not guided by a clear and pre-determined budget formulation calendar. Instead, the budgeting process
begins late in the year (around August) and the approval of the budget by the legislature regularly
happens after the start of the fiscal year for which the budget has been approved. The triannual rolling
Public Investment Program (PIP) is elaborated by MAED and is used as the basis for the annual
investment budget (BCI), but the articulation between planned investments and related operational
costs is poor. The budget memos (circulaires budgétaires) outline the general priorities for the budget
and makes reference to strategic documents, but do not include budgetary ceilings for functional areas
or administrative units. The 2014 PEFA scores show low budget credibility and a weak link between
policies and the budget as measured by PEFA indicators. The total PEFA score on PI-1 (aggregate
expenditure outturn compared to original approved budget) remained the same between the 2008 and
2014 assessment (C), while the PI-2 (composition of expenditure outturn compared to the original
approved budget) and PI-3 (aggregate revenue outturn) indicators fell from B to D+ and from A to D
respectively in the 2014 evaluation compared to 2008. The indicators related to policy based budgeting
PI-11 and PI-12 dropped from A to D+ and B to C+ respectively. Only indicator PI-4 increased from B+ to
A as a result of reduced payment arrears. A new public finance framework law (Loi Organique relative
aux Lois de Finances) under elaboration is expected to introduce program-based budgeting and a
detailed process and calendar for budget preparation. However, past experience has shown that
introducing policy based budgeting in a low capacity environment can pose its own challenges and will
not necessarily improve budget practices.

40.      Budget execution is characterized by weak internal and external controls and irregular
oversight and monitoring of public spending. One reason for the downward trend on the PI-2 indicator,
from B in 2008 to D+ in 2014 is the weak enforcement of internal and external controls and poor
monitoring and oversight by senior managers. There are significant differences between budgeted and
actual expenditures. Almost one-third of expenditures are entirely opaque, with little information
available on which sectors receive the funds or what kind of expenditures they finance. The PEFA notes
a slight improvement on indicator PI-20 related to internal expenditure controls (D+ to C+), but this
progress is due to the development of a clearer legal and institutional framework for controls, while the
implementation is still entirely missing.
41.      The various external and internal oversight institutions of the state are understaffed and
poorly financed, and a lack of coordination between them prevents effective controls . The low
performance of the internal auditor, general state inspector and the supreme audit institution are
reflected in PEFA scores PI-18, 21, 25, 26, 27 which are all rated D. Internal audit can provide important
corrective action during budget execution, and should focus on systemic institutional and performance
issues in addition to pure compliance aspects. This is the intention and mandate of the General Financial
Inspectorate (Inspection Générale des Finances; IGF) but it is currently unable to fulfill this role. There is
a general state inspector (Inspection Générale d’Etat; IGE) reporting to the Prime Minister, as well as
Commissaires aux Comptes, which are internal controllers based in each spending/budget unit and
reporting to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The supreme audit institution (Cour des Comptes)
carries out about 20 audits per year. Its independence is questionable and it is hampered by low
capacity and limited resources and is experiencing significant delays, having recently finalized the 2005–
06 audits and is currently working on the 2007 report of the state budget. The last published report was
the 2006 Annual Report.

    Box 1.2: Key findings of Mauritania’s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (2014)
Budget credibility. Budget credibility was affected adversely by non-compliance of budgetary allocations to line
ministries, non-compliance with budget ceilings and weaknesses in revenue forecasting. Between 2011 and 2012,
a significant difference was observed between the originally approved budget and the actual outturns (RACHAD),
though this deviation improved in 2013. Other improvements were observed in the elimination of old arrears and
the non-accumulation of new domestic arrears which contributes to budget credibility.
Comprehensiveness and transparency. The budget is fairly comprehensive, using a classification based on
international standards. Improvements are needed with respect to the coverage of autonomous public
institutions and local authorities. Public access to some key fiscal documents is hampered or not provided in a
timely manner, which impacts Parliament’s and civil society’s accountability work.
Policy-based budgeting. Some progress has been made in multi-year planning owing to the preparation of
macroeconomic and budgetary frameworks as well as some sector expenditure plans but these tools need to be
further improved by reinforcing statistical capacities and forecasting models. Overall, policy-based budgeting
practice remains largely deficient. Links between the MTEF, sector plans/strategies, and the annual budget are
weak as plans do not respect any fiscal space and information on donor aid is limited, affecting the strategic
allocation of resources. Mauritania’s dual budget process and lack of a budget calendar further undermines the
effectiveness of the budget-preparation process.
Predictability and control in budget execution. The fiscal and custom administrations’ legal framework is
generally comprehensive and progress with taxpayer registration has improved revenue collection. However,
Mauritania needs to further enhance the registration system and capacities and install interconnected software.
Weaknesses in cash planning for expenditure commitment is one of the reasons for the frequent budget
adjustments during the fiscal year. The government’s management of debt by three agencies (MAED, MEF, and
the BCM) is not in accordance with international practice. The installation of a debt management system
connected into the budget execution cycle and the treasury would substantially improve the efficiency of debt
management. The performance of the payroll system is generally satisfactory but cumbersome administrative
procedures lead to long delays in processing changes in the personnel database. Expenditure control was
strengthened through the establishment of the information system RACHAD and the reduction of informal
expenditure procedures but it is affected by the lack of a central financial control service and its respective tools.
The performance of the internal and external audit function is weak due to insufficient staffing, insufficient
information exchange between both audit services, and the lack of a mechanism for ensuring follow-up of its
recommendations.
Accounting, recording, and reporting. Considerable improvements have been made in budget reporting and
accounting by implementing the computerized information systems (RACHAD and Beite El Male; see Annex A2).
Treasury records are regularly reconciled with bank account data. However, suspense accounts and advances are
not subject to systematic reconciliation and clearance during and at the end of the fiscal year. Much also remains
to be done to improve the frequency of in-year budget reports, public access to execution reports, the
accessibility of front-line delivery units to information about resources allocated to them, tracking the effective
use of sub-national resources, and delays in preparing the government’s consolidated financial statements.
External scrutiny and audit. The Supreme Audit Institution is coping with capacity challenges which have led to a
backlog of audit work and is responsible for delays in issuing the external audit reports. The legislative scrutiny is
undermined by the lack of time to review the budget and insufficient budget documentation that does not cover
all needed information. The effectiveness of parliamentary scrutiny of the final audits is also diminished by the
backlog in the examination of the financial statements and its insufficient capacity to adhere to procedures.
Donor practices. External funding consists mainly of project-related aid. Disbursement procedures are specific to
each donor and disbursement forecasts of new projects are not all available at the time of budget preparation.
Documentation attached to the budget law only takes into account projects for which funding is acquired,
reducing the predictability of planned aid.

    Key Areas for Reform
    42.     Revenues and expenditure trends have revealed major weaknesses in Mauritania’s fiscal
    policy. These include volatile domestic revenues, dependence on mineral- and oil-sector receipts, high
    non-transparent discretionary spending, inelastic recurrent spending items such as the wage bill and
    transfers, and weak investment in human capital. These have led to a very volatile fiscal position which
    have affected the macro-stability of the country. With widened budget deficits and increasing debt
    ratios, Mauritania lacks the fiscal buffers it needs to weather both external and domestic shocks to the
    economy. As a result, the outlook for Mauritania looks unfavorable in the post super-cycle era, “the new
    normal?.
    43.     Mauritania will need to undertake a number of key structural reforms if it is to improve its
    fiscal outlook and achieve its development objectives. In an environment of low commodity prices,
    structural reforms become imperative to widen the tax base and increase revenue mobilization on one
    side, and boost economic growth through diversifying the economy and investing in human capital in
    the other. These measures should build some fiscal space to enable the country to maintain in part its
    ambitious public investment program and shield it from external shocks and fluctuating business cycles.
    This would also entail reviewing budget governance structures, particularly public investment
    management, to ensure the highest economic and social returns on selected projects.
    44.     In this respect, we propose a combination of quick wins and medium-term fiscal reforms. This
    chapter has examined a number of constraints limiting the effectiveness of fiscal policy in Mauritania.
    Table 1.8 presents a set of non-comprehensive recommendations for strengthening the institutions and
    processes that largely determine the impact of public spending on the country’s development goals. A
    more comprehensive set of reforms are discussed in the remainder chapters of the report.

Chapter 2: Increasing the Economic and Social Impact of Public Investments


In Mauritania, Public Investment Spending Analysis is Complicated by Fragmented and
Incomplete Data
45.      The analysis in this chapter is complicated by incomplete and fragmented data on public
investments. The existence of a multitude of investment planning/budgeting and monitoring
instruments prepared and managed by different institutions, for different purposes and without any
coordination, has resulted in a lack of reliable data and the existence of several partial datasets. Despite
efforts to improve the monitoring of donor-funded projects through the installation of a new database,
the situation remains very similar to the previous PER which was finalized in 2011.
46.     The authorities are unable to produce a timely, complete and reliable overview of the
implementation of their entire investment budget. There is no central instrument to monitor how
investment projects perform against planned budget envelopes and execution calendars. This clearly
complicates any analysis on investment budget execution, and prevents any meaningful monitoring
from the center. Individual investment project units have this kind of information, but central
authorities also need to have access to it for budget planning and monitoring purposes. The inability of
existing systems to capture this information in a timely manner can lead to unrealistic budgeting,
causing delays due to under-budgeting for some projects or locking up scarce capital through over-
budgeting for others.
47.    Mauritania’s investment program is outlined and reported on through four different
instruments:
         The Public Investment Program (PIP), a three year rolling investment program, is a strategic
          investment document which includes projects for which funding is secured as well as projects
          where funding has not yet been obtained but where government is seeking funding. It is
          supposed to be updated on an annual basis.
         The Consolidated Investment Budget (BCI), which is annexed to the budget law every year, and
          includes all domestic funding, projects funded by external partners, as well as investments
          through state-owned enterprises.
         The annual national budget law, which includes only the investments financed by domestic
          funding, including the share of foreign finance investment projects which is covered by
          counterpart funding (from 15 percent of total project value and up).
         The Table of State Financial Operations (Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’État: TOFE),
          which is the monthly report on the execution of the national budget. It provides information on
          internal or external funds administered by the central government through the national
          electronic payment system (Réseau Automatisé de la Chaîne des Dépenses: RACHAD).
48.       Two additional instruments have been introduced since the last PER:
         The BOOST database is a World Bank spreadsheet-based budget analysis tool which provides
          basic information on budget trends, including amounts for the approved budget, revised
          budget, and expenditures broken down by Administrative Unit, Economic Classification and
          Source of Funding. Its purpose is to facilitate budget analysis. It was introduced in Mauritania in
          2013. It draws on several national electronic public financial management (PFM) systems
          (Rachad, Beit El Mal, DAD) and so is constrained by the availability of data in these systems.


                                                      30
            The Development Assistance Database (DAD) introduced in 2013 is a web-based platform and
             database which provides information on externally financed projects including their stage of
             implementation, and sectoral and geographic concentration. It uses off-the-shelf commercial
             software and its database is managed by a US-based company. It is informative to the public,
             but is still of limited use to the authorities for monitoring purposes. The authorities are planning
             to add another module for public investment monitoring which should allow for closer
             monitoring of targets and broader analysis across the donor-financed portfolio.

The Investment Budget has Increased Significantly in Recent Years.
49.      Significant windfalls from high mineral prices have allowed Mauritania to increase its public
investment budget significantly between 2010 and 2015. In nominal terms, the investment budget
increased from MRO 173 billion (US$ 576 million) in 2010 to a high of MRO 255 billion (US$ 850 million) in
2015, an increase of 47% between 2010 and 2014. Actual spending went from 65 Bn MRO (US$ 216
million) in 2010 (5.4 percent of GDP) to 228 Bn MRO (US$ 760 million) in 2015 (14 percent of GDP) (see
Figure 2.1).

50.      The proportion of investment to recurrent expenditures in the national budget has also changed
significantly, increasing from 36 percent to 53 percent in 2014. Importantly, the volume of domestic
funding for investment has more than doubled from MRO 54 billion (US$ 180 million) in 2010 to MRO
120 billion in 2014 (US$ 400 million) (Figure 2.2), and is now at par with investments from external
resources. However, not all of this growing amount of budgeted investment is converted into additional
public investment – i.e. spending that contributes directly to general government gross fixed capital
formation. Many development budget expenditures are essentially recurrent (i.e. consumable) in nature
but are included in the consolidated investment budget because they are associated with specific

projects – for example all donor projects are categorized under the development budget, irrespective of
whether they are financing recurrent or capital expenditures. Total public investment (government gross
fixed capital formation) is therefore likely to be considerably lower than total investment spending in a
given year.58

51.     The execution rate of the investment budget has improved considerably since the last PER .
Table 2.1 shows the consolidated investment budget by the nature of funding and the rate of
implementation (all sources of funding between 2010 and 2014). The investment budget execution rate
increased from just under 40 percent in 2010 to 76 percent in 2014. This is mainly due to the high
execution rate of the share of the domestically financed investment budget, which averages almost 100
percent, while the execution rate of externally financed projects over the period 2010 –14 was around
40 percent59. This large difference in execution rates merits closer examination but unfortunately no
analysis has been done by the authorities to look at the reasons behind these. The authorities cite the
complexities in managing multiple donor requirements for project management and limited use of
country systems, combined with a slow response time on the part of partners. On the other hand, the
greater flexibility seen in domestic financed projects could also imply less rigor in project management
and expenditure controls, which could be a reason for concern.




58
   For domestically funded investment expenditures, the sub-category of “fixed investments? was on average 62 percent of
investment budget spending, followed by debt amortization at 17 percent, transfers and subsidies at 16 percent, goods and
services at 5.3 percent and salaries at under one percent. For externally funded expenditures, approximately 70 percent is
spent on infrastructure and construction, with the remainder going to capacity building.
59
   The execution rate of externally financed investments is estimated using data from the consolidated investment budget (for
the original budget), TOFE and BOOST (for execution). Given significant gaps in the data, the estimates may be subject to
errors.

While Large Infrastructure Projects Receive the Bulk of Investment, Other Areas Have Seen
Significant Increases
52.     The budget category of Territorial Development and Land Planning, which includes major
infrastructure projects (roads, ports, and airports), continues to receive the bulk of state resources at
more than 50 percent of the total investment budget for the period 2010–14 and up from 44.1 percent
over the period 2004–09. Roads received half of these funds, followed by Ports, Urban Water, and
Urban Infrastructure. Some large investment projects such as the free trade zone in Nouadhibou or the
new national airport are not included in this envelope since these are financed through PPPs with
minimal public funding. Very little information is available on the terms of these PPP arrangements and

                                                                     33
total the costs and benefits to the state and the private sector companies involved. The Regional
Development Fund transfers resources to local governments for locally determined investments to
sustain the decentralization process and to correct regional imbalances and has benefited from
substantial budgetary allocations. Its funding makes up nearly 30 percent of Housing, Urban, and
Transport allocations, at MRO 3.5 billion for 2014 (US$ 11.6 million). In this context, 2014 saw the
effective start of the activities of the National Integrated Support Program for Decentralization, Local
Development and Employment which was allocated MRO 30 billion (US$ 99 million) over the period
2014–19. The program focuses on financing basic urban infrastructure but it has been very slow to start
up.
53.      The industrial development sector almost quadrupled its budget from MRO 13 billion (US$ 43
million) in 2010 to MRO 43 billion (US$ 143 million) in 2014. It absorbed MRO 109 billion (US$ 363
million) during the period 2010–14, which is almost 11 percent of the total capital budget. These funds
have focused on sectors of strategic importance for Mauritania (such as fishing, industry, tourism, and
energy), with most of the funding devoted to the energy sector (nearly MRO 90 billion – US$ 300
million), resulting in a 250 percent increase in energy production capacity, and rates of access to energy
rising from 21 to 32 percent.
54.     The rural development sector has seen a significant increase in resources in 2013 and 2014 .
This is partly explained by the adoption of the Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) which
provides the integrated framework for all interventions in the sector. Since 2012 the government has
also invested in the irrigation development programs in the river valley in Trarza. Since 2004, allocations
to the sector had moderately fluctuated around MRO 12-13 billion (US$ 40-43 million), but in 2013 it
received MRO 25.8 billion (US$ 86 million) and in 2014 MRO 29.4 billion (US$ 98 million), which was 8
percent of the investment budget. The objective is to increase agricultural productivity, strengthen the
strategic role of livestock in the economy, improve the supply of drinking water in rural areas, and
preserve the environment.
55.      The government continues to underfund the human development sector (health, education,
justice and culture) in relation to its needs and importance for poverty reduction and development.
Overall, the human development category allocation went from 4.2 percent of the investment budget in
2010 to 11 percent in 2013 and 9 percent in 2014, but this increase was largely driven by employment
and support for university-level education which averaged nearly 3 percent and 2 percent of the BCI
respectively. Pre-school and primary education, for example, received only 0.01 percent of budgeted
resources in 2014, the lowest of any sub-category and down from 0.25 percent in 2010. Health and
social affairs fared a bit better, increasing its envelope from 1.2 percent to 2.6 percent over the period.
56.     The Multi-sectoral Projects category received approximately 14 percent of the total
investment budget allocation in 2014, and double what it received in 2010. This category includes 33
projects that span multiple sectors. The largest single budget line under this category in the 2015
investment budget is the Anti-Slavery Program (MRO 7.3 billion – US$ 24 million), followed by General
Reserves (MRO 6.2 billion – US$ 20.6 million), Emergency Operation (MRO 5 billion – US$ 16.6 million),
and the Rural Oasis Development Program (MRO 4.8 billion – US$ 16 million). The Institutional
Development category is intended primarily to strengthen the technical, institutional and organizational
aspects of public administration, and support to reforms in economic governance and the improving the
business climate. It finances general training and capacity building support to public-sector institutions
and NGOs, including the development of sector strategies, technical support, and studies.
57.    On-lending and grants to the national mining company SNIM averaged 3.4 percent of the
investment budget for the period 2010–14. There is little information available on the use of these
resources and there has recently been some debate and controversy around the lack of transparency in

                                                    34
SNIM investments. Despite continued access to cheap credit for investment, neither production nor
financial results have improved during the period. At the same time the SNIM Foundation has co-funded
some large-scale and visible investments such as the second Nouadhibou Regional Hospital (MRO 3
billion – US$ 10 million), the Institute for Hepatitis (MRO 1.6 billion – US$ 5.1 million), and a gateway to
the east (MRO 400 million – US$ 1.3 million).

Operating expenses have increased and transfers to public enterprises are high
58.      A breakdown of the categories used to record investment spending in the national budget
execution reports produced by BOOST show that the share allocated to operating expenses has
increased as a share of investment budget spending from 11.8 to 19.5 percent between 2010 and 2014.
Debt amortization also increased from 13.8 percent to 16.8 percent of investment spending over the
same period (see Figure 2.5), reflecting Mauritania’s relatively high debt levels (over 90 percent of GDP)
and the increased burden of servicing it. Transfers to public enterprises constituted on average 9
percent of the investment budget. Maintenance spending on physical infrastructure comes out of the
recurrent expenditure budget, averaging 7 percent of domestic investment spending (around 3 percent
of total investment spending) and 1 percent of total domestic spending between 2009 and 2014.

59.      The country has also witnessed a significant resurgence of external resources from
development partners following the freeze after the 2008 coup. A review of the commitments made at
the Round Table for Mauritania in Brussels (June 2010) shows that development partners have signed
agreements for over US$3 billion against initial pledges of US$3.233 billion, the equivalent of MRO 921.4
billion. But the absorption of these funds over the same period only reached US$1.099 billion, which
represents an implementation rate of less than 34 percent (Figure 2.3).60 The World Bank and the
European Union are among the major multilateral development partners after the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the Islamic Development Bank; the largest bilateral
development partners are China, France, and Saudi Arabia through the FSD.

partners (Brussels round table development partners and others) reached MRO 1,010,952 billion (US$
3.3 billion), a rate of 109.7 percent of the initial commitments. The sectoral distribution of externally
funded investments (Figure 2.6) shows that infrastructure and construction —electricity, housing, roads,
and water—has benefited from over two thirds (70 percent) of the funds, with nearly a third (30

projects due to delays in donor reporting on expenditures in the DAD.

over 59.8 percent of funding is at national level and in the capital, Nouakchott. Regions like Aftout
Oriental and Hodh Chargui are new destinations for funding. The south and southeast of the
country attracts the bulk of official development assistance.

Little Progress Has Been Made with Public Investment Management
61.     The following section is a summary diagnosis of the Mauritanian public investment
management (PIM) system based on the analytical framework developed by Rajaram et al. (2010).
The same framework was used in the latest Public Expenditure Report 2004–09. It found that the
Mauritanian PIM system lacks basic systems for project appraisal, selection, and monitoring and
evaluation. These findings were confirmed by Mauritania’s scores on the 2011 Public Investment
Management Efficiency Index (Figure 2.7). Like

Strategic guidance:
63.     Broad strategic guidance for public investment is an important way to anchor government
decisions and to guide sector-level decision makers toward national priorities. Guidance may be
derived from a national plan or other medium to long-term strategic document that establishes
economy wide development priorities at the highest decision-making levels. The national plan may be
supplemented by a sector-level or even subsector-level strategy that provides more detailed translation
of the overarching priorities. Beyond the strategic vision or plan, governments also need a formal
process for project development. Line ministries and spending agencies initiating projects for public

                                                           39
investment should prepare a project profile with basic project information, including the relevant
strategic priority and program or subprogram, the specific problem to be addressed, the project
objective, the main activities, the expected results, and the estimated budget. The quality of those
plans, programs and projects, and how well resources are used, are critical factors for success. To
improve the chances of success, attention needs to be placed on some of the common areas of
weakness in guidance. The following questions are examined in the context of guidance:
        Is there well-publicized strategic guidance for public investment decisions at the central,
         ministerial, and provincial levels?
        Is there an established process for screening of project proposals for basic consistency with
         government policy and strategic guidance? Is this process effective?
        What proportion of projects so screened is rejected?
64.      Assessment: there is still a near absence of a legal framework for PIM. Decree 86-78 from 1986
outlines the basic steps for the preparation of the investment budget, but no guidelines, methodologies
or instruments exist for investment project preparation, including technical and economic analyses.61 As
in many aid-dependent countries, the authorities expect development partners to handle all aspects of
project preparation, even as the national investment budget has grown to match externally funded
projects.
65.      In addition to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which provided general priority
areas for investment, an overall MTEF has been elaborated as well as three sectoral MTEFs and some
sectoral development strategies. However, only the education sector strategy (2011–2020 National
Program for the Development of the Education Sector; NPDES), health (National Health Development
Plan 2012–2020), and employment (National Employment Strategy and Action Plan 2009–2013)
strategies have specific expenditure forecasts. Of the three sectoral strategies, only the NPDES appears
to be articulated with a sector MTEF and the annual budget forecast. However, the strategic documents
only inform the investment budget in a very limited manner, as indicated by the very significant budget
discrepancies between the various instruments as noted in the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment from 2014. For example, the PRSP notes the need to rehabilitate
schools and build new ones, yet the investment budget allocated to the primary education sector is one
of the lowest in the entire investment budget (0.1 percent of the budget). Other PRSP priority areas are
more clearly identifiable in the investment budget profile. Development partners generally align their
projects with the main strategic instruments, although the categories are too broad to be useful for the
screening or selection of projects. Investment projects are not always developed on the basis of need and
an analysis of alternative solutions. In fact, filtering and project selection seems to work in reverse; the
government first seeks funding and then adjusts the budget, PIP and PRSP to include it. The main criteria
for project selection seems to be the availability of financing and not strategic importance, in-depth
analysis of alternative solutions to a challenge, or even a review of project proposals.
Project appraisal and review:
66.      Project Appraisal serves to determine whether to go ahead with an investment project
proposal or not. Several steps are usually involved including pre-feasibility and feasibility studies
determining technical, social, environmental and economic viability of the project, including of different
design alternatives. For project appraisal to be effective, technical guidance and capacity, funding and a
relatively clear process and allocation of responsibilities for the appraisal should be in place. The project
selection process needs to ensure that projects proposed for financing have been evaluated for their

project development and selection.

social and economic value. To do so effectively, governments should have formal and well-publicized
guidance on the technical aspects of project appraisal appropriate to the technical capacity of ministries
and departments. The guidance should describe techniques of economic evaluation that are appropriate
to the scale and scope of the project—with larger projects requiring more rigorous tests of financial and
economic feasibility and sustainability. The project appraisal process should consider project proposals
of different scales and take into account the key macro, sectoral, and project-specific uncertainties such
as inflation, cost overrun, change in output, and key input prices over the project life. The following
diagnostic questions are used as a reference for assessing practices relative to project appraisal and
independent review:
       Is there a formal pre-feasibility study process before the formal appraisal process of feasibility
        study?
       Is there a formal cost-benefit appraisal process for more detailed evaluation (whether at the line
        ministry or the central finance agency level) of public investment project proposals?
       If yes, is appraisal mandatory for all projects or only for projects above a certain monetary
        value? Is project appraisal undertaken only for specific sectors and, if so, which sectors? What
        proportion of public investment projects is formally appraised for costs and benefits?
       Is there a formal manual or guidelines for cost-benefit appraisal? What are they? What is the
        quality of such appraisal manual or guidelines?
       Are project appraisals formally undertaken by the sponsoring department or by an external
        agency? What is the quality of such appraisals?
       What proportion of such appraisals is rejected or sent back for amendment?
67.      Assessment: project appraisals are generally carried out for donor-funded projects and by
development partners themselves, although practices vary widely. Formal appraisals do not take place
for projects financed by domestic resources. As a result, some investment projects included in the
budget are of poor quality, with issues such as underestimating needs or costs, omissions, and over-
ambitious timeframes. Although the government has made efforts to filter projects there is still no
evaluation that would allow more transparency and efficiency in the selection of major public
investment projects. Some development partners, such as the World Bank and the EU explicitly require
an analysis of costs and benefits (economic, financial, social) of investment projects, but this is not the
case for all development partners and also does not apply to investment projects financed domestically.
The strategic role of the MAED in the investment budget process is unclear and is often seen as being
limited to facilitating contact between sectors and development partners to mobilize resources rather than
functioning as an arbiter, standard setter, and quality controller for investment projects.
68.      No independent reviews of project appraisals take place and there is no institution charged with
such reviews. The internal auditor of Mauritania has a broad mandate to carry out functional reviews of
all public institutions, including audits of investment projects, yet it lacks the capacity or technical skills
to review investment projects. Although it does carry out some audits of public works, its intervention is
usually at the final/completion stage of investment projects and usually focuses on compliance audits.
The need for independent project reviews and improved accountability in public investment was
highlighted in the recent controversy regarding the investment in the fish freezing and processing plant
of a Chinese company, where some felt that the public benefit it provided was doubtful.
Project selection and budgeting:
69.     The overall criteria for a functioning public investment selection and budgeting system follows
from the general functionalities of good budgeting, i.e. allocative efficiency, operational effectiveness
and fiscal discipline. Ideally a fiscal framework and the annual budget circular would establish the

                                                      41
overall and sectoral envelope for public investments and would ensure that adequate funding is
allocated to maintenance of completed projects/assets. The pressures to include any given project in
the budget – independent of the results of any appraisal – can be significant. Stakeholders who stand to
benefit from a proposal will mobilize to ensure that funding is provided. This makes the existence of a
“gate keeper function? important to ensuring that only viable projects are included in the budget and
that the overall envelope is fiscally responsible.
70.       The following key questions are examined in the context of selection and budgeting:
         Is there an effective process to control the gates to the budgeted PIP? Is there an established
          but limited process for including projects for emergency or politically imperative reasons?
         Is final project selection undertaken as part of the budget process or prior to the budget
          process? Does the government maintain an inventory of appraised projects for budgetary
          consideration? Are public investment projects selected and funded through extra-budgetary
          channels?
         What is the role of the legislature, including special legislative committees, in the selection of
          public investment projects? Does the legislature’s involvement cover both budgetary and extra-
          budgetary channels?
         What proportion of the public investment program (PIP, the collection of projects that are
          formally approved for budget allocation and implementation) is donor-financed? Are donor-
          financed projects subject to the same or different rules for appraisal and inclusion in the budget
          as government financed projects? If the rules are different, describe the difference.
         What is the average value of new projects relative to the ongoing public investment projects
          and projects completed?
71.      Assessment: during the period 2004–09 covered by the last PER most investments were
financed by donor funding and government financing of the investment program was limited mostly to
contributing counterpart funds. Currently, however, about half of the public investment program—
nearly US$400 million—is government financed. Development partners generally follow their own rules
and procedures for project selection, development, and appraisal. The rules and criteria for including
projects in the national budget are not clearly defined, except for general alignment with broad
priorities outlined in the PRSP and other strategic documents, a principle which development partners
generally respect although the categories are broad enough to accommodate almost any investment
project idea. Basically, if external funding is available, is it included in the budget? The government is
closely involved in project development, design, and budgeting and government institutions generally
express quite clearly their priorities and needs during the preparatory process. However, poor
coordination amongst institutions, an unwillingness to collaborate, and frequent turnover of key
technical staff complicate the project preparation process, and donor-funded projects often need to be
restructured in order to avoid overlaps and double funding. The practices for the preparation of
domestically financed projects are not clear, but public-sector staff say that political lobbying, rather
than technical aspects, is the main requirement for getting any project into the national budget.
Project implementation and adjustment:
72.     Problems in implementation can at times be related to poor project selection and budgeting.
Clear responsibilities for implementation, institutional capacity to manage and monitor project
implementation, timelines, total project cost management system, multi-year budgeting and effective
procurement are important elements of a well-functioning public investment management system.
Managing the total cost of projects over their life requires a multi-year budgeting process and an
accounting system that captures and reports all project costs rather than accounting by separate
contracts or stages and tracking against annual appropriations. Project proposals, especially for a large

                                                     42
infrastructure project, should also present organizational arrangements for running the project once the
construction is finished. Although, implementation problems can at times be related to poor project
selection and budgeting they are often due to procurement challenges. Procurement is thus a special
area of focus as the mechanisms for selection and contracting of contractors influence price, quality and
facilitate or mitigate fraud and corruption risks. A recent review of about 500 projects funded by the
World Bank across all regions concluded that unsatisfactory procurement performance significantly
affected the development outcomes of projects, with those outcomes being three to five times more
likely to be negative in cases with poor procurement performance.62 Another important aspect of
implementation is the ability to handle project adjustments. Costs of materials might fluctuate, the cost
of funding might change, physical and social conditions on the ground might not be as predicted,
providers might not perform as expected and political demands might evolve as the project is
implemented leading to design adjustments. The following diagnostic questions guides the assessment:
        What is the completion rate of the PIP (annual average over the past five years), defined as the
         annual public investment budget divided by the estimated cost to complete the current PIP?
         How does this completion rate differ across key sectors—education, health, water supply and
         sanitation, roads, and power, for example?
        Are project-implementing agencies required to prepare periodic progress reports on projects?
         Do these reports include updated cost-benefit analyses?
        Are the sponsoring departments accountable for changes recorded in either costs or benefits
         and for the delivery of net benefits? What mechanisms exist to ensure that this occurs? Does
         the government have a decision process to close down projects which have shown significant
         cost overruns or time delays which render them uneconomic? For a representative subset of the
         PIP, what is the average percentage cost overrun (in inflation-adjusted terms) on major projects
         in key sectors?
        Has the government rationalized its PIP in the recent past? Did it result in the cancellation or
         closure of ongoing projects—and if so, what percentage of the PIP was cancelled or closed?
         Indicate whether projects were merely “deferred? rather than cancelled.
73.      Assessment: the authorities are unable to provide up to date information on the completion
rate of the PIP and the consolidated investment budget by project. Expenditures are recorded by
economic and/or institutional categories only. At the time of the last PIP update in 2014, a general
overview of planned expenditures and actual expenditures by project was carried out. However, the
review seems incomplete and full of significant data gaps. For example, it shows an overall execution
rate of just over 5.7 percent, but with significant variations amongst projects. At least two thirds of the
listed projects show a 0 percent execution rate. Other projects range from just over 1 percent to over
200 percent execution rates. Also, the information in the PIP differs significantly from that of the
consolidated investment budget (BCI). For example, there are only 131 projects listed in the PIP, valued
at 165 MRO Bn (US$ 550 million), whereas the BCI includes 323 projects, budgeted at 236 MRO Bn (US$
786 million). Neither the MAED nor any sector ministries have an updated database or any other
systems to monitor the financial and physical execution of projects. The DAD is updated on an irregular
basis and information is incomplete. Monitoring happens at project level, and for large infrastructure
projects there are sometimes independent third-party monitors for technical aspects, but no systematic
analysis is carried out during project implementation to examine progress across a larger set of the
portfolio at either sector or geographical area. There has been no effort to assess the completion rate of
the investment program, including trends on time and cost compliance, contract revisions, and any

overruns. The procurement control commission is supposed to monitor contract implementation but
have never prepared any reports. Line ministries do not submit periodic and regular reports on the
progress of projects to ensure that funds are spent as intended (on time, for the purposes intended,
within the planned budget). The audits carried out by the procurement control commission provides a
physical visit to a sample of investment projects,63 and these reports include basic statistics on the
procurement methods used by each sectoral procurement commission and a summary opinion on each
contract, but the level of detail and analysis is very limited. There is no information on contract
execution for example.
74.     Most donor-funded projects are managed by project implementation units (PIUs) which
operate outside of the public administration and following donor-specific fiduciary arrangements. This
complicates the monitoring and follow up of investment projects by the authorities. In recent years, the
authorities have made efforts to ensure greater integration of donor-funded projects. As a result, most
procurement is now subject to review by the national procurement commissions. (See the following
section for a review of the public procurement system). In 2014, the number of PIUs was estimated at
around 26, with 14 of these managing World Bank-funded projects. While PIUs may facilitate project
execution and improve financial control, they create parallel administrative structures that undertake
work which the public sector should be doing. PIUs will also often attract the best staff due to offering
higher salaries than in the public sector. In addition, PIUs rarely increase the technical and managerial
capacity of the public administration because their lifespan is limited. Nevertheless, given the significant
weaknesses in the Mauritanian public sector many development partners opt for the continued use of
PIUs.
75.     In 2009, the government established an agency for investment planning, monitoring, and
evaluation (ANESP). The agency is attached directly to the Presidency and its objective is to improve
PIM in Mauritania through technical and strategic support for the entire project cycle. The agency
focuses on a limited number of high-profile projects, but remains largely absent from the broader public
investment process, which is controlled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED)
and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), with inputs from sector ministries. In February 2016
the government decided to merge the MEF and the MAED. This provides an opportunity for the
authorities to bring much-needed coherence to the entire budgeting process, including preparing the
investment budget and monitoring investment projects.
76.      Project adjustment: there is no evidence that a rationalization of the public investment program
has ever been undertaken in Mauritania. A review of the latest updated PIP for the period 2013–15
shows no reduction or cancellation of non-performing projects for example. Adjustments to the PIP are
mainly related to funding availability. Adjustments to individual projects do take place, mostly relating to
project duration (usually extension), revision of the contract value, additional work specifications, and so
on. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that contract value adjustments are a regular occurrence and
that there are few controls in place to prevent bidders from winning contracts on the basis of
unrealistically low cost estimates which are then adjusted upwards once the contracts are signed. Fines
are sometimes levied on contractors who fail to meet contractual agreements but this is not done in a
systematic manner. Given the lack of analytical work on the existing investment portfolio, the
authorities are unable to produce information on core PIM metrics such as the average percentage cost
or time overrun for any part of the investment portfolio. Development partners regularly carry out
adjustments/revisions to their projects during implementation, often triggered by the need to avoid
double funding the same activity. Given poor coordination and the practice of submitting multiple

similar funding requests, it is often necessary to make adjustments to similar projects affecting the same
beneficiaries.
Facility Operation
77.     Following project completion, it is important to have a process ensuring that the facility is
ready for operation and that services can be delivered. This process should include an effective
mechanism to hand over the management responsibility for future operation and maintenance of the
investment, and ensure that there is adequate budget funding of service delivery agencies to operate
and maintain these assets. In addition to the above, completed investment projects should be included
in an asset registry and its value accounted for. The following diagnostic questions are examined the
context of guidance:
       Are there long delays in completed projects becoming operational? Is this a general problem, or
        is it limited to some sectors or projects?
       Is there a process for handover of management responsibility for future operation and
        maintenance of the created assets to service delivery agencies?
       Do service delivery agencies have adequate budget funding to operate and maintain these
        assets? Is service delivery associated with facility operation tracked through time? Are agencies
        held accountable for the delivery of services? Do facilities charge for access, and are such fees
        earmarked for facility operation and maintenance?
       Does the government maintain an asset register or inventory of public sector property such as
        equipment and vehicles? Is legal title to assets maintained?
       Are assets valued according to sound accounting principles, such that the accounting definition
        of an asset is met, depreciation is deducted from the asset value, and, where feasible, asset
        values are updated to reflect changed prices?
78.      Assessment: a lack of coordination between the preparation of the recurrent and investment
budgets has contributed to insufficient planning and budgeting for facility operations. Sector ministries
report that they are not receiving sufficient funds to operate and maintain facilities which have recently
been completed and this frequently leads to delays in making investments operational. There is no
overall instrument to calculate or estimate operational costs for investment projects and the institutions
responsible for operating and maintaining investments are left to make the case for such funding.
Where mechanisms have been designed to ensure sufficient operations and maintenance for large
infrastructure projects, the high degree of informality and a weak compliance culture has prevented
these from working sufficiently. For an example from the roads sector is illustrative: the roads agency
ENER was set up in 1994 to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the roads network in
Mauritania. However, since 2010 it has focused largely on road construction, paying less attention to its
maintenance responsibilities.
79.      Completion reviews and evaluations do not take place in a systematic manner. Some
development partners carry out their own completion reviews and these are shared with the
authorities. The MAED itself has not produced any evaluation reports on the PIP between 2010 and
2014 and no information is available regarding any closing visits or reviews. Audit reports from the
General State Inspectorate (Inspection Générale d’Etat; IGE) may cover some elements of project
completion, but these are not shared with anyone beyond the Prime Minister’s office and the reviewed
institution. The authorities do not maintain an asset register or inventory of public-sector property and
other assets.
80.    In sum, the Mauritanian PIM system exhibits all the regular features of public investment in
aid-dependent countries, as summarized in Box 2.1 below.

                                                   45
                           Box 2.1: Common Features of PIM in Donor-Dependent Countries

  PIM systems in donor-dependent settings tend to exhibit the following distinctive features:
  Investment guidance, project development and preliminary screening: government strategy documents, such as public
  investment programs, MTEFs and PRSPs, tend to be directed towards development partners, rather than covering both
  external and domestic investment in an integrated and coherent manner. They are at a level of generality that limits the
  extent to which they can provide a basis for preliminary screening of projects, and are often not supported by effective
  sector strategies.
  Formal project appraisal: there is a reliance on development partners to conduct appraisal, with a serious lack of
  appraisal capacity within government; and a lack of guidance on defining the project preparation process and on how to
  appraise domestically-financed projects and public-private partnerships.
  Independent review of appraisal: reflecting reliance on development partners, there is a lack of capacity for any
  independent review of public investment projects.
  Project selection and budgeting: the budget is divided into a recurrent and a development budget, with weak integration
  between the two and substantial off-budget aid. The use of PIPs remains quite common, but these can be poorly
  connected to fiscal policy and the budget. In practice, a PIP tends to be more a coordination/information tool than an
  instrument to manage the project portfolio strategically or to help enforce the review of individual project proposals
  before they can be considered for budget funding. Agreement from a donor to finance a project is tantamount to the
  project being included in the budget—subject to basic screening for consistency with a PRSP (which is not difficult given
  their generality) and any required counterpart financing being affordable.
  Project implementation: unpredictability of donor funding (especially budget support) interrupts project implementation
  due to lack of alternative financing. Weak project management capacity induces development partners to set up multiple
  project implementation units (PIUs) within implementing agencies that initially help to speed implementation and
  compliance with fiduciary standards, but which cut across and impact negatively on internal capacities, and accounting
  and reporting systems. Procurement is undertaken by PIUs or development partners to development partners’ standards
  rather than national procurement standards.
  Project adjustment: reliance on development partners to trigger review of any projects that are off track. No similar
  mechanism for domestically-financed projects.
  Facility operation: formal hand-over procedures on completion of donor projects, but inadequate asset registration
  systems; and inadequate funding for operations and maintenance, in part due to weak integration of recurrent costs of
  donor projects in fiscal policy and budgets.
  Basic completion review and evaluation: reliance on development partners to undertake reviews and evaluations of their
  projects. Little or no systematic basic post-project review or evaluation, and little systematic use made of findings from
  donor evaluations to improve future project design and implementation.

Procurement Reforms Begun in 2010 Have Not Brought About the Desired Results
81.      Mauritania’s modernized procurement system aims to make the system more transparent,
efficient and accountable in accordance with international standards. In the face of budget constraints
and the need to fight corruption, the Mauritanian government embarked on reforming the procurement
law and strengthening its institutional foundations to better manage and controlling procurement. The
new Law on Procurement (2010) requires all public procurement to be conducted in accordance with
the principles of separating procurement, control, and regulation. The law led to the establishment of
several public bodies for contract awards, control, and regulation, set out procedural rules (whose
provisions include the advertising and public display of bid opportunities, and notices of best evaluated
bidder and contract award) and lays out procedures for complaints. Since its adoption, the Procurement

                                                              46
Regulatory Authority (ARMP), a control commission (Commission Nationale de Contrôle des Marchés
Publics; CNCMP) and sectoral procurement commissions (CSMs) were set up, staffed, and are
operational. Several directives, instructions, and tools (CAD-type Procedures Manual, single web portal,
etc.) were adopted to reflect the new principles of procurement and procurement tools. According to
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology and the OECD/Development
Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS), both
carried out in 2014,64 the new procurement system is consistent with international standards with
regard to publication requirements, the comprehensiveness and transparency of the legal framework,
and the functioning of the complaint system. Nevertheless, both assessments also point to a number of
remaining crucial challenges in effectively reforming the system.
82.      Based on the OECD/DAC MAPS baseline indicators, the assessment found areas of strengths
but also weaknesses in compliance and performance. The assessment examined the legal and
regulatory framework, the institutional arrangements, the operational practices, and the
competitiveness of the procurement system as well as its integrity and transparency (see Table 2.4).
Overall, it assessed Mauritania’s public procurement system as strong on the legislative and regulatory
framework (Pillar I), but with still much room for improvement in the three other areas (Pillars II–IV). A
more detailed assessment based on the 12 baseline indicators shows the degree of access to
information (Indicator 11), the efficiency of appeals mechanism (Indicator 10), and the public
procurement legislative and regulatory framework (Indicator 1) were among the strongest features of
Mauritania’s procurement system. In contrast, the most significant weaknesses were found in
institutional development capacity (Indicator 5), the control and audit system (Indicator 9), and the
efficiency of the country’s procurement operations and practices (Indicator 6).

83.     Pillar I assesses the legal and regulatory framework from the highest level down to the more
detailed operational procedures, guidelines, model tender documents, and standard conditions of
contract. With the enactment of its new procurement law, Mauritania has in place a sound and
comprehensive legal framework for public procurement with clear hierarchical distinctions (laws,
decrees, regulations, procedures). The law covers the procurement of goods, works, and services. It
establishes open competitive tendering as the default procurement method, and defines the situations
in which other, less competitive, methods can be used. However, the legislative and regulatory
framework lacks operational regulations (i.e. related to bidding thresholds, the delegation of services,
the determination of illegal fractions). Model tender documents still need to be made mandatory and
appropriate standards have not yet been specified in tender documents consistent with national
requirements and, when applicable, international requirements.
84.      Pillar II assesses how the procurement system is operating through the institutions and
management systems and practices forming part of the overall public sector governance. In
accordance with the new act, the creation of the ARMP, the CNCMP, and the CMS seek to ensure the
regular function of the system. The ARMP’s responsibilities are in conformity with international best
practice and it is well funded. The agency is also not responsible for undertaking procurement
operations directly in order to prevent conflict of interest for procurement officials. The nomination of
staff by the Prime Minister or the President (for the Head of the AMRP) and staff recruitment on a
competitive basis ensures the independence it requires. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the
procurement systems’ regular functioning is severely constrained by a number of factors: (i) the
agencies are largely staffed with temporary workers (“contractuals?), adversely affecting their authority,
responsibilities, and performance; (ii) the agencies lack leadership and coordination, notably between
the ARMP and the CNCMP; (iii) agencies’ functions are not always clear and overlap with other
responsibilities; (iv) control functions are lacking for a substantial portion of procurement related to
services and supplies, with thresholds at MRO 100 million (US$ 333 million); (v) there are no established
procedures to ensure that the budget law and budget management support timely procurement; (vi) no
statistical data collection system is in place—a task of the CNCMP; (vii) despite initiating a capacity-
building strategy, there is still no in-house training structure; and (viii) the institutional setting lacks
procurement units established at the level of Finance Departments and implementing agencies (Table
2.5).

   85.      Pillar III looks at the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the procurement system at the
   level of the implementing entity responsible for issuing individual procurement actions. The
   implementing agencies’ efficiency in administering procurement in accordance with regulations is
   severely undermined by a lack of procurement knowledge, mostly attributable to the implementing
   agencies’ loss of procurement staff to the newly created procurement agencies and the lack of
   procurement capacity development (see also Pillar II). There is still no system for safekeeping of records
   and documents, which affects the government’s ability to look at implementation performance and the
   functioning of the control system. In addition, if a procurement system is to function well, it needs a
   well-operating and competitive private sector. Despite the existence of a Chamber of Commerce under
   the Ministry of Commerce, Mauritania does not have a well-established mechanism for public-private
   partnerships. Access to the procurement market is hampered because of poor procurement knowledge
   among private bidders, a weakness further exacerbated by the absence of initiatives to build
   procurement capacity. Another major constraint for private-sector participation in competition for
   public contracts are the oligopolistic or monopolistic features in important segments of the market, such
   as large-scale building contracts given to public companies outside the public procurement process.
   Lastly, while disputes during contract implementation are common and contribute to delays, Mauritania
   does not have a resolution process defined in its contracts and procedures to enforce the outcome of
   the dispute resolution process.

                                                                     49
86.      Pillar IV examines the adequacy of control systems (including an effective control and audit
system, an efficient appeals mechanism and a comprehensive information sharing system) and
measures to address the potential for corruption in the system. An independent and well-functioning
internal and external audit function are important to ensure compliance and to detect fraud and
corruption. Mauritania’s audit structure suffers from a lack of legal provisions for internal audits and
poor follow up on external audit recommendations. Even though the ARMP is adequately resourced to
conduct annual procurement audits, it is severely constrained by the absence of an integrated
information system and the lack of reporting on procurement operations below a certain threshold
level. External control is partly ineffective as evidenced by the absence of a mechanism for reporting
fraud and corruption or for civil society’s participation in monitoring procurement processes. In contrast,
a well-functioning and independent complaint and appeal mechanism was established and the system is
accessible to the public. The establishment of the new procurement agencies substantially improved the
dissemination of information on government procurement with each agency having its own website and
posting timely information on procurement notices and awards. Information (invitations to tender,
notices of interim and final awards, etc.) are also published in the national press.
87.     Public procurement is a high risk area for fraud and corruption due to the allocation of large
and potentially lucrative contracts for companies that win them. Despite these risks, the systems for
detecting, uncovering and prosecuting corrupt practices are weak or absent in Mauritania. Despite a few
isolated cases and some noise in the media there isn’t much information available on how the
authorities are combating corruption. Mauritania’s accountability institutions do not actively report on
the findings of their audit and control work and they do not have in place mechanisms for working with
the public to uncover fraud and corruption. The Procurement Control Commission does not report on
fraud and corruption in procurement, and neither do the external or internal auditors. Despite being
foreseen by the current legislation, there is no system in place for debarment of firms found guilty of
procurement fraud.
88.     Mauritania is currently ranked 112 out of 168 countries (29th percentile) on Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions index. Mauritania’s score on the control of corruption indicator
of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) set dropped from 45th to 18th percentile between 2004
and 2014, which is a considerable deterioration from 2004 when Mauritania scored above lower middle
income countries and the SSA average whereas today it is below both. The 2016 Global
Competitiveness Index identifies Corruption as the third most problematic factor for doing business in
Mauritania, after access to financing and poor infrastructure.

89.      The authorities have recently passed a new Anti-Corruption Law in Parliament (February 2016)
and it is currently awaiting promulgation. The new law aims to; (i) put in place measures to criminalize
and penalize corruption in all its forms (ii) facilitate and support international cooperation and technical
assistance for the fight against corruption, and (iii) facilitate the recovery of ill-gotten assets. While no
single legislation was in place prior to this law, the legal basis for an effective fight against corruption
was already in place through other pieces of legislation (Procurement Code, Penal Code) and
Mauritanian’s ratification of international legal instruments (Africa Union Convention Against
Corruption, UN Conventions Against Corruption). In addition, the Fisheries Transparency Initiative (FITI),
an international initiative launched by the Mauritanian government and Transparency International
aims to bring greater transparency to fisheries licenses. But the new law and other transparency
standards will only have an impact on corruption if they are effectively implemented, and this is the
major area of weakness in Mauritania.

                                Box 2.2: Recent Corruption Cases in Mauritania

 The two most recent corruption cases in Mauritania have both been initiated by foreign governments :
 The Canadian mining giant Kinross’ Mauritania operation is currently under investigation by the US
 authorities in relation to a 50 USD million transport and logistics contract awarded to a French company in
 partnership with a Mauritanian company owned by a former high ranking government official. Internal
 documents showed that the determining factor for the winning bid seems to have been “political
 advantages? rather than price, and that it was the “stated preference of the authorities? (Globe and Mail
 2016). The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower.
 In a case prosecuted by the UKs Serious Fraud Office (SFO) a UK company (Smith and Ouzman) was convicted
 of bribing an official in the ministry of the interior in connection with a contract for the purchase of printed
 elections material (Corruption Watch 2016). Mauritanian authorities were slow in collaborating with the UK
 authorities and the official remained in service long after the case was concluded in the UK (December
 2014). In March 2016 the authorities finally took action and charged the official with bribery,
 misappropriation of state property and breach of trust. The official is currently awaiting sentencing. In the
 UK, the company senior management were given jail sentences and the company was ordered to pay 2.2 Mn
 pounds (3.1 Million) in fines and damages. A small part of these funds will be transferred back to
 Mauritania..
 There have been several other allegations circulating in the local Mauritanian media related to possible
 public sector fraud and corruption, such as the award of a 25 year fishing license to the Chinese company
 Poly Hongdong with several exceptions to national legislation, and to the transfer of large tracts of arable
 land in Dar el Barka to a Saudi Arabian company in exchange for unknown services to GoM, amongst others,
 but very few such allegations are followed up on and investigated and prosecuted by the relevant
 authorities. A notable exception is the 2014 case of theft or around 4 bn MRO (US$ 13 million) for which
 five accountants in the regional Treasury offices were jailed. The internal audit function of the treasury was
 subsequently strengthened.



90.     A genuine effort to combat corruption will require a willingness of the judicial authorities to
proactively seek to uncover and aggressively handle cases of corruption and fraud and for the
authorities to improve their communication with the citizens and the media. The general lack of
transparency in public affairs contributes to speculation around the motives of certain government
decisions. Promoting a culture of openness and transparency can be a dissuasive factor for public sector
personnel who would otherwise be tempted to engage in corrupt practices and it can also help prevent
unwarranted suspicions around government actions.

Despite Increased Public Investments, their Quality and Economic Impact Remain Uncertain
91.      Investment in infrastructure can have a positive effect on a country’s economy. Evidence
shows that insufficient physical infrastructure is a drag on productivity growth for LICs. This is especially
important for the agriculture, manufacturing, and education sectors, in order to ensure economic
diversification and a reduced reliance on extractives-driven growth as well as for social returns in the
form of poverty reduction. But there are downside risks if public investments do not yield the expected
economic returns. Mauritania’s fiscal expansion is based on an assumption that expanded public
investment will boost economic activity and thereby deliver increased revenues needed to meet future
loan repayments. However, this requires investment in viable projects with good returns and an efficient
system to manage the investments during and after construction. There is some evidence that public

                                                        52
investment’s contribution to economic growth has been low in recent years in spite of the increase in
investment spending.
92.      Despite rapidly growing public investment expenditures in recent years, which are high by
regional standards, economic growth has been in line with the Sub-Saharan Africa average and
progress on social indicators has been limited. This calls into question the efficiency of public
investments in Mauritania. The incremental capital to output ratio (ICOR) for Mauritania is 10.4,
indicating low productivity of capital,65 and therefore a low level of efficiency of public investments.
Total factor productivity (TFP) has contributed negatively to growth in the 2000s at -1.8 percent,
compared to a positive impact of +1.7 percent on average for LICs (IMF 2015). The quality of
Mauritanian infrastructure is low. It scores above its peers on electricity supply, but below other low-
income countries (LICs) on roads, ports and air transport infrastructure (Figure 2.9). The quality of other
infrastructure, such as rural/agricultural and social infrastructure is unknown.

93.     Getting a higher return on its public investments will become increasingly important for
Mauritania in the medium term given the shrinking fiscal space brought about by lower commodity
prices—combined with a high and growing debt to GDP ratio. This, again, will require major
improvements to its public investment management systems, whose significant weaknesses have been
outlined above. Weak PIM systems can reduce the economic and social impact of public investment.
The IMF estimates that weak PIM systems reduces the value of public investments by 30 percent on
average, and that strengthening PIM systems can help close two thirds of that efficiency gap.
94.     In addition to strengthening its PIM system, the authorities also need to consider its broader
investment strategy, since it can also determine the social and economic impacts of its public
investments. Unfortunately, the analysis tools at the government’s disposal to weigh up the costs and
benefits of different investment strategies are either too general or specific. While debt sustainability

     A higher number indicates lower productivity of capital. The Africa regional average is 3.

                                                                    53
analyses (DSAs)66 are frequently useful in estimating overall resource limits, they are unable to provide a
picture of the overall impact on the economy. Similar tools are only able to provide broad assumptions
about future GDP growth rates, inflation, exports, and fiscal revenues. On the other hand, computable
general equilibrium (CGE) models provide a more systematic approach. They can be used to assess the
impacts of large public investment projects on increased demand for services—agriculture, construction,
services, transport, manufacturing—and the supply-side effects of increased productivity in sectors that
benefit from the completed project. However, there are a number of problems with CGE models.
Producing a model requires considerable resources and can be very complicated. Such models are often
too general to be of use in estimating the impact of specific projects or programs. Moreover, their
complex nature often prevents others from being able to successfully apply them to key issues.
95.      The following paragraphs summarize the results of a study commissioned by the government
of Mauritania to estimate the impact of its PIP on key macroeconomic variables, such as exports,
imports, GDP, fiscal balance, debt, and net domestic assets. The model used assesses the increase in
demand that occurs as a result of public investment program and the boost to supply generated by its
completion. It also estimates the impact on real prices, revealing any potential “Dutch disease? effects
caused by additional demand that cannot be fully met by a corresponding supply response. Over the
past five years, the PIP has significantly grown in value, buoyed by increased tax revenues, donor flows,
non-tax revenues (particularly iron ore) and fishing proceeds. By 2014 the PIP constituted around
14 percent of GDP. However, analysis on its impact on the economy has been limited.
96.     The model draws on IMF data to derive Mauritania’s monetary, national, fiscal and balance of
payments accounts. A number of steps were applied to construct the model. The first step was to
project the accounts forward to 2050 using conservative assumptions and reflecting historical long-term
trends where possible.67 Second, baseline accounts were derived after removing the PIP and its expected
impact from the macroeconomic accounts for 2014–50. Third, assumptions were made on the likely
flows of PIP funds and their impact on the economy (demand effects), and the expected benefits
accruing (see Annex A3 for a detailed description of the methodology and assumptions).
Baseline scenario:
97.      The total cost of the PIP is estimated at around MRO 615 billion (US$ 2.1 billion) over 2014-16,
which is around 11-14 percent of GDP per annum. Implementation of the PIP will increase aggregate
demand during 2014–16, particularly for the key sectors of transportation, construction, services,
manufacturing, and agriculture.68 However, domestic demand effects are expected to be significantly
reduced, because a significant proportion of PIP resources are assumed to be spent on imports of labor
and capital. Moreover, price effects are expected to be significant, while supply effects will be small due
to the limited time period. After the PIP implementation period it is expected to generate a 6 percent
return in terms of increased GDP. This will result in increased exports, investment, taxes, and
consumption.
98.     The PIP will have a modest effect on the GDP deflator, due to a reasonable proportion of the
PIP being spent on imports. Nevertheless, it will have significant price effects in key sectors. Figure 2.10
below shows that the impact of the PIP is particularly pronounced for the construction sector, which
witnesses as sharp increase in the GDP deflator in 2014, before gradually returning to trend after 2016.

66
   A DSA typically assesses the impact of different economic policies on key macroeconomic variables, such as the debt-to-GDP
ratio or the debt-service-to-exports ratio over a given time horizon to ascertain the sustainability of debt.
67
   For example, some line items are assumed to have stagnant growth. For example, projections for donor financing are based
on existing trends, with the assumption of no new investment.
68
   Note, for simplicity other sectors were assumed to not be affected by the PIP.

                                                             54
This is in part due to the completed program’s impact on economic productivity, and the increase in
supply prompted by additional demand during its construction. As Figure 2.10 illustrates, the model
estimates that the impact of implementing the PIP will slightly raise GDP between 2014 and 2016.
During this phase, the most significant increases in supply are projected to occur in the construction and
agricultural sectors. Once the PIP has been implemented, it is estimated it will raise the level of real GDP
by 3.2 percent in 2019, causing an upward shift in the trend path of real GDP. It should be noted that
the model does not consider multiplier effects resulting from the benefits accruing from the PIP, which
would likely increase the PIP’s estimated rate of return and lessen its impact on debt sustainability.
99.    The PIP will have a short-term impact on imports and a longer-term impact on exports. As
Figure 2.10 shows, imports are estimated to rise by around 12 percent during the program’s
construction phase. The PIP is expected to permanently increase exports by around 2.4 percent in 2019.

100. Finally, the impact of the PIP on the fiscal situation is considerable. The implementation of the
PIP entails considerable fiscal costs, and while some of these are covered by revenues and grants, a
sizeable proportion are covered by borrowing. The PIP is estimated to change a fiscal surplus of 13
percent of GDP under the baseline scenario to a fiscal deficit of 1.1 percent with the PIP.69 The cost of
servicing the loans used to finance the PIP means the higher costs will continue after the program is
completed, but given the largely concessional nature of the debt, this is more than offset by additional
tax revenues generated by increased production. The debt profile is outlined in Figure 2.11. The initial
impact of the PIP in 2014–16 is to keep debt levels roughly constant. Under the baseline scenario the
resultant fiscal surplus from not implementing the PIP means the government becomes a net creditor,
peaking at around 5 percent of GDP. However, there is a resultant linear increase in debt under this
scenario over the period with debt reaching parity with the debt profile under the PIP.



69
  Please note, while the baseline assumption that the money not spent on the PIP is saved may seem unrealistic,
this for the purposes of the counterfactual. Further assumptions such as assuming a commensurate fall in tax
revenues to offset the fall in public expenditure would lead to further effects on the economy.

Calculating the Internal Rate of Return
101. To ascertain whether the impact of the program represents a worthwhile financial return for the
government and the economy, the model estimates three internal rates of return (Table 2.6; see Annex
A3 for further details).70
             First, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) calculates the interest rate from the flow of costs
              from the PIP (including debt flows) minus the revenues it will generate. The model estimates the
              PIP to have an FIRR of around 6 percent. This is a strong effect, but reflects the largely
              concessional nature of the debt, and the impact on tax revenues.
             Second, the model calculates the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) by comparing the
              project costs in the year they are incurred and the stream of interest costs with estimated GDP
              effects. The estimated return of 15 percent is in line with what one should expect from a
              commercial program.
             Third, the economy-wide internal rate of return (EWRR) also includes private investment costs
              (suppliers’ investment costs during the implementation of the PIP) as well as project costs and
              benefits. This shows a return of around 12 percent, which in light of additional private
              investment costs is in line with expectations. In conclusion, given the assumption of reasonable
              financing of the PIP through concessional loans, combined with a modest positive impact of the
              PIP on fiscal revenues, the PIP represents a strong FIRR. Similarly, the EWRR of 14 percent
              demonstrates that there are strong economic benefits to implementing the PIP.

Estimating the Macroeconomic Impact of the PIP Under Different Scenarios
102. The model estimates the macroeconomic impact of the PIP under six different scenarios,
outlined in the following paragraphs and summarized in table 2.6 below. See Annex 3 for a more
complete description of the methodology, assumptions and results.
     Table 2.6: Key assumptions and selected results of PIP implementation (in percent of GDP unless otherwise indicated)

70
  To work out internal rates of return, costs and benefits are forecasted forward and the interest rate is calculated for the net
present value to be zero.

Scenario 1: Larger Proportion of the PIP is Implemented by Domestic Labor
103. Scenario 1 assumes a large proportion of the PIP is implemented by domestic labor. This is likely
to be the case in relatively non-capital intensive infrastructure programs, such as road building or where
there is a large increase in public-sector costs due to higher wages and/or increased hiring of public-
sector workers. The result of substituting domestic labor and capital for imported capital increases the
marginal propensity to consume, increasing domestic demand for goods and services during
implementation, resulting in significant price increases rather than supply increases. Therefore, the
impact of the PIP during its implementation period is modest. The impact on the GDP deflator and
construction sector GDP deflator is now greater. Moreover, there is a noticeable impact on imports,
which shrink compared to the original scenario. Finally, rising demand only leads to minor effects by
increasing tax revenue during implementation. As a result, this does not affect the IRRs or the debt
dynamics.
Scenario 2: Financing Terms Closer to Market Rates
104. The second scenario explores the impact of the PIP on macroeconomic variables if its financing
terms were to become less advantageous, which is likely to happen as Mauritania becomes wealthier
and the financing mix becomes more reliant on financing at market prices. Even under adverse loan
terms the effect on debt financing is not severe enough to prompt the government to increase taxes or
reduce spending (in the short to medium term), and as a result its impact on most macroeconomic
variables would be negligible. However, the more expensive debt would push up debt servicing
significantly at the start but would reach lower levels by the end of 2050. The IRRs are estimated to be
significantly affected. In particular, the significant increase in financing costs results in the FIRR
becoming negative (-5). Public programs which rely on significant commercial financing require a
significant revenue-raising component or the imposition of user fees if they are to be financially viable
for governments. Social returns may still justify the investment.
Scenario 3: A Smaller Return to the PIP (2 percent)
105. The original scenario assumes a return of around 6 percent in terms of the benefits of additional
GDP accruing to the PIP. However, it is possible that a number of key projects may not achieve desired
returns due to poor planning, management, implementation and maintenance. In such a scenario,
where there is systematic underperformance of the PIP the return is likely to be small. Scenario 3 looks
at the impact of a 2 percent return on the PIP on the macroeconomic variables. This has a significant

                                                                      57
impact on exports and GDP. The impact of the PIP is negligible, registering only a miniscule effect. The
impact of a lower return to the PIP is to reduce tax revenues thereby increasing financing requirements.
Finally, the IRRs are substantially affected by the assumed lower return to the PIP. The FIRR registers a
negative interest rate principally due to lower tax revenues. Meanwhile, the EWRR and EIRR are
substantially reduced (both 4 percent). Nevertheless, even in this scenario the returns to the economic
internal rate of return suggest there is a modest case for financing the PIP, particularly if there is a
significant social dimension that will accrue benefits over a long period or that are difficult to quantify.
Scenario 4: High imports
106. Under some circumstances highly sophisticated, technical infrastructure programs may require
significant imports of international labor and capital71. In such examples, the resource flows to the
domestic economy are significantly smaller. By lowering demand effects, the GDP deflator would be less
pronounced over the implementation period of the PIP. Moreover, the effect on additional GDP over
the period is negligible. Conversely, the impact on imports is significant. In this type of scenario
therefore implementation of the PIP imposes balance of payments as well as fiscal pressures. Lastly, the
impact on the IRRs is significant. While the impact on the FIRR is small, the significant impact on GDP
during the implementation period lowers the EWRR and EIRR. This issue reinforces the view that
investment programs that do not rely on domestic labor and capital significantly reduce the benefits to
countries. Indeed, many countries have imposed regulations, provided financial incentives or provided
support programs to encourage investment to maximize the use of local resources, particularly, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia. Conversely, research on SSA has noted that where investment is not integrated
within the economy it will have limited impact on the development of the economy.
Scenario 5a: Slightly expanded PIP with a normal return
107. Scenario 5a assumes a slight expansion of the PIP in 2016 from around UM 187 billion to nearly
   UM 196 billion. As figure 8 demonstrates, the impact on the macroeconomic variables is minor and
   not noticeable. Nevertheless, there is a long-run impact due to the slightly elevated resources from
   the PIP, which more than offsets the costs of financing assumed to be largely concessional. In fact,
   the EWRR increases from 12 to 13 percent.
Scenario 5b: Slightly expanded PIP in 2016 with a low return

108. Scenario 5b similarly assumes a slight expansion of the PIP in 2016, but a fall in the PIP’s return
to around 2 percent. As table 9 demonstrates there is very little difference with the impact on the
macroeconomic variables compared to scenario 3. Similarly, the internal rates of return are identical to
those depicted in scenario 3.
Scenario 6: Inefficient Implementation of the PIP
109. Finally, we consider a scenario where planning and management of the PIP is sub-optimal.
Inefficiencies could be due to delays in implementation, costs overruns, and wastage due to corruption.
These inefficiencies are assumed to lower the effectiveness of the investment by around 20 percent. As
the table illustrates, if investments are inefficient then the PIP ceases to be financially viable, with a
return of -9 percent. All other things being equal, this would adversely affect the fiscal accounts.
Similarly, the EWRR and EIRR are noticeably affected. The impact on GDP and exports are slightly
reduced.
110. Applying the model to Mauritania and assessing the macroeconomic effects of public
investments highlights the importance of having a clear public investment strategy and ensuring

                                                                58
efficient PIM. First, the immediate effects of a public investment program will vary depending on the
investment strategy but are generally very positive. Not only do they increase GDP during
implementation, but they also enable linkages to be developed with international labor and capital,
allowing the diffusion of skills and knowledge. Moreover, the impact of the GDP deflator was
manageable despite assuming most of the demand would initially result in higher prices. Second, the
financially viability of the PIP is dependent on assuming only a small proportion of financing is on market
terms. If in future a significant proportion had to be financed on market terms, perhaps due to a
reduction in donor financing, then elements of the program would need to focus on revenue generation
or user fees if the program as a whole were to be financially sustainable. Costly short-term financing
mechanisms may significantly increase debt service payments during the implementation of a program
even if it is expected to generate significant long-term benefits. Third, the analysis is dependent on
assumptions of a modest return to the PIP (6 percent). Given the under-investment in the country this
remains a conservative, robust assumption. However, as shown in Scenario 4, poor project management
leading to time and cost overruns or non-viable investments could reduce potential returns to zero,
making it financially non-viable. The fiscal accounts and debt sustainability would also be adversely
affected.

Key Areas for Reform
       Improve investment budget and project data. In order to permit the assessment of the
        allocative and execution efficiency of the public investment program, the availability of
        investment budget data must be urgently improved. The first priority should be to make it
        possible to track the execution of investment projects outlined in the CIB. Currently, the national
        systems and tools (RACHAD, TOFE) only track budget execution by institution or by economic
        categories, and by funding source. This could be complemented by introducing a project
        category as well. It is also important to ensure timely and complete information on the physical
        and operational progress of investment projects. The authorities could consider a database
        which tracks the entire cycle of each significant investment project
       Develop a clear strategy for public investment based on a better understanding of the
        economic and social impacts and its financial viability in the longer term. Also, ensure that
        investments are better aligned with its strategic priorities. Update and refine sectoral strategies
        and MTEFs and ensure coherence between these, the PIP, and annual investment budget
        proposals.
       Improve investment project preparation and preliminary appraisal. First, develop clear
        guidelines (i.e. handbooks) and criteria for project development and disseminate these to
        budget units, along with training on the use of these methodologies for personnel involved in
        investment project preparation. Second, align project preparation and screening with the
        budget process. Only include investment projects that have been screened and which satisfy
        minimum established criteria. Finally, evaluate operational and maintenance expenses and
        include these in MTEFs and in the national recurrent budget
       Clarify roles and consider independent reviews. Create inter-ministerial committees to examine
        and evaluate proposals at the preliminary and screening stages, and consider the establishment
        of an independent mechanism to review proposals before inclusion into the CIB.
       Monitor and support project implementation. Formalize the reporting requirements of
        execution agencies to the Ministry of Economy and Finance for all projects and produce regular
        reports on physical and financial execution (quarterly or bi-annually). Introduce a risk
        management system to identify time and cost overruns, etc. Establish a multi-sectoral
        committee to review investment progress reports and propose actions, including project

                                                    59
    revision where necessary. Adopt a system to account for public assets (physical tracking and
    values, including depreciation).
   Improve the procurement process. The focus now needs to be on (i) consolidating the public
    procurement code and adopting a comprehensive set of implementing regulations and standard
    documents, (ii) increasing the efficiency and transparency of new independent procurement
    bodies, (iii) developing the capacity of public and private stakeholders at the operational level,
    and (iv) installing control and surveillance mechanisms to measure quality and ensure system
    integrity.

Chapter 3: Use of Resources in the Education Sector72


Despite Some Progress, Mauritania is Not on Track to Meet its Educational Goals
111. Mauritania has made good progress on education since 2010. The government’s updated
Education Sector Development Program (ESDP II 2010–2020) focuses on (i) achieving the education-
related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), (ii) pursuing education system reforms, and (iii)
improving the relevance and quality of post-primary education. The education sector has seen some
progress over the past years, particularly in making advances in reaching the MDG goal on gender
equality. Net enrollment rates have also improved for all age groups between 2008 and 2014 with no
exceptions. Another achievement is the improved enrollment at the pre-primary level. Pre-school
attendance increased from 5 percent in 2008 to 12 percent in 2014.73 Although this is still low by
regional standards (the Sub-Saharan Africa average is 20 percent), it still contributes to greater
educational attainment. The primary completion improved significantly between 2008 and 2014 from 59
to 72 percent (Figure 3.2), above the average for Sub-Saharan Africa but below the government’s target
of 78 percent (Figure 3.4).

   The school system in Mauritania includes six years of primary school, followed by four years of lower secondary education
and three years of upper secondary education.
73
   The figures would be even higher if they included the Islamic schools, mahadras. In Mauritania, mahadras provide religious
education with the objective of teaching young students and adults the basic concepts of Islam and religious beliefs, in Arabic.
Mahadras constitute a separate informal education system catering for children aged 4 to 18 as well as adults. They constitute
an important social safety net by taking in students that have dropped out or left the public education system due to its poor
performance. In 2010, a study showed that out of 6,489 religious schools, 585 are mahadras and 3,219 are Quranic schools
while the remaining 2,684 did not fulfill the criteria of either a mahadra or Quranic school. The majority of the mahadras (66
percent) are in urban areas but more than half do not have a location, and only one-third have access to energy, toilet facilities
and domestic taps. Most of the 68 classrooms for literacy schooling are in two regions, Nouakchott and Trarza. About 21,707
students attended mahadras in 2010 of which almost half (47 percent) have attended both the public and the religious school
system. (Ministere des Affaires Islamiques et de l’Enseignement Originel 2010).

                                                                                                                              61
112. Despite this progress the Mauritanian education system faces challenges related to quality
and inclusion. The EPCV survey shows that literacy in age 10-20 y.o. has actually declined from 83.9
percent to 83.2 percent for males while it increased from 77.6 to 79.9 percent for females between
2008 and 2014. Almost two-thirds of children aged six to 11 years old from the poorest 20 percent of
the population were not in school. These students either attend the Islamic schools, mahadras, which
are not regulated and lack a basic school curriculum, or are absent altogether. Parents cite financial
constraints or the low quality of education as reasons for keeping children out of school.
113. Challenges related to low quality and efficiency in education remain that may weigh
negatively on performance in the years ahead. Mauritania’s educational performance is lagging behind
other Sub-Saharan Africa countries in some key areas. Both the net enrollment rate and the lower
secondary completion rate are below average for the region, suggesting internal inefficiencies in the
education system (Figures 3.3 and 3.4). Only 40 percent of children of the relevant age are enrolled in
school and 40 percent of students drop out of school before completing five years. For every 100
students entering primary education, only 34 enter lower secondary and only 12 enter upper secondary.
School quality at primary and secondary level suffers from overcrowding, in particular in urban areas,
and a shortage of qualified teachers. Learning outcomes across all educational levels are low, although
primary education is particularly affected, owing to students dropping out early and inadequate learning
conditions (UNICEF 2014). Standardized tests in math, French, and Arabic in primary schools have shown
that students’ learning achievements are not only low but have also deteriorated over the past 15

114. Lower levels of educational attainment lead to a less skilled and less productive workforce.
There are several underlying causes for Mauritania’s low educational attainment. First, there is a
shortage of qualified teachers due to a mix of deficiencies on demand and supply side: a limited pool of
adequate candidates with good levels of French, the focus on language skills rather than relevant
teaching skills by national training institutes, and training institutes’ limited management capacity and
resources hindering improvements to the training curriculum. Second, there have been frequent and

                                                                                                                                          62
unplanned changes between French-based and Arabic-based curricula and educational policies. Third,
the government’s lack of a functional information management system (on the distribution of teachers
across the school system, enrollment of students, educational attainment data, etc.), has hindered its
ability to effectively manage the sector. The low quality of education has led to a skills mismatch and to
low worker productivity. The 2014 Investment Climate Survey (ICS) reported that low worker skills
resulting from poor education quality were a major constraint for 6 percent of Mauritania’s firms, twice
the Sub-Saharan Africa average (World Bank 2014a). Many workers have limited or no education while
very few firms provide formal training for their employees (World Bank 2014b).

Although Spending Has Risen it is Still Low, Except for Primary Education
115. Budgetary allocations increased gradually between 2010 and 2014, but remain below both the
sector’s needs and international commitments. The government’s review and preparation of a second
ESDP (2011–2020) provided an opportunity to tackle the challenges in the sector and fund the areas
most in need. A review of the government’s budget allocation to education over the period 2010–14
shows an upward trend in real terms on average by 10 percent, representing 14 percent of the total
budget (or US$188 million) in 2014 (Figure 3.7). This increase has also translated into an increase in
spending per student, though in 2011 and 2014 per-student spending fell, suggesting education
spending has not always kept pace with the growth in the school-age population. Education spending
fell slightly as a share of the government budget, from 15 percent in 2010 to 14 percent in 2014. As
such, Mauritania did not reach the target of 20 percent set in the 2011–2015 Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF), which constituted an indicative benchmark of the Fast Track Initiative.74 Examining
the sector’s public investment program (PIP) for 2012 and 2014, only one -fifth of the interventions to
meet the needs identified in the ESDP have been funded.

117. The distribution of resources reflects the country’s prioritization of universal primary
education but leaves scope for improvements in other educational levels:
                 Pre-school education has been shown to improve children’s cognitive skills and educational
                  attainments but Mauritania has not made pre-school education a policy priority.
                 Around half of education spending is in favor of primary education, underpinning the
                  government’s efforts to reach universal primary education (see Figure 3.10). Spending on
                  primary education has increased in real terms by 10 percent but declined as a share of total
                  education spending from a peak of 54 percent in 2011 to 49 percent in 2014. However,
                  Mauritania’s level of spending on primary education remains high compared to the average for
                  Sub-Saharan Africa (44 percent) and East African countries (49 percent).
                 Spending on secondary and vocational education and training (VET) also increased in real terms
                  between 2010 and 2014 (accounting for 23 percent and 4 percent respectively of total
                  education spending). Skills acquisition is vital for an economy to compete and grow. Skills gaps
                  are widespread in Mauritania but have been neglected by policy makers in the past.
                 Spending on tertiary education also showed an upward trend and accounted on average for
                  one-fifth of total education spending between 2010 and 2014. Even though it contributes
                  substantially to Mauritania’s effort to develop highly skilled workforce, the quality and relevance
                  of higher education remains a challenge. While tracer studies of university graduates are done
                  only occasionally, job insertion rates are known to be quite low. Education policy has not
                  adequately addressed the shortage of skills in critical areas such as education, health, and
                  government. In addition, the government’s scholarship program, accounting on average 17

           percent of total tertiary spending, exacerbates inequity in access to tertiary education as it has
           no strings attached in terms of academic performance and that it tends to favor students from
           well-off families.
118. Overall, the government might have more choices and more room for maneuver to reallocate
resources across the levels of education than it would appear (see below).

119. Islamic religious education constitutes an important educational social safety net in the
country but receives little public funding, is unregulated, and shows some risk of religious
radicalization. A very small share of the education budget (on average less than 1 percent) is spent on
religious education (the mahadras). These resources are managed by a separate ministry, the Ministry
of Islamic Affairs and Religious Education. There is a slight upward trend: for every MRO 100 spent on
the public school system in 2014, MRO 9 were spent on the mahadras, compared to MRO 6 in 2011.
Even though the budget has remained small over the past years, the separate funding of a parallel
education structure that caters to children left behind by a failing public education system raises some
questions. These include: (i) the use of public funds to support a separate unregulated education
structure whose underfunding has led to similarly poor quality education as the public school system; (ii)
the role of the mahadras as a social safety net taking in more and more students that are poor, school
drop outs, or generally disappointed by the public system; and (iii) the risk of infiltration by radical
teachers, promoting violent extremism, although the majority of mahadras do not propagate violent
ideologies (Boukhars 2012).

Children from the Poorest Households Receive the Least Benefit from Education Spending
120. Income exerts a strong influence on the poor’s access to primary and secondary schooling.
Almost one-third of the poorest quintile of school-age children are not in school compared with only 2
percent of the richest (see Figure 3.11). A student from the richest quintile is almost four times more
likely to complete primary education than one from the lowest quintile. At secondary education level,
only 2 percent of the poorest quintile complete secondary school compared with 34 percent of the
richest quintile. As a result, children from the poorest households have almost no chance of accessing
higher education. In addition, level of education appears to be related to the risk of religious

extremism—the lower the level of educational attainment the higher the risk that the student will turn
to violent extremism.75

121. A regressive distribution of public resources negatively affects the poor. As shown in Figure
3.12, educational coverage declines with increasing levels of education, while per-student spending
increases. A cohort analysis showed that the almost one-fifth of students who never enrolled in school
receive no benefit from the public spending on education. The 66 percent of students who completed
primary and lower secondary benefited from 51 percent of public resources, while the 17 percent of
students who completed upper secondary benefited from 49 percent of education expenditures. As
students from the lowest quintile make up a decreasing share of students as the level of education rises
(Figure 3.11), public expenditure benefits the higher income groups more than the poorer ones.
122. The resources allocated to the regional offices are also regressive. The recurrent budgets of the
regional national education offices (Directions Régionales de l’Education Nationale; DREN), excluding
salaries, accounted for only 1 percent of total recurrent allocations for primary and secondary education
in 2015. Although the bulk of the recurrent education budget is devoted to salaries, the funding of local
offices seems too low to meet the needs of the front-line services. The few funds at the local level are
divided between the DREN office, inspection unit, and the schools in the region, leaving almost no funds
to meet the schools’ needs for furniture and basic educational material such as pencils, schoolbooks,
and boards. The regional distribution of these resources by DREN shows the budget per student varies
significantly among the regions and is biased towards wealthier regions. Poor and rural regions such as
Guidimagha, Brakna, Gorgol, and Assaba, show a per-student expenditure considerably below the
national average (MRO 810 – 3 USD). At the same time, the number of students per teacher is high in
these regions, between 45 and 64 (Figure 3.13). These data underline several critical regional
distributional issues: (i) resources are not distributed based on need, as determined by the number of
students, the conditions of the schools, and the poverty rate; (ii) the government struggles to hire and
retain teachers in remote areas; and (iii) learning opportunities are more limited for poor students in

   The Mauritanians who have been arrested for terrorism offenses are young (aged 16 to 24), poor, speak only Arabic and have
a low level of education—most of them have failed secondary education. In contrast, leading figures in terrorist organizations
have been typically well educated, holding higher educational degrees. (Boukhars 2012).

Redistributing education spending could help to raise quality and effectiveness...
123. The disparity in education coverage and quality suggests that there are similar disparities in
the government’s efforts to adequately fund the different educational functions. Recurrent
expenditure constitutes the largest spending item, on average 89 percent of total education spending.
As a share of total education spending, recurrent expenditure decreased from 95 percent in 2008 to 85
percent in 2014 as spending on investment rose from 2 billion MRO (US$ 6 .6 million) to 9 billion MRO
(US$ 30 million) between 2010 and 2014. The increase in investment spending is mostly attributable to
increases in donor aid spending by 80 percent over the same period. On average, 70 percent of the
education investment budget depends on external aid.
124. A closer look at the composition of spending in the sector (see Figures 3.14 and 3.15) raises
issues in view of the urgent need to address education coverage, quality and equity:
            Salaries. The lion’s share of recurrent spending is absorbed by salaries, on average 83 percent—
             just above the MTEF target of 78 percent. Spending on salaries has grown steadily, by 7 percent
             over the period 2010–14. At primary level, salaries account for on average 96 percent of total
             education spending, above the average for East Africa (75 percent) and Sub-Saharan Africa (76
             percent). Trends in salaries are determined by both teachers’ pay levels and the number of
             teachers. The number of students per teacher for primary and secondary education fell between
             2008 and 2014, reaching 36 and 20 respectively in 2014, which is below the Sub-Saharan Africa
             average. However, these ratios are questionable as reports have drawn attention to the absence
             of teachers (often taking better paid assignments in private schools), their low level of
             qualifications, and overcrowded classrooms, notably in primary and secondary schools. These

             deficiencies are considered one of the main factors contributing to the low quality of education
             in the schools.76
            Goods and services account for 4 percent of total education spending. This may be too low since
             they include critical educational inputs such as textbooks, practice guides and basic student
             furniture, teacher training and curriculum development, and school construction and
             maintenance. Several of these services and materials are currently funded by development
             partners, even though they are part of the government’s regular budget.
            Investment spending has been concentrated on tertiary (on average 50 percent) and primary
             education (on average 36 percent) between 2010 and 2014. In contrast, investments in
             secondary education and VET have been low (only 7 and 6 percent respectively). While it is
             more cost effective to invest in primary education, post-basic education is important for skills
             development and formal sector employment. In contrast, Mauritania’s considerable investment
             in tertiary education raises questions about equity and cost efficiency given its budget
             constraints and a poorly performing basic and post-primary educational system.

...As Could Improving its Targeting and Efficiency
125. There are inefficiencies in the way education resources are managed, particularly in primary
education. Mauritania spends more per student on primary education than many similar countries, but
despite significant government spending, the educational outcomes at primary level are low. Assessing
the impact of students dropping out and repeating grades as educational “wastage?77 illustrates the cost

76
   Whereas the pupil/teacher ratio implies a calculation based on the number of teachers on the payroll, for Mauritania it
would be more accurate to use the number of teachers effectively in the classroom. However, these data are not available.
77
   The term “wastage? in respect to education refers to human and material resources spent on pupils who have to repeat a
grade or who drop out of school before completing a cycle. It denotes the inefficiency of a school system and refers also to the
wasted opportunities for these children to develop the knowledge, skills attitudes, and values they need to live productive lives
and to continue learning (UNESCO 1998).

                                                              68
of internal inefficiencies at primary level. Since most of those who drop out lapse into illiteracy, one-
third of public spending is essentially wasted. If considering learning acquisition in primary schools
(measured by the certificate of primary studies administered at the end of the last year), the educational
wastage of resources is even higher since only 30 percent of participants pass the test. Fewer resources
are wasted further up the educational ladder, as the impact of students dropping out and repeating
grades is less significant. Hence, concentrating on addressing low learning outcomes in primary
education would result in a more effective use of public resources.
126. The management of the budget shows some operational inefficiencies, notably related to the
management of donor aid. According to the data available, Mauritania’s education budget has been
almost fully implemented, with an average budget execution rate of 97 percent between 2010 and
2014. This can be mainly attributed to the large share of the ministry’s budget taken up by salaries.
Nonetheless, a separate review of the externally funded investment budget points to some inefficiency
in the management of donor aid. Only about half of the donor-funded projects were effectively
implemented due to shortcomings in procurement, donor procedures, and project management.78 This
is concerning given that donor aid funds a large part of the education investment budget.
127. Private schools perform better than public schools and have seen faster increases in
enrollment rates. Although on average 80 percent of the student population attend public schools,
enrollment in private schools has increased considerably: on average 11 percent between 2009/10 and
2013/14, against 3 percent in public schools. The share of private enrollment at the primary level
increased from 11 to 15 percent though these averages mask much higher prevalence of private
schooling in some regions. In Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, for example, enrollment in private schools
reached 50 percent. A recent ESDP II review in 2015 suggests that private schools achieve better
learning outcomes than public schools, in particular in final exams at the end of the school cycle
(Ministry of Education 2015). For instance, in 2014/15 the success rate in the Basic Education Certificate
was considerably higher in private schools (49 percent) than in public schools (33 percent). While more
work is needed to better understand these differences in performance, these facts are particularly
disturbing from a poverty-reduction standpoint, as they suggest wealthier students have better access
to well performing schools than poorer ones.
128. The school feeding program is a cost-effective way to achieve benefits in many areas
(education, nutrition and health, poverty reduction) but underfunding and poor targeting undermine
its effectiveness. Mauritania’s school feeding program is targeted on schools that face poor attendance
and enrollment and on students who are food insecure and living in areas with a high incidence of
poverty. The program has had a flat budget of approximately MRO 1.2 billion or US$4 million a year
since 2009. It covers 50 percent of primary schools with 50 to 300 students. However, a number of
implementation problems have eroded its effectiveness. First, it is underfunded, limiting its scope—even
though the program supports the same number of schools, it has had to reduce the number of meals
(and the number of days) due to a combination of price increases and the flat budget (World Bank
2014b). As a result, the program has not been able to achieve its objective of providing two meals a day
to 150,000 pupils. Second, the program’s design, targeting schools of an average size (50 to 300
students), can favor children in urban areas or larger villages, and penalize smaller schools, which are
more prevalent in remote and poor areas. The World Food Program has provided food inputs and
logistics, but this support will end in 2016. The government is developing a national strategy for school
feeding that provides an opportunity to improve the program’s funding and effectiveness by better

  Donor aid is not reported in the national budget and information is only available about the financing agreement in the TOFE
(Charts of the Financial Operations State). Some of the external aid is captured by the information system DAD (Development
Assistance Data), managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development, but this is still operating on a pilot basis.

                                                              69
targeting disadvantaged families and communities that lack the resources to adequately provide for
their school-age children, or those that need to be motivated to enroll their children in school.
129. Decentralized public provision of education is associated with improved service provision,
allowing for increased efficiency of teacher management and better resource mobilization at the local
level. However, in Mauritania, effective decentralization is constrained by fiscal and institutional
limitations. While education (together with health) is the most advanced in terms of deconcentrating
resources to the services compared to the other sectors, the decentralization of education is limited to
selected investments for primary school buildings available under a performance grants for department
capitals and LGs. The grant is part of Government’s National Integrated Program for Decentralization,
Local Development and Employment (PNIDDLE) and aims to build capacity and strengthen national and
regional oversight in areas that are particularly poor and underdeveloped. However, implementation
delays of the program suggest its impact for the education sector remains very limited.

Key Areas for Reform
130.   There are some important reforms that the sector can undertake to improve its performance.
      Focus on improving school quantity and quality. To achieve universal primary education,
       Mauritania should prioritize increasing access to schools, increasing spending on inputs that
       yield a high marginal return in terms of student learning, and prioritizing spending on the areas
       of greatest need. Proper maintenance of classrooms and availability of basic school supplies will
       require an increase of spending on goods and services. In addition, enforcing teachers’ presence
       in the classroom, complemented by frequent in-service teacher training and curriculum
       development, will be key to improving learning conditions and outcomes. Alongside this, the
       government needs to improve teachers’ qualifications and motivation by attracting a better
       cohort of educated candidates and improve teachers’ pay, preferably through a performance-
       based incentive system that links teachers’ salaries to student learning achievement.
      Address equity issues. Even though gender equity has been reached, increasing access to
       schooling for the poor is the main hurdle to achieving universal primary education. Mentoring
       and tutoring programs should be made available to ensure that students across socio-economic
       income groups at least pass the primary certificate (Certificat d'études primaires; CEP). In
       addition, basic skills and literacy programs will be critical for students who have dropped out of
       primary school to increase their job readiness while providing a second chance to those who
       seek to re-enter school later.
      Enhance accountability and increase the funding of vocational education and training
       institutions while improving connections with the general education system . The Mauritanian
       VET system needs to become more responsive to changes in needs for skills and to improve
       access to training and skills development. Institutionalizing annual audits of the public
       institutions managing vocational training and universities could encourage a better and more
       transparent use of public resources. Conducting routine tracer studies of graduates is important
       to assess the integration of the students in the job market and feed lessons back into the
       development of training programs. There is also a need to increase public resources for basic
       vocational and literacy programs to cater better for the significant share of the population aged
       15–24 who are currently unemployed and illiterate. Expanding the VET education subsector has
       the potential to raise productivity in rural agriculture and increase incomes from urban informal
       low-paid economic activities
      Review the current scholarship program and enhance accountability . The current scholarship
       program needs to be significantly reviewed to target low-income students and those university

                                                  70
    programs with high employment potential. Government-funded scholarships to foreign
    universities should be terminated. Development partners could fund specialist training in the
    areas of the most need, for which the country lacks capacity.
   Render the education information management system functional. To improve the availability
    of accurate and consistent data for informed decision-making, the government should invest in
    the education information management system. This would allow improving timeliness and
    quality of data quality as well as ability to link with other sources of information in the sector.
   Tracking and monitoring of resources and performance. Improved tracking and monitoring of
    allocation and spending would enhance transparency and contribute to ensuring that education
    expenditures reach the intended beneficiaries. To this end, institutionalizing annual reviews of
    public expenditures and conducting periodic public expenditure tracking surveys and school-
    level surveys would be worthwhile initiatives, providing information on actual inflows to schools
    and identifying leakages. These initiatives could be coupled with social accountability
    mechanisms (i.e. using parent’s feedback via SMS to monitor teacher absenteeism) to improve
    administrative record keeping and teachers’ incentives to attend schools.

Chapter 4: Use of Resources in the Health Sector


Despite Some Effective Public Health Interventions79, Overall Progress has been Mixed
131. Progress on health outcomes has been mixed in Mauritania. In line with the Millennium
Development Goals, Mauritania’s National Health Development Plan (PNDS) 2012–2020 seeks to (i)
reduce infant/child mortality, (ii) improve maternal health, and (iii) fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and
other diseases. Mauritania has made good progress on indicators such as child vaccination due to more
funding and improved program management—coverage of measles immunization reached 80 percent in
2013 against an average of 74 percent for Africa. It seems to have achieved the MDG for malnutrition,
reducing it to 20 percent in 2014 (against a target of 23.5 percent) (Republic of Mauritania 2014). Child
and maternal mortality indicators have shown some improvement between 1990 and 2013, but are still
far from reaching the MDG targets. In 2013, infant mortality was still at 67 for every 1,000 live births
against the MDG target of 45, and maternal mortality was 320 per 100,000 live births against an MDG
target of 232.80 HIV/AIDS prevalence remains low (below 1 percent in 2014) but the prevalence of major
diseases (such as malaria and tuberculosis) has not fallen. The rate of assisted deliveries improved
substantially, reaching 70 percent in 2014, up from 61 percent in 2007, although this improvement
masks geographic disparities. More than half of all births in rural areas were delivered without skilled
care, which can affect the health outcomes of the mother due to insufficient postnatal care (UNICEF
2008, 2014).

   The following analysis is based on information available to the team as of January 2016. Notably, the results from the MICS
survey and health sector expenditure analysis (comptes santé) work which was underway at the time were not available to the
team. Hence, health sector data is more outdated than that of the other chapters of this review

   Note for some health indicators the PER uses the World Health Statistics for international comparison purposes. However,
the data deviate from the results of Mauritania’s 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), which shows lower outcomes
for infant and maternal mortality, with an infant mortality rate of 75 for every 1,000 live births and a maternal mortality rate of
626 per 100,000 live births (UNICEF 2014).

132. Mauritania has made some effective public interventions (particularly on immunization and
nutrition), but the country’s healthcare system suffers from a number of shortcomings (Republic of
Mauritania 2014). The government considers reaching the health MDGs a priority and has set up a
national entity to allow a follow up of health indicators. Despite these efforts, the sector continues to be
plagued by a number of problems. Mauritania is still far from the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
standard of 25 professionals per 10,000 inhabitants: the country has on average 10.3 doctors and nurses
per 10,000 inhabitants (Ministry of Health 2014a). The performance of health workers is also affected by
a decline in the quality of training, a lack of motivation, and an uneven geographical distribution, with 45
percent of health workers being concentrated in Nouakchott. Insufficient numbers of staff at health care
facilities remains a major barrier to improving services, as are the poor condition of the health facilities.
According to the 2013 Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey, only one-third of
health facilities are adequately equipped and operational. Almost none have the medical equipment to
conduct standard diagnostic tests (WHO 2013). According to a user satisfaction survey, long waiting
times and the high cost of services are the main causes of dissatisfaction with health services among the
population (Republic of Mauritania 2014).

Health Spending Has Risen from a Low Base, but Does Not Fully Reflect Mauritania’s Policy
Goals81
133. Total health spending in Mauritania stagnated between 2010 and 2012, but the start of the
PNDS implementation in 2013 saw a marked increase. After several years of small fluctuations, total
health spending (public and private) increased sharply by 27 percent in 2013, to US$120 million or 2.4
percent of GDP. Part of that spending increase is attributed to a significant increase in central
government spending, which coincided with the implementation of the PNDS. Despite government
commitment to the health sector, the amount of central government spending in 2013 remained below
the funding needed to finance the interventions identified in the PNDS (2012–30). The bulk of public
health resources are managed by the Ministry of Health, accounting 4.1 percent on average of the total
government budget, which is far below the Abuja Declaration (2001) target of allocating at least 15
percent of the budget to the health sector.

  This assessment is based on the National Health Account 2011, 2012 and 2013 and captures all sector health expenditures,
including government expenditure (from the ministries of Health, National Defense, Interior, Work, Education, and Social
Affairs), donor aid, insurance, household and community spending (Ministry of Health 2015).

134. Mauritania’s health spending is relatively low compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Mauritania spends about US$48 per capita on health, in contrast to an average of US$95 for
selected Sub-Saharan African countries. As a share of GDP, Mauritania’s spending is around the regional
average of 2 percent. A comparison with health outcomes in other countries shows that Mauritania has
some scope to use its resources more efficiently. Other countries which spend the same or less than
Mauritania, have better outcomes related to infant mortality, for example.

135. Resource distribution within the health sector is not fully in line with government priorities,
particularly achieving the health-related MDGs. In an effort to address the flaws in Mauritania’s health
care system, the government has devoted more resources to primary health care—expenditures
increased in real terms by 26 percent between 2011–13, climbing to one-third of total health spending
in 2013 (Figure 4.7). However, more than half of resources are spent at the tertiary level (hospital and

                                                                  74
ambulatory care) and central administration. In part, this can be attributed to the higher cost of
providing tertiary services. Nevertheless, taking into account the faltering progress towards several
MDG goals, more support seems to be required for primary health care, which is essential to addressing
child and maternal health, managing communicable and chronic diseases, and offering preventive
services. From an equity perspective, the primary front-line services offer health care to three-quarters
of the population but receive only one-third of public health resources.

Unequal Distribution of Health Expenditure is Likely to Exacerbate Health Inequalities
136. Health expenditures are unequally distributed across regions, negatively affecting the poorer
segments of the population. For instance, Tiris Zemmour, a region with a poverty rate of less than 30
percent, received 12 times more health spending per capita than Brakna, with a poverty rate of 67.4
percent. These regional disparities in funding contribute to the obstacles the poor face accessing health
services. Use of primary health care is strongly linked to physical proximity to services. However, nearly
two-thirds of households in rural areas are more than 60 minutes from a health facility, against 16
percent of urban households.82 Given the predominantly rural nature of poverty (53.2 percent), the poor
have less access to health services. More than half of the poor (58 percent) travel more than 5
kilometers to a health center. The inequity in the allocation of health resources also has a major bearing
on the distribution of qualified health personnel and hence the availability and quality of health care
received by the poor. While more than half of poor households consult basic health centers, almost all
specialist doctors (94 percent), half of all general practitioners (47 percent) and more than three-
quarters (76 percent) of technical specialists are in hospitals which are located in Nouakchott and in
regional health care centers.

 The World Health Organization recommends a distance of 5 km or 30 minutes to a basic health center (Republic of
Mauritania 2014).

137. Inequity in the allocation of resources can contribute to inequity in the use of resources.
Significant discrepancies in the use of health services between different income categories remain.
According to the 2014 Mauritania Poverty Profile, health spending by households increased between
2008 and 2014 (from 3.8 to 4.8 percent of total household spending), however individuals in the top
quintile spent a larger share of their income on health-related expenditures than those in the bottom
quintile. The poor tend to seek less medical help when ill compared to the non-poor and are more likely
to consult a basic health facility rather than the central and regional hospitals. This is consistent with the
observation that the poor undergo fewer treatments than the rich due to income limitations.
Furthermore, although the use of clinic services for prenatal care has improved nationwide since 2008,
poor women still receive fewer prenatal consultations than the non-poor. In fact, the percentage of
poor women obtaining medically trained assistance during childbirth is alarmingly low—only 36 percent
of women from the poorest households (first quintile) are assisted in childbirth by doctors or midwives
whereas this rate is 59 percent for women in the richest households (fifth quintile). Nevertheless, a user
satisfaction survey showed that 80 percent of the users living in rural areas are satisfied with health
services (Republic of Mauritania 2014).

Private Spending and Health Insurance Are Becoming Increasingly Significant as Donor
Funding Declines83
138. More than two-thirds of total health sector spending is absorbed by salaries and goods and
services. Salaries constitute the bulk of health system funding (on average 43 percent), followed by
goods and services (on average 37 percent), while one fifth of the total health spending is in favor of
investment (see Figure 4.10). After a stagnation in total health spending for three years (2010–12), it
rose by 27 percent in 2013, boosting the non-salary recurrent budgets of the regions and basic health

  The assessment of the health system financing is based on the sources of funding, covering government (including all
Ministries managing health expenditures, notably Ministry of Health, Habitat and Defense), donors, insurance and private
sector (mainly households’ out of pocket spending).

centers by 150 percent.84 Recruitment of medical staff shows a steady upward trend between 2011–13
(Figure 4.11). Nevertheless, the uneven regional distribution of medical workers, particular in rural
areas, as well as the overall shortage of medical workers continues to hamper access to skilled care at
birth, in emergencies, and for specialized services. Out of a total of 5,393 health workers, the basic
health centers and posts employ 1,402 medical staff, but need an estimated 3,530 (Ministry of Health
2014b). Mauritania’s ratio of health workers to population is not the worst in Africa, but remains below
the African average (Ministry of Health 2014b; see Figure 4.12). It is also noteworthy health spending on
drugs (8.2 percent) is considered very low, as evidenced by the limited availability of drugs in the health
facilities. For instance, only 1 percent of health facilities consistently have 14 tracer drugs available
(WHO, 2013).

   Other additional spending was directed towards the creation of hospital centers (the hospital Attar, Aleg, Seilibaby and
Tidjekja became hospital centers in 2012 (with management autonomy), benefiting from government subsidies since 2013) and

139. In Mauritania, government domestic spending accounts for half of all health system funding,
followed by spending on National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM) and donor programs. Both
domestically funded expenditures and spending on the government’s health insurance, CNAM, rose as a
share of total health spending between 2010 and 2013, accounting for 5.3 percent and 18 percent
respectively in 2013 (Figure 4.13)85. Private health expenditures in the form of out-of-pocket spending
by households has also shown an increase, representing 13 percent of spending in 2013. In contrast,
although numerous development partners provide support to the health system, donor assistance has
declined on average by 14 percent per year over the same period, and formed 12 percent of total health
spending in 2013. The downward trend can be partially explained by the completion of the Friendship
Hospital in Nouakchott, supported by Chinese cooperation. A slight increase in 2013 was not sufficient
to return to the spending level of 2010. The mix of the sources of financing has implications for the
sector, particularly in terms of access, equity, and financial sustainability:
        The government insurance scheme represents one-fifth of total health sector spending,
         although coverage is limited to a small share of formal workers. Created in 2007, the CNAM is
         a publicly funded insurance system that mobilizes funds from employees and employers to
         finance health care services for its members. At present, it covers 13 percent of formal sector
         workers. This insurance scheme has had little impact on access to health services and financial
         protection as it targets only a small fraction of the population while excluding those most in
         need.
        The decline in development assistance over the reviewed period raises critical concerns for
         future sustainability of high-impact health interventions, particularly preventive programs.
         Donor assistance has largely funded preventive programs related to maternal mortality,
         communicable and infectious diseases (tuberculosis, malaria), and the implementation of
         vaccination programs (where the government has purchased the drugs). HIV/AIDS is one of the
         few programs funded and implemented solely out of the government’s own resources. The
         predominance of donor aid for certain key programs raises concerns about their sustainability in
         an environment where government funding is constrained. In addition, these activities are
         vulnerable to the frequently erratic nature of donor funding commitments and low level of
         actual disbursements.
        Given the limited ability of the poor to pay, and their absence from the CNAM, the increase in
         out-of-pocket spending is another indicator of potential inequities in the health system . The
         main source of private health spending is households’ out-of-pocket spending. While out-of-
         pocket spending remains low compared to other spending sources, it shows an upward trend in
         real terms, almost doubling between 2010 and 2013.

More Devolution and Prioritization Could Make Better Use of Existing Resources
140. Efficient utilization of public resources in the health sector will be critical given the
government’s budget constraints. The performance of domestically financed health spending is
characterized by budget overruns for some categories and projects and underspending in others. The
overspending of the domestically funded appropriations (on average 112 percent between 2011 and
2013) can be mostly attributed to higher spending on salaries as the budget law had not taken into

85
  As noted earlier, apart from the Ministry of Health a few other Ministries also manage health expenditures (such as the
Ministry of Habitat and Defense), however the spending level of these ministries is low, contributing on average 10 percent to
total Ministries health expenditures (excluding donor aid) or 5 percent to total health spending (including government and
private expenditures).

account the recruitment of health workers during the fiscal year. Some expenditure overruns also
occurred for subsidies and transfers in 2013 due to in-year requests for the purchases of drugs and
other medical supplies. These additional needs are funded through the use of ministerial decrees during
the fiscal year. In contrast, spending on goods and services has been below budget appropriations, with
the exception of a budget overrun in 2011. Overall, the management of the health budget points to
weaknesses in budget planning but also a lack of fiscal discipline.

141. Devolution of key functions generally improves the efficiency and quality of services in the
health sector. Mauritania still has scope to better resource front-line services and to make use of local
networks. Although the health sector has deconcentrated its administrative functions to regions and
health districts, 10 percent of the ministry’s budget is managed by the central administration compared
with only 2 percent for the deconcentrated services. This raises questions about the transparency and
cost effectiveness of health resources as well as the effective targeting of services according to the
needs of the different communities. Social mechanisms—such as community participation and local
empowerment to give communities responsibility for decision making about adequate services and
improving the quality of care—remain embryonic in Mauritania, even though community participation is
considered an essential part of good local governance and promotes effective health care at a lower
cost. Similar to the education sector, the decentralization of health services is limited to a few
investments provided to 100 LGs under the performance-based grant for community health centers and
small-scale hospitals. Given the delays in implementing the PNIDDLE, the effective impact of these
investments on local health service delivery suggests being small and remain unknown.
142. Ensuring that the resources available are directed towards those interventions that have the
greatest impact on health outcomes at the lowest cost (better allocative efficiency) remains a key
challenge. The current distribution of resources prioritizes curative services, often underfunding largely
cost-effective and high impact interventions, such as communicable and infectious disease control,
reproductive and maternal health, and health education. These account for only 4 percent of total
health spending, and are mainly funded by donor assistance.

Key Areas for Reform
143.    There are a number of key areas of reform in the health sector.
       Prepare a universal health coverage policy. Universal health coverage lowers financial barriers
        to health care and reduces the impoverishing impact of health payments. The government has
        begun to embrace the concept of universal coverage by preparing a financing strategy to
        explore different financing mechanisms. To complement this, it needs to prepare a policy
        focusing on (i) financial risk protection to address catastrophic health expenditure, where
        households have to forego the consumption of other necessary goods due to high out-of-pocket
        payments and impoverishment, closely coordinated with the national social protection policy;


                                                             79
    (ii) improving the quality of effective services; and (iii) addressing social determinants of health
    such as addictions (tobacco, drugs, alcohol and other addictions), traffic injuries, pollution, and
    the lack of clean water and sanitation networks.
   Improve human resource management. The ability of a country to meet its health goals
    depends largely on the skills, motivation, and deployment of the health workers responsible for
    delivering services. Given the shortcomings of Mauritania’s human resources in the health
    sector, it is critical to (i) recruit skilled health workers to ensure that primary health care
    facilities meet their nationally recommended staffing norms, and (ii) implement an effective
    incentive scheme to attract and retain essential health workers. The 2013 budget included
    measures such as the provision of extra pay and benefits for health workers taking a post in
    rural areas and the piloting of a results-based financing strategy. These are important steps
    towards providing incentives for health workers to improve motivation and retention.
   Address equity issues. Equity plays a constitutive role alongside growth in reducing absolute
    poverty. A well-designed resource allocation formula that considers equity aspects can reduce
    government spending disparities across regions. Additional resources should benefit currently
    marginalized and very poor regions such as Brakna, Gorgol, Tagant, and Guidimagha.
   Reinforce cost-effective interventions. The quality of care is key to improving health outcomes,
    efficiency, and user satisfaction. Effectively targeting resources on the areas of greatest need is
    critical to improving the quality and use of health services. To achieve this, Mauritania needs to
    strengthen those health interventions that have the greatest possible benefits (for example
    maternal and infant programs, and preventable diseases), expand CNAM’s coverage to informal
    workers and the poor, and implement the results-based financing program which the Health
    Steering Committee approved in September 2015 to put more emphasis on outcomes instead of
    inputs.
   Strengthen budget management. Effective management of the budget encourages better
    decision-making, the efficient use of resources and results in better health outcomes. This
    requires the strengthening of tools for budgeting, accounting and execution, improving
    management capacities of all departments, notably at the regional offices, and implementing a
    computerized management system that includes all resources (including external funds) and is
    connected to MF and treasury’s information system.
   Review and explore different models of social accountability. Social accountability
    interventions have proven to be critical to enabling meaningful participation of all citizens,
    proper accounting of health resources and addressing information asymmetries. It encompasses
    a range of practices (such as participatory public policy-making, participatory budgeting, public
    expenditure tracking, and citizen monitoring and evaluation of public services) that should be
    reviewed and explored for the Mauritanian context.
   Strengthen decentralization of health functions to improve human resource management.
    Many arguments have been made that decentralization of health care may bring benefits of (i)
    improved technical efficiency as local governments are more cost conscious and have more
    freedom in contracting with providers; (ii) better allocative efficiency through greater alignment
    of services to the needs of the different communities; (iii) improved equity as local authorities
    know communities better and can successfully target resources to the more vulnerable groups.
    While decentralization reforms in Mauritania constitute a slow process, efforts could focus on
    improving the management of health staff by making staff positions regional (to reduce the
    concentration of health workers in Nouakchott) and strengthening the local oversight of the
    regions to guide the promotion and sanctioning of health workers, and therefore encourage
    better performance.

Chapter 5: Use of Resources in the Agriculture Sector


Structural changes in Mauritania’s rural areas have led to increased productivity and a
reduction in poverty
144. Although Mauritania consists largely of desert (only 0.5 percent of the land is considered
arable), the agriculture sector is important. It contributed 17 percent of GDP in 2014, and is the second-
largest employer, providing 26 percent of total employment in 2014. Mauritania is largely a livestock-
producing country (accounting for about 70 percent of agricultural GDP) and has a strong potential for
irrigated agriculture along the Senegal River. About 60 percent of the rural population depends on
agriculture for a living. At present, Mauritania imports more than 70 percent of its cereal. Nonetheless,
it has the potential to satisfy its needs for rice, vegetables, and other crops through irrigated agriculture
(only 10-20 percent of its irrigation potential is currently exploited) and for cereal and milk for the
domestic markets (both are currently largely imported). Tapping into this potential could contribute to
poverty reduction given that over half of the poor population lives in rural areas.
145. Developments in the agricultural and livestock sectors have had a significant impact on
poverty in Mauritania. Increased production, prices and incomes for rural workers in the irrigated and
mechanized agriculture sector and in the livestock sector have resulted in very significant reduction in
poverty rates in rural areas, and has driven the large reduction in poverty at national level (from 44.5
percent in 2008 to 33 percent in 2014). The driving factors of this change can be found in irrigated
agriculture, which has witnessed large increased in productive land (146 percent) and in tons produced
(150 percent) and in the livestock sector, where ownership for the poorest quintile has increased
significantly (86.6 percent). These improvements could be the result of improved investments in the
livestock sector, improved savings by farmers or both.
146. Despite these very encouraging results the sector continues to underperform. Rice production
has increased in the past ten years, positioning Mauritania as a regional leader. Mauritania’s agricultural
value added per worker is also above the average for Sub-Saharan African countries (Figure 5.3).
Nevertheless, agriculture’s share of GDP has declined over the past ten years, mostly due to repeated
drought, severely affecting products other than rice and livestock that depend heavily on rainfall. The
sector’s vulnerability to climatic shocks has discouraged farmers and the private sector from increasing
investments in the sector. The rate of adoption of agricultural technology has been low in Mauritania,
contributing to low yields. Agricultural growth has also been hampered by weak support services (credit
and extension), weak capacity among producer organizations such as village cooperatives and economic
interest groups (groupements d’intérêt économique; GIE), and a challenging business environment.

Despite Agriculture’s Impact on for Poverty Reduction, Mauritania May Struggle to Mobilize
the Investment the Sector Needs to Reach its Full Potential
147. Government allocations to the agriculture sector have increased overall between 2010 and
2014, but mobilizing funding to implement the NADP will be a challenge over the coming years. After a
temporary drop in 2011, budget appropriations increased on average by 54 percent in subsequent
years, amounting to 6 percent of the national budget, or 1.7 percent of GDP, in 2014. The increases can

                                                                                                                83
be mainly explained by the government launching a large-scale pro-poor irrigation program in the
Senegal River Valley and introducing input subsidies, notably to support rice production. Despite these
increases, budget appropriations remain below the 10 percent goal set by the 2003 Maputo Agreement.
The NADP (horizon 2025) estimates the sector’s funding needs at MRO 350 billion (US$1.1 billion) with
the bulk of the funding (MRO 275 billion) to be mobilized from development partners and the private
sector (Ministry of Agriculture 2015).86 While it is promising for the NADP implementation that current
central government appropriations are above the estimate of resources needed from the government,
key challenges remain in securing external and private funding for the forthcoming years.

148. Compared to its peers, Mauritania has spent relatively little on agriculture, but yields are high
for its main commodity, rice. Comparisons of spending on agriculture have to be made with caution, as
Mauritania was not included in the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) dataset on
agricultural spending from 147 countries. However, Figure 5.7 suggests that government spending on
agriculture in Mauritania, both as a proportion of GDP and a share of total expenditure) is very low
compared to Sub Saharan African countries. Despite this, yields for one of its main commodities, rice,
are very high (Figures 5.1 and 5.2, above). The explanation might be a combination of factors such as the
development of large-scale mechanized private farming, the purchase of rice at a subsidized price by the

Continuing Food Subsidies May Not be the Best Way to Address Chronic Poverty
149. Some food subsidy programs aimed at mitigating the impact on vulnerable populations of a
severe drought in 2011 are still in place. In late 2011, a severe drought led to a fall in agricultural
production by 75 percent, which affected agricultural communities, resulting in loss of cattle and
increased vulnerability among pastoral communities. In December 2011, about one-quarter of rural
households were food insecure, half of them severely so. Government intervention under the
emergency Emel Program, managed by the Food Security Commission, focused on food-based programs
and targeted poor farmers and communities.87 Funding for the Emel Program peaked in 2012 at MRO 28
billion (US$ 93.3 millon) or 9 percent of the national budget. In 2013, spending fell to MRO 14 billion
(US$ 46.6 million) due to favorable rains and the closing of two of the Emel Program components, the
Village Level Food Security Stocks (SAVS) and the emergency food distribution program. Despite being
initially designed as a short-term response, however, Emel’s subsidized food shops (Boutiques Emel)
remain in place. They aim to distribute subsidized food to the poor, generate employment, and hold
down food prices.
150. The Emel Program shows the government’s capacity to manage large-scale programs, but also
raises questions about its contribution to reducing extreme poverty and its fiscal impact. The Emel
Program was successful in averting a potential humanitarian crisis but its targeting mechanism showed
some limitations. An evaluation conducted by the World Bank (2014) indicated those most in need, the
extreme poor, did not have either the means to buy subsidized products at the Boutiques Emel or their
own herds to participate in the livestock support component, and were thus excluded from the


87
  The Emel Program included a national network of subsidized food shops (the Boutiques Emel), restocking of cereal banks (the
Village Level Food Security Stocks (SAVS)) and an emergency food distribution program. It also included a large-scale livestock
support program designed to protect the country’s livestock herds from depletion, and the rural economy, which is greatly
dependent on pastoral activities. (World Bank 2014b)

                                                                     85
program’s main components. Reviewing the sustainability of the Emel Program, the evaluation also
found that the government’s decision to distribute food on a large scale via the Boutiques Emel was
appropriate in the context of the immediate emergency and more cost-efficient than using the private
sector. However, beyond the crisis response, the costs of setting up and maintaining the shops are not
sustainable and are higher in logistical terms compared to other programs (i.e. cash or voucher
programs) and associated with a high risk of loss (spoiled food, losses, or theft). The government
therefore needs to complement its emergency food-based program with investments in long-term
interventions that address chronic poverty and build resilience against shocks (i.e. health and education
services or cash transfers) (World Bank 2014b).
151. Mauritania has also initiated investments in the Senegal River Valley and the southeast
explicitly targeting poverty. Spurred by the need to mitigate the 2011 food crisis, the government
supported six pro-poor interventions in irrigated agriculture along the Senegal River Valley as well as
gardening initiatives in wetlands (Kankossa, Tamourt En Naaj, and Mahmouda) in the south east of the
country. Local unemployed farmers received government support in the form of free land plots,
fertilizer, equipment, and assistance via extension services over the course of three years. The program
succeeded in generating and diversifying income for more than 6,000 famers located along the Senegal
River. Several factors contributed to the initial success of the program: (i) the interventions were
conducted in a very short time on land for which social and technical feasibility studies had already been
conducted, typically taking three years, hence allowing immediate cultivation of the land plots; (ii) about
3,000 hectares of arable land were distributed for free to local farmers in the Senegal Upper Valley; and
(iii) a flexible credit scheme was introduced for input subsidies (depending on income level, repayment
rates varied between 30, 40, and 50 percent), accompanied by the cancellation of old inherited loans.
Input support was gradually reduced over the three-year intervention period to enhance sustainable
local irrigation management. Despite the initial success in the first years, the land plots were not further
cultivated after government support ceased.
152. Some lessons can be derived from this pioneering experience for potential wider application: (i)
given the small size of land plots (around 1 hectare per household), the government needs to provide
continuous support in the form of land maintenance services; (ii) the importance of addressing the issue
of land tenure in the Senegal River Valley; and (iii) the need to provide resource-conserving technology
(such as solar- or hydro-powered pumps) to sustain the investments and livelihoods.

Weak Administrative Capacity and Insufficient Research and Investment Need to be
Addressed
153. Funding by development partners has overtaken the government’s own resources as the main
source of agriculture funding, and the private sector has been crowded out by the public sector. While
domestic resources have increased on average by 25 percent since 2011, donor aid increased by 91
percent. As a result, donor aid increased from 33 percent of total appropriations for the sector in 2011
to 58 percent in 2014. Private investment has been sluggish in the sector, with one explanation possibly
being the government’s policy of promoting win-win partnerships, notably for irrigated farming. In an
effort to leverage private resources, most private investors benefit from an attractive and
comprehensive package of services, including the free granting of land rights in the Senegal River basin
and the provision of agricultural and seasonal credits for plot development. This incentive scheme,
however, has been prone to rent-seeking behavior and has had an adverse impact on private
investment.

154. The largest share of the sector’s domestically funded resources is devoted to administration,
while several core functions and priorities are being underfunded or not funded at all. In Mauritania,
the Ministry of Rural Development is primarily responsible for the agriculture sector. More than two-
thirds of the ministry’s budget is allocated to administration (central and regional) with the bulk of
resources being managed by the Minister’s office (Figure 5.8). One-fifth of its budget is attributed to
agriculture while less than 5 percent is directed to research, training and extension, livestock, and the
fight against the locusts that have caused severe damage to crops. Even though the potential return on
investments into generating and disseminating agricultural technology are considered high in West
Africa (46 percent), core functions such as agricultural research and development (R&D) are highly
underinvested in Mauritania, resulting in low crop variety, declining soil fertility, and insufficient crop
and pest management.88
155. High administrative costs raise questions about the adequate distribution of responsibilities,
programs, and staffing. For example, the Minister’s office has been carrying out some of the supervision
tasks of the Department of Agriculture and the extension services. This not only raises concerns about
the effectiveness and cost efficiency of these missions, but it also exacerbates the problems of the
already underfunded and low-performing extension services. Only 2 percent of the total ministry budget
is allotted to the locally based services. The civil servants in local offices are often unqualified, lack
experience, and have been recruited through non-standard procedures.

156. The composition of the agriculture budget has reflected a policy bias towards traditional
commodities in recent years. This is particularly the case for rice production; around one-fifth of
Mauritania’s total agriculture allocations have been directed to subsidies and transfers in support of rice
production and irrigation since 2011. Since 2010, subsidies and transfers have increased substantially,
from MRO 0.2 billion (US$ 666,000) in 2010 to MRO 4.1 billion (US$ 13.6 million) in 2013. The marked
spikes in spending in 2011 and 2012 can be attributed partly to input subsidies (seeds, fertilizers, and
herbicides) distributed by the government under the agriculture irrigation program at the Senegal River

                                                                   87
Valley and partly to transfers supporting the Emel Program and the agricultural campaign.89 These
subsidies have played an important role in stimulating agricultural production, particularly of irrigated
rice and recently wheat, but risk undermining efforts to promote efficiency and more sustainable
agriculture. They have also raised equity concerns as a large share of subsidies have been biased in favor
of input providers and larger producers.
157. Weak management capacities and a shortage of skilled staff pose significant challenges to the
implementation of agricultural programs. Spending on salaries (15 percent of total agriculture
spending) shows the lowest growth in real terms (4 percent) compared to all other spending items.
Several recent staff assessments highlighted a number of shortcomings in the management of the
agriculture staff: (i) a top-heavy administration, as evidenced by 142 staff in category A (management
level) against 98 staff in category B and D (operational level); (ii) more than half of the salary spending is
absorbed by the Minister’s office (48 percent of the staff are appointed to the cabinet of the Minister of
Agriculture but they earn 62 percent of the ministry salaries);90 (iii) lack of skilled staff to manage
investment programs, and provide advisory and technical support; (iv) 137 non-categorized posts; and
(v) insufficient separation of technical and policy/managerial functions, resulting in inefficiencies and
affecting the quality of service delivery.
158. The ministry benefited briefly from special unallocated credits but this practice has been
eliminated since 2012. During 2010 and 2011, the Ministry of Rural Affairs obtained fungible credits
from the state budget (accounting for 20 percent of total agriculture spending) to correct imbalances in
its recurrent budget. These funds were used primarily to fund the Emel Program and the agricultural
campaign. However, such practices distort fiscal discipline and undermine accountability over the use of
public resources. The 2012 budget law reflects these concerns by adopting provisions to report these
resources by source and destination.
159. Public investments in the sector more than doubled in real terms between 2010 and 2013,
representing almost three-quarters of the sector’s total budget. Public investment in the sector show
an upward trend from MRO 7 billion (US$ 23.3 million) in 2010 to MRO 19 billion (US$ 63.3 million) in
2013. The scaled-up investments were aimed at increasing the amount of arable land (notably extending
irrigated land at the Senegal River Valley and Aftout Saheli) and promoting job creation. Findings from
the recent World Bank poverty assessment indicates that these objectives were achieved. The surface
of cultivated land and agricultural output has increased significantly between 2008 and 2014. Small
producers also increased their output and benefitted from increased prices, thereby increasing their
incomes. The government has also attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) to develop large-scale
agriculture projects but faces resistance from the local population who prefer the expansion of large-
scale publicly developed perimeters.

Ineffective and Costly Subsidies Are Absorbing Too Much of the Government’s Resources for
Agriculture
160. The domestically funded budget has suffered from overruns and underspending across all
categories over the observed period. The management of subsidies and transfers is deficient as public
spending has either exceeded budgetary allocations (148 percent in 2010 and 118 in 2013) or has been
89
   In response to years of droughts in the past, the government introduced the agricultural campaign seeking to provide support
to farmers and promoting agriculture development. The support provided under the campaign has increased substantially since
the 1960s and has become a regular program of the Ministry of Agriculture. The campaign provides a range of support grouped
under the term of crop support assisting farmers accessing land, credits, agriculture inputs, markets, and reinforcing capacities.
90
   Note civil servants are under the cabinet’s budget while others (mostly non-permanent workers) are managed under the
budget of the directorates and projects.

                                                               88
underspent (50 percent in 2011). This is particularly concerning given the size of the budget item. In
2011, the investment budget and unallocated credits were overspent to cover additional in-year needs
for the various emergency programs (such as the Solidarity Program (2011) and the Emel Program
(2012–15). In contrast, spending on salaries has been below budget appropriations (on average 89
percent) over the period under review; such underspending also occurred for goods and services (79
percent) and investment (74 percent) in 2010. This can be mainly attributed to weak budget planning for
the part of the salaries and cumbersome procurement procedures and insufficient capacities for the
latter two categories, resulting in low implementation of the respective budget items. There is an urgent
need to improve internal systems for tracking, recording, and disseminating information about public
spending in the agriculture sector. Information on disbursement of donor aid is often not timely
available, which in turn impacts strategic planning and management of the externally funded programs
for the sector.
161. Deconcentration and decentralization of specific functions of the agriculture sector could
improve efficiency in the administration and service delivery . In practice, the ministry’s effectiveness
on the ground is weak as the deconcentration of resources proceeding slowly. Only a small share of the
budget (less than 1 percent of the total recurrent budget allocated to goods and services) has been
deconcentrated to the local units, while expenditures subject to procurement continue to be approved
by the central administration of the ministry. The centralization of the budget has been justified in part
by the relatively weak capacity and demotivation of the staff posted in peripheral locations. However, as
a result the front-line operations have almost no decision-making authority and are less able to provide
services to farmers, such as educational services on the adoption and utilization of new scientific
farming practices, guidance on the application of fertilizers, or crop management sequencing.
162. Recourse to subsidies can be an attractive option in times of crisis as it is relatively simple to
implement, quite effective, and produces visible results in the short term . Under the pressure of the
food crisis in 2011, the government introduced a range of new subsidies to stimulate agricultural
production, particularly rice production, make inputs affordable to farmers who could not buy them,
and support poor households in rural areas that were most affected by the crisis. The subsidies aimed to
support food price stabilization and job creation through discounts on input use and tax breaks. In 2011,
the government set up a purchase and sale mechanism with controlled prices for locally produced rice,
independent of market forces.91 The government also increased transfers to banks to support
agriculture activities and financing systems (such as credits, insurance, and guarantees).92 The
information available shows the level of funding is considerable, amounting to MRO 61 billion (US$ 203
million) or 15 percent of the national budget in 2013 (Didi 2015). The bulk of the resources (67 percent)
was allocated to the Emel Program (the Boutiques Emel). The subsidies were successful in providing
essential support to destitute communities and mitigating the food security crisis but their continuation
in the aftermath of the crisis has raised concerns.
163. Subsidies may have crowded out private investment and there are risks that vested interests
will prevent the government from reprioritizing spending to other areas. Given that the government
has consistently increased spending on subsidies, there is a concern that this spending displaces long-
term investments in capacity building, technology, and rural infrastructure. Another concern is that as
the costs of subsidies rise, they displace government spending in other areas (such as market
development, the development of harvesting and agricultural technology, research in soil conservation,

91
   For instance, through these mechanisms the government pays a subsidy of MRO 92 per kg that covers almost 70 percent of
the sale price.
92
   These include National Union of Agricultural Cooperatives and Saving of Mauritania (UNCACEM), Fund for Deposits and
Development (CDD), National Union of Cooperative Savings and Credit for Livestock (UNCECEL) and Mutual Investment and
Credit Oasis (MICO).

                                                           89
and crop varieties). Subsidies may also be inefficient, as there is some evidence that they have not fully
benefited small farmers but have increased profits of the wealthier groups (huskers, transporters, input
providers, and rice suppliers). Despite their relatively weak progress in raising incomes and increasing
agricultural productivity, the subsidy programs are politically popular, increasing the risk the
government will have difficulty in rolling them back.
164. The design and efficiency of Mauritania’s agriculture subsidy system also show shortcomings.
Mauritania’s agriculture subsidy system is costly due to the large gap between the price at which the
public or private dealers buy seeds and farm equipment in the market and the price at which they sell
them to the government, which in turn distributes them to the farmers. The system also has other
inefficiencies:
       There are large differences between the amount of fertilizer distributed, according to
        administrative documents, and the amount effectively used by the farmers based on the
        acreage declared to the Fund for Deposits and Development (Caisse de Dépôts et de
        Développement; CDD) by farmers to obtain fertilizer based on a preferential loan (currently
        300kg/ha). Farmers may use less than they have declared and sell the excess at market price to
        agribusinesses.
       Low-quality fertilizer and rice seeds are being sold at high prices to the farmers—imported
        fertilizer is being purchased abroad at a low price and low quality and sold at a fixed high price
        to the farmers. The current urea content is 46 percent instead of 22 percent, resulting in an
        increase of use from 300 kilograms of urea per hectare to 700 kg/ha.
       The availability of inputs is delayed, resulting in delayed planning—delays can take up to 5–6
        months due to a chain of approvals and transfers of resources from the government to the CDD,
        to the Mauritanian Company of Import and Export (Société Nationale d'Importation et
        d'Exportation; SONIMEX) and finally to the farmers. Likewise farmers face similar delays for
        payment; they have to sell their rice at a fixed cost to the milling plant but are only paid several
        months later.
       It encourages the production of poor-quality seeds—subsidies can have the perverse effect of
        discouraging the production of higher-quality seeds as there is only one fixed price for all
        categories of rice.

Key Areas for Reform
165. Looking ahead there are a number of key areas for reform in the sector. Despite the attractive
nature of subsidies for some interest groups, the system of subsidizing inputs and administering prices
carries significant inefficiencies and inequities. In an effort to address this, the government recently
adopted a new decree that eliminates all rice subsidies. As the decree has not yet become effective, it
provides an opportunity for the government to implement it in the context of a new approach or reform
strategy that may include the following reforms:
       Ensure that funding, distribution of responsibilities, and staffing corresponds to core functions
        and sector priorities. With the recent creation of a separate Ministry of Agriculture, it would be
        important to review the Ministry’s 2015 budget in view of improved funding of core functions
        (such as R&D, extension services...) in comparison of the Ministry’s administrative functions.
        Responsibilities and staffing should also be reviewed to ensure it supports the sector’s efficient
        operation (i.e. the supervision missions to be conducted by the responsible executing agency)
        and front line units.



                                                    90
   Develop a transition strategy. The change from a publicly controlled market system to a
    market-oriented one may need to be implemented gradually over several years. Such a
    transition period would allow farmers and private operators to adjust to changes in prices and
    services. The preparation of a transition strategy constitutes a priority to allow a transparent
    and predictable implementation of the reforms. This transition seems to have started after the
    government declared in December 2015 that it was not willing to set a price for nor buy locally
    produced rice. This cold turkey strategy is much more effective than a gradual one, but may be
    more difficult to implement politically. A transition strategy carries some risk as it could allow
    those who are benefiting from the current situation (most of whom are in control of the current
    system) to prolong the transition or even block it altogether.
   Assess the impact of eliminating rice subsidies on the poor. Experience from other countries
    that have successfully eliminated crop price support show the importance of (i) compensating
    farmers for potential income loss, (ii) educating them about new support programs, and (iii)
    providing technical assistance. The government’s recent cut off of rice subsidies might have a
    significant impact on the poor. To identify appropriate mitigation measures it should assess the
    impact of the elimination of rice support subsidies on the lowest income groups and identify
    appropriate compensations mechanisms, such as direct cash transfer to farmers.
   Review options for smart subsidies. Production support for rice (from input subsidies to
    marketing assistance and price setting) is fiscally expensive and inefficient. Assessing the use of
    “smart subsidies? could help establish a more efficient system of production incentives (Box
    5.1).


                                     Box 5.1: Principles for Smart Subsidies
     Subsidies should be (i) targeted as effectively as possible at resource-poor farmers, (ii) work
     with the market (for example by giving vouchers to farmers rather than have the state
     distribute subsidized fertilizer), and (iii) time bound, with a clear schedule for phasing out
     when they have achieved their purpose. Indexation is a possible way of avoiding an
     indefinite government commitment.
     An example of such subsidies are “market-smart? fertilizer subsidies that promote fertilizer
     as part of an integrated package of improved crop-production technologies, coupled with
     measures focusing on the demand for fertilizer.

   Gradually close the Boutiques Emel. Recent reforms in the sector provide an opportunity for
    the government to establish long-term safety net interventions, invest in social services, and
    strengthen measures addressing market imperfections. The gradual closing of the Boutiques
    Emel could be carried out alongside the introduction and reinforcement of existing programs. In
    the first phase, the government could (i) orient the Emel Program toward rural areas by
    strengthening shops in those areas, (ii) reprioritize safety net interventions that target the
    poorest populations (for example scaling up the country’s cash transfer program, developing a
    mechanism for vouchers and reinforcing the cereal banks SAVS), and (iii) assessing the
    effectiveness of the market for basic food items. In the second phase, it needs to gradually close
    the Boutiques Emel, starting in areas where the cash transfer program is established and the
    private market is well functioning (World Bank 2014b).


                                                   91
   Build on the experience of the investments in the Senegal River Valley and further upscale this
    program. Drawing on the successful experience of the initial pro-poor investments in the
    Senegal River, the program should be further expanded in the Valley as well as to other areas
    suitable for such an intervention. The program should ensure support in the form of land
    maintenance services is provided, land tenure issues are addressed and resource-conserving
    technology are provided to sustain the investments and livelihoods.
   Increase sustainable investments in the agriculture sector. A gradual winding down of subsidies
    would free substantial public funds to be allocated to other priority investments in the sector.
    To promote productivity growth, priority should be given to investing in market infrastructure,
    agricultural technologies and institutions. The reallocation of public funds to R&D, technology
    promotion and adoption, and education could also significantly help increases yields and
    production efficiency. The recent preparation of Mauritania’s participation in the West Africa
    Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) provides an important opportunity for the country
    to benefit from the assistance provided under this program in capacity building and adopting
    improved technologies.
   Encouraging private sector investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The
    establishment of effective PPPs, supported by an improved business environment, can support
    the agricultural commercialization process, provide greater certainty on employment, and
    improve risk-adjusted returns to investments in agriculture. The government, with the support
    of the World Bank is currently funding a study to assess the use of PPPs in the livestock sector
    (notably for red meat). For the agriculture sector, it is recommended that Mauritania should
    assess opportunities for the use of PPPs in the red meat, milk production, and rice value chain
    which would contribute significantly to the sustainable development of the sector.
   Fully deconcentrate extension and advisory services for agriculture. Fully deconcentrating
    certain agricultural activities, notably extension and advisory services, could offer benefits
    including: (i) the timely provision of services (i.e. in case of a disease), (ii) a closer identification
    of farmers’ needs and increased specialization by an extension service, and (iii) the creation of
    incentive structures to reward the extension service for responding effectively to local needs
    (World Bank 2014b). To fully reap the benefits of deconcentrated services and authorities,
    Mauritania will need to simultaneously build capacity in the local units while gradually devolving
    and delegating resources and staff to front-line services. The central administration might be
    also need to accompany these efforts with cultural changes among centrally based bureaucrats
    towards the policy choice of pursuing deconcentration.

Chapter 6: Use of Resources in the Energy Sector


Progress on Increasing Supply of Energy, but the Sector Remains Highly Vulnerable to Rising
and Volatile Oil Prices.
166. Mauritania has made significant progress towards the achievements of its objectives in the
energy sector over the last years. The policy priorities of the energy sector included in the 2001–15
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper seek to: (i) improve the supply of electricity and access; (ii) promote
rural electrification and renewable energy; (iii) implement a policy based on a mix of more efficient
energy choices; (iv) ensure regularity of liquid hydrocarbon supplies in the context of healthy
competition and the safety of people, property, and the environment; (v) increase the supply of butane
gas to reduce demand for forest fuels; and (vi) strengthen the capacity of the sector. Over the past
years, the government has implemented an ambitious investment program that emphasizes reducing
energy costs by enhancing less-polluting and renewable energy sources. As a result, Mauritania went
from a chronic electricity shortage in 2008 to a surplus in 2014 that can be exported.93 The increases in
installed capacity by 250 percent can be in part attributed to continuous investments in thermal energy
but also in part to renewable energy (solar, wind, and hydroelectricity).94 According to the 2014
International Finance Corporation (IFC) enterprise survey, several of Mauritania’s sector indicators (such
as the number of power outages or shortages per month and delays in obtaining a connection to
electricity) are above average for Sub-Saharan Africa and lower middle-income countries (IFC 2014;
Figure 6.1). Access to energy has improved substantially in recent years with one-third of Mauritanians
having access to electricity in 2014 (Figure 6.2). Nevertheless, a comparison with other countries
suggests Mauritania still remains below the Sub-Saharan Africa average (35 percent).95




93
   The total installed capacity (national park production – excluding production for mining sector use) increased from 88 MW to
310 MW between 2008 and 2014. In addition, the current power capacity from the available interconnected network
(Nouakchott, Rosso, and Kaedi Boghé) totals 205 MW while the total peak demand of cities connected to the interconnected
system is 101.5 MW, resulting in a surplus of 103.5 MW.
94
   The government commissioned the Sheikh Zayed 15 MW solar plant in Nouakchott, and constructed a 30 MW wind power
plant. In addition, the government commissioned in October 2015 a 180 MW dual fuel power plant (Centrale du Nord) that is
currently running on heavy fuel oil and can run on natural gas once gas from Banda reservoir is made available. Rehabilitation
and better management of OMVS hydroelectric plants in Manantali and Felou are also contributing to the increased capacity.
95
   Data for international comparisons are taken from the World Development Indicator database but are only available for
2012.

 167. Mauritania has an opportunity to scale up its renewable and clean energy sources, reducing
 costs and generating growth. Recent efforts to jumpstart renewable energy generation means it now
 makes up 16 percent of Mauritania’s total capacity, although heavy fuel oil (HFO) remained the main
 source of energy, at 84 percent in 2014. Electricity demand (excluding mining) is forecast to grow by 9
 percent per year until 2020 (World Bank 2014c). To cover the energy demand, the government plans to
 further enhance the energy mix. The country has significant renewable resources that could, if scaled
 up, can account for 35 percent of Mauritania’s capacity by 2035.96 Renewable energy sources can
 reduce the cost of electricity by providing services for off-grid populations and enable energy exports.
 168. While considerable progress has been made in access and production in recent years, the
 energy sector still faces considerable challenges on the policy, infrastructure, and investment front.
 Despite recent improvement in electricity coverage, rural electrification remains very low: only 4
 percent of the rural population have access to electricity. Low population density in a mostly desert
 country makes interconnection difficult and affects electricity production cost. Alongside this, old
 transmission and distribution systems impede private-sector development and improvements in the
 population’s living standards.
 169. Mauritania’s challenges are not only physical in nature, they are also economic, financial,
 legal, regulatory, and institutional. Given the dominance of oil-based electricity generation, the sector
 remains highly vulnerable to rising and volatile oil prices. It lacks sound energy strategies and policies,
 and its legislative and regulatory framework are insufficient. Its electricity tariff structure fails to
 accurately reflect the costs of generation and its national utility company, SOMELEC,97 is financially

 96
    The country has significant potential in solar energy (its estimated solar photovoltaic potential is 2,000–2,300 kWh/m2/year,

    SOMELEC has been struggling with heavy debt repayments and a widening deficit due to high generation costs dependent on
 oil-based thermal generation capacity and low electricity tariffs, resulting in reliance on government subsidies. The more

insolvent, with limited capacity to implement infrastructure projects due to poor financial management.
Private-sector participation in energy is lacking due to the absence of a legal and regulatory framework,
inadequate administrative capacities, and weak public governance that has dampened enthusiasm for
public-private partnerships (PPPs). These factors all hamper the investment the electricity system needs
and the enhancement of Mauritania’s energy mix—the latter is critical for reducing cost and the
country’s fiscal risk. To address some of these flaws, the government has put in place a sector recovery
plan to improve the power companies’ financial performance with some tangible results.
170. The development of the Banda Gas-to-Power Project was projected to substantially reorient
Mauritania’s energy mix away from imported oil and towards domestically produced gas in 2016/17.
The project, supported by World Bank guarantees, consisted of the following components: (i) the Banda
offshore gas field production, transmission, and processing infrastructure; (ii) a 300 MW gas-to-power
plant located in the north of Nouakchott; and (iii) existing and new power transmission lines to
distribute power. Out of the 300 MW of power generated, Mauritania would be able to sell 125 MW to
mining customers and the public utility, and export 125 MW to Senegal and 50 MW to Mali.
Unfortunately, the project suffered a setback after the departure of the main private investor, Tullow
Oil, in late 2014 against the backdrop of declining oil prices. As a result, Banda gas has not yet been
developed; out of the 300 MW planned, 180 MW were commissioned late 2015 and are now running on
HFO. A review of the project’s fiscal and regulatory requirements was conducted by the Bank and a
technical and financial advisor, suggesting the development of the Banda gas field through a PPP
structure. The government has recruited strategic and legal advisors to support it in restructuring the
project and the recruitment of a new gas operator.

Subsidies are Driving Up the Energy Budget While Investment in Renewables Lags Behind …
171. Budgetary allocations to the energy sector have more than quadrupled in real terms between
2010 and 2014 with a slight drop in 2015.98 Between 2010 and 2014, total budget appropriations to the
energy sector have increased substantially in real terms (by 44 percent) and as a share of the national
budget (from 5 percent in 2010 to 14 percent in 2014, see Figure 6.3). The increase in the sector’s
budget is partly attributable to the government’s fuel subsidy program, launched in response to spikes
in the international fuel prices in 2008 and 2011. It is also partly due to the scaling up of investments in
electricity, driven notably by a rise in development assistance. The upward trend reverses slightly in
2015 as shown by an 18 percent decline in real terms from the previous year. On the whole, budgetary
allocations to the sector totaled 2.5 percent of GDP or US$150 million in 2015. A Master Plan for the
Production and Transport of Electricity was adopted in 2012 focusing on energy supply using a
combination of natural gas and HFO as the fuel of choice. This was complemented by a recently
prepared three-year rolling Energy Action Plan 2015–17, to better plan investments. The sector’s
investment needs for the five years between 2013 and 2017 were estimated at US$468 million (US$265
million for production, US$158 million for transport, and US$47 million for distribution) (SNC LAVALIN
2013). However, the sector’s investment planning is weak (lacking least cost expenditure planning,
indicators, and so on), hampering the effective strategic management of the sector as well as fiscal and
physical sustainability.




electricity SOMELEC sells, the larger the debt it incurs. The scattering of production and distribution facilities over a vast
territory have affected production management. Low levels of bill payment from private and public-sector consumers, and
technical and commercial losses have further adversely impacted the agency’s financial and operational performance.

 172. The distribution of public resources reflects the government’s priority of expanding access to
 electricity, though recent investment in less polluting and renewable energy sources show a promising
 upward trend. On average, three-quarters of the total energy budget goes to support the electricity
 sector, reflecting the government’s gains in providing access to electricity over the past years. Public
 resources in favor of clean energy have mainly focused on butane gas subsidies while investments in
 natural gas exploitation have been mainly carried out by a mix of public and private investors, together
 with development partners. Recent years show a substantial increase in government spending on
 renewable energy (notably wind and solar power), rising from 1 percent of total energy investment
 appropriations in 2010 to 22 percent in 2015. Even though this funding level is still far from the level
 needed to initiate the country’s transition to large-scale use of renewable resources, it is already
 considered a leader in the sub-region in the installation of renewable energy projects (IRENA 2015).

 ...And Have Proved Highly Regressive Particularly for the Rural Poor
 173. Energy access initiatives have successfully increased access to electricity services among the
 urban poor, but the rural poor remain at a disadvantage. Access to electricity significantly improves
 households’ conditions and promotes the economic activities of the most vulnerable populations.
 Extensive evidence suggests that rural electrification has substantial benefits, promoting production and
 better health and education for households (Torero 2014). A report by the World Bank’s Independent
 Evaluation Group (IEG 2008) showed that the rates of return on rural electrification projects justify the
 investment. Nonetheless, similar to other Sub-Saharan African countries, the high cost of providing
 electricity services in lightly populated, remote places with difficult terrain, low affordability, and greater
 electricity loss due to long distances, have hampered investments in rural electrification. Even though
 the government’s commitment to rural electrification is documented in its development plans, only a
 small share of the investment in the sector went towards rural electrification, implying political


                                                                              96
reluctance to invest in energy services in rural areas. Nonetheless, the government’s investment in
urban electrification targeting populations on the outskirts of the cities has successfully enabled access
for urban poor communities, improving their quality of life and socioeconomic status.
174. Traditional biomass energy is the main source of energy for most of the rural population, but
this is associated with significant negative impacts on health and the environment. The main use of
energy in households is for cooking, followed by heating and lighting (IEA 2006). Given the low levels of
electrification in rural areas in Mauritania, most of the population depend on non-commercial energy
resources for their needs. Traditional biomass, such as fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural waste, and
animal dung, provides 64 percent of primary energy consumption. However, when biomass is used as
the primary fuel for cooking, it is usually burned inefficiently, resulting in substantial emissions of air
pollutants that affect human mortality and morbidity rates, especially for children (Yeh 2004). Reliance
on biomass for energy can also adversely impact education, income, and the environment (IEA 2006).
175. Mauritania’s energy subsidy program, introduced in 2011 in response to increases in oil prices,
is intended to protect the consumption level of the entire population but has proved highly
regressive. In response to fiscal pressures due to high oil prices and an increased wage bill, Mauritania’s
fiscal adjustment strategy included energy subsidies to support much needed social spending while
allowing for budget cuts in other areas. The purpose of the energy subsidy program was twofold: (i) to
give low-income households in forest communities access to free butane bottles for cooking, generating
positive externalities with respect to income, health, and the environment; and (ii) to enhance access to
affordable energy for poor families by subsidizing electricity costs. Despite the intention to achieve
some type of redistribution to the poor, the government has recognized that—similar to the experience
of other countries—the program strongly favored the rich at the expense of the poor. According to the
IMF, only 13 percent of the electricity and butane gas subsidies were captured by the poorest 40
percent of households, thus contributing to income inequality rather than reducing it (Figure 6.5).

The Government Has Become Dependent on External Assistance
176. Mauritania’s funding policy for the sector has put an emphasis on energy subsidies since 2011;
though the Government was able to capitalize on the recent low oil prices and reformed its subsidies
in 2015. Between 2010 and 2014 subsidies and transfers accounted on average to more than one-third
of total sector appropriations, largely financing subsidies for butane gas and electricity. At their peak in
2012, energy subsidies amounted to 4 percent of the national budget and 1 percent of GDP. Despite a

                                                      97
   modest drop in 2013, appropriations for both subsidies remained high, at MRO 14 Billion (US$ 46.6
   million) (Figure 6.6). These subsidies have not only been a drain on the budget but in some ways have
   undermined, rather than advanced, sustainable energy by diverting public resources away from
   investing in alternative energy sources or pro-poor programs in the sector. The recent decline in
   international oil prices has given the government an opportunity to revise Mauritania’s subsidy policy
   with limited social and economic backlash. In 2015 the government removed the electricity subsidies
   and cut subsidies for butane gas to MRO 7 Billion (US$ 23.3 million), freeing up resources for other much
   needed social and infrastructure spending.99
   177. Spending on salaries and goods and services has been low, adversely affecting the
   performance of operations and services.100 Appropriations for salaries have seen a modest increase but
   remain below 2 percent of total budget appropriations. Likewise, goods and services have accounted, on
   average, for less than 2 percent of the ministry’s total budget between 2010 and 2014, despite tripling in
   2014. The investment budget increased more than threefold between 2010 and 2015 (from MRO 10
   billion - US$ 33.3 million to MRO 40 billion – US$ 133 million), and despite a drop in real terms in 2015,
   its share of the total sector budget still amounted to 83 percent in the same year. Given these
   substantial investment flows in the sector over the past year, the low funding level of goods and services
   suggests insufficient attention is being paid to the incremental recurrent costs attributable to the
   increase in capital spending. These in turn can affect the operation and maintenance (O&M)
   expenditures needed to ensure the sustainability of an investment.

   178. Most of the sector’s growth in investment has been driven by development assistance,
   challenging budget credibility and contributing to a dual budget system. Domestically funded
   investments in the energy sector have been less of a priority for the government over the past years;

      Note energy subsidies have been managed in the past through special accounts but were included in the
   Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mining’s (MPEM) budget since 2010 to enhance budget transparency.

                                                                        98
   despite some fluctuations, budget allocations for investments show a downward trend, declining by 72
   percent in real terms between 2010 and 2015 (from MRO 10 billion to MRO 3 billion respectively – US$
   33.3 to US$ 10 million). Most of the government’s investments were to support the electricity expansion
   in the two largest cities, Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, as well as a few new rural electrification
   locations. As in other countries in the region, the government’s limited resource envelope means much
   of the financing for energy sector investments in Mauritania comes from international development
   partners, rising from 21 percent of total sector funding in 2010 to 66 percent in 2014.101
   179. A review of donor projects over the period 2010–14 found the bulk of assistance concentrated
   on electricity projects in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, while only a few benefited rural
   electrification.102 However, development assistance has played a critical role in supporting renewable
   energy, especially in the last three years. The off-budget nature of donor aid is also further exacerbating
   the problem of a separate recurrent and investment budget. As it is less likely that sufficient funding for
   O&M will be secured for externally funded investments in the domestic budget, this could further affect
   the financial sustainability of these investments.

   180. Public investments in the energy sector, particularly externally funded ones, suffer from a low
   budget execution rate. Several domestically funded investments included in the 2013 budget were cut
   due to absorption constraints of the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mining (MPEM). These included
   priority projects supporting rural electrification (MRO 0.6 billion – US$ 2 million), renewable energy
   (MRO 1.2 billion – US$ 4 million), and SOMELEC (MRO 2 billion – US$ 6.6 million). Difficulties prioritizing,
   planning, and managing investment projects are further exacerbated by large parts of the investment

   101
       Many development partners are active in Mauritania’s energy sector. Several development partners (including Islamic
   Development Bank, European Union, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, French Development Agency, France,
   United Nations Development Program and Spain) have supported 20 projects with a focus on power generation facilities in
   rural areas, wind power plants, hybrid solar-thermal power station the modernization of the national electricity generation and
   transport system. (IRENA 2015).
   102
       Note that AFD provided budget support to the sector; this is accounted in the total of donor aid but its use and destination
   cannot be assessed in detail.

                                                                 99
budget being financed and executed off budget by development partners. A review of selected
externally funded investments also shows challenges in absorbing externally funded public resources—
execution rates range from 2 percent to 80 percent across the projects. This weak implementation
performance is caused by a number of factors such as slow procurement process, weak technical
capacity in budgeting and planning, and complex donor procedures. Nevertheless, the higher execution
rates of domestically funded projects is partly a sign of weaker controls which increases the risk of
procurement fraud and corruption.

The Financial Situation of SOMELEC has Improved, but Exposure to Fuel Oil Makes It
Vulnerable to Price Increases
181. The government has put in place a sector recovery plan to improve SOMELEC’s financial
situation, but poor management and governance weaknesses remain a critical challenge. The sector
recovery plan has five medium term components for SOMELEC: (i) reinforce sector oversight by the line
ministry, including through an updated performance agreement between the government and
SOMELEC; (ii) recapitalize the company through financial restructuring; (iii) urgently invest and
rehabilitate generation and distribution infrastructure; (iv) improve commercial performance, including
through introduction of pre-payment meters; and (v) restructure human resources and increase
training. The recovery plan is being implemented with support from the Agence Française de
Développement (AFD), and has included a consolidation of cross debts between the government and
SOMELEC, and a recapitalization of the latter. Other recent measures include a performance contract
between SOMELEC and the government but it lacks performance specifications (cahier de charge) and
implementation decrees.
182. While efforts have been made to rein in technical and non-technical losses between 2010 and
2013, these efforts were not sustained in the last two years. SOMELEC has been able to reduce
technical and commercial losses from 29 percent of 2010 to 23 percent in 2013 while improving
substantially collection rate from 62 percent in 2010 to 82 percent in 2013. Unfortunately, global grid
efficiency has fallen again, down to 70.7 percent in 2015, below the 2010 level (Table 6.1). Thus, the
positive financial result posted in 2015 is mostly the result of the dramatic fall in oil price, over which
SOMELEC has no control.

183. SOMELEC remains financially insolvent and requires an urgent recapitalization. Between 2010
and 2014, SOMELEC’s income deficit has declined from MRO 12.1 billion (US$42 million) to about MRO
2.3 billion (US$7.8 million) in 2014 and this deficit turned into a surplus in 2015.103 Also notable is the

fact that SOMELEC did not receive any operating subsidy in 2015. Nevertheless, the consecutive years of
negative earnings have taken their toll on SOMELEC’s balance sheet: its equity portion is negative in
2015 with paid-in capital of MRO 42.3 billion (US$141 million) versus a negative MRO 48 billion (US$160
million) of retained earnings. The company is currently operating on short, medium and long-term debt;
it is technically insolvent. This testifies to the urgency of its need for a capital injection.

Key Areas for Reform
184. There are some important reforms that the sector can undertake to enhance access and
efficiency
      ?     It is absolutely imperative to reduce grid losses by at least one-third. Without network and
            billing improvements, the electricity tariff, which is already high in absolute terms (20 USc/kWh),
            will need to be increased to bridge the gap between revenues and costs. SOMELEC has
            demonstrated that it has the capacity to reduce these losses between 2010 and 2013.
      ?     Reduce reliance on imported fuel oil by pushing ahead with the Banda gas to power project.
            Currently the sector is heavily reliant on fuel oil for power generation, which happens to be
            competitive in the depressed oil price environment. However, the government is recommended
            to pursue the Banda Gas to Power project as the key strategy for diversifying its energy mix. The
            World Bank remains committed to the development of this project for the benefit of
            Mauritania, Senegal, and Mali, which all share a strong reliance on liquid fuels.
      ?     Hedge itself against oil price variations for the short and medium term. Given the exceptionally
            low oil price environment, SOMELEC should pursue hedging instruments to lock in the low price
            in order to reduce the impact of future oil price increases on its financial results.
      ?     Revise the electricity tariff structure. The structure of the tariff needs to be revised to allow
            SOMELEC to properly invest in maintenance and system improvements and improve equity.
            Designing a better tariff structure should start with a clear methodology to set tariffs that reflect
            costs, implemented through a phased approach to help to mitigate the impact on household
            energy expenditure and accompanied by a far-reaching communication strategy to ensure
            public support.
      ?     Well-targeted measures to mitigate the impact on the poor. Keeping the social electricity tariff
            that protects the most vulnerable customers would be a good option until better social


104
   In addition to operational subsidies, SOMELEC also receives ‘investment subsidies’ which were approximately
2.5 Bn MRO per year

                                                           101
    assistance mechanisms could be developed or scaled up (for example, the cash transfer
    program). The effectiveness of the LPG program could be refined to be better targeted on the
    poor, for example through the subsidy of small gas canisters (“bonbonnes?) but not those used
    by large-scale consumers. The freed-up budget resources could then be also used to expand
    programs with quick tangible results (for instance, school meals, public works, or reductions in
    education and health user fees).
?   Promote rural electrification. Well-planned, carefully targeted, and effectively implemented
    rural electrification programs provide enormous benefits to rural people. A rigorous rural
    electrification policy and a clear programmatic vision, together with the mobilization of
    resources, are key elements to create rural electrification programs on a national scale.
?   Develop electricity networks, in particular in the Senegal River Valley. Priority should be given
    in the next few years to the development of electricity networks to enable border areas to use
    electric existing transmission lines to take advantage of surplus energy available in the country.
    In particular, the installation of low and medium voltage electrical systems in farming areas of
    the Senegal River valley could accelerate the industrialization of the country, especially in the
    food industry, directly improving the living conditions of the population.
?   Better governance and improved management. SOMELEC needs better governance and
    internal controls to improve accountability, transparency, and data reliability. A first critical step
    to achieving this would be to improve implementation of the current performance contract.
?   Encourage PPPs. The sector needs urgent and substantial investments in new generation,
    transmission, and distribution infrastructure. Given the shortage of public funds, the
    government could benefit from partnering with the private sector through a PPP arrangement
    to enhance the quality of projects in transmission and distribution. A key prerequisite would be
    a sound investment climate and legal framework to define public-sector responsibilities.
?   Increase investments in renewable energy. In a country like Mauritania, the decentralized
    nature of renewable energy can have enormous benefits, particularly for poorer rural areas.
    Renewable energy can offer a secure and reliable energy alternative that is able to increase the
    standard of living of rural and less developed communities. Further, local authorities can invest
    in local renewable energy infrastructure and services, allowing for significant local added value
    creation in terms of job creation and boosting local economic growth.
?   Improve coordination and aid management. The creation of a platform for consultation and
    exchange between actors in the electricity sector would allow resources to be optimized and
    improve the implementation of projects, especially with regards to the programming, and
    monitoring and evaluation of investments at a national level. Alongside this, the establishment
    of a reliable information system on donor aid may contribute to improved traceability,
    accountability, and transparency in the management of aid.

Concluding observations

185. This report has looked at trends in public budgeting and spending between 2010 and 2015 with
a focus on the poverty impact of public expenditures in Mauritania.
186. Mauritania has enjoyed an extraordinarily positive macroeconomic environment over the
period under review, driven by high commodities prices and resulting in large windfalls for the state.
A large number of investments were financed during the period, but its impact on growth has been
curtailed by poor investment selection practices and value for money. Now that the commodities super-
cycle has come to an end and the medium term outlook remains subdued, the GOM will have to manage
with tighter budgets in the years ahead. This will require more efficient use of scarce resources. A
conscious effort will be needed to broaden the tax base and reduce the reliance on volatile extractives
revenues. Political will is going to be essential to strengthen public financial management and public
investment management practices.
187. Mauritania has achieved a remarkable reduction in poverty between 2008 and 2014, but the
exact contribution of public programs to this result is unclear. This report finds that public spending
overall has not been well targeted or efficient and as such has probably not had the full impact that it
could. It also found that public spending is largely regressive in social sectors like education, health, and
agriculture where the funds are spent on central administration, university education and scholarships,
urban hospitals, etc. – and as a consequence the rural poor are severely disadvantaged and
underserved. When accessed, the services provided to the poor are often of low quality: problems of
efficiency abound, such as health centers lacking essential medicines and teachers that are absent from
public schools. Emergency social safety nets programs and agricultural subsidies have benefited from
greater financing, but the programs remain fragmented and ill-targeted. As a result, the poorest are
unable to access basic services and their opportunities to take part in Mauritanian society as active and
productive citizens are limited. In the longer term, such exclusion can build resentment and become a
source of social instability.
188. In particular, stronger controls are needed to safeguard public funds from fraud, corruption
and wastage. GDP growth has been driven by capital formation, but the future financial and social
returns on public investment projects remain uncertain given the weakness of systems to ensure good
project evaluation, selection, programming, execution, and control. As a first step, the priority should be
put on implementing basic elements of formal project selection and appraisal, execution and controls
such as (i) allowing investment projects to advance only if they are mature enough and closely monitor
them (iii) using resources effectively by getting value for money in public procurement and carefully
manage contracts to avoid cost and time overruns (iv) ensure investment projects are audited and
evaluated ex-post as required.
189. Finally, tighter financing constraints make it even more urgent to collect timely data to track
public spending appropriately and to deliver results. Differences in budget classifications and a
fragmentation of fiscal data make it impossible for the authorities to prepare timely and complete
reports on its entire budget execution and thus prevents a comprehensive monitoring of public
spending, from budget appropriation to payment. Incomplete and fragmented data and weak
monitoring also increase the risks of waste, fraud and corruption in public spending, which Mauritania
cannot afford in years ahead.

Annex A2: List of Financial Management Information Systems in Mauritania

1.       RACHAD (Réseau Automatisé de Chaîne de la Dépense): RACHAD software has been in use
since 2006 by the Budget Directorate to manage the allocation of budget resources and commitments,
and the preparation of payment orders. RACHAD is a commercial package developed by ST2I, Tunisia,
using the Oracle database platform.105 Initial deployment of the RACHAD was funded by the Public
Sector Capacity Building Project (Projet de Renforcement des Capacités du Secteur Public; PRECASP) to
about US$146,000. This web-based system can be used by 250 concurrent users to manage current and
capital budget expenditures. The interface between RACHAD and the Central Bank (BCM) has been
developed through another contract in 2011(US$99,000). Although the new interface has improved the
speed of processing payments (check or cash), the total duration of payment processing is around 3 –5
days. This is expected to be improved during the implementation of new project with the introduction of
electronic payment systems and treasury single account (TSA) operations. The system is also linked to
Beite El Male for processing of payment orders.
2.      Beite El Male Treasury Accounting System: the Beite El Male software was developed by a local
consultant/firm in 2002, to automate central government accounting and reporting functions. The
Treasury directorate is using this system to record all budget transactions by combining
revenue/expenditure data received from tax/customs and other entities. The software has been
developed using a commercial platform (WinDev) and is based on an MS SQL database. The team was
informed that the dispute between the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the software developer
regarding the ownership of the source code has been resolved, and the development of interfaces with
other systems is in progress (SITP, JIBAYA, SYDONIA, NOVA, TEHLIL, etc.).
3.      SITP (Système d’Information Trésor Public): the SITP system was developed by a local firm in
2005 to support the monitoring of public expenditures with dynamic (daily) updates on the Treasury
website. It also supports the electronic filing of transaction documents (about 450,000) in the Treasury
archive (as PDF files). Interfaces with other PFM systems are expected to be developed in Q4 2014.
Other PFM entities will have read-only access to SITP records once these interfaces are completed. SITP
is a web-based locally developed software platform based on open source solutions (Java and MySQL).
Reports on budget revenues (including extractive industries) and expenditures are being published on
the Treasury website regularly.106
4.       JIBAYA (Tax Administration System) + Numéro d’Identifiant Fiscal (NIF): the General Tax
Directorate (Direction Générale des Impôts, DGI) signed a contract with Arab Soft, Tunisia107 in April
2011 for US$648,000, for the development of web-based tax system (JIBAYA) application (locally
developed software based on Java, Oracle and Web Logic). Three additional contracts were signed in
May 2013 for Oracle licenses, workstations, hardware, and network equipment (US$590,000 in total).
The development of system requirements, testing and acceptance phases have been completed in three
years, and the system has been fully operationally since 2014 (with a total cost of about US$1.238
million). The team was informed that the longer-than-expected implementation of JIBAYA was due to
extensive customization needs of the DGI to comply with new legislation and regulations, as well as the

introduction of new Tax ID Number (Numéro d’Identifiant Fiscal; NIF). The system includes a number of
key modules to support tax assessment, filing, collections, case management, vehicle taxes, and more.
Remaining challenges include the activation of the e-Filing module, and the development of interfaces
with Treasury and other PFM systems. JIBAYA is hosted in a server room located in DGI building (no
disaster recovery solution yet) and maintained by the IT team trained by Arab Soft. The new government
main data center can be used as the future hosting platform of JIBAYA to minimize the cost of system
maintenance and support.
5.     SYDONIA++         (Automated System for Customs Data/Système Douanier Automatisé): The
General Customs Directorate (DGD) has used the SYDONIA/ASYCUDA system since 1999 as a customs
management solution in 14 locations (customs offices/ports) countrywide. In 2012, the system was
upgraded to SYDONIA++ running on Oracle. Servers are located in the DGD data center (no disaster
recovery solution yet). The system was originally developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) and is currently used in more than 80 countries.108 The customs
administration initiated the migration to the latest web-based version, SYDONIA World in 2014, which
was expected to be completed by May 2015, with support from UNCTAD experts. The DGD can benefit
from the countrywide fiber optic backbone being established through WARCIP to improve network
connectivity, and the shared MDC and DRC platforms for daily data exchange and backup needs.
6.      SIGADE (Debt Management and Financial Analysis System/Système Intégré de Gestion
Automatisée de la Dette Externe): the MEF has been using the SIGADE/DMFAS software developed by
UNCTAD as their external debt management software since 1985.109 The system is running on Oracle
and hosted in the DDE server room. Similar to other PFM systems, there seems to be an opportunity to
use MDC and DRC as shared platforms and minimize maintenance and support costs. The latest version
of SIGADE could be used to benefit from new capabilities and expand the scope of the system to support
domestic debt management as well. Development of an interface with the treasury system could also
help in automating the debt payments and reconciliation of debt data during the implementation of
new project.
7.     BUDGET (Budget Preparation System): The budget formulation and preparation is not
automated through a database application yet. The MEF Budget Directorate is currently working with
the GIZ for the development of budget preparation system requirements. In order to avoid the
development of an incompatible system or overlapping functionality, this activity needs to be well
coordinated with the new project activities supporting the PFM systems.
8.      SYBSIM (Public Investment Budget Monitoring System). The MEF has developed another locally
developed software platform (most probably based on Oracle) with support from local consultants for
programming and monitoring the consolidated public investment budget, and the system is being used
since 2010. It would be useful if the MEF Budget Department can communicate with the MAED officials
who are already using the DAD software and may be implementing the public investment management
module of the same platform to perform similar tasks. There is a need to collaborate and coordinate
closely during the preparation of new project to optimize the design of new components and avoid
duplicate investments.
9.      DAD (Development Assistance Database). The Development Assistance Database (DAD)
software is being used by the MAED for monitoring the donor funded project activities and
disbursements since 2013. DAD is commercial off-the-shelf software developed by Synergy International
Systems with support from the UN, and the DAD Mauritania is currently hosted in the Synergy cloud

funded projects in Mauritania, with a total commitment of US$4.358 billion. Various graphical analysis
tools, geographical information system modules, and reporting options are available to create detailed
outputs on all these projects. The DAD also has a public investment management modules supporting
the full cycle of investment planning. Such a module can be used to extend the capabilities and link this
platform with other PFM systems.
10.     SIGPE (Système Informatique de Gestion du Personnel de l’Etat): SIGPE is the current human
resource management (HRM) system of the government managed by the MoCS to support various
functions for all civil employees since 1992. It was originally developed by the Tunisian Public
administration and later on adapted to the needs in Mauritania. SIGPE is locally developed based on
Oracle, and will be replaced by NOVA in January 2015.
11.      RATEB (Réseau Automatisée du Traitement et Salaires des Employés Payés sur Bull): RATEB
was developed by the MOF as a civil service registry and payroll calculation system in 2010. RATEB is
locally developed software based on open source platforms (Java on NetBeans IDE) and using MS SQL
database. The system is currently used by 20 MOF users to update records and manage payments (max
150 concurrent users) of about 37,000 employees. The system is expected to be replaced by NOVA in
January 2015.
12.     EL MAACH (Pension Management System): EL MAACH is locally developed software (based on
Oracle) used by the MOF to pay pensions since 2011. The system includes the records of 22,000
pensioners (9,500 civil + 12,500 non-civil). EL MAACH is linked with RATEB and Beite El Male to exchange
data on pensioners and payment details. The system is expected to be replaced by NOVA in January
2015.
13.     NOVA (HRMIS and Payroll/Pension System): the MEF and MoCS will be using the new NOVA
Portal starting from January 2015 for HRM information systems (HRMIS), payroll, and pension
payments, replacing existing solutions with an integrated platform. NOVA is based on a commercial
package (using Oracle DB) developed by NOVATIVE, Switzerland.111 The specifications of the system
have been prepared in three years (2008–11) and the selection process began in 2011 (the team was
informed that this was the fourth attempt to develop an integrated HRMIS/payroll since 1993). Initial
contracts for the development of HRMIS application software were signed in Jan/Feb 2012 (US$598,000
+ US$232,000). The system development, testing, and acceptance activities were completed in early
2014. In the meantime, three additional contracts have been signed for licenses, workstations and
servers (US$572,000 in total). Based on the information available, the total cost of NOVA
implementation has been around US$1.4 million) since 2012. The system is designed for 1,000
concurrent users and there is a three-year warranty period (until 2017). NOVA supports a large number
of HRM functions, and most of these are not actively used yet. The team noted that the NOVA database
is designed to capture National ID numbers of employees. However, there is no link between this
platform and National ID system to verify these numbers or exchange data. A number of interfaces are
expected to be developed to link NOVA with other PFM systems in 2014.
14.     TEHLIL (Land Title Registration System): the authorities have developed a new platform for
managing land titles. The ministry’s team of experts and local consultants have developed a web based
platform using open source solutions (Java, MySQL) in a relatively short time and with modest
investments (PRECASP funding for land titling system was US$158,000 in 2013). The system is hosted in

a server room located in the DGDPE (Domaines) building. Approximately 23,000 titles have been
scanned and included in the database since the introduction of the system in early 2014 (before this
new system, only about 7,000 titles were registered from 2010 to 2014). It is expected that additional
26,000 titles can be registered through new system once it is fully deployed to cover all regions. The
TEHLIL system has six modules, including the registration of titles, receipts, and permit authorization.
The DGDPE management is in contact with the Association of Banks, the DGI and other government
entities to establish linkages with relevant systems and expand the capabilities of the system. They are
also very much interested in using shared platforms and integration of their platform with other PFM
systems, to maximize the benefits.
15.      i-World (audit and risk management software): i-World is the audit and risk management
system selected by the IGE to automate their core practices. The system has been selected during
recently completed GIZ funded activities, and the IGE is in the process of establishing proper information
and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and learning more about the capabilities of i-World
to be able to use the system. i-World is a commercial application software developed by S-Consult AG,
Switzerland and is currently using MS SQL.112 The system is expected to be operational in 2015, once the
IGE ICT infrastructure and staff training are completed.
16.     MIS (Management Information System): the MEF Budget IT Unit has installed an open source
management information system in 2013, to support online analytical processing of budget results. The
Jasper Soft platform is being used as a business intelligence solution to analyze the results of budget
execution by extracting data from RACHAD and Beite El Male databases.
17.      National ID (National Identification System): The ANRPTS (Agence Nationale du Registre des
Populations et des Titres Sécurisés)113 is the key agency issuing National ID cards for citizens. The
Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization issued a call for bids for the development of National ID in
Dec 2009. The contract to develop an integrated system was awarded to Morpho/SAFRAN, France114 in
June 2010, and eventually signed in July 2011. System implementation was completed in 2012 and
digital National ID cards have been issued to most of the 3.7 million citizens since then. The team noted
that the biometric and smart card features are included, but have not been effectively utilized. The
National ID card has a huge potential for use in a number of e-Government services and the government
can develop an action plan to expand its utilization in several key sectors (education, health, finance,
social protection, etc.) within the scope of ongoing activities and e-Government program.
18.    e-Government Program: the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training and New
Technologies is coordinating the e-Government activities and assisting the government entities to
improve their ICT infrastructure, staff skills, and basic services.115 There seems to be a chance to benefit
from the opportunities provided through ongoing e-Government program activities while designing and
implementing shared platforms for an integrated GFMIS solution through the proposed project.
19.     El Khazin (Local government accounting system): the MEF developed the El Khazin software for
local governments to provide support for the automation of accounting and reporting processes. The
team was unable to meet with relevant officials to learn more about this platform during this visit.
However, this platform can be analyzed in more detail during the development of integrated GFMIS
model for possible integration of existing capabilities.

Annex A3: Methodology for Public Investment Impact Assessment

The model draws on IMF data to derive Mauritania’s monetary, national, fiscal and balance of payments
accounts. A number of steps were applied to construct the model. The first step was to project the
accounts forward to 2050 using conservative assumptions and reflecting historical long-term trends
were possible.116 Second, baseline accounts were derived after removing the PIP and its expected
impact from the macroeconomic accounts for 2014-2050. Third, assumptions were made on the likely
flows of PIP funds and their impact on the economy (demand effects), and their expected benefits
accruing:
Step 1: producing the baseline accounts
First, projections were developed for the macroeconomic accounts.
         The GDP deflator was disaggregated on a sectoral basis and projected from 2016 to 2050 on the
          basis of historical trends.
         Real GDP was projected from 2014 to 2032 by sector based on simple assumptions. The sectors
          were totaled to provide us with real GDP. Real GDP by sector was then multiplied by their
          respective GDP deflators to obtain nominal GDP.
         After growth forecasts had been obtained, projections were made for the demand components
          of GDP: imports, exports, investment, consumption, and savings. These projections were later
          refined following more detailed projections of imports, exports in the balance of payments, and
          government consumption and investment in the fiscal accounts.
         Projections were made for the balance of payments based on assumptions, such as historical
          trends or shares. Minor increases were assumed for the capital and financial account due to
          small increases in other public investment.117
         Similarly forecasts of revenues and grants were based on conservative projections with the
          assumption that deficit is covered by domestic borrowing.
         Finally, reserve money growth is calculated assuming a precise relationship with the balance of
          payments and fiscal accounts.
Second, an important aspect of this analysis was to estimate the impact of the PIP compared to
the counterfactual, i.e. what would have happened if the PIP had not taken place. Therefore,
baseline accounts had to be constructed to remove the likely impact of the PIP from all the
main accounts.
         Estimates were made on the likely impact of the PIP and these effects were removed from the
          macroeconomic accounts.
         The likely impact of the PIP was estimated from the output accounts – see step 2.




116
    For example, some line items are assumed to have stagnant growth. For example, projections for donor financing are based
on existing trends, with the assumption of no new, additional investment.

    It is assumed that the balance of payments (deficit or surplus) are exclusively financed by NFA.

                           Box A1: Constructing GDP by Demand Component
     i.    Consumption
          Private consumption was projected on the basis of a simple growth rate.
          Public consumption was derived from current expenditure in the fiscal accounts.
     ii. Investment
      Public investment is derived from capital expenditure in the fiscal accounts.
      Private investment was calculated by subtracting gross domestic investment and the
         current account balance from gross national savings.
     iii. Imports and exports
      Imports and exports of goods and services are taken from the balance of payments
          (BOP) plus respective service credits and service debits.
     iv. Gross national disposable income (GNDI)
      GNDI is estimated by adding GDP to transfers and income in the BOP. This estimation
         was revised, once the balance of payments projection had been finalized.
     v. Gross National Savings (GNS)
      GNS is obtained, by deducting total consumption from GNDI.
      Public national savings were estimated by adding grants in the balance of payments) to
        public domestic savings.
      Private national savings are estimated as GNS minus public national savings.
     vi.   We can then compare:
          GDP plus imports; to
          Exports plus consumption and investment.
          The figures should roughly match.
     vii. This is a useful check against estimates of GDP by sector (supply). There should be a
          coherent story between the two.



Step 2: Producing the output sheets
The output sheets attempt to capture the impact attributable to the PIP. By making a series of
conservative assumptions on the flows and their impact on different factor groups and economic
sectors. As a result, it is able to ascertain the additional impact on the macroeconomic accounts: balance
of payments, monetary, fiscal, national accounts, use of resources.
More specifically, the output sheets makes assumptions:
   On the likely financing of the PIP and its financing terms to model debt flows.
   To assess the likely impact of the PIP on factor groups and economic sectors. More specifically,
    assumptions are made on the composition of spending of resource types across savings,
    investment, consumption, and taxes.
   In addition, the impact of the PIP was ascertained on prices and supply across five selected
    economic sectors—construction and public works, transport, manufacturing, agriculture, and
    services. A number of assumptions are made:

                                                    6
                   The demand effects are assumed to be constant throughout the period. It is assumed
                    that suppliers are rational and will increase their supply based on average PIP flows over
                    the financing period 2014-6.
                   The supply response in year 1 occurs when implementation of the program commences.
                   It is assumed that upon commencement of the demand effect, suppliers will start
                    investing, and the supply response in subsequent years will improve.
                   It should be noted, that since this analysis looks solely at the impact of the PIP from
                    2014-6, it is assumed the supply response disappears in 2017 upon the finalization of
                    this current PIP.118
Step 3: Producing the macroeconomic accounts
The output sheets form the basis for the calculation of the macroeconomic accounts, which can then be
compared to the baseline accounts, enabling us to compare the PIP’s impact on key macroeconomic
variables. In addition, it enables us to generate costs and benefits and conduct IRR analysis to estimate
the:
      The financial internal rate of return (FIRR);
      The fiscal economic internal rate of return (EIRR);
      The fiscal economy-wide internal rate of return (EWIRR);

A number of key assumptions were made to estimate the impact of the PIP on the macroeconomic
accounts from 2014 -2050:
     It was assumed that the benefits of the PIP would accrue from 2019 onwards.
     The return on the PIP in terms of increased GDP would be around 5 percent.
     The increased GDP would be in the form of higher exports, investment, consumption and taxes
       (see table 1 below).

                    Table 1. Effect of increase in GDP due to PIP on macroeconomic variables (in percent) allocation
                                                                                    Macroeconomic variable
                                                      Exports             Tax revenue          Private    Cons.      import     Total
                                                                  Income     Sales    Trade Invest.                  substit.
                                                         50.00       3.00       4.00     3.00         10         50        -            100




118
   The price effects are a proportion of the demand effects. For simplicity, the price effects and supply effects equal 100%. For
instance, in year 1 (or 2014 in this model), price effects are 90% for the construction sector, while supply effects are 10%. In
subsequent years, the price effects are expected to fall, while supply effects rise. It is assumed the price effect persists due to
inefficiencies described earlier.

                                                                      7
                                    Box A2: Output Assumptions Sheet
 A series of assumptions were used to assess the additional impact of the PIP on the macroeconomic
 accounts. These assumptions, were chosen on the basis of accuracy, simplicity and proportionality.
 The assumptions sheet uses data in the inputs and benefits sheet to the output sheets.

 A number of key assumptions were constructed to determine the:
      Allocation of public resources to resource groups
      Resource group’s domestic consumption, imports, investments, savings and tax revenues
      Firms’ supply and price response in relation to increased demand, which vary by sector
      Reallocation of GDP due to demand increase after program implementation has been
       finalized
      The allocation of real GDP (due to program benefits) to the components of GDP
         (see table below.)




Estimating the internal rate of return
The internal rate of return (IRR) for the program can be estimated for:
     The financial internal rate of return (FIRR);
     The economic internal rate of return (EIRR);
     The economy-wide internal rate of return (EWIRR); and,



                                                    8
The FIRR provides us with the IRR for the government, as it calculates the public costs of the project
minus the revenues it will generate. To obtain the FIRR project financing is split into loans and grants:
  ∗d     ∗d
Gt   = Gt   (χ1t + χ2t )
where χ1t and χ2t represent the relative share of project spending financed by loans and grants,
                                                                                                ∗d
respectively. Defining the total loans required for the investment project as lt = Gt              χ1t , and
         ∗d
GR t = Gt χ1t enables us to calculate the program’s FIRR as:
            lt (rt +at )+(RCt −Ut) −T∗
FIRR = ∑N
        t             (1+IRR)
                                     t




where, rt and at denote the interest rate and amortization costs of all project loans, while RCt
represents the project’s recurrent costs and Ut indicates user fees levied by the government to cover a
share of the project’s recurrent costs.

                                                                            ∗d
The EIRR is estimated by subtracting additional public investment spending Gt  and recurrent costs
RCt from the project-related increase in GDP determined above.
                   ∗       ∗
             −[    +RCt ]
EIRR = ∑N
        t          (1+IRR)
Similarly, the economy-wide IRR is estimated by deducting private investment costs PIt and additional
public investment and recurrent costs from the project-related increase in GDP. This indicator measures
of the impact of the program on the broader national economy.
                      ∗ −[  ∗ +PI +RC ]
               
EWIRR = ∑N

    the national systems and tools (RACHAD, TOFE) only track budget
    execution by institution or by economic categories, and by funding
    source. This could be complemented by introducing a project category
    as well. It is also important to ensure timely and complete information
    on the physical and operational progress of investment projects. The
    authorities could consider a database which tracks the entire cycle of
    each significant investment project

      development and disseminate these to budget units, along with training         (20 Million USD)
      on the use of these methodologies for personnel involved in investment
      project preparation. Second, align project preparation and screening
      with the budget process. Only include investment projects that have
      been screened and which satisfy minimum established criteria. Finally,
      evaluate operational and maintenance expenses and include these in
      MTEFs and in the national recurrent budget

     Given the shortcomings of Mauritania’s human resources in the health
     sector, it is critical to (i) recruit skilled health workers to ensure that
     primary health care facilities meet their nationally recommended
     staffing norms, and (ii) implement an effective incentive scheme to
     attract and retain essential health workers. The 2013 budget included
     measures such as the provision of extra pay and benefits for health
     workers taking a post in rural areas and the piloting of a results-based
     financing strategy. These are important steps towards providing
     incentives for health workers to improve motivation and retention.

     Steering Committee approved in September 2015 to put more emphasis
     on outcomes instead of inputs.

20   Strengthen budget management. Effective management of the budget            Budget neutral
     encourages better decision-making, the efficient use of resources and
     results in better health outcomes. This requires the strengthening of
     tools for budgeting, accounting and execution, improving management
     capacities of all departments, notably at the regional offices, and
     implementing a computerized management system that includes all
     resources (including external funds) and is connected to MF and
     treasury’s information system.

21   Review and explore different models of social accountability. Social        Budget neutral
     accountability interventions have proven to be critical to enabling
     meaningful participation of all citizens, proper accounting of health
     resources and addressing information asymmetries. It encompasses a
     range of practices (such as participatory public policy-making,
     participatory budgeting, public expenditure tracking, and citizen
     monitoring and evaluation of public services) that should be reviewed
     and explored for the Mauritanian context.

22   Strengthen decentralization of health functions to improve human            Budget neutral
     resource management. Many arguments have been made that
     decentralization of health care may bring benefits of (i) improved
     technical efficiency as local governments are more cost conscious and
     have more freedom in contracting with providers; (ii) better allocative
     efficiency through greater alignment of services to the needs of the
     different communities; (iii) improved equity as local authorities know
     communities better and can successfully target resources to the more
     vulnerable groups. While decentralization reforms in Mauritania
     constitute a slow process, efforts could focus on improving the
     management of health staff by making staff positions regional (to reduce
     the concentration of health workers in Nouakchott) and strengthening
     the local oversight of the regions to guide the promotion and
     sanctioning of health workers, and therefore encourage better
     performance.

23   Ensure that funding, distribution of responsibilities, and staffing         Budget neutral
     corresponds to core functions and sector priorities. With the recent
     creation of a separate Ministry of Agriculture, it would be important to
     review the Ministry’s 2015 budget in view of improved funding of core
     functions (such as R&D, extension services,.) in comparison of the
     Ministry’s administrative functions. Responsibilities and staffing should
     also be reviewed to ensure it supports the sector’s efficient operation
     (i.e. the supervision missions to be conducted by the responsible
     executing agency) and front line units.

     December 2015 that it was not willing to set a price for nor buy locally
     produced rice. This cold turkey strategy is much more effective than a
     gradual one, but may be more difficult to implement politically. A
     transition strategy carries some risk as it could allow those who are
     benefiting from the current situation (most of whom are in control of
     the current system) to prolong the transition or even block it altogether.

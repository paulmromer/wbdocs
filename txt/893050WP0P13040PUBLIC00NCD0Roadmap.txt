Body Mass Index (BMI)                 Body Mass Index. A measure of weight for height, calculated as
                                      a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
                                      persons height in metres: kg/m2. WHO define BMI equal to or
                                      greater than 25 as overweight, and BMI equal to or greater
                                      than 30 as obese. There is ongoing research about how
                                      appropriate these cut off points are in the Pacific.

Cost-effectiveness analysis; highly   Cost-effectiveness analysis compares the costs, and the health
cost-effective; cost-effective; and   effects, of alternative interventions to see which option
not cost-effective                    achieves the biggest impact for the same cost (or same impact
                                      for the lowest cost). The technique helps decide if an
                                      intervention gives value for money (‘maximum bang for the
                                      buck’) as distinct from simply being the lowest cost option.
                                      Many use the WHO convention that a highly cost-effective
                                      intervention globally delivers a result at less than GDP per
                                      capita; a cost-effective intervention between one and three
                                      times GDP per capita; and not cost-effective intervention at
                                      more than three times GDP per capita (WHO, 2013b)

DALY                                   Disability Adjusted Life Year. Instead of simply measuring the cost of
                                      death averted, a DALY seeks to take into account avoidance of death
                                      and sickness and disability. A DALY is therefore a notional,
                                      composite, measure combining mortality (death) and sickness /
                                      disability (morbidity). One DALY represents the loss of one healthy
                                      year of life.
Externalities                         Costs (including social costs) that are not fully captured in the

Fiscal Space                          Exists when a government has budgetary room to increase
                                      spending, and can do so without impairing fiscal solvency i.e.
                                      the government’s present and future ability to cover its

                                      efficiently’ (Economist, 2013). Sources of market failure
                                      include abuse of market power by monopolies; externalities
                                      (good or bad effects not captured by the price of a product or
                                      service); ‘public goods’ (things that the private sector has little
                                      or no incentive to produce at a socially desirable level) and
                                      information failures (asymmetric information or uncertainty)
NCDs                                  Non-Communicable Diseases, also known as chronic diseases

Executive Summary


                                 The key messages of this report

      NCDs are already causing a health crisis in the Pacific, with most of the trends and risk
       factors pointing to a substantial worsening of the situation.
      Several NCD related programs are already financially unsustainable.
       Overall NCD costs in the Pacific are expected to continue increasing, given the high level of
       risk factors for NCDs in the region and the lack of investments in primary and secondary
       prevention strategies to date. However effective implementation of the recommendations
       in this Roadmap is the most likely way of 'bending' the cost curve for NCD treatments
       downwards, putting countries on the path to more sustainable financing.
      Growing NCD burdens, combined with modest economic growth, will inevitably further
       squeeze Ministry of Health and national development budgets unless urgent action is taken
       now. Premature death and disability undermines national economic productivity.
      Fortunately, many NCDs are often preventable, or their health and financial burdens can at
       least be postponed.
      Proven, affordable, and cost-effective interventions are available. Some interventions are
       cost-saving, paying for themselves over the longer term
      Multiple factors inside – and beyond – the health sector are driving the rise in NCDs, so a
       multi-sectoral approach is essential.
      Given risk factors in the Pacific, and available ‘best buys’, each country should now finalise
       its own short Country-specific NCD Roadmap that would include the following four key
       strategies common to all countries in the Pacific :
            o Strengthened tobacco control (including raising the excise duty on tobacco products
                to at least 70% of their retail price));
            o Policies on reducing consumption of food and drink products directly linked to
                obesity, heart disease and diabetes in the Pacific, especially salt and sugary drinks.
            o Improved efficiency and impact from the existing health dollar by reallocating
                resources to targeted primary and secondary prevention of NCDs including scaling
                up of PEN and better drug prices;
            o Strengthening the evidence base for better investment planning and program
                effectiveness, including estimating productivity losses to the economy from
                premature NCD disability and death.
      Countries can then add other interventions to their own country NCD Roadmap that suit
       their own specific country needs and capacities. This report identifies a menu of over 30
       other actions suited to the Pacific from which to choose.
      A simple template is provided at Annex 10 that can serve as the basis for a country specific,
       but also region wide, NCD Roadmap.

Section 1:
Why an NCD ‘crisis’?

There are essentially three arguments why the Pacific is facing an NCD ‘crisis’: a health argument,
an economic argument; and a political argument.

The health argument is essentially that NCDs are already a major health challenge in the Pacific.
NCDs account for around 70% of all deaths in the Pacific, and in some cases up to 75% of all deaths.
Importantly, many of these NCD related deaths are premature (before age 60 years) and are
preventable. Indeed, most countries in the Pacific have rates of premature deaths much higher than
the rest of the world. Pacific Island countries have some of the highest rates of diabetes in the world.
NCDs not only cause premature deaths, they also impose a heavy burden of disability on individuals,
families, and workers including through strokes, diabetes related blindness and amputations, and
kidney disease. Importantly, the trends are pointing the wrong way: existing risks factors suggest
that NCDs will be an even greater health challenge for the Pacific in coming years unless urgent and
widespread action is taken now. Over half (52.45%) of adult males in Tonga are estimated to be
obese - the highest prevalence of obesity out of 188 countries worldwide – and four of the seven
countries in the world where adult female obesity is estimated to be 50% or more of the population
are in the Pacific: Kiribati, FSM, Tonga and Samoa (Ng et al., 2014). Three of the top ten countries in
the world for rates of adult smoking are in the Pacific: Kiribati, PNG and Tonga (Ng M et al., 2014).

The economic argument is essentially that NCDs impose large – but often preventable – costs on
already overstretched Government health budgets, and the economy more broadly. Countries can
expect a further rise in the costs of treating NCDs in the coming years given the pipeline of risk
factors in the Pacific, and the lack of investment in primary and secondary prevention to date. A
hypothetical, stylised, presentation of this possibility is shown in diagram one below. Overall NCD
costs in the Pacific are expected to continue increasing, given the high level of risk factors for NCDs
in the region and insufficient investments in primary and secondary prevention strategies to
date. However effective implementation of the recommendations in this Roadmap is the most likely
way of 'bending' the cost curve for NCD treatments downwards, putting countries on the path to
more sustainable financing. The rising costs of (preventable) NCD treatment extend beyond the
health sector, undermining national budgets and national investments. NCDs also impose large – but
again often preventable – economic costs on individuals and the economy more broadly through
death and disability of key skilled workers. Adverse social impacts occur when people – especially
girls – are withdrawn from education or the workforce to become carers for those with NCD
disabilities. Orphans and widows caused by premature NCD deaths are vulnerable to poverty and
exploitation.

The political argument is essentially that Pacific Islands Forum Leaders themselves have invested
political capital by explicitly declaring the “Pacific is in an NCD Crisis?. Health, Finance and Economic,
and Trade Ministers from the Pacific have made similar commitments. A business as usual approach,
combined with the existing high level of risk factors for NCDs, will inevitably lead to deteriorating
health and living standards in the Pacific under the watch of current leaders, thereby undermining
their political credibility and reputation. But political leaders who take substantial action now to
prevent and control the NCD crisis in the Pacific will make a substantial and recognised contribution
to social and economic growth in their countries.

Why the focus on cardiovascular disease and diabetes?


There is a particular focus in this report on cardiovascular disease (which leads to high blood
pressure, heart attacks and strokes) and type 2 diabetes. This is deliberate. In Tonga for example
60% of all male deaths and 58 % of all female deaths of all ages are attributed to cardiovascular
disease and diabetes. Cancers and chronic respiratory diseases – the other two main NCDs that
occur in the world – should, of course, continue to receive attention and resources where that is
technically feasible and affordable in the Pacific. Countries with limited resources and lower
incidence of cancer can also seek to identify opportunities to leverage off other existing programs:
antenatal care and public health advice about sexually transmitted infections provide a good
opportunity for identification and prevention of cervical cancer. Effective risk reduction through
tobacco control, reduce harmful use of alcohol, improved diet and physical activity contributes to
reduction of the incidence of all four main NCDs: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
respiratory diseases, and cancers.




Page | 8
Why the focus on risk reduction more than disease management?


There is a deliberate focus on reducing exposure of the population to modifiable risk factors of
major NCDs affecting the countries including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and
harmful use of alcohol. That is because it is almost always more costly to treat NCDs than to prevent
them arising in the first place, or progressing to more advanced stages. That is especially so in low
and middle income countries where economic resources (including money and skilled health
personnel) are scarce.

Why the focus on these four strategies?


Governments – and their citizens – want to know that scarce health resources are being directed
to a manageable set of achievable actions that will have the most impact on health outcomes and
will provide the best value for money. This report uses the international literature to identify four
key strategies – tobacco control; reducing consumption of unhealthy food and drink; improved
efficiency and impact; and improved evidence base for decision making – that will make the biggest
difference to reducing the health and economic burdens of NCDs in the Pacific. Importantly, these
four key strategies constitute “best buys? for all countries in the Pacific irrespective of their
population size, wealth, or political and economic systems. Implementing these four key strategies
will also contribute to a regional response to the region wide NCD crisis. As this report makes clear,
individual countries are then also encouraged to identify and implement additional interventions to
the four ‘region-wide’ strategies so as to address particular risk factors that affect their country, and
for which they have the resources to respond.

Why a multisectoral approach?


Multiple factors inside – and beyond – the health sector are driving the rise in NCDs, so a multi-
sectoral approach is essential. WHO estimates that two thirds of the effects in responding to NCDs
will come from reducing exposure to risk factors through multisectoral initiatives. Around one third
of the effect to better control NCDs will come from interventions to prevent and treat high risk
groups – for example sedentary, overweight, smokers with high blood pressure and insulin
resistance – particularly through interventions at the primary care level. Continued, and intensified,
leadership from the health sector in promoting population wide tobacco control and scaling up the
Package of Essential NCD interventions (PEN) for high-risk groups is therefore essential. But relying
on the health sector alone to reduce the NCD crisis is ineffectual. The social determinants of health
need to be addressed. And while pharmaceutical drugs and similar treatments have a vital role to
play in preventing and treating NCDs, ‘medicalising’ the NCD response through drugs alone when
changes in lifestyle would have been more effective is wasteful of scarce health resources. Ministers
from the Pacific have therefore formally committed themselves to adopting a multi-sectoral
approach to responding to NCDs. Stakeholder analysis identifies numerous areas where multi-
sectoral approaches are needed. Development partners also have an interest in supporting a



Page | 9
multisectoral approach through their investments in infrastructure and other sectors, and their trade
policies.

Why this report?


This report responds to the FEMM Ministers’ request in July 2013 for a ‘Roadmap’ to respond to
NCDs. This NCD Roadmap Report serves as a background resource document for officials to review
the latest evidence about the economic and financial implications of responding to the NCD crisis in
the Pacific. A short briefing note has been prepared for Ministers, and a slightly longer briefing note
prepared for officials. Specific recommended interventions are summarised in Annex 6 which is, in
effect, the operational Roadmap for action by all stakeholders from an economic and financial
perspective that can be adopted at the country level. Annex 8 provides details of the evidence base
used to identify strategic interventions by Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, including the
key issue of taxation policy. Annex 9 provides details of resource allocation and financing issues for
Ministries of Health. Annex 10 provides a template for the development of individual country
Roadmaps to prevent and control NCDs that could be considered at the joint meeting of Finance and
Health Ministers in July 2014.

This NCD Roadmap Report is intended to help ‘operationalise’ - in ways that are affordable and
cost-effective - the already agreed frameworks and strategies for responding to NCDs. There are
already agreed global, regional, and national frameworks and strategies for responding to NCDs. This
proposed Roadmap is not intended to duplicate or serve as an alternative to those existing
frameworks and strategies. Indeed, each of the recommended interventions directly support the
WHO supported nine voluntary global targets for prevention and control of NCDs by 2025 (details in
Box 3 in the next chapter) and the priorities Pacific countries have identified already. Rather, it
provides a financial and economic perspective of how to use existing – and hopefully additional –
resources in the most effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable ways to address the NCD crisis as
part of existing frameworks and strategies.

Section two: An economic and financial perspective to setting strategic
priorities for NCDs

Economics can provide insight into why and under what circumstances investing in NCD
prevention and control is a good use of scarce resources. There are compelling economic reasons
for countries to invest resources to reduce the impact of NCDs. In particular, economic analysis
shows that NCDs can impose large and rapid increases in costs to budgets, sometimes to an
unsustainable level. But NCDs also impose broader costs to the economy through lost productivity as
a result of premature deaths and disability such as stroke. Economic analysis is particularly useful in
identifying ‘best buys’ and selecting interventions that are likely to achieve value for money. Some
interventions – especially taxation measures - are even cost-saving to Governments over time,
because subsequent reductions in health expenditure are larger than the intervention costs.
Importantly, there are cost-effective and often affordable interventions for each of the major risk
factors for NCDs – Smoking (and other forms of tobacco use such as chewing tobacco), Nutrition,
Alcohol and Physical inactivity (‘SNAP’). It will be important to further analyse ‘best buys’ in the
Pacific given the particular NCD challenges in this region. One particularly cost-effective – but often

Page | 10
overlooked and under-funded - investment is implementation research and impact analysis. It is also
important that Pacific Island countries undertake, and update, their own cost-effectiveness and
other forms of economic analysis because the key variables will change. There are also important
limitations to the use of cost-effectiveness and other economic tools that need be noted.

Section three: actions by government agencies.


All Government Ministries have a role to play in addressing the multi-sectoral aspects of the NCD
crisis. Leaders have declared NCDs to be regional and national crisis: all arms of government
therefore have a role to play. The Prime Minister’s Office has a key role in providing leadership,
demonstrating political commitment, using their convening power to ensure coordination,
measuring overall progress, and explaining to the public the need for price increases through
taxation. A critically important factor is emphasising accountability for effective implementation.

Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning have a particularly strategic role to play by ensuring
that scarce resources from Government, development partners, and other stakeholders are
allocated to best use and can be sustained. Most Pacific Islands are caught in a pincer movement:
rapidly rising NCD related health costs but only modest prospects for overall economic growth and
revenue generation. Not everything will be affordable. Not everything represents value for money.
The focus must be on allocating scarce financial and human resources to preventing – or at least
postponing – the rising incidence of NCDs and their complications in ways that are affordable and
sustainable.

This roadmap is not a plea for extra resources: rather it is an argument for using existing resources
to better effect. There is a case for some – but not necessarily all – countries in the Pacific to
increase their public expenditure on health. But that is not the central message of this report. To the
contrary, the key message is that all countries can use their existing resources more effectively,
efficiently, equitably and sustainably. Each country’s own roadmap will enable them to identify
where existing resources can be used to best effect, drawing on the options identified in this report.

Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning also have the important role of setting tax policy to
discourage consumption of unhealthy products. Tobacco is a major policy area because it kills up to
two thirds of its users prematurely, and exacerbates the costs and consequences of all NCDs. Three
countries in the Pacific – Kiribati, PNG and Tonga – are amongst the top ten countries in the world
for prevalence of male tobacco smoking. Pacific Island countries should immediately take steps to
raise the excise duty on tobacco products to at least 70% of their retail price to raise revenue and
reduce consumption: the Cook Islands presents a good example of what to do. Other
complementary action should also be considered to achieve the already agreed aim of a Tobacco
Free Pacific by 2025. Compliance with existing tobacco regulation is generally weak, providing an
environment for uptake of tobacco amongst the young as well as loss of government revenue.
Alcohol is another policy area: The Cook Islands provides a useful example of how to use price to
capture some of the health and social costs of alcohol abuse. Taxes and subsidies on food products,
especially sugar-sweetened drinks is a key policy area: consumption of sugar is a major,
independent, explanatory factor in the rise of type 2 diabetes in low and middle income countries.
But political economy factors need to be understood and managed: the pain in raising taxes is now,


Page | 11
the public health gain is later. There are several practical lessons to draw on in designing taxes on
food and drinks that are spelt out in this report. Reducing salt intake is a cost-effective strategy to
reduce high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Transfats are now recognised as a significant
risk factor for NCDs and can be relatively easily removed / replaced in the food chain as a public
health measure.

Ministries of Health are also key agencies, with some key financing and resource allocation issues
common to the Pacific that still need to be addressed in the health sector as a whole, not just with
respect to NCDs. The themes common to most countries in the Pacific include the need for
improved efficiency; improved focus on prevention and front line services; strengthened public
financial management; investment in data analysis, and impact evaluation; and a preparedness to
take hard decisions, including avoiding high cost interventions with poor outcomes. There is also an
unfinished agenda of communicable diseases and maternal, newborn and child health to address.
Strengthening NCD prevention and control should become a means of health system strengthening
more broadly, rather than becoming another ‘vertical’ disease approach. Ministries of Health also
need to decide how best to implement – and fund – health promotion activities. This report notes
that there is a distinction between health promotion activities and health promotion foundations.
Whatever institutional arrangements are chosen – health promotion activities through the existing
primary health care system or via a dedicated health promotion foundation - it is important to assess
program effectiveness: changing lifestyle behaviour is difficult and resources can be wasted if not
used well.

Four key strategies are recommended for immediate adoption by all countries in the Pacific in
their own ‘NCD country Roadmap’. The four key strategies were selected because they directly
address the key drivers of the NCD epidemic in all countries of the Pacific; involve ‘best buys’ for
Governments; are technically, financially and administratively feasible in all countries of the Pacific;
complement and strengthen existing policies, commitments and systems. The four key strategies
applicable in all countries of the Pacific are:

       to urgently strengthen tobacco control, including by raising the excise duty on tobacco
        products to at least 70% of their retail price
       tax, and better regulate, food and drink products that are directly linked to obesity,
        diabetes, heart disease and other NCDs in the Pacific, and improve public understanding
        how food and drink can be drivers of NCDs;
       improve efficiency and impact of the existing health dollar by reallocating scarce health
        resources to targeted primary and secondary prevention of NCDs including through the PEN
        package of ‘best buys’;
       strengthen the evidence base for better investment planning and program effectiveness to
        ensure interventions work as intended and provide value for money.

There are other key priorities in the 30 or more other options identified. Each country can then
add other interventions to these four key priorities from a wide menu of identified options suited to
its own country circumstances. For example, some countries will need to include much stronger
measures for alcohol control in their own country specific roadmap, given the burden of alcohol
related NCDs. Other countries may not identify alcohol control as an urgent priority at this stage for
their country specific roadmap, but will wish instead to focus on reducing childhood and adolescent

Page | 12
obesity as that is the key challenge in their situation. Reducing pharmaceutical prices is urgent for
those countries paying up to ten times the price of essential drugs such as simvastatin, as shown
later in this report. Each country will be able to identify other priorities from the 30 or more options
identified in Annex 6. This would enable countries to develop a country specific NCD Roadmap, but
one that also entails a regional response (based on the four key strategies common to all countries
in the Pacific).

There are important roles for all other Government agencies too if a multi-sectoral approach is to
be effective. This report discusses the economic and financial rationale of various NCD related
interventions by each of the following agencies: Attorney-General, and (in alphabetical order)
Ministries of Agriculture; Communications; Customs and Excise; Education; Labour and Industry,
and the Public Service Commissions; Trade; Urban Planning and town councils; and Sport. Each
country’s National Statistics Offices, and their Police force, have important roles to play too. Annex
6 provides a summary of the economic reasoning and possible revenue implications of options for
each Ministry.

The strategies put forward in the Roadmap are achievable and affordable but will take
determination and leadership in the face of vested interests. The Roadmap identifies specific
actions that can be taken by all Ministries, including the Economic Ministries. The Roadmap
identifies possible cost and revenue implications, and potential ‘winners and losers’ of any
intervention. The Roadmap involves some financial and political costs. The public, and affected
industries, do not like taxes and price increases. Some of the benefits of intervention will only
emerge in the medium term while the costs appear sooner. Vested interests might seek to
undermine the actions taken in the public interest. They might promulgate certain myths (see Annex
12). But the health, social and economic costs of inaction are much higher than the costs of
intervention in the Pacific where there is an NCD crisis. Political leaders will need to demonstrate
leadership in managing the political economy challenges. The Pacific Islands are at a critical juncture
in responding to NCDs. Leaders who take decisive action now will create a substantial and lasting
legacy for their nations.


Pacific Leaders have declared an NCD “crisis?: effective implementation is therefore a key part of
a national and regional response. It is quite common for good policy to be developed, and laws
enacted, in developing and developed countries, only to find that actual implementation is
neglected or starved of resources and attention. But weak implementation has economic and
political costs. The economic costs are the ineffectual use and wasted time of leaders and managers
who had developed a policy that had not been implemented properly. Political credibility of leaders
is eroded when implementation is weak. All Pacific countries share some things in common when it
comes to implementation of NCD responses: this is an opportunity for regional sharing of
information and lesson-learning. On the other hand, differences in implementation capacity need to
be recognised. There are some useful generic resources available to help countries strengthen their
implementation efforts. There are also some useful lessons that arise from country-specific studies.
Section three elaborates.

Section Four: Development partners, the private sector, civil society and
regional approaches


Development partners can support – or sometimes hinder – the response to the NCD crisis. They
directly support – or can distort – efforts to reduce NCDs by the nature, timing and type of aid
financing to Ministries of Health. Development partners, like governments in the region, should
anticipate a rise in treatment costs of NCDs in the Pacific, given the high level of risk factors for NCDs
in the region, and insufficient investment in primary and secondary prevention strategies to date.

Development partners also indirectly support – or sometimes hinder – the response to the NCD
crisis by the way they design and implement their aid activities in other sectors as well, including
road transport, agriculture and education. Development partners can also help – or hinder – the
response to the NCD crisis by their own ‘whole of government’ approaches, including trade policy.
Development partners in the Pacific should consider having NCDs as a standing agenda item when
they meet together.

It is not in the interests of the private business sector to see workers (or consumers) going on sick
leave, become disabled, or die prematurely due to (otherwise preventable) NCDs. Establishing a
standing, high level, liaison between the Prime Minister’s office and the Chambers of Commerce is a
starting point to encourage two-way dialogue. Civil society especially Churches, media, and
Universities can play an important role. Regional agreements are important too, particularly for
generating regional public goods and sharing knowledge.

Section Five: Conclusion and next steps
Conclusion


Pacific Leaders have committed to responding to the NCD crisis. Forum Economic Ministers, Health
Ministers, and Trade Ministers have echoed the importance of responding within their mandates.
Global, regional, and national frameworks and strategies have already been identified and agreed.

Existing financial and other economic resources need to be used to maximum effect if commitments
and frameworks are to achieve the goals of reducing the impact of NCDs. Multiple causes beyond
the health sector are driving the NCD crisis: as a result a multi-sectoral approach is essential.
Ministries and stakeholders need a credible, economically and financially defensible, ‘actionable’
roadmap to know where, how and why to engage.

Four key strategies, tailored to the specific challenges of the Pacific, and adopted by all countries
would make a strategic difference: tobacco control; reducing consumption of unhealthy food and
drinks that drive obesity and diabetes in the Pacific; improved efficiency and impact of the existing
health dollar; and strengthening the evidence base for investment planning and results
management. This would be the core response that all countries in the Pacific would be encouraged
to commit to in their own country specific NCD roadmap. Because of their applicability and
feasibility to all countries in the Pacific, the four strategies – if adopted – would then also become a



Page | 14
coherent regional strategy. Each country can then also choose other interventions from a menu of
other options to suit their own country circumstances.

Next steps


Ministers may each wish to endorse a country-specific roadmap for their country where progress
can be mapped and monitored, with tangible evidence of progress then available when Healthy
Islandscelebrates its 20-year anniversary in 2015. A draft template for countries to quickly set out
their own country-specific roadmap is at Annex 10. It assumes each country in the Pacific will initiate
and track progress on the four strategic activities to control NCDs (tobacco control; reducing
consumption of unhealthy food and drinks that drive obesity and diabetes in the Pacific; improved
efficiency and impact of the existing health dollar; and strengthened evidence base for investment
planning and results management). It also assumes countries will also identify other interventions
they see as priorities from the menu of options identified in Annex 6. Ministers have already agreed
to have NCDs as a standing item on future agendas: reporting back on progress under Annex 10
would give all Ministers tangible evidence of systematic and prioritised progress when countries
evaluate the 20 years of Healthy Islands Healthy People in 2015.

            Section one: context and purpose of this roadmap

            Evidence of an NCD ‘crisis’

              There are essentially three arguments why the Pacific is facing an NCD ‘crisis’: a health argument,
              an economic argument; and a political argument. The health argument is essentially that NCDs are
              already a major health challenge in the Pacific (Lower T, 2005; Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat,
              2012; WHO, 2007, 2013f; World Bank, 2013a). They contribute around 70% of deaths (Annex 1) and
              are a major source of disability. The response to NCDs requires additional resources from
              Governments1 at the same that there remains an unfinished agenda of communicable (including
                                              malaria), maternal, newborn and other challenges for rapidly
                                              growing, and ageing, populations. Importantly, the Pacific region
                  Box 1.1                     now has higher rates of premature deaths2 than other countries of
                                              similar income levels, and indeed the world as a whole (Chart 1).

            and child care. Expenditure on NCDs can rise quickly and dominate public health expenditure. Latest
            reports show that health care expenditure on cardiovascular disease in Australia rose by nearly 50%
            to AUD $7,717 million in the 8 years to 2008/9, making it the largest single disease expenditure item.

The political argument why NCDs are a crisis is essentially that Pacific Islands Forum Leaders
themselves have invested political capital by explicitly declaring the “Pacific is in an NCD Crisis?
including as part of the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum communiqué of September 2011. Health,
Finance and Economic, and Trade Ministers from the Pacific have similarly confirmed there is an NCD
crisis and the importance they attach to urgently addressing NCDs. Pacific Island governments have
signed up to the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020
including its headline goal of achieving a relative reduction of 25 per cent in the overall mortality
from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases by 2025 (WHO,
2013d). Most countries also have country - specific NCD strategies. Tonga has included NCD targets
into its own Millennium Development Goals framework. The risk factors for NCDs, and the increased
prevalence of NCDs, will not fix themselves automatically. Political action is needed at the global,
regional and country level (Bonita et al., 2013). Further details substantiating the health, economic
and political arguments are in Annex 2.

Responding to a crisis: the need for a multisectoral approach
Multiple factors inside – and beyond – the health sector are driving the rise in NCDs, so a multi-
sectoral approach is essential. Some of the determinants of NCDs cannot be changed or modified:
age, gender and genetics. But much of the rapid rise in NCDs globally, and in the Pacific, in recent
decades is the direct result of lifestyle choices and social factors that can be modified. These ‘social
determinants of health’ include critical choices made by individuals: Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol and
Physical inactivity (‘SNAP’) (Beaglehole R et al, 2011; Marmot, 2005; UNDP, 2013). Town planning -
including lack of sidewalks, bicycle paths, parks, and the location of fast food shops – can create an
‘obesogenic environment’ that makes it easier for societies to adopt unhealthy lifestyles. Some
argue that it is the interaction between genetic factors in the Pacific (a ‘thrifty gene’ that stores fat)
and the broader social environment (cheap but unhealthy food and a more sedentary lifestyle) that
explains the particularly high rates of obesity, overweight and diabetes in the Pacific (Joffe &
Zimmet, 1998). Others note that early explorers to the Pacific particularly remarked on the lean and
healthy physiques of people, and that obesity and diabetes are now only very recent phenomenon
(Coyne T, 2000). This, in turn, suggests there is nothing natural, automatic, or inevitable about
obesity and associated NCDs in the Pacific.

            The health sector has a key role to play, but so too do other sectors. WHO estimates that two
            thirds of the effects in responding to NCDs will come from reducing exposure to risk factors through
            multisectoral initiatives (Bettcher D, 2012). Key issues include reducing tobacco use, unhealthy
            eating, and facilitating more physical activity. Several ministries – including Ministries of Health, will
            need to be involved in these activities. WHO also estimate that around one third of the effect to
            better control NCDs will come from interventions to prevent and treat high risk groups – for example
            sedentary, overweight, smokers with high blood pressure and insulin resistance – particularly
            through interventions at the primary care level. Continued, and intensified, leadership from the
            health sector in promoting population wide tobacco control and scaling up the Package of Essential
            NCD interventions (PEN) for high-risk groups is therefore essential.

             Relying just on the health sector to reduce the NCD crisis is therefore not enough. Some
                                          interventions such as immunisation against communicable diseases,
                                          and surgery, can achieve desired outcomes solely through the
                  Box 1.3                 health sector. But many other health challenges involve factors
                                          beyond the health sector: availability of water and sanitation, the
     Voluntary Global Targets for the
                                          level and quality of girls’ education, policing of traffic violations and
  prevention and control of NCDs to be
achieved by 2025 under the WHO Global     domestic violence etc. This is particularly true of NCDs where

                                            multi-sectoral approaches are needed. Ministers of Health have
                                            publicly committed to a multi-sectoral approach4 in the recent
                                            Honiara Communique (Honiara Communique, 2011). Stakeholder

            country in areas such as pricing and marketing of healthy versus unhealthy foods, agriculture,
            fisheries, trade and education (Snowdon, Lawrence, Schultz, Vivili, & Swinburn, 2010). Globally,
            member states of the WHO, including those in the Pacific, are supporting nine voluntary global NCD
            targets to be achieved by 2025: four of which are outside the health sector (Box 1.3). Globally,
            Article 39 of the recent UNGA Political Declaration on NCDs states that ‘the incidence and impacts of

            implementation of evidence-based initiatives to reduce the common modifiable NCD risk factors across the
            life-course, and address the social determinants of health, including leveraging the power of local government
            and civil society, with a focus on interventions across the life-course?

non-communicable diseases can be largely prevented or reduced with an approach that
incorporates evidence-based, affordable, cost-effective, population-wide and multisectoral
interventions’ (United Nations General Assembly, 2011).

Development partners also have an interest in supporting – and contributing to – NCD prevention
and control. Several bilateral and multilateral development partners have supported investments in
the health sector in the Pacific and join the countries in the region in not wanting to see those gains
reversed by the rise of (often preventable) NCDs. Development partners are now starting to increase
their support to NCD prevention and control, after earlier providing much larger funding for HIV
AIDS programs where disease burdens were lower (Negin J & Robinson H, 2010). Increased support
for NCD prevention and control by development partners, such as the recent 30-week NCD training
course for Tongan nurses, is welcome. But governments and their development partners also need
to integrate their efforts into broader health system delivery, and avoid treating NCDs as another
‘vertical’ disease.

Bilateral and multilateral development partners can also influence NCD incidence through the
nature of their investments in other sectors. How development partners design and fund activities
in other sectors can improve – or worsen – the ‘obesogenic environment. Examples include roads
(with or without pavements and bicycle paths); buildings (elevators rather than stairs made the
prominent default option); schools (with insufficient play areas); and agriculture (alternatives to
tobacco production). Development partners also have direct interests in the overall macroeconomic
stability of the Pacific and the prospects for long-term sustainable growth. No-one, including
development partners, wants to see the health (and then the national) budgets of small states
overwhelmed by (otherwise preventable) NCD costs, and the country becoming aid-dependent.

Substantial progress is possible. For example, latest STEPS data shows remarkable progress in
reducing some (but unfortunately not all5) risk factors in Samoa. More specifically, the percentage of
adults who smoke tobacco daily fell from over one third (34.9%) in 2002 to just less than a quarter
(24.4%) in 2013. The percentage of those adults with low physical activity fell from almost a half
(48.8%) to less than one fifth (19.9%) over the same period. (Globally, a recent study (Kontis et al.,
2014)found that addressing just six risk factors would get very close to achieving a 25% reduction in
NCD premature mortality between 2010 and 2025 (the ’25 x 25 target’). Those six risk factors are
tobacco and alcohol use; salt intake; obesity; and raised blood pressure and glucose. The study
found that if the targets for addressing these risk factors were achieved, the probability of a man
aged between 30 and 70 years dying from the four main NCDs (cardiovascular disease, chronic
respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes) would decrease by 22% compared to a business as usual
scenario. For women, the decrease would be 19%. Importantly, in terms of setting priorities, the
largest benefits globally come from reducing blood pressure and tobacco control. Indeed, achieving
a 50% reduction in tobacco use is judged to be the quickest and most likely route to closing in on the
25 x 25 target (Kontis et al., 2014).

  The same STEPS survey also found a 27 percentage point increased prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose
from just over one fifth of the population (22.3%) to almost a half (49.7%) over the period 2002 to 2013 and an
average 1.5 kg / m2 in BMI.

This report responds to the request by the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) for a
‘Roadmap’ to respond to NCDs. Forum Leaders declared NCDs to be a ‘crisis’ (Annex 3). The FEMM
held in Tonga in July 2013 requested SPC to facilitate the development of a ‘roadmap’ for NCD
prevention and control in the region (Forum Economic Ministers Meeting, 2013). In addition,
Ministers directed that the Forum Secretariat and Secretariat of the Pacific Community explore
options for a joint meeting of Economic and Health Ministers to promote greater collaboration to
tackle the epidemic rate of NCDs in the region’. FEMM also agreed that a standing item on NCDs be
included in their annual meeting agenda. The key extracts from the FEMM communique are at
Annex 4.

This proposed Roadmap is intended to help ‘operationalise’ the already agreed frameworks and
strategies for responding to NCDs in ways that are affordable and cost-effective There are already
agreed global (WHO, 2013e, 2013g), regional (WHO, 2013f), and national frameworks and strategies
for responding to NCDs. This proposed Roadmap is certainly not intended to duplicate or offer an
alternative to those existing frameworks and strategies. On the contrary, this proposed Roadmap is
intended to help ‘operationalise’ these existing frameworks and strategies in ways that are
affordable, cost-effective, and financially sustainable from an economic and financial perspective in
the context of the Pacific. Countries – especially in the Pacific where financial and human resources
are already stretched – ‘want fewer proposals and more action’ (Beaglehole, 2014).

This report therefore provides an evidence base on what is currently known about NCD prevention
and control and then identifies four high impact, feasible, strategies to prevent and control NCDs
recommended for all countries in the Pacific which are consistent with existing agreements. This
report can be a resource for officials and other stakeholders wishing to get an up to date snapshot of
current research about NCD prevention and control, particularly as it might apply to the Pacific.
Based on that latest evidence, four core strategies are identified that are necessary and achievable
to implement in all countries of the Pacific. Those four key strategies are: strengthen tobacco
control; tax products that are linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other NCDs; improve
efficiency and impact of the existing health dollar by reallocating scarce health resources to targeted
primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes; and strengthen the
evidence base for better decision making. Those four interventions have been selected because they
most directly and strategically address the key constraints in reducing the NCD crisis and are feasible
to implement in all countries of the Pacific. Beyond those four key interventions the Roadmap then
offers a menu of over 30 other interventions that various Ministries could consider depending upon
their own country’s challenges and capacities. That recommended menu of additional measures is
inevitably quite generic as it addresses the needs of differing countries in the Pacific, but is a
resource that countries can draw on to develop their own country-specific roadmap. Individual
governments are best placed to decide the time lines, and sequencing, of interventions.

The key is country led actions via their own country NCD Roadmap, but there is scope for regional
collaborative action too. The NCD crisis in the Pacific requires a national level whole of government
response to meet national and global commitments (Bonita et al., 2013). But there are also
opportunities for regional collaboration and sharing of lessons. Despite their many differences, most
countries in the Pacific face common challenges: similar increases in NCDs, particularly
cardiovascular disease and diabetes; similar risk factors, including tobacco use, and overweight; and
similar economic and financial resource constraints. A good starting point for more collaborative

action and achieving economies of scale would be for Pacific Island countries to agree on more
systematic sharing of information and experiences. Early priorities for information sharing might
include experiences with tobacco control, effective health promotion activities, and the costs of
expanding PEN. An existing regional institution might be able to take on this role of being a clearing
house of relevant experiences.

The immediate audience for a report of this detail and length are Government officials and other
stakeholders requiring evidence of policy options. A 2 page briefing note is available to Ministers
and an 8 page briefing note is also available to officials. A suggested menu of over 30 possible
recommended options for countries to consider including in their own Country NCD Roadmap are
summarised in Annex 6. Annex 8 provides details of the evidence base used to identify these
options with respect to the large and substantive issue of taxation policy. Annex 10 provides the
outline of a country – specific NCD roadmap that each country in the Pacific could complete prior to
the Forum Economic Finance Ministers Meeting in early July 2014, and then agree to.

 This proposed Roadmap incorporates views of many stakeholders. SPC was responsible for overall
management of this report. The World Bank6 was asked to provide initial drafts, bearing in mind the
economic and financial implications of NCDs, and the role of the World Bank in engaging with
Ministers of Finance but also other multi-sectoral agencies including Ministries of Agriculture,
Education, Health, Transport etc. The report draws on insights and contributions made by the 20
Pacific Island countries and several partner organisations at the Fifth Pacific NCD Forum held in
Auckland 23-26 September; the meeting of Quintilateral partners in New Caledonia 2-3 December
2013; the SPC Scientific and Technical Expert Group 9 December 2013; the Nossal Institute for Global
Health; the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; NZAID; and a meeting convened by
the World Bank in Sydney on 11 February where economists and public health experts from a range
of institutions participated. Drafts were shared with key officials of the Pacific Islands during March
and April 2014 and their reviews reflected in further revisions to the report. Directors of Health from
the Pacific endorsed the broad directions of the Roadmap during their meeting in Nadi, Fiji, 28-29
April 2014. A formal World Bank peer review meeting in June 2014 also provided comments and
insights that were reflected in this final version of the Roadmap report.

              There are compelling economic reasons in principle for countries to invest resources to reduce the
              impact of NCDs. Improved health is a sufficient reason itself for preventing and treating NCDs, but
                                            economics also provides compelling supporting arguments. The
                                            international literature is clear: NCDs impose large direct and

etc: investing in prevention was clearly economic (APMA, 2014). Another study found that a range of
community based physical activity interventions in the United States generated cost-effectiveness
ratios between $14,000 and $69,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) 9 gained compared to no
intervention (Roux L, Pratt M, Tengs T, & al., 2008). All interventions in this study appeared to
reduce disease incidence10. The interventions were judged to be generally worthwhile from an
economic perspective given that the annual cost directly attributable to inactivity in the United
States was an estimated $24 billion–$76 billion, or 2.4%–5.0% of national healthcare expenditures.
The analysis also noted that ‘interestingly, even the most complex and expensive intervention (the
physical activity component of the diabetes prevention program) proved to be cost-effective,
suggesting that targeting high-risk populations with intensive interventions can be a good use of
public health funds’.

Some interventions are even cost-saving to governments: the cost of interventions being less than
the subsequent reductions in health expenditure from successful programs. One major study found
that taxation measures on unhealthy products ‘are consistently cost saving in all the low and middle
income settings considered, and generate the largest or second largest health effects’ (Cecchini et
al., 2010). This is in contrast to OECD countries where higher costs of interventions make
interventions cost-effective, but not necessarily cost saving. Food labelling was also found to be cost-
saving, but with smaller health effects than taxation and other fiscal measures. The availability,
accessibility, and quality of the overall health system is also a key determinant of cost-effectiveness.
Cecchini and colleagues found that ‘physician counselling of individuals at risk in primary care is one
of the most effective interventions, but its health effect is greatest and cost-effectiveness best in
countries where a larger proportion of the population has regular access to primary care physicians
and facilities’ (Cecchini et al., 2010). Narayan and colleagues (Narayan et al., 2006) found that three
interventions for preventing and treating diabetes - moderate glycemic control, blood pressure
control, and foot care - were cost saving, and feasible11 , in all developing country regions of the
world.

Several interventions can be cost – effective compared to alternatives. Narayan et al found that
some interventions for diabetes were often cost-effective in terms of cost per Quality Adjusted Life
Year compared to alternatives, but not necessarily cost-saving. For example, lifestyle interventions
to prevent type 2 diabetes was estimated to cost $ 80 per QALY gained in the East Asia and Pacific
region in 2002. On the other hand, screening for undiagnosed diabetes was not particularly cost
effective in most regions, ranging from $3870 to $8550 per QALY gained in 2002 dollars depending
upon the region. (This may not necessarily be the case in the Pacific where prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes may be higher).

Importantly, there are cost-effective and often affordable interventions for each of the major risk
factors for NCDs – Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol and Physical inactivity (‘SNAP’) – identified by public

9
  A Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY ) is most simply defined as a ‘health outcome measurement unit that
combines duration and quality of life’ (Sassi, 2006)
10
   The report notes that ‘all interventions appeared to reduce disease incidence: reductions ranged from 5–15
cases per 100,000 for colorectal cancer, to 15–58 cases per 100,000 for breast cancer, to 59–207 cases per
100,000 for type 2 diabetes, and to as many as 140–476 cases per 100,000 for Chronic Heart Disease.

  ‘Feasibility’ was judged on the basis of 4 criteria: difficulty of reaching the intended population; technical
complexity; capital intensity and cultural acceptability.

health experts (Beaglehole R et al, 2011) that are now part of key response strategies and
frameworks. Some interventions – such as encouraging increased walking – may have negligible cost
to government but noticeable improvements in reduction of NCDs for patients at risk. For example,
a recent peer reviewed study found that, at the baseline study, every 2000 extra steps per day
(roughly equivalent to 20 min a day of moderately-paced walking) amongst people with impaired
glucose tolerance was associated with a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular event (eg stroke). Each
2000 step increase or decrease in daily walking from the baseline results of the study to 12 months
was associated with an additional 8% lower or higher cardiovascular event rate, respectively (T.
Yates et al., 2014).

 WHO has identified a series of ‘best buys’ from an economic perspective that align with the four
major risk factors for NCDs at a global level12. The details are in Annex 5 but the key points
summarised in Table 2.1 below. It can be seen that several interventions are judged to be both ‘very
cost-effective’ as well as being simultaneously ‘very low cost’ at a global level. Other interventions
are judged ‘quite cost-effective’ and simultaneously ‘quite low cost’. Still others are judged to be
‘less cost-effective’ and have a higher cost.

Although more needs to be done to assess the cost, and effectiveness, data, preliminary analysis
also suggests there are some very cost effective ‘best buy’ interventions available in the context of
the Pacific Islands too. These are summarised in Table 2.2 below.

It will be important to further analyse ‘best buys’ in the Pacific given the particular NCD challenges
in this region. The abovementioned identification of ‘best buys’ to date for the Pacific is very useful.
But questions still remain where economic analysis could generate important insights. Would the
global finding that promotion of healthy eating and physical activity in schools is ‘less cost effective’
still be true in the Pacific, given the high levels of obesity and overweight school age youth? Is ‘public
awareness through mass media on diet and physical activity’ really a highly cost-effective
intervention in the Pacific when other studies suggest general public health campaigns may have
only ‘trivial’ impacts on lifestyle choices (Cobiac L et al., 2012; Szmedra P, Sharma K, & C., 2009)? To
what extent will the reportedly low compliance levels for taking medication in the Pacific undermine
cost-effectiveness? Is the quality, as distinct from the coverage levels, of scaled up NCD related
interventions likely to achieve cost-effectiveness? While strengthened alcohol control is clearly

Page | 28
important in some countries in the Pacific to reduce risk factors for NCDs (and domestic violence) is
that true for all countries, given different cultural norms? How can NCD prevention strategies be
integrated into and leverage off existing programs: for example using antenatal services and public
health advice about sexually transmitted infections to identify and reduce cervical cancer? And
conversely, should countries have a public discussion about the likelihood that some interventions –
heart transplants and possibly even dialysis – are simply unaffordable for some countries at this
stage in their development?

One particularly cost-effective – but often overlooked and under-funded - investment is
implementation research and impact analysis. Resources are scarce in the Pacific. They cannot be
wasted on well-intentioned but low impact interventions based on intuition, ideology, or inertia.
Investing in applied field research, genuine evaluation, impact analysis and result-management is a
cost-effective and potentially cost-saving investment. There are now several good resources on how
to undertake impact evaluation at reasonable cost that can then improve the evidence base for
subsequent policy making and resource allocation (Bamberger M, Rugh J, & Mabry L, 2012; Duflo E,
2004, 2006; Duflo E & Kremer M, 2003; List J, 2011; World Bank, 2011b).

It is also important that Pacific Island countries undertake, and update, their own cost-
effectiveness and other forms of economic analysis because the key variables will change. Cost-
effectiveness of interventions will vary between and within countries of the Pacific, and over time.
Costs will change up and down with changes in exchange rates and inflation. Effectiveness of
interventions will change with change in response to technological changes, and disease resistance.
The key NCD burdens will change with population ageing, changes in risk factors, and improved
disease surveillance and detection. The capacity to fund interventions in a sustainable manner
(‘fiscal space’) will change in the light of economic growth and other factors. As a result, what is a
cost-effective and value for money intervention now may not be so in five years. Countries will
therefore need to keep cost-effectiveness and other economic assessments under review. But
undertaking cost-effectiveness and other economic analysis will itself use up finances and economic
resources. Even economic analysis needs to be prioritised, achieve value for money, and be
affordable.

There are also important limitations to the use of cost-effectiveness and other economic tools that
need be noted (Jamison D et al, 2006; WHO, 2003b). It is often very difficult, or expensive, to get
reliable data on either, or both, of the key arms of cost-effectiveness: actual costs 13 and / or actual
effectiveness of interventions. Even if data is available, cost-effectiveness analysis normally says
nothing about whether governments should then intervene: individual households and the private
sector might be better placed to respond. And even if government financing was justified, due to the
existence of market failures14, cost-effective interventions may simply not be affordable given
constraints on government budgets. Issues of inequity also need to be explicitly considered. Some
cost effective interventions may increase inequity: for example, where there are low unit costs to
treat large numbers in urban areas compared to more remote rural areas. In other cases, cost
effective interventions may reduce inequity: for example where there are increased unit costs to

reach outer islands and remote communities, but those groups have higher burdens of disease than
others.

It will also be important for governments, and their development partners, to scale up NCD
prevention and control in ways that strengthen the health system more broadly. The rise in NCDs
places new and additional strains on health systems, some of which are still struggling to fully
respond to communicable diseases and maternal health challenges around which they were
originally designed (Robinson H & Hort K, 2012). In PNG, for example, communicable, maternal,
perinatal and nutritional conditions still constituted almost half (47%) of all deaths of all ages, with
NCDs constituting 44% of all deaths and injuries 9% (WHO, 2011). Recent analysis identified several
health system challenges as Fiji scales up its response to NCDs. These challenges included the need
for strengthened human resource planning (at the time there were only two staff dedicated to NCD
in the Ministry of Health); reducing inequity in access and outcomes; strengthening the links
between attendance at the national diabetes centre and glycaemic control; and strengthened
strategic planning and coordination with civil society and the private sector dealing with NCDs
(Snowdon W, Waqa G, Raj A, Kanungo A, & H., 2013).

Linking NCD interventions to maternal care in primary health care settings is one way of
strengthening the health system more broadly and avoiding a ‘vertical’ disease approach. There
are increasingly clear links between maternal nutrition and health, including smoking and alcohol
use when pregnant, and the increased risk of obesity and NCDs amongst children and young adults
(Barker D, 1990; Black et al., 2013; Gillman, Rifas-Shiman, Berkey, Field, & Colditz, 2003; Jaddoe W et
al., 2014; Victora et al., 2008; R. C. Whitaker & Dietz, 1998). Investing in maternal nutrition and
health is a sound investment in its own right. Linking and leveraging NCD interventions to maternal
health, especially in regular primary care settings, is one way of maximising the health impact of
government resources, and strengthening the health system more broadly. Good advice and support
for women about smoking cessation, diet and exercise, breastfeeding, and testing for pre-diabetes
and hypertension contributes to maternal health and NCD prevention simultaneously. Reproductive
health services also offer the opportunity to identify, prevent and treat cervical cancer.

Section three: actions by Government agencies.
All Government Ministries have a role to play in addressing the multi-sectoral aspects of the NCD
crisis. Leaders have declared NCDs to be regional and national crisis (Annex 3). All arms of
government therefore have a role to play or the Leaders’ statement is simply rhetoric. This section
of the report highlights options that make best use of existing government resources to
operationalise national and regional strategies. Discussion starts with the role of the Prime
Minister’s office as without national leadership and coordination all other Government efforts will
be fragmented and lose coherence. Discussion then highlights the substantial roles to be played by
Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, and the Ministries of Health. Discussion then identifies
how other agencies, listed in alphabetical order, can best use their existing resources to address
NCDs at low cost but with potentially high and sustained impact. Annex 6 summarises the overall
situation, including the possible additional cost and revenue implications, and technical and political
feasibility of specific individual options. Annex 6 is therefore, in effect, ‘the roadmap’ for
Governments to consider.

The importance of implementation


If Pacific Leaders have declared an NCD “crisis? then implementation is a key part of a national and
regional response. It is quite common for good policy to be developed, and laws enacted, in
developing and developed countries, only to find that actual implementation is neglected or starved
of resources and attention (Thomas J & Grindle M, 1990). Many factors contribute to weak
implementation: inadequate financing and resourcing; weak or ambiguous lines of accountability;
weak monitoring and evaluation; perceptions that leaders and managers are no longer interested in
the issue; and opposition to change by vested interests.

But weak implementation has economic and political costs. The economic costs are the ineffectual
use and wasted time of leaders and managers who had developed a policy that had not been
implemented properly. This imposes a particularly high cost in the Pacific when the time, energy,
and political / bureaucratic capital of skilled leaders and managers is a precious resource that should
not be wasted. The political cost is the erosion of credibility and authority of leaders and managers
as people see another ‘crisis’ or commitment declared with little tangible follow up.

All Pacific countries share some things in common when it comes to implementation of NCD
responses: this is an opportunity for regional sharing of information and lesson-learning. Virtually
all countries are scaling up the Package of Essential NCD interventions (PEN) at the same time. What
are the clinical, management, budgeting and financing successes and failures of implementing this
scale up that can be shared? All countries in the Pacific want to expand and strengthen NCD
preventive care and broader health promotion in primary care settings so as to relieve pressure on
hospitals: what are the lessons of implementing such approaches? Many countries in the Pacific
recognise the importance of tobacco control in reducing NCD burdens, but would benefit from
sharing experiences about implementing tobacco control to domestic, smallholder, loose-leaf
tobacco.

On the other hand, differences in implementation capacity need to be recognised. The response to
HIV AIDS in the Pacific shows that individual countries in the Pacific have very different staffing

Page | 31
resources and capacities. A one size fits all approach cannot be applied when some countries have
just one or two public health officials available to work on NCDs, while others have potentially more
staff available. Individual countries are in the best position to know what to prioritise in terms of
implementation; how to budget and resource implementation; and how to hold agencies and
individuals responsible and accountable for results. Having said that, it is also important for each
country to be explicit and clear about which agency is actually responsible for implementation of a
specific policy. The illustrative example of a country-specific NCD Roadmap therefore includes a
column at the right hand edge of the template where countries can specify which agency is
responsible for implementing a particular policy.

There are some useful generic resources available to help countries strengthen their
implementation efforts. For example, the latest WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic focuses
on implementation of tobacco control particularly with respect to enforcing bans and advertising
controls (WHO, 2013h). That report notes that “governments globally collect nearly $ 145 billion in
tobacco excise tax revenues each year, but spend less than $ 1 billion combined on tobacco control –
96% of this is spent by high-income countries?. WHO estimates that, globally, developing countries
invest just $ 0.0003 per capita on tobacco control. The latest WHO report also notes that countries
need to take comprehensive action in terms of restricting tobacco advertising, promotion and
sponsorship: experience suggests tobacco companies will often respond to effective advertising
control measures by shifting their advertising budgets across to sports or school sponsorships,
defeating the purpose of control (WHO, 2013h).

Since December 2012 WHO has also made available an online version of its Tobacco Tax Simulation
(TaXSiM) model (http://www.who.int/tobacco/economics/taxsim/ en/index.html). TaXSiM is a
practical way of improving implementation of a key NCD response strategy because it is “an
innovative tool that can be used to describe the current market and tax situation for cigarettes
particular country or tax jurisdiction, and then to forecast the impact of tax changes on final
consumer prices, cigarette consumption and government tax revenues. A particular strength of the
model is that it examines outcomes on a brand-wise basis, which highlights how different tax
policies can affect different segments of the tobacco market? (WHO, 2013h).

There are also some useful lessons that arise from country-specific studies. Thow and colleagues
examined trade and food policy in three Pacific Island countries - Fiji, Samoa and Tonga – and drew
out insights and lessons from those countries’ experience in seeking to control and reduce imports
of turkey tails and lamb flaps (Thow AM, Swinburn B, et al., 2010). The case studies note the
importance of political leadership; of generating widespread public understanding of the need for
control measures; and the convergence of policy goals (perceptions of ‘dumping’ of low quality food
not sold for human consumption in exporting markets complemented health policy goals). The case
studies also highlight specific objections that can arise as governments seek to implement policy. For
example, the report notes that in the case of Samoa “Overall, the Chamber of Commerce supported
the aim of ban (improving health), but disagreed with notion of prohibiting the import of legal
products. The question of availability of affordable healthy alternatives was a key concern of critics
of the ban, as turkey tails were considered to be the cheapest cut of ‘meat’ available?. The report
also draws some general conclusions from the three countries about how to successfully implement
policies:



Page | 32
           “Policy uptake was also enabled by the use of existing legislation, consideration of other
           government commitments (e.g. WTO) and establishing a clear justification for food targeted.
           In contrast, barriers to policy success included a limited policy scope, low engagement from
           other sectors, selection of an inappropriate legislative tool, ……Barriers to policy success
           included a focus only on health concerns (not taking into account policy issues of other
           sectors), limited engagement from other sectors in proposing and developing these cross-
           sectoral policies, and lack of a clear enforcement mechanism? (Thow AM, Swinburn B, et al.,
           2010).

Tonga announced in mid-2013 a range of fiscal and other policy measures designed to reduce risk
factors associated with NCDs. This quite comprehensive package of measures included:

          The tobacco concession for inbound travellers is reduced from 500 cigarettes to 250
           cigarettes
          Duty for fresh fish has been reduced from 20% to 5%.
          Duty on vegetable oil has been reduced from 20% to 10%.
          Duty on tinned fish has been reduced from 20% to 5%.
          Excise tax of TOP $1 per kg is imposed on lard.
          Excise tax of TOP $.50 per litre is imposed on carbonated drinks.
          Excise tax on tobacco is increased from TOP $210 per 1000 cigarettes or per kg to TOP $250
           (imported) – and TOP $200 to TOP $238 for locally manufactured tobacco/cigarettes.

Further fiscal and policy measures are under consideration in Tonga. It would be very useful for
policy makers in Tonga, and indeed in the rest of the Pacific region, to collect baseline data and track
trends in consumption and government revenue as taxes and duties change. That would help
establish a good evidence base to assess if policies are having the desired effect in terms of
consumption of unhealthy products, or if consumers are switching to lower priced, but possibly even
more unhealthy, products.

Against that background of what some countries have done already, the following section canvasses
options for Governments to consider.



Prime Minister’s Office


The political credibility of leaders can be enhanced or diminished by the actions taken – or not
taken to respond to NCDs. Forum Leaders have themselves explicitly defined the NCD situation as a
‘crisis’ in the Pacific, threatening social, health, and economic achievements (Forum Communique,
2011). Their own political credibility therefore rests on the actions they take, and are seen to be
taking. The Prime Minister and his15 office possess the leadership to display a sense of urgency about
NCDs; have the convening power to bring together public and private sector stakeholders; and have
the authority to make decisions and remove policy obstacles. While each country in the Pacific is
best placed to decide how to use the prestige and authority of the Prime Minister and his office, a

15
     There are currently no female Prime Ministers in the Pacific Islands.

Page | 33
minimum requirement would be for the Prime Minister to establish, and then actively chair, a
regular meeting of a multi-sectoral task force to supervise progress in addressing NCDs.

The Prime Minister and his office is also important in terms of explaining the need for certain tax
increases. Nobody welcomes increased taxes. This is especially important in the democratic Pacific
where governments can change if they lose the support of the general public. Yet increasing taxes on
certain harmful products, especially tobacco and sugar-sweetened drinks, is essential in the context
of the Pacific where NCD rates are so high. The Prime Minister and his office can provide the
leadership and public explanation as to why raising taxes on certain harmful products is necessary
and in their society’s best interests.

Perhaps most importantly, the Prime Minister’s office can hold Government agencies and other
stakeholders accountable for properly implementing their stated commitments. That is critical,
because weaknesses in implementation and accountability are often the Achilles heel of otherwise
good strategies and policies, resulting in waste of scarce resources, political cynicism, and loss of
public support.

Ministries of Finance and Economic Policy


Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning have a particularly important role to play, especially
with respect to taxation policy. While increasing taxation carries with it its own economic costs,
there are good public policy reasons why increasing taxation on targeted items is justified in the
Pacific. Annex 7 provides details.

The following summarises what, where and why Ministries of Finance can do within their mandates
to respond to the NCD crisis in the Pacific. Greater detail and substantiation is provided in Annex 8.

Ensuring that existing and future expenditures are affordable, effective, efficient and
financially sustainable.


The most strategic action Ministries of Finance and Economic Policy can take is to ensure that
scarce resources from Government, development partners, and other stakeholders are affordable,
allocated to best use, and can be sustained. Most Pacific Islands are caught in a pincer movement:
rapidly rising NCD related health costs but only modest prospects for overall economic growth and
revenue generation. Not everything will be affordable. Not everything represents value for money.
The focus must be on allocating scarce financial and human resources to preventing – or at least
postponing – the rising incidence of NCDs and their complications.

Ministries of Finance and Economic Policy have a responsibility and duty to therefore require tests
of value for money and overall affordability for expenditure on NCDs to ensure scarce resources
are used to maximum benefit. Ministries of Finance and Economic Policy are entitled, for example,
to reject, or at least question, expenditure proposals for dialysis treatment of diabetes if the cost per
patient is more than three times the GDP per capita of the country16; prognosis and outcomes poor;
and / or access confined to the well-connected. Overseas treatment costs are also often a source of

16
     See “cost-effectiveness? in the acronyms and glossary for a definition of cost -effectiveness thresholds.

Page | 34
large and fast-growing costs for many countries in the Pacific: overseas treatment absorbed 15% of
the total health budget in Samoa but benefited less than 0.1% of the nation’s population (World
Bank, 2013a). Threshold levels of relative additional benefit and cost, and overall affordability,
should be used to screen large and fast-growing expenditure items. Those proposals failing to meet
minimum thresholds should be rejected, and resources reallocated to potentially high impact
interventions such as PEN. Expenditure on ‘futile care’ 17 should be redirected to interventions with
greater evidence based probabilities of successful outcomes. Ministry of Finance and Economic
Policy should also actively and critically assess development partner funding proposals. New, aid
funded, expenditure on tertiary hospitals should be rejected if they impose a long tail of otherwise
unforeseen or un-budgeted recurrent costs on Government’s own resources, or attract health
worker and other resources away from primary and secondary prevention at the community level.



Tobacco control and reducing harmful use of alcohol
Tobacco is a major strategic policy area to address NCDs, particularly in the Pacific. That is because
tobacco use is the only risk factor common to all of the four main NCDs (cancer, heart disease,
chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) and causes or exacerbates virtually all NCDs. WHO notes
that “tobacco is the leading behavioural risk factor causing substantially large number of potentially
preventable deaths worldwide…one death every six seconds (WHO, 2012d). Tobacco smokers lose at
least one decade of life expectancy compared to those who never smoked (Jha et al., 2013). The
Pacific needs to take urgent action: adult males in Kiribati, PNG and Tonga have the 3rd, 5th and 10th
highest rates of smoking in the world in 2012 with age standardised prevalence rates of 54.4%;
51.4% and 46.4% respectively (Ng M et al., 2014). Tobacco use costs money (and ill health) yet rates
of tobacco consumption, including leaf tobacco, are highest amongst the poorest and least educated
groups in PNG. Second-hand smoke imposes health and economic costs on society. Recent studies
show that, although no significant reduction in birth weight was detected, smoke free legislation is
associated with a more than 10% reduction in preterm birth and hospital attendances for asthma
(Been et al., 2014). Recent analysis finds that “at present, tobacco use is the most policy-responsive
of (six)18 targeted risk factors? responsible for the majority of NCDs globally (Kontis et al., 2014).

Raising taxes on tobacco products is a particularly effective means of simultaneously reducing
consumption (thereby decreasing death and disease); increasing total government revenue; and
reducing hospital and other medical expenses. The total cost of tobacco control measures in
California was $4.5 billion but resulted in $86 billion reduced health care costs: a saving to the health
system of $19 for every dollar invested in the tobacco control program (Glantz & Gonzalez, 2012).

WHO recommends that excise duties should be at least 70% of the retail price of all tobacco
products as a means of reducing consumption. Very few countries in the Pacific have achieved that
level. However, as seen in Table 3.1 below, several Pacific Island countries are sufficiently close that
a small extra effort would reach that recommended level, while other Pacific Island countries
however need to catch up. The countries that have achieved this level have done so recently by


17
   In essence, complex and expensive treatment that medical professionals know has little or no chance of
working which simply postpones death for a short period rather than prolonging healthy life. See Annex 9.
18
   The six main risk factors for NCDs in the study by Kontis et al (2014) are tobacco and alcohol use; salt intake;
obesity; and raised blood pressure and glucose.

Page | 35
         raising taxes on tobacco products. Increasing excise duties on tobacco to at least 70% reduces
         consumption while generating additional revenue for Government. In some countries the excise
         level may need to be higher to reduce consumption). Modelling by WHO in 2012 found that raising
         the then excise tax on cigarettes by 50% would directly generate an additional $1.6 million
         Government revenue per year in Samoa. Tonga would directly generate an additional $1.45 million
         per year (World Bank, 2013a). The modelling did not include savings to the Government health
         budget as a result of reduced strokes and heart attacks.

         Raising tobacco excise rates sends a powerful signal to consumers – and an important message to
         development partners. Raising the price of tobacco sends an important signal to consumers about
         the harmful effects of tobacco, provided this is accompanied by public education. Raising the price
                                            of tobacco also sends an important signal to development

Recent analysis finds that some 7.4 million Smoking Attributable Deaths (‘SADs’) were averted
amongst countries implementing good tobacco control in the 3 years to 2010. Importantly, while the
largest number of SADs was averted as a result of increased cigarette taxes (3.5 million), other
policies were also important including smoke-free air laws (2.5 million SADs averted); health
warnings (700 000 SADs averted); cessation treatments (380 000 SADs averted), and bans on
tobacco marketing (306 000 SADs averted) (Levy D, Ellis J, Mays D, & Huang A, 2013).

Despite a commitment to a Tobacco Free Pacific by 2025, compliance with existing tobacco
regulation and control is generally weak in the Pacific. Sale of single sticks of cigarettes, or sales to
minors, is still commonplace in the Pacific. Tobacco advertising needs to be strictly controlled,
including at sports grounds and near schools. Smoking bans in restaurants and public places need to
be enforced. Nicotine replacement therapy should be provided where this is affordable. It is
particularly important in places like PNG that Ministries of Agriculture ensure that higher prices of
tobacco products are not accompanied by an expansion of domestic, including backyard, tobacco.
Tobacco companies should not be providing educational scholarships, as they do in PNG. Plain
packaging of cigarettes appears to be effective in reducing consumption: there was a 78% increase in
the number of calls to tobacco Quitline, peaking 4 weeks after the Australian Government
introduced plain packaging of cigarettes (Young J et al., 2014). ‘Earmarking’ tobacco taxes for use in
health promotion makes political sense, but is very hard to justify on economic or public finance
grounds for reasons discussed in Annex 8. In any event, raising the price of tobacco to reduce
consumption is a key objective in its own right: arguments for and against ‘earmarking’ are a
secondary issue (Annex 8 elaborates).

Increasing the tax on tobacco will generate arguments, but there are strong counter-arguments.
The tobacco industry argues that raising tobacco prices is regressive, hurting the poor the most. This
is not true over the medium term: the poor benefit significantly more than the rich in terms of
improved health outcomes, and less of the tax burden, because the poor are more likely to stop
smoking, or not take it up (Jha P et al., 2012). While direct employment in tobacco industries may
fall, this can be managed by staging the tax increases over time and actively supporting alternative
employment in production of healthy foods: an important goal in its own right in the Pacific. Any
immediate losses in the tobacco industry need to be compared to increased excise revenue and
reduced government health expenditure on strokes and heart attacks. Strong tobacco control
measures that are well implemented have early health and financial benefits: hospital admissions for
heart attacks in several countries fell by an average of 17% within a year and around 30% after 3
years, saving health budgets (Glantz & Gonzalez, 2012). Annex 11 summarises some myths about
NCDs including tobacco control.

Alcohol also contributes to the burden of NCDs, as well as causing other health and social
problems, and should be considered for tax increases. Tobacco requires aggressive policies because
there is no safe level of usage; is addictive; kills two thirds of users; and has no health benefits.
Alcohol does not have those characteristics, and is not – at present – as widely used in the Pacific.
Yet alcohol can also contribute to NCDs. Parry and colleagues recent comprehensive survey of the
evidence concludes that: ‘There is a strong link between alcohol and non-communicable diseases,
particularly cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pancreatitis and diabetes, and these
findings support calls by the World Health Organization to implement evidence-based strategies to
reduce harmful use of alcohol’ (Parry, Patra, & Rehm, 2011). Alcohol misuse amongst men can lead

Page | 38
to domestic violence, already an important challenge in the Pacific, and medical costs. Alcohol
misuse amongst pregnant women can cause irreversible damage to the foetus and child. The Cook
Islands provides a useful example of how to use price to capture some of the health and social costs
(“externalities?) of alcohol abuse. Details are in Annex 8. Individual countries are best placed to
decide via their own country specific Roadmap what priority and policy to adopt with respect to
alcohol depending upon the health and economic burden it places on society.



Taxes on unhealthy food and drink that are associated with diabetes and obesity


There is no doubt that the Pacific has high levels of overweight and obesity: a key but preventable
risk factor for NCDs including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. As seen in Chart 4 below, over half
the adult population in 16 of the 17 Pacific Island countries and territories for which information is
available are overweight or obese. In 11 countries, more than 75% of the population is overweight
or obese.

Increased taxes on unhealthy food products, especially sugar-sweetened drinks are a therefore a
strategically important option in the Pacific, in combination with improved physical activity. That is
because the top ten countries in world for the highest rates of obesity - as well as diabetes - are all
in the Pacific. Of course, many food and drink products are potentially unhealthy, so priorities need
to be set. Consumption of sugar, especially in sugar-sweetened drinks is an important first target in
the Pacific. That is because they are a major, independent, explanatory factor in the rise of type 2
diabetes in low and middle income countries (Basu, Stuckler, McKee, & Galea, 2013). Sugar and high
                                           fructose corn syrup is increasingly used in many
                                           processed food products and drinks and aggressively

                                           studies involving price increases of around 25% - to 50%
Sugar-sweetened beverages are              that reduced consumption (Thow AM, Jan S, Leeder S, &
concentrated sources of sugar….As the
                                           B., 2010). Some international evidence suggests that
sugar is in a solution, it is easily and
completely ingested, giving a large        taxing food and drink products to reduce NCDs is usually a
injection of calories without the          cost-effective intervention (Cecchini et al., 2010; WHO,
consequential satiation of appetite...the  2003a). However some analysts find that while there is
correlation between obesity and soda       clear evidence that increased taxes on sugar sweetened

                                           including eggs and oils. Most analysts note the lack of well
                                           conducted studies in developing countries, or involving
                                           populations ‘at risk’ of poor nutrition (Andreyeva T, Long

Any decision to tax food and drink therefore needs to be designed carefully if it is to have desired
outcomes on reducing risk factors. Tax increases need to be relatively large to be effective; cover a
range of similar goods to prevent substituting into other unhealthy products; incorporate the price
increases at the shelf price (rather than at the checkout); and not be subject to easy price
manipulation such as bulk purchasing. It is also important to understand how both suppliers, and
consumers, react to a tax increase. How suppliers and shops respond to the tax increase on
unhealthy products will depend upon the degree of competition in the industry. Highly competitive
markets may see some or all of the tax increase absorbed by suppliers and shops. Suppliers and
shops with little competition may pass on the tax increase in terms of higher prices to consumers.

How consumers respond may also differ depending upon the availability of alternative purchases. In
general, poorer households are most responsive to price changes and, often having higher levels of
risk factors for NCDs, stand to benefit more from shifting consumption away from unhealthy foods.
However in practice much depends upon the availability of healthy alternatives. As noted shortly
after Denmark introduced a ‘fat tax’ in 2011: “the desired health outcome will be achieved only if a
healthier substitute is affordable or cheaper…for example if butter is easily and cheaply substituted
with low fat spread. This is known as a substitution effect. If consumers choose to continue to
purchase the same food they will have to spend more money, which implies that they may
compensate by reducing the amount of healthy foods they buy, such as fish, fruit, and vegetables.
This is known as income effect.?(Sinne Smed, 2012). It is worth noting that Denmark subsequently
abandoned the ‘fat tax’ particularly because people in Denmark could easily cross the border to
another country and purchase lower priced products that were not so taxed.

Control of salt intake is important where there are high rates of hypertension and heart disease, as
in the case of the Pacific. The physiological requirement for salt is less than 1 gram per day however
many are eating between 9 and 12 grams. Excess salt intake progressively elevates blood pressure
levels throughout life, which greatly increases the risks of vascular disease and is likely responsible
for about half of the disease burden ascribed to high blood pressure (Asaria et al., 2007; Mohan S &
Cambell N, 2009). Salt reduction has also been shown to be cost-effective, and in some cases, cost-
saving. In the US, it was projected that an intervention that reduced salt by 3g/day would save
between $10 and $24 billion in health costs annually (Bibbins-Domingo K et al., 2010). Regulation;
industry cooperation; and public awareness campaigns about reducing salt intake can be a cost-
effective strategy to reduce hypertension and cardiovascular disease which do not necessarily
involve taxes (Asaria et al., 2007; Cecchini et al., 2010). Cost effectiveness studies of salt reduction
are currently being conducted in Fiji and Samoa. Despite differences in costs and circumstances,
these studies will provide valuable insights and lessons for other countries in the Pacific region. The
WHO Collaborating Centre on Population Salt Reduction has also been working with countries in the
Pacific to identify and measure actual salt levels in commonly consumed foods, and to develop
appropriate, evidence-based salt reduction targets suited to the Pacific. This work is now well
advanced. When finalised in coming months, the region wide targets for salt reduction would be
well suited for formal inclusion in each country’s NCD Roadmap.

 Transfats, often used in restaurant cooking and baked products, has been linked to heart disease
and diabetes. Several countries globally are seeking to limit their use (Mozaffarian, Katan, Ascherio,
Stampfer, & Willett, 2006). Recent analysis found that 60 out of 64 food products sampled in Fiji
contained more than one accepted level of 2% transfats per 100 gram of fat with some commonly

Page | 41
consumed products such as pizza having 18.85% transfats per 100g fat (Chand B, Prasad R, Lako J, &
Sotheswaram S, 2011). Fiji is introducing legislation that require trans fats to be labelled in nutrient
information. Restrictions on caterers re-using cooking oils can be a useful option. Basu and
colleagues estimate that a 20% tax on palm oil would avert approximately 363,000 deaths from
heart attacks and stroke over the period 2014-2023 in India if there was no substitution into other
unhealthier oils (Basu S et al., 2013).

Reducing taxes on healthy foods, or even providing subsidies, is a possible option for some
countries but would require very careful targeting. There may be some scope for reducing taxes on
healthy products (including fresh fruit, vegetables, and fish) in some countries but the additional
costs (loss of revenue) need to be compared to the additional benefits (price reductions would need
to be large to induce increased consumption and improved health). It is unlikely that subsidies on
healthy foods are going to be the best use of scarce government resources given the budgetary
constraints most Pacific Island countries are facing; the usual problems of targeting the truly needy
via subsidies; and the likelihood the money spent on subsidies would have higher impact in
alternative uses.

Political economy factors clearly need to be understood and managed when designing taxes on
food and drink. The political pain is now, the public health gain is later. Consumers often like to
consume the (unhealthy) food and drinks, and dislike taxes. Industry and retailers will resist efforts
to reduce sales and will actively – and sometimes aggressively – work to protect their profits (R.
Moodie et al., 2013). There will be claims that taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks are regressive
(disproportionately affecting the poor) although little mention of the likelihood that the poor are
also disproportionately disadvantaged if they consume higher levels of such products. There will be
industry winners and losers. Political leadership and communication explaining the links between
unhealthy food and drink and the NCD crisis is essential before taxes are increased. There are several
practical lessons to draw on in designing taxes on food and drinks that are spelt out in this report
and suggested roadmap.



Ministries of Health


Ministries of Health clearly have a central role to play in responding to the NCD Crisis. WHO
estimates that around one third of the effect of NCDs can be controlled through actions such as
targeting prevention and treatment of high risk groups (overweight, sedentary, smokers with high
blood pressure and insulin resistance) taken within the health sector (Bettcher D, 2012). The
following summarises the key interventions for them. Details are in Annex 9.

NCDs need to be seen as part of the broader health system strengthening agenda of the Pacific,
and not ‘just another vertical disease’. The focus on NCDs is understandable when around 70% of
deaths and a large share of the disability burden are caused by NCDs. However virtually all countries
in the Pacific also still have an unfinished agenda of communicable diseases and maternal, newborn
and child health to address (World Bank, 2013a). The rising incidence of NCDs also adds to existing
challenges of health system strengthening, some arguing that prevention and management of
chronic diseases are now ‘a litmus test for health system strengthening in low and middle income

Page | 42
countries’ (Samb et al., 2010). This has implications for all of the building blocks of the health
system including information management, health workforce, technology choices, drugs, leadership
and health financing, especially as countries increasingly move to Universal Health Coverage.
Weaknesses in national health systems also undermine the value of otherwise cost-effective
interventions for NCDs and other diseases (Cecchini et al., 2010; Robinson H & Hort K, 2012; Samb et
al., 2010).

Integrating health system strengthening, whilst acknowledging the broader social determinants of
health, is therefore critical when scaling up NCD responses. Taking a life cycle approach to NCD
prevention and control, from pre-pregnancy through to old age, is one way of integrating NCD
management into the health system more broadly. Taking a life cycle approach to NCD (and other
health challenges) from pre-pregnancy through to adulthood within the overall health system is also
a way of recognising that many of the social determinants of health nevertheless still lie outside of
the health system itself.

Increasing efficiency and impact of the existing health dollar is a key strategy available for most
countries in the Pacific, freeing up resources that can be better allocated to prevention and control
of NCDs, maternal and child health, and other core priorities. There is a good deal of scope for
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of existing government expenditure in many countries of
the Pacific. Challenges common to most countries in the Pacific include the need for improved
allocative (‘doing the right things’) and technical (‘doing things right’) efficiency; improved focus on
prevention and front line services; strengthened public financial management; investment in data
analysis and results management; and a preparedness to take hard decisions, including avoiding high
cost interventions with poor outcomes (World Bank, 2010, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). There may
be scope in some of the larger economies of the Pacific to consider gradually privatising or at least
contracting out very expensive and cost-ineffective interventions such as dialysis units in ways that
allow the currently small private sector to expand in a phased manner.

There are also several specific actions that Pacific Island countries can do which are likely to
improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of the existing health dollar. Pacific Island
countries should continue to implement and scale up the Crisis Response Package, including the
Package of Essential NCD (PEN) interventions, adapted to their country needs and resources. Those
approaches involve evidence-based, technically feasible, and cost-effective and generally affordable
interventions in most settings. Like all such interventions, Ministries of Finance and Economic
Planning, and Ministries of Health, need to actively and jointly monitor and measure the costs and
consequences of the scaling up of these interventions. That is because, amongst other things, there
is a potentially very wide range of options and costs involved. The predicted costs for scaling up PEN
in the Cook Islands range from $NZ900,000 ($NZ 12 per person) to over $NZ 4 million ($NZ 54 per
person). Careful monitoring is also required to assess the quality of implementation as this
ultimately affects value for money as well as health outcomes. There are also second round dynamic
effects that need to be identified and budgeted for: will increased coverage of NCD screening lead to
surges in diagnostic testing and treatment that had not been anticipated or resourced? Pacific Island
countries, and their development partners, should more systematically capture the costs and lessons
of the roll out, and share those insights with others in the region. For example, there are strategic
benefits in Pacific Island countries identifying the reasons for large variations in the price of identical
pharmaceutical products in the region (Annex 9 provides details).

Page | 43
Ministries of Health also need to distinguish between health promotion and a health Foundation
and evaluate program effectiveness carefully. The latest global study of obesity and overweight in
The Lancet concluded that:

         Data from systematic reviews suggest that only 31% of the coronary heart disease risk and
         8% of the stroke mortality risk associated with obesity is mediated through raised blood
         pressure and cholesterol collectively. Therefore, drugs targeting blood pressure and
         cholesterol can be expected to attenuate some, but not most of, the cardiovascular risk
         attributable to overweight and obesity. Therefore, even with aggressive drug therapy,
         increased rates of overweight and obesity can be expected to have substantial health eﬀects
         and increase prevalence of diabetes, osteoarthrisits, cancers, and major vascular disease.(Ng
         et al., 2014)

Health promotion and changes to lifestyle are therefore important. But health promotion goes well
beyond simply raising ‘awareness’ if risky behaviours (smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyles;
unhealthy eating) are to change. Having a dedicated health promotion foundation may be a good
option, provided it did not duplicate existing activities or take scarce, highly trained managers and
staff away from existing Ministry of Health priorities. A more cost-effective alternative to
establishing a new stand-alone health promotion foundation might be to better integrate health
promotion activities into the existing primary health care settings20. Whatever approach is taken, the
difficulties in changing lifestyle behaviours means that program effectiveness should be tested and
evaluated.

Earmarking taxes for health promotion activities can make political sense but raises fundamental
issues about best use of scarce revenues and is always a secondary issue to the key objective or
reducing tobacco use through a price increase. ‘Earmarking’ increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol
and allocating the additional revenue to health promotion has intuitive and political appeal, and has
been used in several countries including Thailand. But ‘earmarking’ is hard to justify on economic
grounds. That is because additional revenue from any source should go to the central government
pool where it can be allocated to the highest development priority in whatever sector: health,
education, agriculture, energy, road infrastructure etc. (For some countries in the Pacific, the highest
national development priority might indeed be to reduce the incidence and rising public expenditure
impacts of preventable NCDs). In any event, debates about earmarking should always be seen as
very much a secondary issue: the first order of priority is to raise (and maintain) the real prices on
tobacco so as to discourage consumption of an addictive substance that kills two-thirds of its users,
and undermines the health and wealth of the already poor. The poor, and young, are particularly
sensitive to price increases so raising (and maintaining) the excise duty on tobacco is a worthwhile
and sufficient objective in its own right.

Cost recovery and Social Health Insurance are also problematic. User fees have the potential to
raise additional revenues and send useful price signals. But they may generate even larger economic
and social costs, and harm access by the poor. Introducing social health insurance is most unlikely to

20
  Of course, not all health promotion activities could or should be done at the primary health care level.
Higher level advocacy, communications, regulations for tobacco control etc are done at a national level. And
there will always be a place for health promotion while treating patients at secondary and tertiary levels of the
health care system, when patients may be more open to adopting health promotion advice.

generate additional financial resources in the Pacific context at this time, and is not a better
response to addressing NCDs than other options, including improved technical and allocative
efficiency in the health sector. Annex 9 has details.



Other Government departments


All Departments have a role to play when there is a ‘national crisis’. Annex 6 provides a consolidated
summary of actions that departments can take from an economic and financing perspective. The
following summarises the situation.

Attorney Generals


The Attorney-General will need to be involved in any multi-sectoral task force to ensure that
taxation and other measures are legally sound. From an economic perspective, Governments
certainly do not wish to incur needless court costs and possible compensation payments that
overturn revenue enhancing taxation measures that are successfully challenged by industry.

Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries


The Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries can do two things that are strategic from an economic
perspective. First, they can proactively identify and promote production and marketing
opportunities for fresh fruit, vegetables and fish. They can help identify and support increased value
chain processing of healthy but under-utilised products, and facilitate their sale to local markets,
schools, and restaurants. They can support efforts to improve the consistency, quality, reliability and
safe handling of food products, including by supporting refrigerated warehousing, and improved
transportation links. This would increase the value-added of primary production and help reduce
the current high levels of physical and nutritional deterioration of food between farm / fish catch
and the consumer. Second, Ministries of Agriculture should actively discourage the production of
unhealthy products, including small holder production of tobacco leaf, including through inspection
of actual land usage by extension officers, and help identify alternative productive use of the land.
This would be particularly important in PNG where local tobacco leaf production is common and
opportunities for alternative high value crops foregone.

Ministries of Communications


The Ministries of Communications have two important roles to play from an economic perspective.
First, they should strictly limit harmful advertising including advertising of alcohol, tobacco and ‘junk
food’ on TV, radio and movies – especially during times when children may be watching or listening
– and in public places such as sports grounds, as these are ‘gateways’ to unhealthy lifestyles and
acquiring NCDs. Second, the Ministries should also be promoting clear and evidence based
information about risk factors for NCDs and other public health issues, as such information is a
‘public good’ unlikely, by definition, to be supplied at the optimum social level by private industry .

Page | 45
But this needs to be done carefully and monitored for effectiveness as there is mixed evidence about
the cost-effectiveness and impact of public health messages promoting healthier lifestyles (Cecchini
et al., 2010; Cobiac L et al., 2012). The Ministries could encourage and financially support role
models, including sports and movie stars, to be advocates for healthy living. Local TV programs and
soap operas could be encouraged wherever possible to show healthy lifestyle and eating behaviours
as normal.

Ministries of Customs and Excise


The Ministries have two important roles to play from an economic perspective. First, they need to
ensure that excise duties, and rules of marketing and selling products known to cause NCDs, are
being implemented properly and consistently across the country at all times. Imported tobacco,
alcohol, food and drink should all pay the appropriate rates of excise duty. Illegally selling of broken
packets of cigarettes and single stick sales at local markets – still a common occurrence in much of
the Pacific - should be curtailed and if necessary fined. Leakage of duty free tobacco and alcohol
from duty free stores to the domestic market should be stopped, and duty free allowances of the
products reduced over time. Action in this area will increase government revenue, and increase the
effectiveness of public health policy and warnings about illegal practices.

Second, the Ministries should work with the National Statistics Office, the Ministries of Health, and
the Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning to more systematically collect data and trends on
the importation of tobacco, alcohol, food and drink. Many countries rely heavily on imports of these
products but have weak data on actual consumption (and revenue) trends. Ministries of Customs
and Excise should regularly monitor and publish the level of excise duty collected for tobacco and
alcohol, and map the revenue gained on geographical maps – which should then be published online
– so that the public can identify which sales points are selling NCD inducing products but not paying
excise duties.

Ministries of Education


Ministries of Education have an important role to play in reducing NCDs. That is partly because
childhood obesity increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in adulthood as well as obesity
(Han, Lawlor, & Kimm, 2010; Robert C. Whitaker, Wright, Pepe, Seidel, & Dietz, 1997). It is also partly
because children spend so much of their time in the school environment where access – or barriers –
to physical activity and healthy food can help set in train life- long positive -or negative – patterns of
behaviour. And it is partly because schools provide an environment where children and youth can
learn accurate (or inaccurate) information about the risks and consequences of NCDs that can then
influence their own choices, and those of their families. These issues are particularly important in
the Pacific where there are already high rates of being overweight and obese: nearly one in four
boys and one in five girls aged 13-15 are obese, and nearly 30% of boys in the Cook Islands are obese
(World Bank, 2013a).

There are several practical measures that Ministries of Education and individual schools can take.
School canteens should aggressively monitor and avoid unhealthy foods and especially ban sugar
sweetened beverages. Ministries of Education should work with town councils to ensure that fast

Page | 46
food outlets, trade stores, and street hawkers selling tobacco and sugar sweetened drinks are not
permitted to be located near schools. Short but regular and vigorous exercise during school hours
should be encouraged. Increasing playground space, and / or making playgrounds safely and
responsibly accessible to the community during weekends could be considered. Advertising of
unhealthy products and sports / educational sponsorship by tobacco companies (as occurs in PNG)
should be banned.

It will be important to measure and monitor the impacts of such interventions over time as several
studies and reports suggest that school based interventions are not particularly cost-effective, at
least at a global level (Cecchini et al., 2010; WHO, 2010a). The situation may – or may not be –
different in the Pacific where levels of overweight and obesity are particularly high among school
aged youth.



Ministries of Labour and Industry, and the Public Service Commission


Ministries of Labour and Industry have three important contributions to make in responding to NCDs
from an economic perspective.

First, because of ‘market failures’21 Ministries should work constructively – but firmly - with food
and drink manufacturers, and retailers, to reduce the production and sale of unhealthy products .
This includes production, labelling, and sale of tobacco and alcohol, the level of salt and fat content
in products, and the sale of sweetened drinks and products. Tobacco, alcohol, processed food and
drink industries often have strong market power and use sophisticated mechanisms to expand sales
and increase profits globally that are not socially optimal (‘market failures’). (R. Moodie et al., 2013;
Zimmet, 2000). Recent analysis concludes industry self-regulation is not sufficient to protect public
health. More specifically, recent peer reviewed research concludes that ‘despite the common
reliance on industry self-regulation and public–private partnerships, there is no evidence of their
effectiveness or safety. Public regulation and market intervention are the only evidence-based
mechanisms to prevent harm caused by the unhealthy commodity industries’ (R. Moodie et al.,
2013).

Second, Ministries should work in an even – handed way to promote the production and
marketing of alternative healthy local foods. Stakeholder analysis finds there are several policy and
administrative barriers to promoting locally produced healthier foods in Fiji and Tonga. This acts as a
barrier to expanded economic production and opportunities for increased value-added in the
economy, as well as undermining public health. These barriers include absence of food quality and
food labelling requirements for locally produced and manufactured food; poor support to the local
fishing industry; difficulties in access agricultural land; support for agricultural exports but not local
production (Snowdon et al., 2010). Supporting a policy and business environment that encouraged
employment intensive production and sale of healthy horticultural and garden products would help
generate additional tax revenues and help offset any employment losses from reduced employment
in tobacco and related industries.

     See glossary for a definition of market failures.

Page | 47
Third, the Ministries of Industry and Labour, and the Public Service Commission, should actively
make workplaces “heart healthy?. They can do so by organising health checks amongst all workers
for NCD risk factors, with mechanisms to facilitate referral and improved lifestyles for those found to
be at risk. A recent workplace health assessment of 900 store managers and 200 operations
managers in a major food chain in Australia found that 31% of senior staff were obese and that ‘80 %
of its senior managers were in bodies older than their birth age’ (Davies A, 2014). As a result, the
company is encouraging fitness and healthy lifestyle programs for 200,000 of its staff. Companies,
supported by Ministries of Industry and Labour, can take several actions. They can ensure workplace
canteens are not selling unhealthy food or drinks, or allowing tobacco or alcohol consumption.
Guam, for example, has introduced a Worksite Wellness Program to help reduce NCDs. Select Care
Health Insurance provides health screening, nutrition and cooking advice, tobacco cessation
programs, and stress management. Workplace interventions should be measured and monitored
carefully as there is some suggestion that, globally at least, such interventions are not particularly
cost-effective compared to alternative use of resources (Cecchini et al., 2010).



Ministries of Trade


It is clear from the literature that, from an economic perspective, international trade, and
international trade agreements, provides both opportunities and constraints to addressing the
NCD crisis in the Pacific (Hawkes C, Blouin C, Henson S, Drager N, & L., 2009; Legge D, Gleeson D,
Snowdon W, & Thow AM, 2013; Mitchell A & Voon T, 2011; Snowdon W & Thow AM, 2013; Thow
AM, Swinburn B, et al., 2010; WHO, 2012a; WHO and WTO, 2002; World Trade Organization, 2013).
On the one hand, international trade and supporting trade agreements provide small and remote
Pacific Island economies with sources of economic growth, and a much wider variety of
competitively priced goods, services and financing (including overseas remittances and tourism) than
they would have otherwise. International trade agreements also provide a rules-based approach to
international dispute settlements, and incentives for public sector reform in procurement and other
sectors. “Aid for Trade? provides an opportunity to increase production and exports of healthy fruits
and vegetables; reduce post-harvest losses of fresh food; and increase policy coherence between
health and economic sectors (Thow AM & S., 2013).

On the other hand, international trade, and trade agreements, have seen the rapid growth of
imports of unhealthy foods, drinks, and tobacco products, often displacing local production and sales
of fresh local products. Importation of canned and bottled sugar-sweetened drinks have contributed
to unhealthy diets while draining scarce foreign exchange reserves and adding to shipping costs for
their importation and re-export of used cans. The six22 Pacific Island members of the World Trade
Organization have access to a rules-based international agreement of 159 countries promoting fairer
and freer trade in goods and services, but are also conscious of the high profile experience of Samoa
when it sought to ban imports of turkey tails on public health grounds (Edwardes B & Frizelle F,
2009; Snowdon W & Thow AM, 2013) and similar events (Thow AM, Swinburn B, et al., 2010). Some
researchers find that recent regional trade agreements carry greater threats and less protection to
public health than more traditional trade agreements because of ‘inherent power imbalances’

22
     Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.

Page | 48
between the parties, and because some regional trade agreements involve investment and
intellectual property rules likely to restrict access to medicines and / or control of harmful
substances (Friel S et al., 2013; Gleeson & Friel, 2013).

The literature suggests that the key issues for policy makers in the Pacific to bear in mind are:

        International trade agreements do allow countries to restrict the import of unhealthy
         products on public health grounds. The WTO and other relevant trade agreements generally
         permit countries to manage trade in goods and services in order to achieve their national
         health objectives as long as health measures respect basic trade principles such as non-
         discrimination between local producers and trading partners. In addition, key provisions in
         the WTO (such as GATT Article XX) specifically allow governments to take actions to protect
         human, animal or plant life or health (WHO and WTO, 2002; World Trade Organization,
         2013). WTO dispute ruling justified a ban on asbestos products on the grounds that WTO
         agreements do give priority to health and safety over trade (World Trade Organization,
         2013). But these actions are disciplined, for example to prevent them being used as an
         excuse for protecting domestic producers: protectionism in disguise(World Trade
         Organization, 2013). PICTA excluded tobacco and alcohol from the tariff reduction following
         submissions on the health and financial implications of their inclusion(Snowdon W & Thow
         AM,                                                                                   2013)

        But taxes or other health related measures need to be consistent with the trade agreement
         rules. For the WTO these rules include the obligation that any taxes or restrictions must be
         applied, for example, in a non-discriminatory way (that is, apply equally to domestic
         production as well as imports); for the purpose of protecting public health (rather than
         disguised protection of local producers); and are based on scientific evidence or
         internationally    recognised     standards     (World     Trade     Organization,    2013)

        Improved data collection on import trends and impact is urgently required to establish the
         actual facts and evidence base to inform policy. There is insufficient data on imports of
         unhealthy products for policy makers to choose strategic, targeted, or defensible decisions.
         The UNDP has analysed household income and expenditure data and estimated the import
         content, and health implications, of such purchases23. Additional work such as that should be
         encouraged.

        Weak implementation of existing domestic regulations, and out-dated regulations, may be
         an equally important factor as increasing imports. Studies show that some Pacific Island
         countries have a poor record in implementing their own food labelling and food standards
         laws, or those laws are out-dated (Snowdon W & Thow AM, 2013). There is ample anecdotal
         evidence to show that cigarettes can be easily sold as single sticks, or to children, in most
         countries of the Pacific due to lax enforcement.


23
  Analysis is awaiting finalisation and publication. However preliminary findings suggest that imported food
was significant in all Pacific countries, but varied considerably between them; and that there was a
statistically significant association between unhealthy food and imported food when measured in caloric
intake as well as a seemingly positive association between imported foods and obesity.

Page | 49
Perhaps most importantly, the Pacific Islands take a ‘whole of government’ approach, preferably
led by the Prime Minister’s Office, and specifically involve Ministries of Health, in the
development of a country’s position on trade and taxation issues. Some countries in the Pacific are
in the process of replacing customs duties with excise taxes and value added taxes as part of trade
negotiations. In the process, the prices of some unhealthy products may rise. But the prices of some
other unhealthy products may also fall, which is likely to increase their consumption. The prices of
other products may be kept administratively low for reasons of price control. It is not at all clear that
the health implications of these significant price changes are being factored into the policy making,
as the Ministry of Health is not automatically involved in discussions.



Ministries of Urban Planning and town councils


Poor urban planning can reduce normal physical activity and increase access to unhealthy fast
foods. Recent estimates suggest that, worldwide, physical inactivity causes around 10% of breast
cancer and colon cancer; 9% of all premature mortality; and 7% of Type 2 diabetes (Lee et al., 2012) .
Urban living is associated with sedentary living and obesity (Kirby, 2013). There is some evidence
that ‘successful promotion of active living, healthy eating, and healthy weight may be influenced
significantly more by social support, access to facilities and greater choice in physical activity and
food venues within neighbourhoods rather than by health advice alone’ (Heath G, 2012). A study of
lifestyle diseases in Pacific communities found that increasing urbanisation and sedentary work
practices contributed to “lifestyles of least effort? (Coyne T, 2000). Around 50% or more of the adult
populations have low levels of physical activity in five24 of the eight Pacific countries for which data is
available.

Ministries of Urban Planning and town councils could therefore ‘map’ the relative ease of access to
‘heart-healthy’ facilities – parks, bicycle paths, sidewalks – compared to unhealthy facilities –
including fast food outlets and plan future developments in better ways.

Ministries of Sport


Ministries of Sport clearly have a major role in promoting physical activity: a key component of
prevention strategies for reducing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other NCDs
(Cecchini et al., 2010). It is therefore critical that Ministries of Sport take a population based
approach to their responsibilities, aiming to improve physical activity of the whole population. From
an economic perspective (as well as a public health perspective) it is important that these Ministries
not to allocate their scarce resources disproportionately to elite (and often male dominated) sports
and sports stadiums. Instead, scarce funding for sports should be accessible by a wide range of
community groups, including girls and the broader community.

  Cook Islands 72 % physically inactive; Kiribati 50.1%; Marshall Islands 66.1%; Micronesia Federated States
64.3%; Samoa 50.3%.

National Statistics Office


The information base for policy making remains mixed. Not one country in the Pacific has accurate,
population based, information on the number of people dying, or on the causes of death. Only three
countries – Cook Islands, Fiji and Samoa – have baseline data on salt consumption. No country we
are aware of has data on the difference in cost when treating the same NCD patient at a tertiary
hospital compared to a secondary hospital or a primary care setting. Only Tonga includes NCDs as a
separate chapter in its National Health Accounts. On the other hand, 19 out of 21 Pacific countries
now have WHO STEPS surveys on NCD prevalence and risk factors, and five have conducted a second
survey. A formal cost-effectiveness study on salt reduction interventions is being conducted in Fiji.

The National Statistics Office therefore has a strategic but often overlooked role to play in the
response to NCDs and other health challenges. Priorities need to be set. This can only be done using
good information, otherwise resources are wasted.

There are several practical things that National Statistics Offices can do. They should be tasked to
regularly collect, analyse, and report to the Prime Minister’s Task Force the latest data from
household and retail expenditure surveys on the key risk factors driving NCDs including expenditure
trends on tobacco, alcohol, sugar sweetened drinks, and fast food. Such surveys should be designed
in such a way that they generate regular, comparable, statistics across the Pacific to identify trends
and outriders. The National Statistics Office should also consider removing unhealthy products
(tobacco, sugar sweetened drinks, turkey tails, mutton flaps etc) from the basket of goods used for
tracking inflation: there is no public policy reason why society should be compensated through wage
increases for price rises in known causes of NCDs during a ‘crisis’.

Police


The police have an important role to play. They will be the agency enforcing alcohol related
convictions, including through random breath testing of motor vehicle drivers and bike riders. Police
will be in a position to collect data and trends on alcohol related offenses including traffic accidents
and assaults. They will be involved in ensuring that laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to children,
or sale of single cigarettes, are implemented.

Section Four: Development partners, the private sector, civil society
and regional approaches

Multi-sectoral approaches are certainly not just confined to the Government sector. Other
stakeholders can support – or undermine – the response to the NCD crisis by what they do, or do not
do.

Multilateral and bilateral development partners


Development partners have not prioritised NCDs until very recently. Latest estimates suggest that
only 1.11% of global development assistance for health was directed towards NCDs in 2009 (latest
year available) compared to 27.4% allocated to HIV AIDS (IHME, 2014). Even in the Pacific, where
NCD burdens are high and HIV AIDS relatively low, development partners have traditionally favoured
funding for HIV AIDS at more than twice the level of NCDs. From 2002 to 2009, external assistance
totalled $68,481,730 for HIV and $32,910,778 for NCDs; external assistance for HIV activities in the
Pacific in 2009 was more than $18 million, while funding for NCDs was almost $12 million (Negin J &
Robinson H, 2010). Development partners have, however, been increasing funding for NCDs since
2008, as seen in Chart 5 below.

                                              Chart 5

                                Source (Negin J & Robinson H, 2010)




Page | 52
Development partners can directly support – or sometimes hinder – the response to the NCD
crisis. Development partners provide direct support to confronting NCDs by providing financial,
technical and policy support to the Ministries of Health. From an economic perspective, this is often
a much valued form of assistance, particularly when such assistance is provided in grant, untied
forms of aid; committed and disbursed in a reliable and predictable manner; is aligned to host
government priorities; is genuinely additional to government’s own expenditure efforts (rather than
substituting for them); is accompanied by evidence-based policy dialogue; and is actively monitored
and evaluated for quality and ‘lesson learning’. However such direct assistance can hinder the
response to the NCD crisis if the assistance does not have those aforementioned characteristics; is
provided as a ‘vertical’ disease specific program that distorts other priorities; duplicates government
mechanisms; or involves additional and low value added transaction costs.

Development partners can also indirectly support – or sometimes hinder – the response to the
NCD crisis. That is because NCDs require a multi-sectoral response and development partners are
usually active in several sectors. To the extent that development partners design, and fund, road
transport projects that also incorporate footpaths and bicycle paths; build schools that have good
recreation space; support town planning that has parks and playgrounds; then development
partners indirectly support the response to NCDs. Development partners that overlook those factors
in the design and implementation of such projects hinder the response. Development partners in
the Pacific could consider including a standing item on NCDs on their agendas for regular meetings.

Development partners can also help – or hinder – the response to the NCD crisis by their own
‘whole of government’ approaches, including trade policy. One observer recently commented that
while tobacco kills more than HIV AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined, the United States does
not include one line item for tobacco control in its $ 8 billion Global Health program, and usually
supports the reduction of import restrictions on tobacco during trade negotiations (Bollyky T, 2014).
One recent analysis notes that:

    ‘The conflict between aid (including for health programmes) and trade is nowhere
    more apparent than in the case of mutton flap exports from New Zealand to the
    Pacific Island countries. New Zealand has provided aid for efforts to control NCDs,
    including the provision of renal dialysis, while at the same time exporting high-fat
    mutton offcuts (mutton flaps) to the region It even threatened to pursue sanctions
    at the WTO when Fiji implemented a ban on importation of flaps’ (Snowdon W &
    Thow AM, 2013)




Private business sector


From an economic perspective it is not in the interests of the private sector to see workers (or
consumers) going on sick leave, become disabled, or die prematurely due to (otherwise preventable)
NCDs. Nor is it in the interests of the private sector to see the Ministry of Health spend increasing
amounts of scarce government resources on (otherwise preventable) expensive curative treatments


Page | 53
when those resources could have been invested in roads, ports, electricity generation and other
wealth enhancing activities. While some industries and retailers profit from manufacturing and
selling unhealthy products, most will benefit from having a healthier society and economy.

Government needs to liaise with industry; explain the reasons for the changes envisaged in each
country’s roadmap; work with the private sector to implement the changes; but be – and be seen to
be – firm and consistent in pursuing the national objectives.

Establishing a standing, high level, liaison between the Prime Minister’s office and the Chambers of
Commerce is a starting point to encourage two way dialogue.

Industry itself needs to take action by better understanding the nature of NCD risks and
consequences in its own workforce. As noted earlier, a recent workplace health assessment of 900
store managers and 200 operations managers in a major food chain in Australia found that 31% of
senior staff were obese and that ‘80 % of its senior managers were in bodies older than their birth
age’ (Davies A, 2014). As a result, senior management is now working on a program to encourage
healthier lifestyles amongst 200,000 workers in its stores.

There may be scope in some of the larger Pacific economies for Government to progressively
withdraw from financing – and providing – cost-ineffective interventions such as dialysis machines
and turning them over to the private sector in a stage manner. This would have a double benefit.
First, it would reduce the large and growing expense of dialysis treatment from the public
expenditure budget. This is important because that public expenditure now benefits only a small
number of individuals, for a few months or years, rather than the general public which is the key
responsibility of Government. Furthermore, progressively opening up the dialysis market to the
private sector in a stage manner would create an environment that would enable the private sector
to grow: itself a worthwhile policy outcome in its own right.



Civil society: churches, university and media


Churches play a very significant role in the life of the Pacific Islands. Church values are directly
aligned to a scaled up response to NCDs: healthy living; no tobacco or alcohol related violence; and
the value and importance of personal responsibility. Church leaders should be given accurate
information about the risks and responses to NCDs.

Media, including opinion leaders on social media, set agendas and norms. Credible health
professionals should be encouraged to brief journalists and social media networkers to give them
accurate information about risks and responses to NCDs.

Universities can play an important role in providing independent and objective generation and
analysis of data related to NCD risks and interventions. They can also provide ‘heart healthy’
campuses and environments for students.

Regional arrangements


Page | 54
The Pacific Islands share many common challenges, but also opportunities for doing things
differently. There are potential benefits (but also some transaction costs) in having a regional
approach to certain challenges including, for example, establishing a tobacco free Pacific. Sharing
insights into the relative costs and benefits of alternative approaches to responding to NCDs is a
‘public good’ that reduces costs for all members. As each country develops and refines its own
roadmap, it will be possible to develop an overarching regional framework showing points of
complementarity and opportunities for collaboration. There is a need for a ‘clearing house’ of
experiences so that countries can learn from each other about approaches that work (and don’t
work) and the cost implications of various approaches. This could be housed within existing regional
institutional arrangements or perhaps within a University. Organisations such as SPC, WHO and
World Bank are well placed to support regional approaches within their respective mandates. SPC is
particularly well placed to foster multi-sectoral, regional, approaches in the Pacific, given its
mandates in agriculture and fisheries as well as public health.

Section Five: Conclusion and next steps


Conclusion


Economics provides strong arguments – and tools - for allocating scarce resources to combating
the rise of NCDs in ways that are effective, efficient, affordable and sustainable. Not everything
that Governments or stakeholders would like to do is affordable, cost-effective, or sustainable in the
Pacific. Yet there are many interventions that are so but are not being scaled up.

Multiple causes beyond the health sector per se are driving the NCD crisis: as a result a multi-
sectoral approach is essential. Action by Ministries of Health is a necessary - but by no means
sufficient - condition for responding to the crisis. Failure of other sectors and stakeholders to
respond to the crisis will mean actions taken by others are undermined and already scarce Ministry
of Health resources wasted.

It is in the interests of all other Ministries, and most stakeholders, to support the reduction of
preventable NCD burdens, but Ministries and stakeholders need a credible and ‘actionable’
roadmap to know where, how and why to engage in practice. That roadmap needs to be
sufficiently comprehensive that all stakeholders can find points to engage; sufficiently flexible that it
meets individual country and sub-national circumstances; but sufficiently specific that it allows all
stakeholders to see where, why and how they fit in and align to the country’s own efforts. A
credible, ‘actionable’ roadmap, led and seen to be led by the top levels of Government, may serve to
reduce the volatility of development partners’ financing as political priorities change. A credible and
‘actionable’ roadmap is also essential for sustained business sector engagement, which has seen
‘roadmaps’ for other aspects of development launched – and then languish – before.

Next steps


This report provides the evidence base for countries in the Pacific to develop their own country
specific NCD Roadmap, consistent with existing policies and programs. Pacific Leaders have
committed to responding to the NCD crisis. Forum Economic Ministers, Health Ministers, and Trade
Ministers have echoed the importance of responding within their mandates. Global, regional, and
national frameworks and strategies have already been identified and agreed. This report, and the
options contained in Annex 6 for consideration by all stakeholders, sets out how to operationalise
those commitments from an economic and financing perspective.

Four key strategies are recommended for inclusion in every Country NCD Roadmap in the Pacific.
Given the risk factors for NCDs, and evidence about “best buys?, four key strategies are
recommended for all countries in the Pacific. The four key strategies involve: strengthening tobacco
control; policies on food and drink products that are directly linked to obesity, diabetes, heart
disease and other NCDs; improved efficiency and impact of the existing health dollar by reallocating
scarce health resources to targeted primary and secondary prevention of NCDs, and especially high
burden NCDs such cardio-vascular disease and diabetes; and strengthening the evidence base for
better investment planning and program effectiveness to ensure interventions work as intended and

Page | 56
provide value for money. In addition, each country can then add other interventions from a wide
menu of identified options to create a Country NCD Roadmap suited to its own country
circumstances.

Annex 2: The health, economic, and political arguments for why there
is an NCD crisis in the Pacific


The health argument
NCDs are already a major health challenge in the Pacific, with the region having rates of premature
deaths much higher than the rest of the world. NCDs are already the leading cause of death in
twelve Pacific Island Countries for which comparable data is available, frequently accounting for 70%
of all deaths (details in Annex One). Life expectancy in Tonga has fallen as a result of NCDs.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Pacific, often occurring at rates twice that
of more traditional communicable diseases. NCDs such as diabetes and stroke can also cause chronic
ill health and disability as well as death. The Pacific now has some of the highest rates of diabetes in
the world (World Bank, 2013a). Of particular importance is the fact that most Pacific Island
countries have rates of premature death that are much higher than countries of a similar income
level, or indeed the world average. The Pacific also has some of the highest rates of diabetes in the
world. This is shown in Chart 1 and 2 below.

NOTE: These estimates use the WDI statistics. It is acknowledged that countries may have different
                         estimates based on different methodologies.



Importantly, the trends are pointing the wrong way: existing risks factors suggest that NCDs will
be an even greater health challenge for the Pacific in coming years unless urgent and widespread
action is taken now. Each of the 10 countries in the Pacific for which data is available have 60% of
more of the adult population overweight, and in six countries more than 75% are overweight. In four
countries of the Pacific at least half the adult population is obese. Obesity and being overweight
often occurs at young ages: nearly one in four boys and one in five girls in Tonga are obese. Other
risk factors apart from weight are also significant in the Pacific. Based on the 2009 STEPS survey,
over three quarters (76%) of males and nearly one half (48%) of females use tobacco. Over 70% of
people in Cook Islands have low levels of physical activity. Based on the latest STEPS report for
Vanuatu, only 5% of adult females, and 10% of adult males, were free of any of the preventable risk
factors for acquiring NCDs in Vanuatu (World Bank, 2013a). Three of top ten rates of tobacco use in
the world involve Pacific countries: Kiribati, PNG and Tonga.

The economic argument


NCDs impose large – but often preventable – costs on already overstretched Government health
budgets. That is the result of a combination of factors: NCDs are increasingly affecting a larger
proportion of a country’s population; often involve medication and treatment for the rest of the
person’s life; and can often involve complex, expensive, hospital based treatments. This is all the
more important in the Pacific where most health expenditure is borne directly by Government’s own
budgets, rather than from out of pocket payments or private health insurance. NCDs put a large
strain on Government budgets: the estimated average total cost of dialysis for patients with diabetes
related kidney failure to the Government of Samoa was $ 38,686 per patient per year in 2010/11,
more than twelve times the Gross National Income of Samoa. But even low cost items can impose
significant costs to government due to the chronic and long term nature of certain NCDs. Glucose
testing strips for a diabetes patient in Vanuatu may cost only Vatu 42 ($ 0.45 cents) per day. But
used every day, as required, amounts to $ 164 per patient per year, more than the total government
expenditure on health per capita, further squeezing the Government’s health budget. One patient
requiring insulin absorbs the equivalent notional drug allocation of 76.4 other citizens in Vanuatu.
Only 1.31% of the total population could be treated with insulin before the total Government
pharmaceutical and medical supplies budget was used up (Anderson I et al., 2013; World Bank,
2013a). Increased expenditure on (often preventable) NCD costs means less money for alternative
high priorities in the health sector (and beyond) including the unfinished agenda of communicable
disease control in most countries of the Pacific.

The rising costs of (preventable) NCD treatment extend beyond the health sector, undermining
national budgets and national investments. Health already absorbs a relatively large share of
Government expenditure in the Pacific. For example, health accounts for between 10% – 24% of
total government expenditure, supported by external financing, in Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu, at
least twice the share found in other lower middle income countries globally. While there is an
argument for increasing absolute levels of public expenditure on health in the Pacific, most countries
have limited scope (“fiscal space?) to increase expenditure on health in a sustainable way. That is
particularly because most countries in the Pacific face modest, or at least volatile, economic growth
prospects and have a small revenue base (World Bank, 2013a). National budgets are therefore
caught in a pincer movement – rising costs due to NCDs but subdued growth in government
revenues. Preventable NCD costs drive out investments in national productive capacity.

NCDs also impose large – but again often preventable – social and economic costs on individuals
and the economy more broadly. Chronic NCDs including diabetes and heart disease lead, on
average, to increased absenteeism and reduced capacity for productive, income earning work.
Diabetes related blindness and amputations reduce mobility and social interactions. Premature
death of parents affects the wellbeing of children. There is some anecdotal evidence that people in
the Pacific are being exploited by spending relatively large amounts of money on traditional or newly
invented “cures? for advanced and non-curable diabetes and cancers.

The political argument


Perhaps most importantly, Pacific Islands Forum Leaders themselves have invested political capital
by explicitly declaring the “Pacific is in an NCD Crisis? including as part of the 42nd Pacific Islands
Forum communiqué of September 2011. The full text is at Annex 3. Amongst other things, Forum
Leaders specifically:

          “Expressed their deep concern that non-communicable diseases has reached
          epidemic proportions in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) and has
          become a ‘human, social and economic crisis’ requiring an urgent and
          comprehensive response.

          Noted with concern the huge economic costs of NCDs in the Pacific and in
          particular the rapidly rising expenditure on NCDs comprising well over 50 per cent
          of the total health budget of many island countries.

          Leaders were particularly concerned that if allowed to continue unabated NCDs
          has the potential to undermine labour supply, productivity, investment and
          education, four of the main factors driving economic growth with potentially
          devastating consequences, especially in Pacific island countries and territories

          (Forum Communique, 2011).

Health, Finance and Economic, and Trade Ministers from the Pacific have similar confirmed there
is an NCD crisis and the importance they attach to urgently addressing NCDs. Pacific Health
Ministers have jointly said that they ‘recognize NCD as a crisis in the Pacific to be addressed with the
utmost urgency’ (Honiara Communique, 2011). The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting recently
reaffirmed the Forum Leaders’ Communique noting that, amongst other things NCDs are creating a
‘human, social and economic crisis’, requiring an urgent and comprehensive response, including
taxation and other economic measures (Forum Economic Ministers Meeting, 2013). The key
references from the FEMM agreement on NCDs is at Annex 4. Forum Trade Ministers have also
explicitly recognised the link25 between trade and NCDs (Forum Trade Ministers' Meeting, 2013)




25
   The most recent Forum Trade Ministers’ Declaration stated that “paragraph 55. The Meeting considered
linkages between trade and health, including Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), trade in alcohol and
tobacco and other health issues. Paragraph 56: Ministers acknowledged the decisions of the 2013 Forum
Economic Ministers and Pacific Health Ministers regarding actions to address NCDs in the region, and noted
the importance of a balanced approach to public health issues, and the need for trade and health officials to
work closely?.

Annex 3: Extract from Forum Leaders’ Communique declaring NCDs a
Crisis

Forum Leaders:

Expressed their deep concern that non-communicable diseases has reached epidemic proportions in
Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) and has become a ‘human, social and economic crisis’
requiring an urgent and comprehensive response.

Leaders expressed alarm that 75 per cent of all adult deaths in the Pacific are due to NCDs the
majority of whom are in the economically active age bracket and that many more times this number
suffer severe side effects that undermine their capacity to contribute further to economic
development.

Leaders expressed grave concern that NCDs can undermine the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) which for a region that is already struggling to meet the 2015 targets
provides an even greater challenge.

Conscious of the assessment by the World Economic Forum ranking NCDs as one of the top global
threats to economic development, Leaders noted with concern the huge economic costs of NCDs in
the Pacific and in particular the rapidly rising expenditure on NCDs comprising well over 50 per cent
of the total health budget of many island countries.

Leaders were particularly concerned that if allowed to continue unabated NCDs has the potential to
undermine labour supply, productivity, investment and education, four of the main factors driving
economic growth with potentially devastating consequences, especially in Pacific island countries
and territories.

Leaders recognised the seriousness of the threat that NCD poses to the people in Pacific Island
countries and territories and the urgency to address it and declared the ‘Pacific is in an NCD Crisis’?

Annex 4: Extract from FEMM Action Plan on Economic Cost of NCDs

Economic Cost of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

41. Ministers reaffirmed the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ declaration that the Pacific is now in
an NCD crisis and commit to implementing the decisions of Forum Leaders by taking relevant
actions within the jurisdiction of Ministries of Finance and Economic Development, agreed to
allocate and mobilise resources for initiatives that have been proven to reduce the incidence
and prevalence of NCDs.

42. Ministers supported implementation of taxation interventions targeting NCD risk factors,
secondary intervention (including preventative measures) and nutrition policy dialogue as part
of the NCD roadmap for the Pacific Island region that would provide the basis for an effective
‘whole of government’ and ‘whole of community’ approach to addressing the NCD crisis in the
region, in collaboration with national health and other relevant ministries/departments and
development partners.

43. Given the high priority accorded to addressing NCDs in the region by Leaders, Ministers
agreed to include NCDs as a standing agenda for future FEMMs and requested the Secretariat of
the Pacific Community, on behalf of the Quintilateral Partners in Health, to provide updates on
the development of the NCD roadmap and ensure close engagement of Forum Members.

44. Ministers requested Secretariat of the Pacific Community, on behalf of the Quintilateral
Partners in Health, to present the finalised NCD roadmap to Economic Ministers in 2014
outlining the specific role and contribution of Economic Ministers in strengthening NCD
prevention and control in the Pacific region.

45. Ministers directed that the Forum Secretariat and Secretariat of the Pacific Community
explore options for a joint meeting of Economic and Health Ministers to promote greater
collaboration to tackle the epidemic rate of NCDs in the region.

46. Ministers noted the importance of political will in leading the fight against NCDs which may
have positive implications for selected Forum Island Countries’ national budgets, as well as
reducing NCDs’ burden as a result of implementation of the NCD roadmap which shall be
developed.

Annex 7 Why taxes? The six reasons why a tax on unhealthy products
(or a subsidy on healthy products) can be a strategic and justified
response to the NCD crisis.

Imposing any tax (or subsidy) has financial, economic and political costs and the decision to do so
should not be taken lightly. Taxes, by definition, raise prices of goods and services to some part of
the economy. They involve direct administrative costs, and indirect welfare costs and ‘deadweight’
economic costs. They involve political costs to Government.

Nevertheless, there are six reasons why a tax on unhealthy products (or a subsidy to healthy
products) can be a strategic response to the NCD crisis in the Pacific.

First, taxes discourage consumption of harmful products. Unhealthy products are ‘normal goods’:
as the price goes up, consumption falls on average, depending upon the responsiveness (“price
elasticity?) 26 of the consumer to the increase in price.

Second, governments can simultaneously increase tax revenue while seeing a reduction in overall
consumption of the unhealthy products if the product is price inelastic, as is often the case with
tobacco. Raising additional revenue is especially important in the Pacific where the large informal
sector currently limits the scope for income taxes, and where accession to the WTO and ongoing
trade negotiations lowers government revenues from import duties.

Third, large price increases, accompanied by clever public health messages, sends a clear positive
reinforcement signal to consumers, reminding them every time they see the price that this product
is unhealthy.

Fourth, increased taxes also send a positive reinforcement signal to development partners.
Multilateral and bilateral development partners being asked to financially support the health sector
in the Pacific are entitled to question the credibility of Pacific Island’s commitment to responding to
an NCD ‘crisis’ if those same Governments fail to make the effort to tax tobacco and other
demonstrably harmful products at an appropriate level.

Fifth, the relatively low prices of unhealthy products fail to capture their true cost to society: taxes
can capture these ‘externalities’. One interesting analysis suggests that smokers appeared to have
“paid their way? in some high income OECD countries through higher taxes on cigarettes “and
shorter life expectancy? as a result of smoking which then reduces pension obligations. On the other
hand, heavy drinkers imposed roughly half their societal costs (‘externalities’) to non-drinkers as a
result of alcohol related traffic accidents, assaults etc.

Finally, costs are regressive but the benefits are progressive. Excise and similar taxes on unhealthy
products are regressive (imposing a bigger proportionate burden on low income people than the

26
   For example, Hsiao and Wang (2013) cite estimates from the USA that Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs)
have a price elasticity of -1.21, meaning a 10% SSB tax increase is associated with a 12.1% decrease in SSB
consumption. They further note that SSB industry reports are consistent with these estimates: a 12% increase
in the price of Coca-Cola is associated with an average reduction of 14.6% drop in sales in the USA.

rich) in the short term. However, the benefits tend to be progressive (achieving a bigger
proportionate benefit amongst low income people than the rich) over the medium term. That is
because low income people are more price sensitive, and often have poorer health, to begin with.
Reducing consumption of unhealthy products by low income groups therefore can have a
proportionately stronger benefit than among the rich (Jha P et al., 2012).

Economic Planning: taxes and excise.
Taxes on tobacco


Tobacco use is a major risk factor for NCDs globally and a contributing factor in the Pacific. Three
of the highest rates of tobacco use in the world are in the Pacific: Kiribati, PNG and Tonga. WHO
notes that tobacco use is one of four27 major risk factors for NCDs. WHO also notes that tobacco use
causes more deaths globally than HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. WHO further
notes that “tobacco is the leading behavioural risk factor causing substantially large number of
potentially preventable deaths worldwide …….one death every six seconds.?(WHO, 2012d). Latest
research from Australia suggests that smoking and is directly linked to two thirds – not just a half as
previously thought – of deaths in current smokers, and cuts an average of 10 years off a person’s life
(ABC News, 2013). Expenditure on tobacco robs users of their health, as well as household income to
purchase other more desirable items: the money spent by a person smoking a packet of cigarettes a
day would cover the cost of nearly 4 secondary school students’ fees in Vanuatu28. Total prevalence
rates of tobacco use by adults vary considerably between the countries of the Pacific, and between
males and females, as seen in Chart 2.1below. Three countries from the Pacific are in the top ten
countries in the world for prevalence rates of age adjusted male smoking: Kiribati29 has the 3rd
highest prevalence rate out of 187 countries around the world at 54.4%; PNG is 5th with prevalence
rates of 51.4% and Tonga is tenth with prevalence rates of 46.4% (Ng M et al., 2014). Rates of
smoking by youth – a worrying indicator for the future given that tobacco is addictive - also vary
between countries of the Pacific and by gender (Chart 2.2). The poorest, and least educated, groups
in PNG use tobacco, including leaf tobacco, the most (Chart 2.3)

          estimates based on different methodologies or more recent surveys such as STEPS.

   A packet of 20 cigarettes currently costs Vt 750 in Port Vila, or Vt 22,500 a month ( Vt 750*30= Vt22,500).
Average monthly expenditure on secondary school fees is around Vt 5900 per month. Expenditure for a
packet a day smoker would therefore cover the secondary school fees of 3.8 children of that smoker. Figures
provided via personal correspondence from staff in Port Vila.
29
   It should be noted that the 2009 STEPS survey gives a male smoking prevalence rate of 76% and female rate
of 48%. Different approaches generate different estimates. But it is clear Kiribati has high rates of tobacco use
whatever approach is used.

Compliance with tobacco regulation is generally very weak, providing an environment for uptake
of tobacco amongst the young, and consequently the risk of addiction, and loss of Government
revenue. The WHO notes that Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu each scored 0/5 on key aspects of
tobacco regulation: monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies; protecting citizens from
tobacco smoke; offering services to help quit, warning of the dangers of tobacco; enforcing bans;
and raising taxation on tobacco products 30 (WHO, 2011). A 2010 survey in Tonga found that access
to tobacco was very high: all but one of Tonga’s 597 retail store outlets sold tobacco products. This
means there is an average of one tobacco outlet for every 29 Tongan households. Roughly speaking,
Tongan citizens have more chance of accessing a store selling tobacco then they do of having a
screening for diabetes at the Diabetes Centre.31 Almost two thirds (63%) of retail store outlets were
selling tobacco sticks separately, and almost one quarter (23%) were selling tobacco to underage
children recently, both activities in violation of the law (World Bank, 2013a). An earlier study found
that even relatively small population centres had very wide access to tobacco: south Tarawa had 245
tobacco outlets, Nuku’alofa 254 outlets, and Port Vila 393 outlets prior to 2005. Worse, 97% of those

30
   More formally, the WHO noted that Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, along with many other Pacific Island
countries, each scored 0 / 5 in terms of the “implementation of anti -tobacco (m) POWER measures at the
highest level of achievement “. (m)POWER stands for M: Monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies; P:
Protecting people from tobacco smoke; O: Offering help to quit tobacco use; W: Warning about the dangers of
tobacco; E: Enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and R: Raising taxes on
tobacco. WHO notes that each measure reflects one or more provisions of the WHO Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control, and the package of six measures is an important entry point for scaling up efforts to
reduce the demand for tobacco.
31
   There are 596 retail outlets selling tobacco in Tonga. There were 438 screenings for diabetes at the Diabetes
Clinic in 2010.

Page | 97
outlets in Kiribati and 85% of outlets in Tonga sold tobacco to visibly under-aged children in a
controlled and supervised experiment (Lower T, 2005). There is anecdotal evidence in the Pacific
that duty free shops ostensibly aimed at overseas tourists are easily sold to local residents.
Increasing enforcement of existing legislation is therefore an important action to consider. Hiring
additional staff to enforce legislation and issue fines and infringement notices would be a net
revenue raising exercise, particularly if such staff were well-paid and well-supervised so as to avoid
the temptation of taking bribes.

There is significant scope for increasing the level – and collection - of excise duties on tobacco
products in the Pacific, thereby generating additional revenue and reducing consumption. WHO’s
longstanding recommendation is that excise taxes on tobacco products should be increased to at
least 70% of the final retail price (WHO, 2010b). And best practice is to raise taxes to at least 75 % of
the retail price, a situation that 27 countries globally have achieved (WHO, 2013a). Table 3.1 below
shows the latest information as at June 2014.

Pacific Island countries should immediately take steps to progressively raise the excise duty on
tobacco products to at least 70% of their retail price so as to raise revenue and reduce
consumption, and then maintain that in real (adjusted for inflation) terms. Significantly raising the
price of tobacco through taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco
consumption, whilst also generating additional revenue for Governments (Abedian I, Merwe R,
Wilkins N, & Jha P, 1998; Guindon E, Perucic AM, & Boisclair D, 2003; Jha P et al., 2012; WHO, 2004).
Countries in the Pacific could do this in a staged manner by increasing excise rates by around 25%
per year over the next 3-5 years. It should, however, be noted that raising tobacco prices may result
in some smokers who are unable to afford manufactured cigarettes to opt for raw tobacco and
tobacco without filters. This should be an area of future applied research to inform future policy.
That is because there is no 'safe' level of tobacco use in any form - manufactured or loose - and
spending money on any tobacco product reduces the opportunity to purchase safe and useful goods
and                                                                                         services.


The Cook Islands and Tonga present good examples of what to do. The Minister of Finance of the
Cook Islands announced in 2012 an increase in the excise on tobacco of 33 per cent, to be repeated
over three years, thereby doubling the price of tobacco. Prudently, the new law also increases the
excise duty by 2% per year to prevent the real value of the tax eroding with inflation (Government of
the Cook Islands, 2012). Tonga has similarly embarked on a process of incrementally raising excise
rates so that it will reach 60% of the final price of cigarettes within 3 years, with the total tax burden
then reaching 75% of final price. This is estimated to raise an additional TOP 4.68 million or
approximately $2.5 million over the three years just from the excise duty increases alone. It is also
projected to reduce the number of daily smokers by 1660 people in Tonga and reduce the number of
deaths by 74. Tonga is also reducing the amount of duty free sales allowed per traveller to that
which applies in Australia: 50 g per person.

There are other examples from the Pacific to follow too (WHO and SPC, 2013a). For example, Tonga
is making schools, health facilities, and public restaurants tobacco free. The 2013 Tonga budget

Page | 99
includes a 15% increase in average price per pack in year one, a 15% increase in year two, and a 13%
increase in year three (WHO and SPC, 2013a). Palau recently approved the implementation of the
country’s first excise tax on tobacco products in 2014 ($3.50 USD per 0.017kg -equivalent to a 20-
pack of manufactured cigarettes) and has included a planned increase to $5.00 USD per 0.017kg in
2015. Some sports clubs in Vanuatu are declared tobacco free. Fiji has just opened its first tobacco-
free school grounds in Nadi. Solomon Islands and Samoa are implementing graphic health warnings
on tobacco products.

In considering the increase in duties on tobacco, it is very important for Pacific Islands to ensure
that the excise duty applies equally to both imports and domestically produced tobacco . That is
important so as to raise additional revenue for governments; reduce consumption; and to be
consistent with the obligations of the World Trade Organisation.

Other complementary action should also be considered to achieve a Tobacco Free Pacific by 2025.
The global target is to achieve a 25% reduction in NCDs by 2025 is to have a relative reduction of
30% in tobacco consumption by that year. However the Pacific goal is more ambitious: to achieve a
Tobacco Free Pacific 32 by 2025, which is a less than 5% tobacco use prevalence rate among adults.
(WHO and SPC, 2013a). To achieve that, Governments will need to take actions to complement the
required increases in excise duties. These complementary actions should include banning smoking in
workplaces, restaurants and public places; banning all tobacco advertising; offering smoking
cessation programs; enforcing existing legislation on tobacco sales; and encouraging increased levies
on life insurance policies for smokers. Countries will need to work with Departments of Agriculture
to ensure that local smallholder production of tobacco does not increase in response to the
increased price of manufactured tobacco, as initially happened in Tonga. Countries can consider the
introduction of plain packaging laws as Australia has done once current legal disputes have been
decided. Plain packaging of cigarettes appears to be effective in reducing consumption: there was a
78% increase in the number of calls to tobacco Quitline, peaking 4 weeks after the Australian
Government introduced plain packaging of cigarettes (Young J et al., 2014).

The tobacco industry can be expected to respond with some myths about tobacco taxes but
increased tobacco taxes do not hurt the poor, or employment, over the longer term, and
smuggling can be controlled in the Pacific. The tobacco industry can be expected to resist changes
that improve tobacco control (R. Moodie et al., 2013). Part of their argument may be that raising
tobacco taxes is ‘regressive’: having a larger impact on those with lower incomes than the rich. That
may be true in the very short term, but recent analysis finds that the poor, and the young, are more
likely to quit, or not commence, smoking as a result of a price increase than the rich. As a result, the
health benefits are actually ‘progressive’: benefitting the poor much more than the rich (Jha P et al.,
2012). Furthermore, revenue raised from tobacco taxation that was then spent by Government on
primary health care (or primary education) is likely to be ‘pro-poor’ and progressive,
disproportionately benefitting the poor.

The tobacco companies may also claim that increased taxes on tobacco will reduce employment and
income of local tobacco farmers and manufacturers. This is certainly possible in the short term and is
an important consideration for some countries with domestic producers and manufacturers of
tobacco. Raising tobacco taxes in a fixed, step wise, incremental approach, as the Cook Islands have

done provides a transition period for workers to find alternative employment. Governments should
also view with scepticism the self-interested assertions by tobacco companies about economic
losses: the agriculture land and manufacturing plants are not abandoned as a result of decreased
tobacco sales. Instead, they shift to other uses that almost always impose less health, social and
economic costs on society. Governments also reduce expenditure through their health system as a
result of averted strokes and heart attacks, benefits that can be seen within months of tobacco
consumption falling. The tobacco companies may also argue that raising the price of tobacco
encourages smuggling. This claim is usually overstated (Abedian I et al., 1998; WHO, 2010b). In any
event, Pacific Island countries have greater capacity to detect smuggling of tobacco than countries in
Asia and Africa with numerous road traffic routes on their porous borders.

Governments should communicate with the tobacco industry, but in a transparent way and not
permit ‘interference’ in policy making. Tobacco companies are reported to use ‘bullying’ and
intimidation under the guise of international trade negotiations (Glassman, 2013 ) to undermine or
limit actions to protect public health. Recent case studies in the Pacific indicate the likelihood of
‘tobacco industry interference’33 contrary to Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control in PNG and Solomon Islands. Examples include agreements on tobacco tax
restrictions between the Department of Finance and a tobacco company; a scholarship scheme
funded by a tobacco company for over ten years to support University of Papua New Guinea
students (Dulcie Oreke, 2012); and an agreement to allow the sale of “kiddi packs? (packs of less
than 20 cigarettes) in PNG (McCool J, 2013).




Taxes on alcohol


Latest research reconfirms that alcohol contributes to the burden of NCDs, as well as causing other
health and social problems. While modest alcohol consumption of red wine provides some
protective and health benefits in adults, larger consumption leads directly to a range of otherwise
preventable health costs. Together tobacco and alcohol—the second and third leading risk factors
for the global disease burden, respectively—cause nearly 12% of global disability-adjusted life-years
(R. Moodie et al., 2013). Parry and colleagues recent comprehensive survey of the evidence
concludes that: ‘There is a strong link between alcohol and non-communicable diseases, particularly
cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pancreatitis and diabetes, and these findings support
calls by the World Health Organization to implement evidence-based strategies to reduce harmful
use of alcohol’ (Parry et al., 2011).

Alcohol use varies across the Pacific, and between genders. Statistics collected from STEPS surveys
by SPC show that current alcohol use for men ranges from 95% of the adult population in Tokelau
through to 30% in the Marshall Islands. Female use of alcohol is consistently lower across the Pacific.

33
  McCool et al (2013) describe ‘tobacco industry interference’ as attempts to influence people in power,
providing advice to undermine effective legislation and policy, attempts to discredit reputable research,
investing in corporate social responsibility activities and attempting to undermine bans on advertising,
promotion of products (e.g., cross-border advertising

In Samoa, 80% of adult males and 47% of adult females use alcohol (SPC, 2011). The more recent
WHO STEPS survey in Vanuatu found that only 12% of males and 7% of females drank alcohol in the
preceding 30 days. Furthermore, 72% of women and 22% of males were “lifetime abstainers? of
alcohol. Excessive consumption of alcohol is acknowledged as a major contributing factor in
domestic violence(Tonga, 2010). An interesting examination of shipping manifests in Tokelau
concluded that around one quarter of the 2562 line items imported over the four years to April 2012
were alcoholic drinks (WHO, 2012b).

The Cook Islands provides a useful example of how to use price to capture some of the health and
social costs of alcohol abuse. Since 2009, all alcohol related consultations and admissions will carry
a charge regardless of patient category or age status. Alcohol related services incur a user fee of at
least 7 times that of non-alcohol related services, and can go as high as 100 times higher in the case
of alcohol related admissions to the high dependency inpatient units. The situation is summarised in
Table A:3:2 below. In the latest budget, the Government of the Cook Islands also increased levies on
alcohol by fifteen per cent, with the levies on low alcohol beers increased by five per cent
(Government of the Cook Islands, 2012).

It would be useful for other countries in the region to know more about the policy framing, and
program implications, of this innovative scheme. For example: how were the fee rates for alcohol
related services actually set? Do they fully cover the direct costs of medical treatment? Are the
additional fees collected in practice, and if so how much has been collected? Are there (subsidised)
services available for alcohol dependency? How do health personnel ensure that only abusers - and
not victims – of alcohol abuse such as spouses are charged the extra fees? Is there any evidence that
the higher user fees affect behaviour amongst high risk groups such as young males?


Taxes on unhealthy food and drinks products.


There is strong evidence to show that changing dietary habits is an important factor explaining the
rise of overweight and obesity in the Pacific. The World Bank study on the Economic Costs of NCDs
(World Bank, 2013a) summarised the situation as follows:

         Changing diets is an underlying risk factor in the Pacific. Diets in the Pacific have
         changed from predominantly root vegetables, coconuts and fresh fish to ones
         consisting of bread, rice, tinned fish, sugar and salt and, more recently, Asian
         packaged noodles. Certain imported foods also increased NCD risks. Coyne cites
         earlier studies showing people in Vanuatu “were 2.19 times more likely to be
         overweight and or obese and 1.94 times more likely to be diabetic if they used
         imported fat sources compared to traditional fat sources such as coconut?. A
         separate study examining the links between food availability, food prices, and
         obesity in Samoa found that total energy availability from food increased by 47%,
         with more than 900 extra calories available per capita per day between 1961 and
         2007. Mean Body Mass Index for men and women aged 35-44 also rose 18%
         between 1980 and 2010. Another study found modern diets, with high levels of
         processed foods, was significantly and positively associated with metabolic
         syndrome in Samoa, an underlying characteristic of cardiovascular disease and type
         2 diabetes. The WHO supported 2011 STEPS survey in Vanuatu found that 65% of
         women, and 58% of men, did not eat the recommended five portions of fruit and
         vegetables per day. Estimates collected by the SPC show the surprisingly low intake
         of fruit and vegetables in much of the Pacific, often exceeding 95% of the total
         adult population. Unfortunately, there appears to be little reliable public data on
         salt intake in the Pacific, despite the fact that salt intake is a potentially significant
         driver of hypertension.

           Changes in the prices of food, supplemented by policy and regulation, can have an impact on risk
           factors for NCDs. Faulkner and colleagues found ‘consistent evidence that weight outcomes are
                                              responsive to food and beverage prices. The debate on the use of
                                              food taxes and subsidies to address obesity should now shift to
                                              how best to address practical issues in designing such policies’
Sugar sweetened drinks and diabetes           (Faulkner et al., 2011). But to be effective these also need to be

drinking less than 1 sugar sweetened
drink per month’ (Malik et al., 2010)          Sugar sweetened drinks are a particular problem. Many foods
                                               can be unhealthy. Taxing or regulating a wide range of foods is
                                               likely to be administratively difficult and politically unpopular. But
                                               with diabetes and obesity rates amongst the highest in the world,
                                               the Pacific needs to address high risk foods and especially sugar
                    sweetened drinks. That is because there is ample scientific evidence to show that high
                    consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) is closely associated with increased risk of
                    weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (Basu et al., 2013; Hu & Malik, 2010;
                    Malik et al., 2010; Schulze et al., 2004; WHO, 2003a). That is mainly because the liquid form
                    of large sugar intake in the form of drinks puts a particularly large, sudden and ultimately
                    damaging load on metabolism. One large study found that individuals drinking 1 to 2 SSBs
                    per day had a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those drinking less than 1
                    SSB per month (Malik et al., 2010). SSBs are the largest source of added sugar in the US diet:
                    84% of adolescents and 63% of adults consume SSBs on any given day, with each standard
                    drink having nearly 7 teaspoons of sugar. (Hsiao A & Wang C, 2013). SSBs often displace
                    healthier drinks (water, milk) and foods. One analysis estimated that consumption of SSBs
                    added $82 billion in medical costs in the USA (Hsiao A & Wang C, 2013).

          Of particular relevance to the Pacific Islands is the recent findings by Basu and colleagues (Basu et
          al., 2013) that consumption of sugar is a major, independent, explanatory factor in the rise of type
          2 diabetes in low and middle income countries. Their study of 173 countries found that:

                  Each additional exposure to sugars and related sweeteners of 100 kJ/ person per day
                  was associated with a 2.8% rise in diabetes prevalence in a country, even after
                  accounting for other components of the diet such as oils and meats (P<0.001). The only
                  other dietary factor significantly correlated with diabetes prevalence was cereals
                  (P<0.01), which are also high in carbohydrates. Sedentary lifestyles and overweight
                  were also significant correlates to diabetes prevalence…..

                  Sugar remained a significant predictor of diabetes independent of these factors
                  (P<0.001). Notably, sugar correlated with prevalence of overweight more strongly than
                  did any other component of the diet (r=0.69)…..

                  Once the effects of sugar and related sweeteners are taken into account, the
                  correlations between diabetes and both rising incomes and urbanization statistically
                  disappear, indicating that sugar exposure may be an explanation for why urbanization
                  and rising incomes have been correlated with diabetes rates.

What information is available suggests the Pacific Islands are consuming large amounts of sugar,
including through sugar-sweetened drinks. It is difficult to find reliable, comparable, statistics
about consumption of sugar and sugar sweetened drinks in the Pacific. However a study of imported
shipping manifests in Tokelau (WHO, 2012b) provides one intriguing insight into the situation:

     In the 2008 to 2012 study period 314 000 kg of soft drink were imported into Tokelau. In
     the study period a total of 32 000 kg of sugar were imported into Tokelau in the form of
     soft drinks. In 2012 the amount of sugar imported in sugary drinks was equivalent to 6
     kg/day. This is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar a day for every resident of Tokelau. In
     2008 the daily sugar was 6 teaspoons each. This dramatic reduction is commendable
     and progress to zero importation of sugary drinks should be encouraged. Apart from
     obesity, sugary drinks are damaging to teeth and also contribute a large amount of non-
     recyclable/non-biodegradable waste to the local environment. The total recorded
     weight of beverages (gross weight: packaging plus liquid portion) imported was 353 000
     kg. The relative quantity, by weight, of fruit and vegetables imported was low. A total of
     15 000 kg of fruit and 110 000 kg of vegetables were imported over 47 months.

Not surprisingly, Governments are therefore using – or considering - taxation measures to reduce
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) for health reasons. Brazil, Chile, France,
Hungary, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand impose taxes on SSB to reduce obesity and improve health
(Jou & Techakehakij, 2012). Within the Pacific, taxes on SSB are or have been applied in Cook Islands,
Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, and Tonga. Taxing unhealthy food and drinks is clearly a key policy option
already identified in the Pacific: 43% of all the policy recommendations34 to promote a healthy food
environment arising from stakeholder workshops in the Fiji and Tonga focused on changing the
prices of food and drinks (Snowdon et al., 2010). The Cook Islands has recently increased excise
duties on imported (but not locally produced) SSBs. This was clearly designed as a health measure to
confront NCDs, as can be seen from the Budget statement at the time:

      Increased consumption of sugar is a major contributor to obesity and other non
      communicable diseases which are now emerging as the single biggest public health
      challenge facing the Cook Islands over the medium term. The average soft drink
      contains thirty six grams of sugar or ten teaspoons inside one can of soft drink. The
      current levies on sweetened drinks will be increased by fifteen per cent from 1 August
      2012 and increased by two per cent per annum from 1 July 2013 to maintain the real
      value of the levy. This will increase the average price of a soft drink can by around
      twenty five cent will apply to imported fizzy drinks and not to locally manufactured
      products, so go local. (Government of the Cook Islands, 2012)

Yet there is still somewhat mixed – or even missing – evidence about the ultimate effectiveness of
taxing food, and especially SSBs, on obesity and NCDs. All of the international peer reviewed
literature consulted for this report noted that the quality of evidence linking taxes on food to health
outcomes is generally low, often involving computer modelling and assumptions. Almost all studies
were conducted in high income countries which may not be applicable in low and middle income
countries.

34
 Increasing access and availability of locally produced health food was next (19%) and better control of
marketing of unhealthy products was next after that (16%).

There are good peer reviewed studies that conclude taxing sugar sweetened beverages reduces
consumption, and even obesity, and raises additional tax revenue. One high profile study
estimated that a 20% tax on sugar sweetened beverages would reduce the number of obese adults
in the UK by around 180,000 people (1.3%) and reduce the number of overweight adults by around
285,000 (0.9%). The tax would also generate an estimated £260 million ($ 418 million) additional
revenue to the Government per year. Most of the benefits would occur amongst younger people,
with little differences between income groups (Briggs A et al., 2013). Another study in Norway
estimated that doubling production taxes and VAT would increase soft drink prices by 27% and this
would reduce average consumption by 44% in heavy soft drink consumers and by 17% in light
consumers. Modelling suggested that a 10% excise tax on soft drinks in the USA would reduce per
capita consumption by 23 litres per year, equivalent to 1.4 kg decrease in body weight. (Thow AM,
Jan S, et al., 2010). Another modelling study estimated that a nationwide penny-per-ounce tax in
the USA “would reduce consumption by 15 %, averting 95,000 coronary heart events, 8000 strokes,
and 26,000 premature deaths over a decade—amounting to healthcare cost savings of $17.1 billion
over 10 years?(Hsiao A & Wang C, 2013). The authors note the societal gains would be even greater
if the $13 billion in tax revenues so generated went to prevention, healthcare or nutrition education.

One study noted a rapid reduction in health care costs, but those savings reducing in later years as
people survived into older age brackets. Modelling for the Australian context found that taxes on
SSBs, with or without subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables, resulted in reduced energy
consumption and BMI, and ‘sustained reductions in the incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and several cancers’. Furthermore ‘total health care costs initially decreased rapidly but stabilised
after 10-15 years, after which the savings reduced in magnitude (due to more people surviving and
requiring health care’(Veerman L, Sacks G, Antonopoulos N, & J., 2012)

But there are also sceptics: at the very least, taxing sugar-sweetened drinks for health reasons
requires careful targeting, management, and monitoring to be effective. One recent study notes
that three factors will determine the effectiveness of a volume based excise tax on SSB in promoting
health: population obesity prevalence; soft drink consumption levels; and existing baseline tax
rates(Jou & Techakehakij, 2012). In essence, taxes on SSB are only effective where the prevalence
and risk of obesity is high, that soft drink consumption is widespread amongst those at risk, and that
existing taxes on SSBs are low. Other analysts are sceptical that a tax on SSBs is effective as a tool in
promoting health under almost any circumstances. For example a recent report (Winkler JT, 2012) in
the British Journal of Nutrition identified several reasons why taxes on soft drinks will not work. First,
it assumes the tax will be translated into price increases. But soft drinks operate in a lucrative and
competitive market where discounting and price promotions are common. Producers may sell the
drinks in larger bottles, or substitute artificial sweeteners for any tax on sugar to absorb or conceal
the price increase. Second, even if the price did increase, consumers may maintain consumption: “if
consumers are (already) willing to pay 950% extra for a brand (Coke) they prefer (compared to the
lowest priced cola drink) they are unlikely to be changed by a 10% tax?. Third, and unlike tobacco,
there are ready alternative substitutes for accessing sugar based products. A tax on sugar sweetened




Page | 106
drinks may see a shift to fruit juices, but they have high sugar contents too35. Fourth, politicians do
not like imposing new taxes, and consumers do not like being ‘told’ what to eat or drink.

One clear finding is that political economy factors need to be understood and managed: the pain is
now, the gain is later. The UK study that modelled a 20% tax on SSB noted that most of the
reduction in obesity and overweight occurred amongst those aged under 30 years. The study went
on to note that “Although improving the health of younger people has the potential to offer lifelong
health gains, the complications of obesity typically present in later life, so savings to the health
service are unlikely to be realised in the shorter term? (Briggs A et al., 2013). Denmark repealed its
tax on saturated fats one year after introducing it for health reasons. They did so due to political
opposition from farmers, producers and consumers, and in recognition that citizens were crossing
the border to Germany to purchase products. Denmark then shelved proposals to introduce a sugar
tax (Stafford N, 2012). Mayor Bloomberg sought to ban increasingly large (greater than 16 oz) sugary
drinks in restaurants in New York for health reasons, partly in recognition that consumers tend to
accept and consume larger portion sizes irrespective of appetite or taste. However the ban was
overruled, based partly on the grounds that the ban would apply to restaurants but not convenience
stores and so was unfair. The US Congress was proposing a 10% SSB tax which would then fund
health care, but the soft drink industry spent $40.7 million in lobbying (increased from $2.8 million in
2006) which was part of the reason for the proposed tax being dropped (Hsiao A & Wang C, 2013).
The President of Mexico is seeking an additional tax on SSBs but is facing opposition from soft drink
companies (The Economist, 2013)

There are practical lessons to learn from the Pacific’s own experience, including managing the
politics and institutional incentives. Thow and colleagues (Thow et al., 2011) undertook a
comparative analysis of the experiences of applying four different taxes on soft drinks in Fiji, Samoa,
Nauru and French Polynesia. Table A 3:3 below summarises the tax level and corresponding amount
of revenue raised.

Their main policy conclusions include:

       Taxes are generally higher in countries (eg Nauru) where there is a clear and explicit goal of
        promoting health and / or directing funds to obesity prevention. This is probably because it
        improves public support for the tax.
       Taxes were lower – and did not last in Fiji – when they were imposed for purely revenue
        raising measures. Domestic lobbying from manufacturers led to the removal of the excise
        tax.
       It was important to use existing legislative mechanisms such as import taxes and excise
        duties as this minimised administrative costs compared to introducing a completely new
        instrument.
       Institutional incentives are important. Allocating tax revenues on unhealthy products to a
        health promotion fund may increase public support for the tax. However incentives to
        collect the tax may be then diluted. In Fiji, Samoa and Nauru the Ministry of Finance
        collected the additional taxes where it contributed to the general government budget (an
        issue of direct institutional interest to those Ministries of Finance). In French Polynesia the
        revenue was originally earmarked for a health prevention fund, but the next Government
        diverted the majority of the tax revenue to the general budget.



Taxing food and drink products to reduce NCDs can therefore be a complex challenge, but clear
conclusions and ‘good practice’ strategies can be identified. Those conclusions and ‘good practice’
strategies can be summarised as follows:

    o   In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction

    o   But they generally have to be large to have an effect.

    o   And they need to be backed up with clear health messages, not just price signals

    o   The type of tax is important. A sales tax at the checkout is a weak disincentive: consumers
        have already decided to buy the item. An excise duty or similar tax is better as it is applies to
        local production and imports and is therefore incorporated in the retail price on the shelf. A
        tax based on price might lead to bulk buying: a tax based on volume is generally more
        effective in switching purchases from unhealthy foods.

    o   It is important to capture like products with a tax, rather than a single product, otherwise
        consumers will simply switch from one unhealthy product to another.

    o   Taxes on food and drink products are not necessarily regressive amongst the young and poor
        over the medium term, because low income households and the young reduce their
        consumption of the now higher priced goods more than wealthier households and adults
        (Thow AM, Jan S, et al., 2010)

Salt


Salt is an important contributor to cardiovascular disease – the leading cause of death in the
Pacific. The Fifth Pacific NCD Forum held in Auckland 23-26 September 2013 noted that:

       Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the Pacific. Elevated blood
       pressure has been shown to be positively linked to stroke and heart disease and to
       multiple end-organ complications. There is a direct relationship between salt intake and
       blood pressure and evidence shows that reducing salt intake reduces blood pressure and
       the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke. Reducing salt intake has been identified as
       one of the most cost-effective interventions to prevent and control NCDs. In May 2013,
       the World Health Assembly agreed a set of targets for NCDs including a 30% relative
       reduction in population salt intake by 2025. For countries in the Pacific to achieve this
       target, action on salt reduction needs to be scaled up and integrated into broader food
       and nutrition security policies and plans

There are cost-effective interventions to reduce salt intake that do not necessarily rely on
taxation or other measures. Salt is different to other unhealthy products such as tobacco. A
minimal level of salt is required for good health: WHO recommends a reduction of salt intake
to less than 5g/person/day which corresponds to approximately 2000 mg of sodium certain
amount of salt. Iodised salt is one important public health approach to reduce iodine
deficiency and preventable reductions in IQ. Salt is also different to other unhealthy products
like tobacco and sugar sweetened products because reductions in overall salt intake can occur
without requiring changes in individual behaviour. That is because much of the excess salt load
comes processed foods: changes in industry standards can be made cost-effectively at a
population based level.

A range of multi-sectoral initiatives have already been identified for the Pacific: better
monitoring of salt intake; increased collaboration with / regulation of the food processing
industry; and improved public awareness are key strategies. Several policy and programming
actions have already been identified for reducing salt intake in the Pacific (WHO and SPC,
2013b). Key amongst those strategies are better monitoring of salt intake (to understand
levels, trends and progress); increased collaboration / regulation of the food processing
industry (to reduce salt loads in foods commonly consumed) and improved public awareness
(so that consumers understand the risks of excessive salt intake.

Transfats


Transfats - an unhealthy product - have been found in high quantities in some locally produced
foods in the Pacific. Transfats, or trans fatty acids, are essentially liquid oils that have been turned
into solid fats, thereby increasing the shelf life of products such as cakes, pastries and pizza. They are
associated with plaque and raised LDL (“bad?) cholesterol and risk of heart disease, breast cancer,
prostrate cancer and diabetes type 2 insulin resistance. A recent analysis found that 60 of 64 food


Page | 109
samples in Fiji contained more than 2% transfats per 100gram of fat, the maximum threshold level
used in Denmark which has a legal limit for transfats. Importantly, three samples contained more
than 20% transfats per 100g of fat. Locally produced and commonly consumed pizza had 18.85%
transfats per 100g fat: well above the 2% threshold in Denmark (Chand B et al., 2011).

The USA is currently considering banning the addition of artificial transfats in food, preventing an
estimated 20,000 heart attacks and 7000 deaths from heart disease every year in the USA. Artificial
transfats occur when vegetable oil are treated with hydrogen to extend the shelf life and improve
the texture of certain food products including frozen pizzas, cakes, coffee creamers. Their use in
food products is associated with cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) announced (US FDA, 2013) on 7 November 2013 its preliminary determination that partially
hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the primary dietary source of artificial transfats in processed foods, are
not “generally recognized as safe? for use in food. If the FDA finalizes its preliminary determination,
PHOs would be considered “food additives? and could not be used in food unless authorized by
regulation. The FDA estimates that further reduction in the amount of trans fat in the American diet
could prevent an additional 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease each year.

Imported products from the USA would cease to have artificial transfats but imports from other
countries could still have them and domestic producers could still use them. The Pacific Islands
market is too small to expect global producers to label or ban transfats from exports to the region.
But it is reasonable for the Pacific to test certain imported and domestic products and consider what
action to take in the light of associated risks. Pacific countries can also require local food
manufactures not to use artificial transfats in their own production. This would require consultation
with industry, and then regulation to ensure compliance. Banning all transfats is not feasible as some
small level of natural transfats occurs in meat and dairy products.

Annex 9 Specific actions within the health sector.



While the underlying causes of NCDs, including lifestyle choices, lie outside the health system, most
of the direct costs and interventions occur within the health system. And while a multi-sectoral
approach is essential to address the social determinants of NCDs, it is also clear that Ministries of
Health will have to play a major and strategic role in preventing, and treating, NCDs. This section of
the report therefore addresses what needs to be done in the health sector. It is clear, however, that
actions in the health sector will also have direct and indirect interactions with other Ministries –
especially the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of Trade
– as well as development partners, the private sector and civil society.

Actions at the broad strategic level in the health sector with strong
economic underpinnings.


Whole of sector, rather than a disease specific or ‘vertical’ approach



The ‘crisis’ in NCDs is a key priority, but it still needs to be seen as part of the health sectors
broader mandate, as there is an unfinished agenda of communicable diseases to address, and
broader health system strengthening is a remaining challenge. It would be a mistake to treat NCDs
as a ‘vertical disease’ drawing resources and management attention away from other important
priorities. These other priorities include the unfinished agenda of addressing communicable,
maternal, neonatal and nutritional conditions which typically still account for between 20% and 25%
of all deaths in the Pacific. Similarly, it would be a mistake and a lost opportunity if the legitimate
focus on NCDs took a vertical or disease specific approach to such an extent that it failed to help
foster much needed broader health system strengthening, including information management and
broader health workforce training.

Key financing and resource allocation issues



There are some key financing and resource allocation issues that need to be addressed in the
health sector as a whole, not just with respect to NCDs. Several recent reports have demonstrated
that Pacific Island countries need to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and financial
sustainability of health financing (World Bank, 2010, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). There are several
common themes that arise from these reports that are directly relevant to addressing the NCD crisis,
as well as the broader health sector. These common themes are summarised below:

      The need for improved efficiency. Governments in the Pacific do not have the current
      financial resources (‘fiscal space’) or future prospects for economic growth to devote
      large increases to the health sector. It is important for Ministries to therefore make
      better use of what resources they do have, as a basis for then seeking additional and

Page | 111
      needed resources. WHO finds that, globally, there are ten leading causes of
      inefficiency36 that, if addressed, could free up between 20% to 40% of all health
      spending (WHO, 2010c).

      Focus on prevention and front line services. Effective primary and secondary prevention
      generally saves – or at least defers – subsequent larger expenditure when complications
      arise and hospital treatment is required. Every person in Vanuatu who changes their
      lifestyle through primary prevention, and successfully avoids becoming a newly
      diagnosed Type 2 diabetes patient, saves the government a minimum of $ 347 per year:
      more than twice the annual per capita government expenditure on health. Effective
      secondary prevention also has high pay-off to government. Every diagnosed Type 2
      diabetes patient in Vanuatu who is stabilised through secondary prevention, and so
      avoids progressing to an insulin regime, then saves the government an additional $484
      per year over the cost of an oral medication regime (World Bank, 2013a). While most
      countries put emphasis on the prevention in public statements, there is a disconnect
      when it comes to actual resource allocation. For example in Samoa per capita
      expenditure on total inpatient curative care, including overseas treatment, was recently
      over one hundred times more than per capita expenditure on prevention of NCDs, and
      almost eighty times what was spent per capita on maternal and child health and family
      planning in Samoa. Even per capita expenditure on traditional health care was more
      than seven times that which was spent on prevention of NCDs (World Bank, 2013c).


      Strengthen public financial management. Slow release of funds, under and over
      expenditure, under-investment in maintenance of key assets, weak procurement and
      reporting practices all demonstrate that available resources are not being managed well
      to achieve the necessary health results, and this undermines the confidence of the
      Ministry of Finance (and development partners) to allocate additional needed funds to
      the sector.


      Invest in data analysis, and impact evaluation. Countries cannot afford to have scarce
      financial and other resources wasted on ineffective interventions and practices. Not one
      Pacific country currently has accurate, population- based information on the number of
      deaths or causes of death. Few interventions are assessed for effectiveness, impact, or
      cost (an ongoing study on cost-effectiveness of salt reducing interventions being one
      welcome exception). Some interventions are based on intuitively appealing reasoning
      but may not be cost-effective. For example, many countries in the Pacific
      understandably wish to invest in health promotion foundations/agencies. But without
      good impact evaluation, even this strategy could lead to waste of scarce resources. A
      recent rigorous analysis in Australia found that $ 130 million equivalent per year spent

36
  The ten leading causes of inefficiency identified by WHO include: purchasing practices for medicines (under-
use of generics; use of substandard or counterfeit medicines; irrational prescribing policies); misaligned
incentives (fee for service payments); management practices (medical errors, costly staffing mixes); and poor
investment decisions (hospital size; technology choices).

      on healthy lifestyle messages offered ‘extremely poor value for money’ and had only a
      ‘trivial’ effect on reducing heart disease, whereas ‘best value for money is achieved by
      mandating moderate limits on salt in the manufacture of bread, margarine and cereal’
      (Cobiac L et al., 2012). A study of chronically ill Pacific Islanders living with NCDs in Fiji,
      Nauru and Kiribati found that there was a distinct ‘a lack of interest in conventional
      public health educational methods including printed material and public lectures’ about
      stress, physical activity, nutrition and health responsibility (Szmedra P et al., 2009).

      Take hard decisions: avoid high cost interventions with poor outcomes. The estimated
      average total cost of dialysis for patients with diabetes related kidney failure to the
      Government of Samoa was $ 38,686 per patient per year in 2010/11. While less than
      the previous approach of sending patients to New Zealand, the cost to Government was
      still more than twelve times the Gross National Income of Samoa. The cost-effectiveness
      of dialysis is further undermined by the fact that almost two thirds have died two years
      after commencing treatment (World Bank, 2013a). Studies in the USA suggest that
      ‘futile care’ (medical interventions with virtually no chance of successful outcomes and
      which postpone death by a few weeks rather than save lives) costs around $ 4000 per
      day (Wenger N, 2013). While no patient should suffer pain, and palliative care is an
      important option, there are ethical as well as economic issues involved when scarce
      resources are allocated to ‘futile care’ when other priority health needs are left
      unfunded (Murray K, 2011). Investing in maternal health and girls’ nutrition is one area
      often under-funded, but which can have large, long term, inter-generational benefits in
      terms of reducing NCD risk and other adverse health factors (Barker D, 1990; Bhutta,
      2013; Black et al., 2013; Gillman et al., 2003; Victora et al., 2008; R. C. Whitaker & Dietz,
      1998)



Actions within the health sector specifically related to NCD control with
strong economic underpinnings


Scale up of Crisis Response Package and the Package of Essential NCD (PEN)
interventions



Pacific Island countries should continue to implement and scale up the Crisis Response Package,
including the Package of Essential NCD (PEN) interventions. That is because that approach has the
potential to improve diagnosis and treatment at the primary care setting, in a low-tech environment,
thereby saving - and better targeting - scarce resources. The approach recognises that lower middle
income countries do not have the financial and other resources to screen and treat each individual
NCD and risk factor separately. Instead, there are public health and economic benefits in identifying
and treating high risk groups in the population, many of whom have multiple risks. The simple colour
coded chart developed by WHO and the International Society of Hypertension (ISH) enables the
identification and targeting of high risk people in resource poor settings without the need for

Page | 113
laboratory testing. Earlier diagnosis and treatment, especially at primary care settings, through use
of basic screening and, where needed, medications has the potential to avert much larger efforts at
curative treatment at hospitals. Chart 2.1 below summarises the state of progress in rolling out the
Crisis Response Package and PEN as at September 2013.

In scaling up PEN, countries should compare the additional costs of using laboratory based testing
to the additional diagnostic benefits. The PEN has been deliberately designed to be an effective,
feasible, and affordable approach to NCD prevention and control in developing countries. It should
therefore form the basis of strategic resource allocations and programs in the Pacific. Importantly,
recent analysis suggests the PEN approach can be simplified even further in low resource settings to
reduce costs, with little if any loss of diagnostic power. More specifically, the additional cost (and
human resource requirements) of laboratory based testing of cholesterol did not seem warranted in
such settings. Instead, chart based assessments of overall risk factors for cardiovascular disease

Page | 114
(such as age, gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, reported diabetes status, and BMI)
appeared to have similarly strong diagnostic and predictive powers at reduced cost to the public
health system (Gaziano, Young, Fitzmaurice, Atwood, & Gaziano, 2008; Otgontuya D, Oum S, Buckley
B, & R., 2013; Pandya A, Weinstein M, & Gaziano T, 2011). Such trials demonstrate the importance
of monitoring, experimentation and impact evaluation: the subject of the next section.


Monitoring, experimentation, and impact evaluation



Pacific Island countries, supported by development partners, should more systematically capture
the costs and lessons of the roll out, and share those insights with others in the region. Most
countries in the Pacific are undertaking the same roll out and scaling up of the NCD crisis response
package and PEN at roughly the same time. There are therefore important lessons and synergies to
be identified, especially since the roll out can be relatively expensive. A well conducted study by the
Cook Islands estimated the total cost of introducing PEN over the next five years ranged between
$NZ 900,000 and $NZ 4,036,795 ($NZ 12 per capita and $NZ 54 per capita respectively) depending
upon whether a ‘pragmatic’ or an ‘ideal’ implementation program was chosen (WHO, 2013c). Fiji has
also commissioned an independent study of the cost of scaling up PEN. Independent studies such as
these should be able to provide valuable insights and lessons to all countries in the region. Relevant
policy questions that could be asked in future such studies could include: do unit costs of medical
supplies rise under the roll out (because they are being shipped to more remote islands) or do unit
prices actually fall (because of economies of scale and purchasing in bulk)? Does cost-effectiveness
rise in more remote areas (because health burdens are higher, more than offsetting the additional
cost of shipping items to more sparsely populated and remote islands)? What are the most
significant drivers of recurrent cost and maintenance of PEN equipment? What innovations did other
countries do to reduce costs?



Pharmaceutical prices


There are strategic benefits in Pacific Island countries identifying the reasons for large variations in
the price of identical pharmaceutical products in the region. As seen in Chart 2.2 below, the Cook
Islands, Kiribati and Niue are able to purchase generic simvastatin to reduce cholesterol at less than
5 cents per 20 mg tablet. However Micronesia is paying five times that (25 cents per tablet) and
Nauru is paying more than ten times that (56 cents per tablet). It is important to understand why
those large differences occur and then identify ways of reducing costs for those that appear to be
paying higher prices. (Regional procurement of pharmaceuticals is, in theory, an option but has not
worked well in the past because some countries did not pay their share of the bills).

Health Promotion activities or health promotion foundations?

Ministries of Health need to distinguish between health promotion and a health Foundation and
evaluate program effectiveness carefully. Health promotion is important, and something that
extends well beyond the formal health sector: principles formally recognised in the Ottawa Charter
for Health Promotion in 1986 (World Health Organization, 2014). Health promotion goes well
beyond simply raising ‘awareness’ if risky behaviours (smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyles;
unhealthy eating) are to change. As noted by Cobiac, the $ 130 million per year was spent in
Australia on promoting healthy lifestyles but rigorous evaluation found this had only a “trivial? effect
on behaviour. Raising “awareness? about risk factors is important but unlikely to lead to any
significant or sustained behaviour change. By itself, general health promotion activities could
therefore be a waste of money. Ministries also need to decide how to implement effective health
promotion campaigns. Having a dedicated health promotion foundation may be a good option. That
is because a dedicated health promotion foundation could have clarity of purpose and be able to
focus on specialised tasks as well as coordinating others. Having a specialised Foundation might also
help to quarantine and protect funding support for health promotion activities. On the other hand,
having a separate health promotion foundation might simply be a bureaucratic duplication of
activities that could and should have been done much more cheaply and effectively in the primary
health care setting.

Whatever approach is taken, the difficulties in changing lifestyle behaviours means that program
effectiveness must be regularly and rigorously tested. A recent study found that, once again,
healthy lifestyles based on five criteria - non-smoking, an acceptable BMI, a high fruit and vegetable
intake, regular physical activity, and low/moderate alcohol intake - are associated with reductions in
the incidence of certain chronic diseases. Men who followed four or five of the behaviours had an

Page | 116
odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for diabetes, corrected for age and social class, of 0.50
(95% CI: 0.19, 1.31). For vascular disease the OR was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.84) and there was a delay
in vascular disease events of up to 12 years. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle also was associated with
reduced dementia and cognitive impairment. However the worrying part of the study was that ‘the
adoption of a healthy lifestyle by men was low and appears not to have changed during the
subsequent 30 years, with under 1% of men following all five of the behaviours and 5% reporting
four or more in 1979 and in 2009’ (Elwood P et al., 2013). The finding that less than 1% of men in the
UK study (n=2,235) had adopted all five healthy lifestyles, and had not changed over 30 years,
indicates the challenges and need for urgent, purposeful, action.

Other less compelling options: user fees, ‘earmarking’ and social health insurance


There are some other options available to Ministries of health that have the potential to raise
additional revenue, but where the economic rationale is much less compelling. For example, user
fees have the potential to raise additional revenues for Government. They can help improve the
efficiency of the referral system by charging extra prices for those people bypassing the primary
health care setting for non-emergency treatments. They are a useful and rationale way of limiting
trivial cosmetic surgery. User fees can, if large enough and applied consistently, also send important
and desirable price signals to society about the true economic cost of adverse personal behaviour:
the Cook Islands sends useful price signals to society by charging large extra user medical fees to
those who abuse alcohol. But user fees also have significant disadvantages from an economic
perspective. User fees are an additional barrier to accessing health care. Despite exemptions and
efforts at targeting user fees often fall, in practice, on the poor most in need of health care but least
able to afford additional expenditure (Lagarde M & Palmer N, 2008; R. Yates, 2009). There are staff
and other costs in collecting and managing user fees. Where user fees do generate additional net
revenues, Ministries of Finance may be tempted to reduce overall budget allocations to the health
sector.

There are obvious political advantages in earmarking and reallocating additional revenue from
‘health taxes’ to the health sector, including health promotion. Linking increased taxes on tobacco
and alcohol to increased public expenditure on health emphasises the adverse health impacts of
those products. Politicians can emphasise this link to steer through potentially unpopular tax
increases. The Philippines Congress eventually passed tax increases on tobacco and alcohol in the
face of strong industry resistance partly because the vast bulk of the additional revenue would be
used – and would be seen to be used – in scaling up Universal Health Care in the Philippines. At least
29 countries around the world now use some or all of the additional revenue from increased taxes
on tobacco and alcohol to fund health activities (WHO, 2013a). Thailand for example earmarks 2% of
tobacco and alcohol excise to fund health promotion activities and Tuvalu allocates 2 cents per
cigarette to tobacco control.

The economic disadvantages of earmarking are less obvious. Government revenue is always scarce,
especially in the Pacific. But Government revenue is also ‘fully fungible’, meaning any additional
revenue generated can and should be transferred to the central government pool of available
resources and then allocated to whatever purpose generates the highest impact, irrespective of
sector. Allocating any additional revenue to girls’ education, rural road maintenance, port


Page | 117
development, electricity generation or even reducing national debt may have an even higher
development impact than funding health programs, important as they are. Importantly, however, it
may be that for some Pacific Island countries, reduction of NCD risk factors such as tobacco
consumption might actually be the single most important development priority that country faces.
In that case, sending additional revenue generated from tobacco taxes to the central revenue pool
ends up, in practice, being then spent on NCD prevention and control anyway because that was the
highest national development priority. At a practical level, simply allocating earmarked additional
revenue from tobacco taxes to the health sector may also result, in practice, a corresponding
reduction in general budget allocations from the Ministry of Finance.

It should be noted that earmarking is very much a secondary issue: the first order of priority is to
raise (and maintain) the real prices on tobacco so as to discourage consumption of an addictive
substance that kills two-thirds of its users, and undermines the health and wealth of the already
poor. The poor, and young, are particularly sensitive to price increases so raising (and maintaining)
the excise duty on tobacco is a worthwhile and sufficient objective in its own right. Whether or not
to ‘earmark’ then becomes very much as secondary and less important issue. It is something best
decided within the political system of each country, taking into account the best alternative uses for
the additional revenue generated by taxes on tobacco.

Introduction of Social Health Insurance is most unlikely to generate additional financial resources
and is not appropriate for the Pacific at this stage. Some countries in the Pacific have considered
Social Health Insurance, usually in the form of compulsory additional surcharges on formal sector
wages supplemented by Government subsidies to the rest of society, as a means of generating
additional financial resources. Several recent studies find this is not an economically viable option
for the Pacific Island countries given their current stage of development (World Bank, 2010, 2012,
2013a, 2013c).

Annex 10: Draft template for Country Roadmap

The following is an illustrative example of what a Country Roadmap might look like. All Pacific Island Forum countries would be invited to complete the
template for the four key priority areas listed in the left hand column: strengthen tobacco control; reduce consumption of unhealthy food and drink;
improve efficiency of existing health expenditure; strengthen the evidence base to ensure resources are used well. Specific activities under those four
strategic priorities would depend upon country circumstances. (The examples in this matrix for years 2014 – 2015 are purely illustrative examples: countries
would identify other examples that are key challenges for them). All Pacific Island Forum countries would also be invited to then choose additional
interventions that address that country’s specific needs and capacities. Those additional country specific interventions would be selected from the menu of
over 30 other options available in Annex 6.

Annex 11: Some common myths about NCD prevention and control

Some interventions – such as food manufacturers replacing trans-fats from food products with
healthier alternatives – are relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. Consumers may not even
notice the difference, except that risks of heart disease have diminished significantly. On the other
hand, raising prices on tobacco products, alcohol, and unhealthy food and sugar sweetened drinks
will be quickly noticed by consumers and producers. Consumers may be willing to accept the price
rises if they are accompanied with clear and consistent messages about the health benefits to
themselves by reducing consumption of harmful products. Producers, importers and retailers may
have legitimate concerns. But they may also have spurious and self-interested motives to undermine
good public policy. It is important to be aware of some of the myths that vested interests use to
block reform.



       Myth: raising tobacco prices particularly hurts the poor, and the broader economy. Fact:
        smoking hurts the poor more, as they have less money to buy good things, and are less able
        to deal with the ill health caused by smoking. The poor are more likely to quit smoking than
        the rich after a price rise, so it is often not ‘regressive’ (hurting the poor more) over the
        medium term. Indeed, the poor tend to benefit most in terms of improved health from a tax
        increase on tobacco (Jha P et al., 2012). While it is true there may be some initial loss of
        employment in local tobacco companies, especially where small economies have limited
        other manufacturing industries. However it is important to recognise other offsetting
        factors: household expenditure on tobacco does not simply disappear when smokers quit:
        the money is spent on other goods and services (virtually all of which will be healthier than
        smoking tobacco) or is saved. Government medical and other health costs will go down,
        often within months, as a result of reduced incidence of tobacco induced stroke, thereby
        freeing up money that can be spent on other goods and services that generate other jobs.
        Agricultural land used for tobacco consumption does not simply fall vacant: it can be used
        for other purposes. Smuggling can be an issue in some countries, but is more able to be
        controlled in island economies than in parts of Asia with highly porous land borders.

       Myth: NCDs including obesity and diabetes are just the natural state of affairs in much of the
        Pacific, and nothing can be done about it. Fact: evidence shows that diabetes and other
        NCDs were virtually unknown in the Pacific less than 100 years ago. Smoking, Nutrition,
        Alcohol and Physical inactivity (‘SNAP’) are the main causes of NCDs and they can be
        modified by policy and taxes.

       Myth: international trade agreements prevent the Pacific from taking action that would
        restrict imports of unhealthy food and drinks. Fact: Trade negotiations certainly involve
        tough bargaining. Unhappy experiences with efforts to control imports of unhealthy
        products do not tell the whole story. Regional trade agreements, as distinct from
        multilateral rules based trade agreements, may involve the reality, or the perception, of
        unequal bargaining power (Friel S et al., 2013). Nevertheless, countries can still restrict


Page | 125
        imports of unhealthy products, but need to do so in a non-discriminatory way that does not
        give special advantages to local producers or favoured trading partners. A renewed interest
        in “Aid for Trade? provides countries with an opportunity to increase fruit and vegetable
        production and exports (Thow AM & S., 2013)

       Myth: NCDs have already taken hold in the Pacific: there is little that can be done to reduce
        the health burden or the costs. Fact: NCDs, and the risk factors of smoking, obesity,
        inactivity are indeed common in the Pacific. But targeted prevention and treatment can
        reduce, or at least postpone, their effects.

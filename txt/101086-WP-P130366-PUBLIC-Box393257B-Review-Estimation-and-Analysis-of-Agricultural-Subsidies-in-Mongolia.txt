Foreword
The use of indiscriminate agricultural subsidies can lead to high financial and welfare costs,
economic inefficiency, skewed resource allocation, trade distortions, and reduced
competitiveness. On the other hand, used as judicious strategic policy instruments, smart
subsidies can lead to desired socio-economic, food security, and developmental impacts for both
targeted groups and for society at large. In Mongolia, direct government budgetary transfers to
the agriculture sector have increased significantly over time, primarily through the Crop
Protection Fund, Livestock Conservation Fund, and Small and Medium Enterprises Development
Fund. However, there is a lack of reliable figures of total producer support estimates (PSE) that
take into account the direct transfers to primary agriculture plus indirect support (or taxation) by
way of the implicit market price support.
This study was undertaken to develop a source of reliable information with which to monitor
public expenditures on agricultural subsidies in Mongolia and to inform a strategy for improving
the effectiveness of these subsidies. It was carried out by the World Bank in collaboration with
partners in the Mongolian Government, primarily the Strategy Planning and Policy Department
of the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, as well as the Ministry of Finance, the National
Statistics Office, and a number of other Government agencies.
Following the global food prices crisis in 2008/09, and a sustained decline in agricultural
production from the mid-1980s to 2007, especially that of wheat, the Government of Mongolia
undertook some major food security and agriculture-livestock development policy initiatives. In
September 2011, the Bank was invited to a workshop by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and
Light Industries to discuss global agricultural trends, policies, and impacts of high food prices.
The Policy and Strategy Department then requested the Bank’s help in analysing the country’s
current policy framework, in particular, the agricultural subsidy programs. The work led to this
report, which the reader should find useful for reflection, research, and program design.
The results of this study show that even though the government budgetary transfers to primary
agriculture have increased over the selected five year period (2008 to 2012), total producer
support has not. This indicates that the budgetary support, especially during 2011 and 2012,
basically went to compensate farmers for the lower domestic market prices vis-à-vis international
prices. The main message of the study is that given the variety of subsidy programs in place, it is
extremely important that the total support to agriculture sector be accurately estimated and its
economic, environmental, and fiscal impacts monitored on a regular basis.

With global food crises and food price volatility in recent years, agricultural subsidies have once
again gained prominence as a policy instrument in many developing countries. In Mongolia too,
subsidies to the agriculture sector mainly through government budgetary transfers, have
increased over time. These gained prominence in 2008 when a global, regional (the drought in
Russia, and Kazakhstan, the two main suppliers to Mongolia), and the national food production
shortfall sent domestic wheat prices soaring to record levels. Wheat production had reached an
all-time low during the years 2005 to 2007. Consequently, subsidies to crop, livestock, and agro-
processing sectors have increased since 2008, and now represent a complex set of programs,
sometimes with conflicting and overlapping goals and intended beneficiaries. A recent MIA
assessment found that the working capital amount and the scope and demand for subsidy fund
activities are increasing over time.

The main types of crop subsidies in Mongolia, implemented under the Crop Protection Fund
and aimed at increasing domestic food production, are in the form of wheat price support and
subsidized soft loans for the purchase of machinery, fuel, seeds, and plant protection chemicals.
Even bigger subsidies are provided to the livestock sector, mainly through the statutory 2
Livestock Conservation Fund, which was established in 2001 mainly to provide support for the
protection of livestock herders from droughts and the severe winter weather events known as
“dzuds?. Over the years, the Fund has been reformed several times. The latest such reform, the
National Mongolian Livestock Program (MNLP), approved in 2010, was introduced to
support development of livestock production for the 2010-2015 period by providing support to
herders, and preferential loans to livestock breeding cooperatives and intensive livestock
production entities.

In addition to these two prominent funds, a number of other support programs have been
implemented. These include the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Development Fund
(covering crops, livestock and agro-processing activities among other SMEs), the Pasture
Management Program (for irrigation of pastures, rodent/pest control), the Veterinary
Program (for services and medicines), and subsidized loan programs for agro-processers (such
as wheat flour mills and cashmere, wool, and meat processors). Credit subsidies have been
widely used. The most common subsidized credit program involves a partial or full five-year
loan at a seven percent annual interest rate, as opposed to the commercial bank loan rate of about
20 percent. Soft loans to agro-processors and commercial farmers are aimed at modernizing the
processing facilities to build capacity to generate value added products locally, and to create
growth and employment.
It is very difficult to find accurate data from the public accounts, except for those which are
clearly defined as “subsidies,? and refer to direct payments to herders and farmers. Furthermore,
it is important to estimate a total subsidy equivalent by considering the implicit support/taxation
by way of the market price support (MPS) to wheat and wool, the two most traded commodities.
Therefore, using the standard OECD methodology, the total producer support estimates (PSE)3

2
  In Mongolia there is a constitutional commitment to support livestock sector and herders. With a majority of the
elected representatives having roots to farming and rural constituencies there is a political support for public
budgetary transfers to the sector.

  Producer support estimates (PSE) is used synonymously with producer subsidy equivalent in this study and
includes the Government budgetary support and the implicit market price support (MPS) which can be positive or

                                                                                                                1
are calculated. The results show that the total subsidies (the government budgetary transfers)
paid out to the primary agriculture sector, in nominal terms4, ranged from 22 billion MNT (USD
15 Million) in 2009 to 91 billion MNT (USD 67 Million) in 2012. Subsidies to the livestock
sector average double those to the crop sector. Crop sector subsidies, however, grew almost three
times faster during the five year period between 2008 and 2012. The livestock sector generates
about four times the level of GDP of the crop production sector. Counting only direct
government subsidies, the crop sector is therefore proportionately more subsidized as a
percentage of its GDP than the livestock sector.

One of the main conclusions of this study is that even though the government subsidies
(budgetary transfers) to primary agriculture have increased over the five year period, considering
the MPS, the total PSE for the primary agriculture has not increased. This implies that budgetary
support basically compensated farmers for the lower domestic market prices, while the
international prices (and import prices) remained high. The PSE for the crop sector
(predominently wheat), as a percentage of the total value of crop production, remained fairly
high at 13 to 17 percent during 2008-2010, but came down drastically in the subsequent years
reaching below one percent. In contrast, the PSE coefficients for the primary livestock
production sector were much lower and, excluding 2008, have steadily gone up.

Thus in aggregate, the PSE for primary agriculture shows a general decline, especially over the
three years ending in 2012 when they reached 2.4 percent. For comparison with other countries
in the region for which OECD estimates exist, it can be concluded that the overall level of
subsidy (including direct and indirect payments) support to primary agriculture in Mongolia was
fairly small and much lower than other states such as OECD countries (18.6%), China (16.8%),
Kazakhstan (14.6%) and Russia (13.5%) in 2012. Only Ukraine at 1.3% and Turkey at -7.3%
were lower than Mongolia.

In terms of the potential impact of subsidies, the wheat subsidies seem to have achieved their
goal of helping to increase production as the yield per hectare of the subsidized crop. Wheat
yields increased more than threefold, and the area sown more than doubled between 2007 and
2012. Similarly, the number of sheep, the main subsidized livestock category, increased faster
than any other type of livestock between 2011 and 2012. Because the carrying capacity of the
land in a number of aimags has been reached and in some instances exceeded, this increase in
number of sheep has generated adverse environmental impacts.

The results of the study point to a number of issues with important policy implications, and to
recommendations for improving the effectiveness and efficacy of agriculture subsidies in
Mongolia. These include the following.

 Rationalize agricultural subsidy programs to help resolve inconsistent and overlapping
  objectives, and to reduce the costs of delivering and implementing the programs. The

negative. Although the MPS is calculated only for the selected two commodities (wheat and wool), direct subsidies
paid to the primary producers of all other commodities such as meat, dairy, vegetables and others are included in the
total subsidy transfers. The OECD category of General Services Support Estimates (GSSEs) for research and
development, education and training, inspection and health services, were not included in the PSEs.
4
 The subsidy amounts (in fact all values) are in nominal terms. The annual average inflation rates in Mongolia from
2008 to 2012 were: 25.1, 6.3, 10.1, 9.5, 15.0 percent, respectively. However, for ease of understanding and
discussion with the Government officials, the nominal values and nominal budgets are used. The estimates are
compared to nominal GDP and agricultural output values and public expenditure. Key subsidy values are shown in
USD terms.

                                                                                                                   2
   negative values of market price support (MPS) to wheat and wool during the five year period
   covered by the study suggests that part of the government budgetary transfers were simply
   used to compensate producers for the implicit taxation. In the absence of domestic market
   price reduction policies, a negative MPS arises mainly as the result of a lack of competitive
   market structure and a rise in the international price of the commodity without domestic
   price transmission. Therefore, a study on the market structure and market performance
   and roles of various intermediaries and their margins in the marketing channel is
   recommended to help design policies to improve market efficiency and to reduce the need
   for direct subsidies.
 Investments in general services support (GSS), including research and development,
  education and training, infrastructure improvement, inspection and health services, are
  recommended as more effective options than subsidies to increase production. This is
  particularly important in the case of Mongolia, given that the subsidy outlays are more than
  double the MIA’s investment budget and nearly nine times higher than expenditures on
  agricultural R&D. A dollar spent on R&D investment is likely to yield significantly higher
  returns than a dollar spent on subsidy according to most literature on agricultural economics,
  suggesting that a reallocation of funds towards research is likely to increase returns and
  reduce costs for Mongolia’s limited government financial resources. Alternatives to
  subsidizing fertilizer, for example, investing in road infrastructure, eliminating bureaucratic
  hurdles and augmenting performance of financial institutions are also recommended (Banful,
  2011) and are applicable in Mongolia.
 Subsidy programs for the livestock sector in Mongolia generally provide short term
  financial support to herders, but do not contribute to improved long term food security
  or economic efficiency. Livestock subsidies may very well be attributable for increasing the
  number of livestock heads to unsustainable levels, and with serious environmental
  consequences. Current literature suggests that subsidies do not necessarily bring about any
  permanent structural or technological change, and therefore may not be at all useful in
  improving the economic efficiency of production (Jayne and Rashid; Dorward). Although
  the newly reformed Mongolian National Livestock Program aims to improve the quality of
  livestock commodities, modernize production systems, and promote adoption of improved
  technologies, the Program is not fully funded and implementation is incomplete. The
  recommendation for the Government is to remain mindful of the adverse environmental
  impacts its support to the livestock sector can have and follow the provisions of the MNLP
  rather than the ad-hoc payments to the sector.
 In 2008, production shocks, low levels of food stocks, high food prices, and critical food
  security situations persuaded policy makers in a number of countries that smart subsidies
  were an attractive alternative. Smart subsidies typically involve objectives relating to pro-
  poor economic growth, the development of local markets, and the promotion of competition
  in input supply, the pursuit of regional integration and clarity of an exit strategy, and other
  purposes. These may also include innovative financing, voucher systems, warehouse receipt
  schemes, etc. intended to reduce input delivery costs and improve targeting to promote private
  input markets, poor farmers’ adoption of new technologies, increased output, and ultimately
  poverty reduction. Therefore, it is recommended that a smart subsidy strategy, to the
  extent possible, be followed with adequate public investment.

1.1 Agriculture in the Mongolian economy

The agriculture sector contributes significantly to the Mongolian economy and is critical to
achieving sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. Agriculture provides an estimated
43 percent of employment with 7 out of 10 jobs in the sector coming from livestock activities.
The majority of rural residents dependent on agriculture for income and sustenance, and the
sector’s performance has a profound impact on livelihoods throughout Mongolia. According to
the 2007/08 household survey, the poverty rate in rural areas was at 43 percent compared to 30
percent in the urban areas. At the national level, a 2012 World Bank estimate of poverty
headcount was 27.4 percent, down from 38.7 percent in 2010. Mongolia is a landlocked country
with difficult logistics throughout much of its area. Reducing the overall incidence of poverty
will necessarily entail doing more to improve the conditions of the country’s rural population.

The performance of the agriculture sector has been uneven and is particularly affected by
periodic weather related natural disasters. Given the severe water constraints and extremely
harsh environment, crop cultivation is highly limited. Nonetheless, with the relatively low
opportunity cost of land, wheat is the main cereal produced. Its land productivity, however, is
very low in comparison to other countries. Wheat production dropped significantly from about
680,000 tonnes in the mid-1980s to a low of 73,400 tonnes in 2005 (see Figure 1), while the
country went from an exportable surplus situation to imports of 350,000 tonnes in 2007/08 with
rise in imports from Russia and Kazakhstan. Droughts in 2005 and 2007 lowered wheat
production still further. Production has rebounded since, reaching 465,300 tonnes in 2012, but
still remains below the national requirement. The drastic decline in agricultural production is
attributed partly to the transition from a socialist to a market economy in the 1990s, and is
accompanied by the decline in the use of farm machinery (see Figure 2) and other modern inputs
such as fertilizer.

The livestock sector in Mongolia accounts for about 80 percent of agricultural output and
supports about 210,000 rural households. The situation was aggravated by the severe dzuds of
1999, 2000 and 2001, when about 11 million heads of livestock died. More recently, in 2009 and
2010, a dzud killed another 11 million animals, reducing livestock numbers from 44 million to
32.7 million. However, in recent years the number of livestock has been building back up with
the latest estimate for 2012 at 41 million, the majority of which are sheep, goats and cattle.
Livelihoods and food security among the affected half million rural people is slowly being
restored. However, the lingering effects of the livestock losses still weigh heavily on the
livelihoods of those affected and will require a sustained effort to overcome. There are also
questions about the environmental sustainability of the peak stocking numbers in recent times,
and whether this contributes to the high mortality rates during dzuds and therefore to stock
number volatility.

1.2 Agricultural policy and subsidies overview

The overall agricultural policy objective, implemented through legislative decrees and laws, is to
ensure national food security by providing “the entire nation with stable supplies of accessible,
nutritious and safe food to create healthy livelihoods and high labor productivity.? Furthermore,
livestock production constitutes the largest agricultural sector and according to the 1992
Constitution, “Livestock is the national wealth of the country and subject to state protection.?
Support to agriculture is therefore embedded in national policy. Increasing agricultural
competitiveness, improving the quality of food products, and environmental sustainability and
natural resources management are all guiding principles of the current agricultural policy. The
policy is intended make government support to agriculture more rational.
To reverse the declining trend in agricultural production, the Government of Mongolia (GoM)
has, in recent years, adopted two key programs and the MDG targets to put agriculture back on
track as a lead sector of the economy, to address constraints to agricultural development, and to
improve national food security by adopting the Mongolian National Program for Food Security
(NPFS) 2009-2016 and the Mongolian National Livestock Program (MNLP) 2010. The NPFS
aims to provide the entire country with secure supplies of accessible, nutritious, and safe food to
enable healthy livelihoods and high labor productivity founded on the participation of the people,
government, as well as the public and private sectors. The overall objective of the MNLP is to
modernize the country’s livestock sector so that it is adaptable to the changing climatic and
social conditions and create an environment where the sector is economically viable and
competitive in the market economy.

Despite the important initiatives outlined in these policy documents, a thorough and
comprehensive review of the performance of the sector has not been undertaken. For example,
the National Livestock Strategy (NLS) was approved by the Parliament in 2010 and sets out an
ambitious agenda for modernizing the sector. Public expenditure in the sector has increased
significantly and the NLS comes with a “guaranteed? contribution from the state budget. Most of
these increased expenditures are believed to have gone to agricultural price and credit subsidies.
Many of the recent policy initiatives, including the subsidy programs and the Agricultural
Commodities Exchange Law, are insufficiently analyzed to afford us a full understanding of the
country’s current policy framework, in particular, the impact of the subsidy programs no being
implemented.

Agricultural subsidy programs such as price supports for farm inputs and outputs, and direct or
indirect payments, are used in many countries, both developing and industrialized. In developing
countries the primary aim is to increase local food production and thereby increase domestic
food availability and national food security. In Mongolia, both livestock and crop sectors have
received rising public support. Yet no proper estimation of the actual amount of direct and
indirect subsidies to agriculture, and no proper assessment of their effectiveness, efficiency, or
impacts has been carried out.


1.3 Objectives of the study

The main objective of this study is to understand the role of subsidies as a form of direct
government intervention. The specific objectives are:
   1. To review the current agricultural subsidy programs and policies.



                                                                                                 6
    2. To estimate the amount of subsidies to crop production, livestock production, and agro-
       processing. The official statistics under “subsidies and transfers? omits many subsidies
       that go to producers and processors through soft loans and other support programs. Nor
       do official statistics include the indirect subsidization (or taxation) of the sector arising
       from government policies and/or market failure. The study therefore seeks to estimate the
       direct subsidies to the primary agriculture sector and such indirect subsidies as market
       price support to wheat and wool, two of the most important, most subsidized, and most
       internationally traded commodities.5
    3. To examine the production/supply, terms of trade and fiscal impact of these subsidies and
       discuss some of the policy recommendations to make them more effective.




The methodology used in this study basically followed two steps, first the review of programs
involving subsidy elements to agriculture and second, the calculation of total subsidy equivalent
estimates.
The review. The first step included a review of all the programs and polices related to
agricultural subsidies in the country including extensive discussions and structured interviews
with all stakeholders during a three week World Bank mission in the country. The key
informants included technical and managerial staff of Government units within MIA, MoF, and
MoL, and of farm organizations, selected private companies and organizations who are involved
in delivering agriculture subsidies or subsidized inputs and outputs.
Methodology of producer support estimates. The second step deals with analyzing raw data on
subsidy funds and various other transfer outlays and converting them into proper subsidy
estimates, direct and indirect, using a simplified OECD PSE methodology.6 The OECD manual
states that the producer subsidy (or support) equivalent (PSE) includes all direct or indirect
payments for outputs and inputs (A detailed list of support categories is shown in Appendix 1).
An important item in the direct payments category in the case of Mongolia, from the
methodology point of view, is the conversion of soft loans into actual credit subsidy, i.e. the
interest concessions. The majority of the soft loans are of medium term five year loans. Working
capital loans are more often shorter term, one year loans, some with a grace period. Most capital
loans have different down payment terms but typically have a five-year repayment term, and
generally have an interest rate of 7 percent as opposed to a typical commercial bank loan rate of
around 20 percent. Accordingly, the concession on interest rates is equal to the difference


5
 The MPS analysis of only two commodities is because of the time and resources constraints for this study.
6
 In this study a modified/simplified OECD PSE methodology is followed since the market price support (MPS)
component is calculated only for two selected commodities, wheat and wool, as opposed to all commodities in the
other OECD studies.

                                                                                                             7
between the annual commercial bank five year loan interest rate and 7 percent. To simplify the
total interest concession calculations these assumptions were made for all loans.

In addition to the direct payments for agricultural outputs and inputs, the OECD methodology
also includes indirect support (or taxation) of agricultural production in the total producer
support/subsidy equivalent (PSE). The indirect support/taxation consists primarily of government
policy interventions called “Market Price Support? (MPS). According to the OECD MPS
represents “the transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers arising from
policy measures that create a gap between domestic market prices and border prices of an
agricultural commodity, measured at the farm gate level.? Thus the methodology 7 calls for
calculating the difference between the farm gate price and the equivalent comparable
international reference price (usually the border import price plus allowances for transport,
handling, minimal processing and margins). As discussed in the objectives of this study, only
wheat and wool were chosen for the MPS analysis. Finally, the PSEs are expressed as a
percentage of the total value of the sector.
The Producer Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC). Another way of looking at the total
support to a specific commodity is calculating the NPC,8 which is defined as “the ratio between
the average price received by producers at the farm gate (including payments per tonne of
current output), and the border price, measured at the farm gate. The NPCs are generally
calculated based on the level of subsidization at each selected specific commodity level, the
Single Commodity Transfer (SCT). The SCT is a ratio of total subsidies specifically designated
for the commodity including the MPS and are linked to the SCT so that NPC is equal to 1/(1-
percent SCT).
In the case of Mongolia, wheat production dominates crop farming, with roughly 50 percent of
crop GDP coming from the value of wheat. Since most of the other crop sector subsidies,
machinery and other input loans are also accessible to wheat farmers, a 50 percent share of other
multiple commodity transfers (MCT) are assumed for wheat. Thus NPC for wheat is calculated
in two ways – 1) with the SCT and 2) with sum of the SCT and the share of the MCT.




3.1 Agricultural subsidy funds and programs

Mongolian Government agriculture subsidies were high during the Soviet period and then
declined sharply during the 1990s. After the 2008 global food price crisis, these subsidies
increased again. Government support to Mongolian agriculture consists mainly of core programs
that provide output-based payments primarily to wheat, wool, cashmere and meat producers. It
also consists of technical support mainly through subsidized soft loans to buy machinery,
purchase inputs, and adopt technologies to increase productivity and build capacity. The

7
    Details are provided in Chapter 4 of the OECD’s “The PSE Manual?, 2010.


                                                                                               8
Government also supports the livestock sector through the provision of subsidized veterinary
medicines and services.

Wheat is the main crop in the country and wheat flour is the major food staple, covering
approximately 55 percent of the daily caloric intake. Wheat production was controlled and
heavily supported during the socialist period up to the 1990s, allowing the country to be self-
sufficient and occasionally a net exporter. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union,
Mongolian agriculture’s input service system collapsed, and wheat production reached its lowest
points between 2005 and 2007. The Government responded by implementing a policy to support
domestic production, assure adequate food availability and higher levels of self-sufficiency. The
policy included major increases in wheat subsidies, including output-based payments and
technical assistance to wheat farmers, for example through grants and loans. Furthermore, a
seasonal 5 percent tariff on imported wheat flour from August to April was increased to 15
percent to protect farmers from competition.

Meat is a staple food in Mongolia. The livestock industry consists mainly of sheep, goats, horses,
cattle, and camels, and engages a large proportion of the workforce. Similar to the other
agricultural subsectors, Government intervention in livestock production diminished in 1991
with a broad reduction of subsidies. However, the number of animals increased during the 1990s,
mainly due to higher mobility of herds and more people reverting to livestock activities after the
breakup of the Soviet Union. Yet, the livestock sector is under higher risk due to frequent disease
outbreaks, and unusually harsh dzuds and droughts, which substantially reduced livestock
numbers in recent years. Over the years, the Government has implemented several programs,
with the objective of supporting primary
producers, as well as assisting secondary
processes, thereby raising the value
added domestically especially for wool,
cashmere and meat. The Government
has also employed in recent years high
taxes on exports of raw and washed
cashmere, and wool. This has led to
some 50 percent of the raw cashmere
being smuggled into China to avoid duty
taxes (WTO, 2005).

Some of the long standing historical
subsidy programs include the Crop
Protection    Fund,     the   Livestock
Conservation Fund, the Small and

Wool and Cashmere Processors, the
Meat Stabilization Fund, Veterinary
Services/Vaccines Subsidization Program, Tax Concessions to Herders and Farmers, and the
proposed Staple Food Price Stabilization Program. Some salient features, purpose/objectives,
operational modalities, administering units, and the size and timeframe of these programs are
given in Table 1.

The Crop Protection Fund, one of the long-standing subsidy programs, was established in 1997
to intensify implementation of the policy to support crop production activities and crop
producers. A further Government Resolution was passed in 1999 to provide “Procedure to

establish and disburse Wheat Fund.? Funding of the program has become more systematic and
regularized since 2008 and includes subsidies in the form of wheat price support and technical
support to the crop sector in the form of subsidized soft loans for machinery and equipment, fuel,
seeds, plant protection chemicals, fertilizer, and the cultivation of sea buckthorn berries. As
shown in Table 2, the size of the fund (amounts for loans and the direct payments) has fluctuated
but grew, in nominal terms, from 24.3 billion MNT in 2008 to 44.2 billion MNT in 2009, came
down in 2010 but rose steadily since reaching 44.9 billion in 2012.9

Provision for the protection of livestock and herders is made in the Mongolian constitution. A
number of programs have been introduced for this purpose. The most important of these is the
Livestock Conservation Fund, which was established in 2001, mainly to support for the
protection of livestock herders from droughts and dzuds. Since then, the Fund has been reformed
under various policies, programs, and corresponding Government decrees. The latest one is the
“National Mongolian Livestock Program? (MNLP), 10 formulated in 2010 to support the
development of livestock production for the years 2010-2015 by providing preferential loan
support to livestock breeding cooperatives and intensified livestock production.

The available credit under the Livestock Conservation Fund is intended to help farmers acquire
machinery, ease working capital constraint and to adopt new technology. Since 2011, the Fund
operates independently. The total size of the fund, with an income from the state budget transfers
and the repayments of loans, has grown from about half a billion in 2009 to over 32 billion MNT
in 2012. This fund included some 30.5 billion MNT worth of subsidy in 2008 to herders for
cashmere, 9.8 billion MNT in 2011 and 29.3 billion MNT in 2012 to herders for sheep and camel
wool. The remaining amount was disbursed as loans. According to the MIA, the loan repayment
rate as of 2012 has been about 90 percent. The MIA assessment also states that the working
capital amount, scope and need, and demand for the Fund activities, are increasing overtime.

In addition to the Crop Protection Fund and the Livestock Conservation Fund, a number of other
programs have been implemented, including the Small and Medium Enterprises Development
Fund (covering crops, livestock and agro-processing activities), the Pasture Management
Program (for irrigation of pastures, rodent/pest control), the Veterinary Program (for services

  According to the official document (MIA 2010) the main goals and objectives of MNLP are as follows:
1. To provide great attention from the State to livestock sector as the one of the economic pillars of country, to
   create a favorable legal, economic and institutional environment, to maintain sustainable development and to
   develop a good governance to livestock sector.
2. To improve livestock breeding service according to social need, to increase productivity and production of high
   quality, to produce qualified bio-clean livestock product and to increase competitiveness in the market.
3. To raise veterinary service standard to international levels and to protect public health through securing
   livestock health.
4. To develop livestock sector that is adaptable in ecological change and able to persist risk.
5. To develop markets specialized for livestock and livestock products, to create processing and selling networks
   and to accelerate feedback of economy through incentive system.

3.2 Institutional structure of subsidy programs

At least nine subsidy programs are currently in operation in Mongolia (Table 1). Most of these,
including wheat price subsidy and crop and livestock technical support programs, are operated
by the MIA. In general the primary agriculture programs are administered by special units within
the agriculture side of MIA. For example, as shown in column 4 of Table 1 –
Responsible/Administrative Unit – the crop protection fund and the livestock conservation fund
are managed by special units by these names. The Livestock Production Department also
operates the veterinary program subsidies and a primary implementer of grants and subsidies
under the Mongolia National Livestock Program. The Department of Coordination for the Light
Industry side of the MIA is responsible for administering and providing technical guidance to
wool and cashmere processors’ subsidy programs and to meat supply stabilization loans to meat
processors/suppliers. Small and medium enterprise (SME) units under the Ministry of Labor also
manage soft/subsidized loans to commercial crop and livestock producers and agro-processors.



                                                                                                                            13
The funding of most of the ad-hoc subsidy programs comes from extra-budgetary allocations
with parliamentary decrees either through special bond offerings or from Ministry of Finance
allocations. Funds for soft loans by the SME units are provided through the selected commercial
banks that administer the subsidized loans. Most of the soft loan funds are intended to be
revolving funds in the sense that the loan recoveries of past loans will provide capital for new
loans. However, most of these are in their initial years and do not yet appear to have sufficient
rates of recovery.

Some verification or control mechanisms exist. For example, when a herder delivers wool to a
local delivery point of a wool processing company he/she deposits the transaction paper with the
local Soum administration office. This transaction information is then transmitted from the Soum
office to the Aimag office, and then to the national office. In parallel the record of purchase
travels from a local processor to national processors’ association office and further to the
national Government office. When the two records reconcile, the herder receives the due
payment. This is meant to eliminate potential fraud in the process.

The Ministry of Industry and
Agriculture, the Ministry of Labor, and
the Ministry of Finance and
Commercial Banks are each involved
in agriculture subsidy programs in
Mongolia. Some of the funds and
programs overlap in terms of their
goals and the beneficiaries they cover.
Examples of this include, SME funds
dealing with crop, livestock and agro-
processing soft loans, the Staple Food
Price Stabilization Program dealing
with meat processors, intensive
agriculture, wheat millers, etc. There is

a need to examine these administrative Meat is a staple food in Mongolia.
structures in order to harmonize the
various subsidy programs to improve institutional, operational and financial management of all
subsidy programs to streamline and make them more efficient.

3.3 Subsidy programs – direct payments and technical support

All support programs are combined into three broad groups in Table 2 and summarized as
subsidy payments and subsidized loans in Table 3 and Figure 4. The broad categories are crop
production support programs, livestock production support programs and agro-processing
industry support programs. They include the size of funds distributed as direct payments (price
support), grants for specific purposes, loans for short term and long term investments and other
subsidy schemes. These amounts are not actual subsidies per se, but rather funds used to provide
subsidies. For example, loans themselves are not subsidies; the interest on these loans given up
under the program would be actual subsidies. These are calculated and described later in this
paper.

Over the last five years (2008 to 2012), two forms of support have typically been used by the
Government: direct payments in the form of price subsidies/grants, and soft loans with varying
terms of concession. The livestock production support funds dominate the total support budget
                                                                                              14
amounting to 127.5 billion MNT (or 56 percent) of subsidy payments and 43.8 billion MNT (or
11 percent) of loans. Support to this sector is also more in the form of subsidies (ranging from
5.7 billion MNT in 2009 to 48.3 billion MNT in 2012) than loans. On the other hand, in relative
terms, agro-processors have been supported mostly with soft loans, whereas, crop sector has
been supported with direct subsidies and with loans in significant amounts.

Although not part of the analysis of this report, new subsidies already started in 2013 include the
new fund for Staple Food Price Stabilization aimed at building warehouse capacity of meat
processors, all intensive agriculture, and wheat millers. There are also other subsidies planned,
such as subsidies for milk producers, vegetable producers, intensive farming of poultry, piggery,
beef, etc. Similarly, some of the international donor support to agriculture in general is classified
as grants/subsidies (e.g. projects by IFAD, EU, ADB, etc.), however, it is relatively small, not
easy to isolate as subsidies and is mostly channeled through the Government. Hence it is not
included in the calculations of this study.

The amounts that are available for the purpose of subsidies under the different funds and
programs need to be converted into the actual subsidy or equivalent amounts. The total subsidy
to a sector, using the OECD definition of the producer support/subsidy equivalent (PSE), is a
gross transfer to agriculture from consumers and taxpayers. In addition to budgetary
expenditures, support includes other estimated transfers which do not require actual monetary
disbursements. Therefore, all direct or indirect payments for outputs and inputs are estimated and

  4.1   Payments based on outputs, inputs and other support

Direct payments to crop sector include mainly wheat price support to the quantities either sold to
the participating millers and/or trading companies or to Government procurement centers. Not all
production is subsidized. For example, only about 60 percent of wheat produced, on average
during 2008-2012, received a price subsidy. Limitations are applied in terms of quality control,
the timing of deliveries (purchased before 1st of December). Wheat sold as feed and to breweries
does not receive a subsidy. The subsidy in 2012 was 100,000 MNT per tonne for the actual
quantity of wheat subsidized however, given that only 60 percent of the production received this
subsidy, the effective wheat subsidy amounts to 60,000 MNT per tonne (about US$44) when the
subsidy is distributed over total production.

Wheat subsidy payments increased
steadily over the five year period
from 11.16 billion MNT in 2008 to
27.83 billion MNT in 2012, an
increase of about 2.5 times (Table 4
and Figure 5). The other major
component of subsidy, the interest
concessions to wheat, vegetables and
other crops, is comparatively smaller
but grew by more than 7 fold during
these five years. The bottom part of
Table 4 shows conversion of subsidy
support with and without MPs in US
dollar equivalents using the annual
average exchange rates.                   Given the severe water constraints and extremely harsh environment,
                                          crop cultivation is highly limited.

                                                                                                                16
According to the official data fertilizer subsidies were offered only during 2008 and 2009. The
total crop sector subsidies grew from 13.57 billion MNT in 2008 to 40.67 billion MNT in 2012
or by three fold in the five year period, with an average amount of 22.64 billion MNT per year.
As far as livestock is concerned, the ad-hoc payments of large amounts, such as the 30.5 billion
MNT in 2008 to cashmere herders and 9.83 billion MNT and 29.44 billion MNT during 2011
and 2012, respectively, to sheep and camel wool herders were delivered (see Figure 6).
Veterinary subsidies in the form of the vaccination of animals and veterinary services to farmers
and herders based on the actual expenditure for agriculture are included under this category.
Given the importance of the livestock sector in Mongolia, the veterinary support expenditures,
have increased from 2.53 billion MNT in 2008 to 13.39 billion MNT in 2012, more than
fivefold. Interest concessions are the smallest component of livestock subsidies in an absolute
amount but have grown the most, especially in 2011 and 2012. Total subsidies to the primary
livestock production sector amounted to about 50 billion MNT as opposed to 40 billion for crop
production, with an annual average spending of 26.35 billion, some 3.7 billion MNT or 16
percent higher than for crop production. The livestock GDP in general is about four times that of
the crop production GDP.

Most of the Government policies in Mongolia in recent years have been aimed
                                                                 when there is government policy
at raising the price of wheat and wool.
                                                                 intervention, such as import
tariffs, other trade restrictions, export subsidies, and so on. These affect the market price. Low
levels of tariff in Mongolia mean that there is likely to be fewer distortions in the market price
resulting from policy intervention. However, besides the policy interventions, deviations in
prices received by farmers compared to the true competitive reference price could also be due to
the inherent market structure, conduct, and performance problems. A particularly relevant
question in the case of Mongolia is what generates negative MPS for wheat and for wool.
Obviously, negative MPS arises when the farm gate price is lower than the equivalent
competitive international price of wheat (an imported commodity) and of wool (an exported
commodity). In theory, there could be three possible reasons for the negative MPS in Mongolia:
    1. the existence of policies to reduce the domestic price (and thereby the farm gate price),
    2. imperfect competition in that commodity market, and/or
    3. high oscillation (especially increases) in international price, with low transmission to
       local market and farm gate prices.
Most of the Government policies in Mongolia in recent years have been aimed at raising the
price of wheat and wool. The likely reasons for negative MPS could therefore be the lack of
market competition as well as an inability on the part of the domestic market to adjust quickly to
the increases in international market as happened in 2011 and 2012 in case of wheat (Figure 8).
Normally, the MPS should be calculated for all agricultural commodities, but owing to certain
constraints, it was agreed to cover only the two selected commodities, wheat and wool. The tariff
on wheat imports is 15 percent except during the off-season of July to April when it is 5 percent
(a complete list of official import tariffs currently in place since 1 July 1999 is shown in
Appendix 2). Farmers may benefit from the wheat import tariff, but they lose on the fertilizer
tariff, which is also 5 percent. For livestock, the tariff on the import of live animals is 5 percent
with other veterinary non-tariff restrictions. There is no tariff for breeding animal imports, while
the tariff for eggs and vegetables is 15 percent.
The MPS calculated for wheat and sheep wool is presented in Table 4 and the total subsidy
amounts shown with and without MPS. The results are interesting as the MPS for these two
commodities is positive in some years and negative in others. Wheat farmers, for example
received a huge implicit subsidy (MPS) during 2010 (about 22 billion MNT) due to the lowest
                                                                                                             19
import price of the commodity (see Figure 5). In 2011 and 2012 however, Mongolian wheat
farmers bore an implicit tax as international prices shot up and consequently the equivalent
reference prices remained higher than the farm gate prices including the price subsidy received
by farmers. The farm gate price (before adding the subsidy) of wheat has been declining over the
years and especially in 2012, giving rise to a much larger implicit tax (of about 39.5 billion
MNT), wiping out the subsidies provided by the Government almost entirely. So, including
MPS, the total subsidy amounts to the crop sector show a peak in 2010 but a decline in the next
two years.

By contrast, the MPS for wool has been much smaller, indicating less distortion and a small
difference in international export price and the price paid to farmers. Even though the farm gate
domestic price for sheep wool (before subsidy) has been rising in general, the wool herders also
faced an implicit tax during the 2008-2012 period, except in 2011 when the price received by
herders exceeded the relatively low international price for wool.11 Thus ignoring the MPS due to
possible market distortions in all other livestock primary production sector commodities, the
total subsidy to the sector, excluding the one-time subsidy payment to the cashmere herders in
2008, shows an increasing trend, going from about 2.45 billion MNT in 2009 to 48.47 billion
MNT in 2012, with an annual average subsidy over 2008-2012 period of about 25 billion MNT,
slightly higher than the 22.64 billion MNT to the crop sector.

The total subsidy to the primary agriculture including the MPS for only wheat and wool was 64
billion MNT in 2008, dropping to 31 billion in 2009, and gradually reaching a high of about 50
billion MNT in 2012.

It should be noted that, these estimates of subsidy with MPS do not cover all commodities.
However, MPS to other commodities could be positive or negative. The overall effect of their
exclusion is therefore ambiguous on total MPS. Furthermore, not included in the study is the
estimate of total tax concessions to herders and farmers. The data required for computation were
not available. Exclusion of this underestimates the total support to the agriculture sector.

  The MPS calculations are made using the adjusted average per unit export value of total wool quantity exported as
a proxy for international reference price. Several simplifying assumptions were necessary as the quality differences
and international prices are very complex. Also, MPS for all other commodities is not calculated, which could
change the conclusions about subsidies to the primary agriculture sector. A full study of PSE estimation is,
therefore, required.

                                                                                                                                 20
Similarly, lack of available data on arrears on soft loans also underestimates the total subsidy
support.

4.3 Subsidies to agro-processing sector

In addition to subsidies for primary agriculture, Government support is provided to agro-
processing firms as an incentive to modernize processing technology and increase the capacity to
take advantage of economies of scale to increase the competitiveness of domestic firms, and to
generate employment in the larger economy. The purpose of soft subsidized loans for wool and
cashmere processors is to protect them from foreign competition, mainly from China. The main
beneficiaries of the soft loans include
meat processing plants, wool and
cashmere processors, and various
other small and medium enterprises,
with the meat stabilization program
and cashmere processing firms
receiving the lion’s share. Subsidies
to the agro-processing industry were
fairly low, under 2.5 billion MNT in
the     beginning,     but      became
particularly significant during 2011
and 2012, reaching a peak at 27.4
billion in 2012, and averaging about
11 billion MNT (Table 5). Given the
average annual inflation rate of about
13 percent during the period between                   The purpose of soft subsidized loans for wool and cashmere processors is
2008 and 2012, this represents a real                  to protect them from foreign competition.

4.4 Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) Estimates

The total PSE figures (producer support/subsidy equivalent, including the MPS for wheat and
wool), for primary agriculture are presented in relation to the total value of each sector (see
Table 6 and Figures 9). More specifically, PSE% = PSE including the MPS divided by the total
value (income) received by farmers (which is equal to the value of production at the farm gate
price plus the PSE excluding MPS) (OECD 2010).

The results show that the PSE for the crop production sector, as a percentage of the total value of
crop production, remained fairly high at 13 to 17 percent during 2008-2010 but declined
dramatically in subsequent years, reaching a low of 0.28 percent in 2012. This was largely the
result of rapid global grain price changes without corrreponding changes in domestic farm gate
prices. The PSE coefficients for the primary livestock production sector were lower compared to
the crop sector but, excluding 2008, they steadily increased from 0.25 percent in 2009 to 2.9
percent in 2012. When the two are combined (the total support to agriculture) the PSE numbers
show some fluctuation in the relative measure but a general decline from more than 5 percent in
2008 to less than 2.4 percent in 2012, with a five-year average remaining at 3.3 percent.


4.5 Nominal Protection Coefficient (NCP) for Wheat and Wool

In order to see the level of subsidization for each commodity, the Single Commodity Transfer
(SCT) and the Producer Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC) are calculated. The NPC is the
ratio between the average price received by producers at the farm gate and the border price,
measured at the farm gate. However, in the case of Mong olia, wheat production dominates crop
farming, with roughly 50 percent of the crop GDP coming from the value of wheat. Since most
of the other crop sector subsidies, machinery and other input loans are also accessible by wheat

farmers, a 50 percent share of other multiple commodity transfers (MCT) are assumed for wheat.
Thus the NPC for wheat is calculated with and without share of MCT.

The full producer NPC for wheat,
shown in Table 7 and Figure 10,
implies that during 2010 about 35
percent higher payments were
received over and above the relevant
border price (assumed international
competitive price). Thus the level of
subsidy equivalent protection to
farmers was 35 percent in 2010.
Whereas, during 2012, the worst
year, wheat producers paid an
implicit tax of 3 percent on the
wheat they sold. The estimated NPC
ratio with the SCT for wheat in
Mongolia is estimated to be 0.93 in In Mongolia, wheat production dominates crop farming.
2012, implying the farmers received
only 93 cents for each tugrik they should have received based on the international prices. This
ratio goes up slightly to 0.97 if we consider additional subsidies potentially acquired by wheat
producers through the MCT. During the last five years, wheat producers have gone from
receiving a moderate level of positive protection to a moderate level of negative protection.

approximately 50 percent).

Conversely, the NPC ratio of 3.51 for wool producers in 2012 implies that the price received by
wool herders (sheep and camel) was more than three times the equivalent border price due to a
high level of government payments during this particular year. This is consistent with the overall
value of the commodity. For example, in 2012 the total value of wool production at farm gate
prices was under 9 billion MNT, while the total subsidy paid to wool herders was over 29 billion
MNT. Thus the NPC analysis, consistent with the PSE estimates, shows that wool herders were
taxed heavily in 2008 and 2009 but were heavily subsidized during 2011 and 2012.

4.6 International comparisons

The PSEs for the primary agriculture sector in Mongolia are compared to similar estimates
available from different OECD studies (Table 8 and Figure 11). The overall level of subsidy
support to primary agriculture in Mongolia has been fairly small (2.4% in 2012), much lower
than OECD countries (18.6%), China (16.8%), Kazakhstan (14.6%) and Russia (13.5%) in the
same year. Only Ukraine at 1.3% and Turkey at -7.3% were lower than Mongolia. Most
countries, including Mongolia, show a generally declining trend. Thus, it can be concluded that
the overall level of subsidy (both the direct and indirect levels) support to primary agriculture in
Mongolia is fairly small, much lower than other countries in the region and has been declining
over the last five years (2008 to 2012).

Agricultural producer subsidies can have varied impacts on production, trade, incomes, market
prices, and overall economic growth and welfare through possible distortions and stimuli. As
indicated by subsidy experts, the sustained long term use of subsidies has a distortionary impact
on markets, prices and resource allocation. However, smart subsidies13 may bring about desired
results in the early stages of agricultural development by correcting for market failures and
promoting the adoption of new technologies (Kaur and Sharma, 2012 and Fan, 2008). Analyses
of economic, social, and environmental impacts require a great deal of long-term data, and time

13
  Ten features of smart subsidies by Morris et al. 2007 (The World Bank publication) are: 1. Promoting fertilizer as
part of a wider strategy, 2. Favoring market based solutions in input supply, 3. Promoting competition in input
supply, 4. Paying attention to demand, 5. Insisting on economic efficiency, 6. Empowering farmers, 7. Involving an
exit strategy, 8. Pursuing regional integration, 9. Ensuring sustainability, and 10. Promoting pro-poor economic
growth.

Alternatively, according to the literature review carried out by Meyer (2011) for the World Bank, the guidelines for
“smart? or “market-friendly? subsidies include: “subsidize the institution but not the borrowers to reduce distortions;
avoid subsidies to institutions that undermine competition; subsidize the creation of public goods that benefit the
entire financial sector; subsidize individual financial institutions where there is natural spillover to nonsubsidized
institutions; identify quantitative performance measures so subsidies to financial institutions do not dull incentives
for high performance; conduct comparative cost-benefit studies to identify subsidies that generate the greatest
payoff; require grant recipients to demonstrate commitment through matching contributions; and design grants to
financial institutions so recipients clearly understand the dif ference between grants and loans.?

full panel household survey data would enable analyses to better capture equity and economic
welfare impacts. The analysis here is limited and is carried out to improve impacts of different
programs based on the lessons learned from international experience and establish an empirical
basis for future assessments of links between farm support and agricultural growth in Mongolia.
5.1 Impact of subsidies on production/supply

In the crop production sector only wheat is offered direct price support. There is some secondary
support across the board, including to wheat farmers, but in less significant amounts. To see the
impact of wheat subsidization, changes in the area planted and yields over the five-year period
are calculated. Significant direct cash subsidies were provided to wheat farming from 2008 to
2012. The benefits of these subsidies were however negated by implicit taxation when compared
to the border reference prices, especially during 2011 and 2012. Although the area cultivated
with other crops is much smaller than the wheat area, the relative changes over time are
important. The area planted with wheat grew at more than double and yields increased more than
three times the rate of other, non-subsidized crops (Table 9 and Figure 12). While fertilizer use in
Mongolia remains low compared to industrialized countries, it doubled from 8.6 kg/ha of arable
land to 18 kg/ha between 2007 and 2010. And although other factors may be attributable for
these changes, it is highly likely that direct subsidies to wheat played a significant role in
increasing wheat productivity. On the negative side, it also means that the subsidies have
promoted further mono-cropping of wheat in the country, going against the desirable production
and diet diversity objectives as well as the allocation of resources in favor of this one crop.

In the livestock sector, the total number of animals
reached a historical high of 44.0 million heads in 2009,
which was brought down to 32.7 million in 2010 by the
severe dzud in the 2009/10 winter. The number of
animals increased again to 40.9 million in 2012. In 2011
and 2012, livestock subsidies were directly exclusively at
wool production, mainly sheep and to a lesser extent to
camel wool. Although the data series were not long
enough to draw any definite conclusions, the rate of
increase in numbers of sheep far exceeds that of any other
type of livestock (Figure 13). Again, it is difficult to
establish that subsidies were responsible, but they could
be one of the factors. If so, this would be an unintended
effect of the subsidy policies as the official goal is not to
increase livestock numbers because they have already
reached or exceeded the ecological carrying capacity of
the land. According to the Mongolian National Livestock
Program document the average carrying capacity of 100
hectares of pasture land is 60 sheep equivalent animals.           The total number of animals was brought down

times this limit in some aimags.

Some of the livestock subsidies, such as the direct payments for raw wool and cashmere, may be
responsible for increasing the already unsustainable number of livestock heads, and therefore
instrumental in raising the overall environmental costs. Subsidies to the livestock sector should
take into account environmental consequences, including ecological carrying capacity and the
long term sustainability of pasture resources. As shown in literature, the economic efficiency of
production may not improve because the subsidies do not bring about any permanent structural
or technological changes. And while the newly reformed Mongolian National Livestock Program
aims to improve the quality of livestock commodities, modernize production systems, and
promote the adoption of improved technologies, the Program is not yet fully funded and
implemented.

The primary goal of the subsidy to wool herders is to increase their welfare and to encourage
them to sell to the local wool processors. Although both goals are achieved with nearly 100

development program objectives needs to be addressed.

5.2 Impact on terms of trade

The terms of trade of the two major commodities traded internationally (i.e. wheat and wool),
which are also subject to subsidization, are calculated and presented in Table 10. Wheat and
wool are both exported. Other commodities, for example, raw cashmere, are traded but not
supported at the farm level by direct subsidy policies at least during the period covered by the
study. As seen from the price ratio of the domestic price received by farmers to the international
price (or by the NPC already discussed earlier), wheat protection eroded over the years reaching
more or less a parity level in 2011 and 2012. Thus, the direct subsidy to this commodity in last
two years has reduced trade distortions. Given that the wheat imports currently are relatively
small (under 100,000 tonnes in 2012 coming down from 350,000 in 2007) the direct trade
distortion effects of wheat policies may be minimal. However, this may change if global wheat
prices decline and the subsidies remain the same.

Support to wool, a major export commodity, on the other hand, has turned from hugely negative
to hugely positive, and thus subsidies have changed the terms of trade. However, this also may
have had no trade distorting effect because the processors purchase the wool from herders and
export at competitive prices in international market. Thus, in Mongolia, subsidies paid to sheep
herders during 2011 and 2012 are likely to act more as a welfare transfer to herders.
5.3 Fiscal impact

To perform an analysis of their potential fiscal impact, agricultural subsidies (only primary
sectors of crop and livestock production, not including agro-processing sector) are compared to
the total income and Government spending in other key productive areas. The analysis includes
the relative magnitude in each year
during the selected five year
period and also the possible
discernible    trends,    if   any.
Agricultural subsidies as direct
payments for output and/or inputs
are calculated while those of other
sector subsidies, for energy,

transportation, and others, are as reported in the official Government expenditure. Thus, ignoring
methodological differences, the total estimated primary agricultural subsidies on average form a
substantial part of the total government subsidies. Agricultural subsidies on average were about
38 percent of total direct subsidy payments with a steady downward trend from 47 percent in
2008 to 27 percent in 2011 (see Table 11). This, however, is primarily due to relatively higher
growth in non-agriculture subsidies including those for energy, transport and other sectors. This
trend was reversed to 45 percent in 2012 with a big increase in wheat and wool subsidies. A
similar magnitude and trend can be found when the agricultural subsidies are compared to the
MIA’s expenditure including the annual outlay of various subsidy funds for crop and livestock.
Agricultural subsidies grew at an average annual rate of 15 percent, while total MIA’s
agriculture investment expenditures grew by 7 percent and R&D expenditure by 16 percent
between 2008 and 2012.

5/ This includes R&D budgets reported by MIA, plus the agr research expenditure through the Science and Technology Fund under
the Ministry of Education and Science.


These subsidy outlays are more than double the investment budget handled by the MIA, which
seems to fluctuate from year to year. There is a very little spent on R&D through the MIA as
well as through the Science and Technology Fund under the Ministry of Education. As a result, if
the data obtained are reliable, agricultural subsidies in Mongolia were on average nearly 9 times
higher than the R&D expenditure during the five year period. If one assumes that a dollar spent
on R&D investment is likely to have much higher return than a dollar spent on subsidy, then
these figures imply a significant scope for reallocating government funds in order to increase the
total return on the limited government financial resources.
Another commonly considered indicator of fiscal impact is the size of subsidy in relation to the
total income of the sector. This is shown in the bottom half of Table 11. The estimated crop
subsidies (only direct output and input payments, not considering the MPS) have been fairly
stable at around 8 to 10 percent of
total crop GDP, with a slight
increase in 2012, and averaging
around 9 percent. On the contrary,
the livestock subsidies were much
less, ranging from 1 to 3 percent
and generally rising from 2009 to
2012. Thus the combined ratio for
the primary agriculture subsidies
(crop and livestock) to its
corresponding GDP ranged from 2
to 4 percent from 2009 to 2012. The
value in 2008 was relatively high
due to the one time large payment
to Cashmere goat herders. The final The  livestock GDP in general is about four times that of the crop production

payments for agriculture and non-agriculture programs ranged from 0.8 percent of national GDP
in 2009 to 1.6 percent in 2011, with an overall average of 1.4 percent from 2008 to 2012. The
relative size of subsidies seems small but their ratios (2009-2012) to the GDP, which itself is
growing at very high rate, is also increasing. Furthermore, the rising share of subsidies suggests
likely squeezing out of other productive investments and R&D and allocations to agriculture
sector.




The issues discussed in the preceding chapters have a number of important policy implications,
and point to a similar number of recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of agriculture subsidies in Mongolia.
1. Rationalize agricultural subsidy programs. By 2012, there were seven direct payments or
   grants programs and seven loan programs with varied terms and conditions for herders,
   farmers, and processors covering crops, livestock, and agro-processing companies. A number
   of these funds, grants, and soft loan schemes overlap in mandate and in intended
   beneficiaries, for instance the SME Fund operated by the Ministry of Labor also covers soft
   loans for primary agriculture that overlap with MIA’s programs targeting the very same
   beneficiaries. Subsidy schemes are authorized under parliamentary decrees, while funds
   typically come from the Government as ad-hoc extra-budgetary allocations to the concerned
   ministries. No clear or transparent method for determining the level of subsidies appears to
   be in place. Therefore, it is recommended that the streamlining and rationalization of
   agricultural subsidy programs be carried out to help resolve the inconsistencies and
   overlapping of objectives and beneficiaries and to improve the overall structure,
   implementation costs and efficiency.

2. Eliminate negative Market Price Support (MPS) and address problems of market
   structure. According to the findings of this study, market price support (MPS) was negative
   for both wheat and wool during some years of the five year period. This implies that part of
   the government budgetary transfers went only to compensate for implicit taxation. In the
   absence of domestic market price reduction policies, the negative MPS arises mainly due to
   the lack of competitive market structure and a rise in the international price of the commodity
   without domestic price transmission. To understand why the farm gate and the local market
   prices are lower than the equivalent competitive market prices a study of market structure
   and performance, and of the roles of various intermediaries and their margins in the
   marketing channel should be undertaken to inform policy that reduces the need for
   further subsidies by improving market efficiency.

3. Develop alternative strategies for investing in agriculture other than subsidies. If the
   main objective of a subsidy is to increase production, it is recommended that more efficient
   options, particularly investments in the General Services Support (GSS) through research and
   development, education and training, infrastructure improvements, inspection and health
   services, among others, be followed. This is particularly important in the case of Mongolia,
   given that the subsidy outlays are more than double the MIA’s investment budget and nearly
   nine times higher than expenditures on agricultural R&D. The common conclusion from the

                                                                                               31
   literature is that a dollar spent on R&D investment is likely to yield much higher return than
   a dollar spent on subsidy. If this is true then the reallocation of funds can increase the total
   returns to the limited government financial resources. The literature suggests that investing in
   road infrastructure, eliminating bureaucratic hurdles and augmenting the performance of
   financial institutions is preferable to subsidizing fertilizer, for example (Banful, 2011).
   Rather than providing blanket subsidies, funds can be provided more selectively to support
   productivity and profitability enhancing measures. Examples of such highly productive
   activities mentioned by some of the stakeholders include - facilities for on-farm storage of
   crops, fencing of fields as animal herds can destroy farmers’ field crops, assistance for
   minimal grain processing (cleaning, sorting, grading), establishment and improved access to
   centralize grain marketing system, among others.

4. Subsidies to the livestock sector should take into account environmental consequences,
   including ecological carrying capacity, and the long term sustainability of pasture
   resources. Direct subsidies to specific groups of livestock herders are fairly controversial
   given their potential to promote bigger herd sizes. According to the MIA’s own estimates the
   current levels of animals have surpassed ecological limits by as much as nine times in some
   aimags. Subsidy programs for the livestock sector in Mongolia generally provide short term
   financial support to herders and do not greatly contribute to improved long term food security
   or improved economic efficiency. They may be even be responsible for increasing the
   number of head of livestock already at the unsustainable levels and thus raise overall
   environmental costs. As shown in the literature, the economic efficiency of production may
   not improve if the subsidies do not bring about any permanent structural or technological
   change (Jayne and Rashid; Dorward). It is noted, however, that the newly reformed
   Mongolian National Livestock Program aims to improve the quality of livestock
   commodities, modernize production systems and help adopt improved technologies but it is
   not yet fully funded or implemented for lack of financial resources. Therefore, it is
   recommended that the support to the livestock sector remain mindful of the environmental
   implications and follow the provisions of MNLP rather than the ad-hoc payments to the
   sector.

5. Adopting a smart subsidies strategy. The so-called smart subsidies described in the
   literature can play an important role in a successful agricultural and broader socio-economic
   development, especially when effectively applied to overcome market failures constraining
   productive use of modern inputs and technology. Smart subsidies typically involve an
   objective of pro-poor economic growth, the development of local markets, and the promotion
   of competition in input supply, the pursuit of regional integration and clarity of an exit
   strategy, among other desirable goals. The market smart subsidies also include innovative
   financing, voucher systems, warehouse receipt schemes, etc. intended to reduce input delivery
   costs and improve targeting to promote private input markets, the adoption of new
   technologies by poor farmers, increased output, and ultimately poverty reduction. Therefore, it
   is recommended that smart subsidy options, to the extent possible, be considered as a
   policy intervention when designing safety net programs that are economically
   productive and socially equitable.

6. Subsidies to the agro-processing industry. In addition to the primary agriculture sector,
   subsidies are also provided to a variety of agro-processors, including wool and cashmere
   processors, flour mills, and meat processors. The primary objective of this support has been
   to help the overall competitiveness of the local processing companies vis-à-vis foreign ones,
   by helping them to modernize and acquire economies of scale Subsidies to this sector are

                                                                                                32
   also justified under the objective of growth and employment creation. For example, subsidies
   to wool and cashmere processors have forced them to organize themselves into associations,
   which may have implications for the export of raw wool and cashmere material. On the other
   hand, the national association of processors decides the overall maximum price level and
   where local companies operate exclusively in designated areas, thus reducing competition.
   Herders may have reduced bargaining power in the process. Similarly, there may be
   unintended consequences of wheat price subsidies, such as mills having the added bargaining
   power over farmers in accepting their deliveries of wheat especially when the deadline of the
   price subsidy period approaches. Subsidies to the agro-industry were beyond the scope of this
   study but it is very important to analyze the impact of the payments to agro-processing
   firms so that future interventions are guided by the experience and effectiveness of
   these subsidies.

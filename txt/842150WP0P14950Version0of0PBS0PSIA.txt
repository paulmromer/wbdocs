Summary and Recommendations
Ethiopia’s Approach to Basic Service Delivery

       Like the majority of developing countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America (Treisman
2007, Manor 1999), Ethiopia has opted for a highly decentralized approach to service delivery in
agriculture extension, basic education, primary health care, rural roads and water supply. This
follows a long tradition of theoretical analyses of how decentralizing government could make
government more responsive to diverse local needs, and more efficient in the provision of public
goods (e.g. Besley and Coate 2003, Faguet 2012, Oates 1972, and Tiebout 1956, to name a few).

        In Ethiopia, these services are primarily managed at the woreda (district) level and mostly
financed by Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers (IGFTs), though some woredas do raise own
revenues. Block grants for decentralized services have been co-financed by development partners
through the Promotion of Basic Services (PBS) program, which not only provides development
partner resources for service provision, but also supports a variety of measures designed to improve
service quality as well local government capacity. Influenced by the idea of an accountability
triangle as presented in the 2004 World Development Report1 (Figure 1), PBS also supports the
direct voice of citizens by emphasizing transparency and governance for the block grants through a
variety of measures. These range from financial transparency and citizen education on budget
issues, to grievance redress mechanisms and specific measures for social accountability.

Overall Findings

       Ethiopia’s service delivery model for basic services reflects a successful application of model
proposed in WDR 2004 Improving Services for the Poor. The WDR linked improved services to
improved accountability of service providers – both through a long route where citizens influence
services providers through the government and a short route direct accountability between service
providers and government. The Ethiopia states holds service providers strictly accountable for
results working through local governments where local authorities are held accountable by regional
and federal levels. There is a degree of local competition for power and influence which makes local
authorities responsible to results and open to feedback from citizens – thus the long route of
accountability works well in Ethiopia specially because of decentralization. In addition, the short
route of accountability is enforced by three elements – financial transparency and accountability,
grievance redress mechansims reporting directly to the independent Ethiopia Institution of the
Ombudsman and finally structured social accountability systems providing direct citizen service
provider interaction.

       Woreda-level spending financed through IGFTs, and supported by PBS, have been a very
effective way of pushing Ethiopia forward to attaining its MDG goals. Health and education
spending account for 80% of PBS-financed woreda spending. Health spending pays for health
extension workers while education spending pays for teachers. The link between recruiting
personnel and actual delivery of services must be treated with caution, and indeed is being explored
further though an on-going Bank study. This study finds evidence of increases in utilization of health
services due to the intervention of health extension workers, especially among the poorest quintiles.
Econometric results show that a US$1 increase in woreda health spending per capita could be
associated with increases in the contraceptive prevalence rate of 6.4%, and in the percentage of

births delivered by skilled birth attendants of 11.3%2. Both of these contribute sharply to reducing
maternal mortality, as global evidence shows and recent results from Ethiopia confirm. Similarly, an
increase of US$1 per capita of woreda-level health spending is associated with an increase in
coverage of Antenatal care by 3.6%, which can significantly help reduce infant and child mortality.
With regard to education, an increase of US$1 per capita in woreda-level education spending is
associated with a 3.6% increase in the net primary enrollment rate within that woreda. In addition,
woreda health and education-level spending is pro-poor, with 58% of the incidence accruing to the
two bottom quintiles. On-going work on incidence analysis in the Ethiopian part of a multi-country
study3 finds the overall incidence of health and education spending on the bottom 40% to be 33%
which is not pro-poor compared to woreda spending. The same study finds that primary education
spending (which is mostly woreda based) is pro-poor – confirming these findings. These results
demonstrate the power of the PBS-financed decentralized approach to improving access to basic
services. Similarly, woreda-level agriculture spending, primarily for agriculture extension workers,
drives increases in output and the adoption of new, improved methods across all asset quintiles.

        Agriculture, education and health account for 97% of woreda spending, which in turn
comprises 97% of PBS financed IGFTspending. The remaining 3% supports citizen engagement,
improvement of local level capacity to manage resources, and improved national-level information.
While it is difficult to provide precise estimates of the impact of the latter activities, the direction of
their effect is clear: spending efficiency is improved through better capacity, more transparency, and
more citizen accountability.

Objectives

       The primary objective of this study is to assess the association of woreda-level expenditures
for decentralized service provision on key policy outputs and human outcomes. A secondary
objective was to assess the incidence of these expenditures by income quintile, in line with the
Bank’s new objective of shared growth that targets the bottom 40%. A third objective was to
investigate possible ethnic biases in the allocation of woreda-level block grants, and if so, whether
any bias is in line with the constitutional objective of providing additional resources to historically
underserved populations.

Citizen Voice

       The PBS’ social accountability program generally increased demand-side opportunities for
constructive citizens-state collaborations to improve basic public services in pilot areas. Evidence
shows that the program increased citizen awareness of their rights, responsibilities and entitlements
to basic services, with over 84% of those surveyed in pilot areas responding positively. Citizens have
also become more aware of their government budgeting process, and are intervening more
effectively in pushing for their rights as a result of the Financial Transparency and Accountability
(FTA) component.

        PBS has also improved the efficiency of resource use by improving financial management
and procurement capacity at the woreda level via support for accountability to citizens through
financial transparency, social accountability, and a formal grievance redress mechanism (under the
Ethiopian Institution of the Ombudsman). Even though Woreda’s in Ethiopia have to operate under
Federal guidelines, they can still exert a significant amount of discretion and can affect the quality of
life and services.

Effectiveness

       The analysis finds that woreda-level spending in education, health and agriculture is
effective in achieving important results in each sector. It is improving net enrolments in education,
access to basic services in health, and increasing productivity in agriculture. These three sectors
account for 97% of woreda-level spending, and thus the spending can be considered both effective
and well-targeted. The results reported in the summary are based on the log-linear regression
estimates. Linear and non-linear regressions were also estimated and the results are presented as an
Annex.

        The study considered two education-related indicators: the net primary enrollment rate
(NER), and the pupil teacher ratio (PTR). These are both included in the PBS 3 Results Framework as
direct objectives that the project aims to improve. For both there is a strong, significant relationship
with woreda-level per capita recurrent expenditure, when controlling for the effects of rural/urban
population and ethnicity. Table 1 shows the relevant regression results. For every additional
Ethiopia Birr per capita in woreda education spending, there is an NER increase of 0.19%. Expressed
in US dollar terms, a $1 increase in per capita spending yields a 3.6% increase in the NER. These
results are significant at the 1% level, and are robust to different data sources.

       The analysis of woreda-level expenditures in health shows a positive association with access
to antenatal care, contraceptive prevalence rate, and deliveries by skilled birth attendants. These
are primary drivers that reduce child mortality (MDG 4) and maternal mortality (MDG 5). Log-linear
regression results using woreda-level data are corroborated using probit regressions on DHS 2011
household data. We find that visits from health extension workers increase the probability of
contraceptive use, vaccinations, use of antenatal care and assisted childbirths in both rural and
urban areas. Most of these results were found significant for all five DHS wealth quintiles.

        In agriculture, the effect of woreda-level spending on agriculture extension workers
increases yields for major crops such as cereals, vegetables, enset, coffee and fruits. When the data
is divided into plot size quintiles, we find that spending on agriculture extension workers increases
the probability of using improved farming techniques across all quintiles.

        Taken together, the results underline that Ethiopia’s rapid progress towards its MDG goals is
a direct result of the country’s highly decentralized approach to basic service delivery.

Equity

       The analysis also considered equity consequences by income/wealth group, gender,
ethnicity and geography. Overall the report finds the incidence of PBS financed IGFT expenditure on
equity in income/wealth terms to be positive, in that benefits accrued to all quintiles in all sectors.
The results are better still in health and education – the incidence of IGFT resources was much
higher for the bottom two quintiles, where 58% of total benefit incidence accrues. In agriculture,
the magnitude was smaller for the bottom quintile, which could be related to a lack of financing to
purchase necessary inputs.

        Gender effect was also positive, especially for education and health. In Ethiopia, 87% of
farmers are males. Access to extension services for female farmers was tested and found to favor
males. It is not clear whether this bias is driven by a gender difference in choice of crops or quality of
land, or some other inherent gender bias.

       An analysis of the regional incidence of PBS-financed IGFT benefits found the two most
favored regions to be Gambella and Benishangul-Gumuz –two of the historically most disadvantaged
regions in the country. Similarly, ethnic dimensions were analyzed and found to favor some
                                                                                                     8


historically disadvantaged groups, in accordance with constitutional provisions though in the Somali
regions even though federal transfers to the region appears to be fine, the region transfers a much
smaller share to woredas making woreda level spending lower than would be needed in lagging
areas.

Conclusions and Recommendations

        The evidence shows that decentralized spending at the woreda level is both effective and
pro-poor. The estimates provided here imply that Ethiopia is far from decreasing returns, and hence
there is scope to increase such spending further to accelerate progress towards its MDGs. It should
be noted that causality from woreda spending to results is direct for education where teachers help
drive enrolments and catalytic in health and agriculture where the health and agriculture extension
workers help increase the effectiveness of system wide spending.

        Some of Ethiopia’s historically disadvantaged areas are significantly favored under the
current regime. The distribution of expenditure across space is broadly equal amongst Ethiopia’s
woredas, with the striking exception of a small number of woredas concentrated in the country’s
most disadvantaged regions that receive significantly greater resources. By contrast, the most
disadvantaged woredas in terms of resource flows are concentrated in the more developed,
historically dominant regions. Five majority-Anyiwak woredas are noteworthy for receiving the most
public resources of all woredas in the nation. The one exception to this appears to be the Somali
group which is the largest among the historically underserved groups and this could call for revisions
to the regional government allocations to the woredas – Somali region (with the exception of single
city regions such as Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa and Harar) transferred the smallest share of its federal
allocation – 49% - the woredas compared to average for all regions minus Addis Ababa which was
73% during the four years for our data set.

       In contrast to the predictions of some public management theories, the decentralized
provision of services in Ethiopia is not increasing regional, ethnic or gender inequalities in terms of
investment inputs or service outputs. Indeed, we found the opposite effect in education and health,
where the incidence of PBS financed IGFT resources was disproportionately high amongst the
bottom two quintiles, and for women. Hence support for decentralized services in Ethiopia appears
to be an effective use of development partner resources from both efficiency and equity
perspectives.

       The exception to these findings is agriculture, where the effect of expenditures was smaller
for the bottom quintile. This could be related to many other factors including access to inputs,
quality of land and water management issues which could not controlled for (except for rainfall).

        Although quantitative evidence is unavailable at present, descriptive evidence implies that
structured feedback sessions between citizens and service providers have helped to strengthen
citizens’ participation in pilot areas under ESAP1, on which basis ESAP2 is being implemented. This
experience, combined with the strong recommendations of theories of governance and
accountability, point to a need for continued application of social accountability tools, and seeking
acceptable policy options for sustainability in the Ethiopian context. This conclusion will be verified
when the results of the impact assessment of ESAP-2 are available – currently only data is from the
baseline survey.

       It is difficult to overstate the difficulty of doing subnational empirical work on Ethiopia.
Creating the database required for this report has required a huge amount of work and
improvisation on the part of the research team. A major output of this study is the production of a
standardized database of woreda-level expenditures and characteristics, which will be made public.
                                                                                             9


It is our hope that this dataset will in time become a useful tool for researchers and students
elsewhere in Africa and beyond.
Introduction and Background
Country and Sector Background

1.        Ethiopia has achieved impressive development results in recent years. That progress
includes rapid and significant improvements in basic service delivery indicators. An Overseas
Development Institute study4 noted that Ethiopia is making the third-fastest improvements of any
country towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The latest Ethiopia
Demographic and Health Survey data show that child mortality has fallen from 123 per thousand in
2005 to 88 in 2010, and primary net enrollment rates rose from 68 percent in 2004/2005 to 82
percent in 2009/2010. This progress on basic service delivery is coupled with an impressive growth
record over the past 10 years. GDP grew on average 11 percent per annum during 2004/5-2009/10,
according to official estimates. Initially led by agriculture, growth has become more broad-based,
with a rising contribution from the mining, services and manufacturing sectors. While growth has
slowed recently, it still remains among the highest in the world. Together, a sharp focus on
decentralized basic service delivery, efforts to maintain equity, and rapid growth have led to overall
improvements in welfare. Based on official data, the population below the national absolute poverty
line fell from 38.7 percent in 2004/2005 to 29.6 percent in 2011.

2.       These MDG, growth and poverty results spring from a long-term, concerted government
commitment to pro-poor development. Building on the Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program 2002-2004/5, and A Plan For Accelerated and Sustained Development to End
Poverty 2005-2010 (PASDEP), the government’s current development plan, the Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP), aims to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and middle-
income status for Ethiopia by 2020-2023. Ethiopia achieved the MDG-4 (Child Mortality) target
earlier this year, ahead of schedule, and appears to be on track to reach the other MDGs by 2015
according the UN progress reports5.

3.       The Constitution and legal framework commit the government to maintain the integrity and
capacity of decentralized administrations down to woreda level6. Within Ethiopia’s federal
structure, central government provides un-earmarked block grants through regional governments.
These in turn provide block grants to woreda administrations, which deliver decentralized services to
citizens. This administrative and financial structure has provided timely, predictable financing that
supports a steady and impressive increase in basic services throughout the country. This follows a
long tradition of theoretical analyses of how decentralizing government could make government
more responsive to diverse local needs, and more efficient in the provision of public goods (e.g.
Besley and Coate 2003, Faguet 2012, Oates 1972, and Tiebout 1956, to name a few).

4.       There is a need to consider whether the approach followed by the government is cost-
effective within the decentralized constitutional context. Basic services are primarily the role of local
governments, and therefore building local government capacity is an important element in
improving basic services for the bottom 40%. Its fiscal architecture additionally makes Ethiopia a
rich, promising empirical setting for investigating the effectiveness of decentralization as a tool for
improving public sector outputs, in terms of both quality and distribution. The evidence that
Ethiopia can offer is especially welcome in light of the inconclusive nature of the empirical evidence
that has accumulated over the past four decades.

5.       Consider the broadest empirical surveys: Rondinelli, Cheema and Nellis (1983) note that
decentralization has usually disappointed its partisans. Most developing countries implementing
decentralization experienced serious administrative problems. Although few comprehensive
evaluations of the benefits and costs of decentralization efforts have been conducted, those that
were attempted indicate limited success in some countries but not others. A decade and a half later,
surveys by Piriou-Sall (1998), Manor (1999) and Smoke (2001) are slightly more positive, but with
caveats about the strength of the evidence in decentralization’s favor. Manor notes that the
evidence, though extensive, is still incomplete, but ends his study with the opinion that ‘while
decentralization …is no panacea, it has many virtues and is worth pursuing’. Smoke, by contrast,
finds the evidence mixed and anecdotal, and asks whether there is empirical justification for
pursuing decentralization at all. Given the sheer size of this literature, the lack of progress is
surprising.

6.      It is worth noting that more recent empirical studies, which are often technically more
sophisticated as developing-country datasets have improved enormously over recent decades, are
generally more positive about decentralization’s potential. Five recent studies that address the link
between decentralization and substantive outcomes directly and with rigorous quantitative evidence
include: Escaleras and Register (Forthcoming), who find that fiscal decentralization is associated with
lower natural disaster death rates, implying more effective preparation and/or responses to natural
disasters by countries with decentralized governments. Clark (2009) applies regression discontinuity
to a natural experiment from Britain to show that schools that opt out of the centralized educational
regime – in effect decentralizing themselves – enjoy large increases in student achievement. Galiani,
Gertler and Schargrodsky (2008) find that decentralization of school control from central to
provincial governments in Argentina had a positive impact on student test scores. The poorest,
however, did not gain, and indeed may have lost. And Barankay and Lockwood (2007) find that
greater decentralization of education to Swiss cantons is associated with higher educational
attainment, especially for boys. This study hopes to add empirical evidence from a low income
country with large, important decentralization and public investment programs, where results are
potentially significant.

Report Context and Structure

7.      This report is part of a programmatic knowledge series which will include future reports
which will go further on the issues covered. These reports would include among others studies
based on services delivery quality in health and education based on on-going surveys as well detailed
survey based impact assessment the Promotion of Basic Services (PBS) program Promotion of Basic
Services (PBS) program based on multi-round surveys over the next three years, an impact
assessment of the Social Accountability component of Promotion of Basic Services (PBS) program for
which baseline survey has taken place and a full report is due in two years – all of these studies will
further elucidate the findings in this report. There will also be a further update of this report when
the results from the mini-DHS are available next year but this report is being prepared at this time to
provide input to the Government’s next Growth and Transformation Plan. This programmatic
knowledge series complements another programmatic knowledge series in Ethiopia led by the
Poverty Reduction Economic Management network which will include a poverty assessment, public
expenditure reviews and address growth and employment issues.

8.      This report is structured with a section describing the Promotion of Basic Services (PBS)
program and inter-government fiscal transfers underlying Ethiopia’s decentralized federal structure.
That section will be followed by a section on study approach and then a section on the governance
and accountability framework underlying the program. After that there will be a section on the
                                                                                                  12


effectiveness of Ethiopia’s intergovernmental transfers program (IGFT) on development results in
Education, Health and Agriculture which will be followed by a section on the equity impact of the
program focusing on income equity, gender equity, spatial equity and ethnic equity. That will be
followed by conclusions and annexes including an annex on methodology.

The Promotion of Basic Services Project

9.       Block grants for decentralized services have been co-financed by Ethiopia’s development
partners through the Promotion of Basic Services (PBS) program, although the government share is
larger and rising. The block grants are distributed from federal government to regional governments
using a formula that adjust for population, and need based on level of development and historic lack
of access to services. The funds are transmitted from the regions to woredas using regional
formulas based on similar criteria. This program not only provides development partner financial
support for block grants to woredas, but also supports a variety of measures designed to improve
service quality as well local government capacity to manage basic services. Influenced by the
accountability triangle presented in the 2004 World Development Report7 (Figure 1) which considers
that the long route of accountability between citizens and services providers through government
needs to complemented by the short route which involved direct accountabity of service providers
to citizens.

10.      The Ethiopia states holds service providers strictly accountable for results working through
local governments where local authorities are held accountable by regional and federal levels. There
is a degree of local competition for power and influence which makes local authorities responsible to
results and open to feedback from citizens – thus the long route of accountability works well in
Ethiopia specially because of decentralization. In addition, the short route of accountability is
enforced by three elements – financial transparency and accountability, grievance redress
mechansims reporting directly to the independent Ethiopia Institution of the Ombudsman and finally
structured social accountability systems providing direct citizen service provider interaction.

11.     Recognizing the critical role of good information to improve development outcomes, PBS
finances a range of surveys and data collection and management efforts. Capacity building efforts
include financial management and procurement for local woredas, in addition to other needs based
on demand.

12.     Woreda-level block grants primarily support locally-recruited staff in the five decentralized
sectors. With some minor exceptions, woredas have very little own revenue and no other regular

and predictable transfers which can be used for staff. Hence total woreda spending in sectors
relevant to the PBS is taken here as a proxy for block grants, which are co-financed by PBS partners
and the Government8. Health sector spending is focused on health extension workers, education
spending on teachers, agriculture spending on agriculture extension workers, roads spending on
road maintenance staff, and water sector spending on recurrent costs for water systems. In
agriculture, education, and health there is a one-to-one correlation between woreda-level block
grant spending and agriculture extension workers, teachers, and health extension workers
respectively.

13.     The Promotion of Basic Services Project is primary means by which the World Bank assists
Ethiopia to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At its inception in 2006, Ethiopia had just

 Over a five year period starting from January 2013, the current Phase of PBS finances US$6.2 billion in basic
service block grants which are analyzed here of which the Government share is US$3.2 billion – the rest
coming from development partners.
                                                                                                       14


started to register noticeable improvements in human development indicators, albeit from low
absolute levels. The PBS 1 PAD stated clearly the need to maintain this nascent progress in the face
of political and economic uncertainly: “These gains represent the first steps on a steep development
trajectory that Ethiopia will need to sustain if it is to have a chance to meet any of the MDGs?. Seven
years on, it has become obvious that Ethiopia, with the support of the World Bank and other
Development Partners through the PBS, has sustained and even over-performed on all of these
expectations. The current phase of PBS (Phase 3) costs US$6.4 billion over five years, of which about
half is financed by the government. Table 1 shows the evolution of Federal Block Grants (FBG) to
regions from the Federal Government while Table 2 shows the evolution of Woreda Block Grants
(WBG) from regions to woredas.

14.      While playing a wide role across many of the eight MDGs, the PBS focuses principally on
three: Achieving universal primary school education (Goal 2), Reducing child mortality (Goal 4), and
Improving maternal health (Goal 5). It also has a direct impact on the eradication of extreme poverty
and hunger (Goal 1), and the promotion of gender equality (Goal 3). In order to assist in these goals,
the PBS mechanism channels resources to the woreda (local) level to finance recurrent expenditures
in five basic-service sectors – education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and rural roads.
Taking advantage of Ethiopia’s well-developed system of fiscal decentralization, which was well
underway when the project began, has allowed PBS to utilize these existing pathways to efficiently
deliver and expand services. Once at the local level, the vast majority of funds pay for the
deployment of frontline development workers, where this financing has a direct association with
meeting MDG targets. Health extension workers, for example, are a cadre of frontline health
workers who are trained to promote healthy preventative behaviors and provide basic interventions,
such as vaccinations and family planning information. This is directly associated with reducing child
mortality and improving maternal health. Additional teachers are directly related to increasing the
net enrollment rate in order to achieve universal primary education. Through its first two phases,
PBS financed IGFTs helped to hire over 100,000 new primary school teachers, 38,000 health
extension workers and 45,000 agricultural extension agents, dramatically expanding the reach of
these services to those previously inaccessible.

   15.     Despite this impressive scale of the PBS, up to now there has been no empirical analysis
   demonstrating the effects of project spending on the outcomes achieved. Partly this has been due to
   the difficulty of obtaining local-level expenditure and outcome data over time. Compiling
   comprehensive expenditure data through time and consolidating it into a database with output
   indicators in health and education (also with the same time period) has been one of this study’s
   accomplishments. This study first addresses the data deficiency, and then provides empirical analysis
   on the effectiveness of Ethiopia’s decentralized approach to basic service delivery.

   Study Approach
   Conceptual Framework

   16.     A primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of woreda-level expenditures for
   decentralized sectors on key sector outputs and outcomes.9 As noted in the previous section, there is
   a strong association between woreda-level spending in agriculture, education and health, and key
   service outputs, such as the numbers of agriculture extension workers, teachers and health
   extension workers respectively.

                                              crops

   17.     This study focuses on such outcomes as the net enrollment rate, rates of vaccination and
   contraceptive use, and agricultural yields of a variety of crops (see figure 2 for a diagrammatic
   representation of PBS results chain). It should be emphasized that the link between spending on
   staff and results cannot be one to one and service availability and use needs to be assessed as well.
   Unfortunately this data is not available except to a limited extent in health where the DHS data


   9
     The study does not look at quality and service delivery effectiveness issues. PBS-3 is funding service delivery
   indicator data collection for health and education and future studies are planned on those results.
                                                                                                      16


shows that utilization of services is driven by health extension workers especially for the poor10. A
secondary objective is to assess the incidence of local expenditures by income quintile in line with
the Bank’s new objective of shared growth targeting the bottom 40%. A third objecti ve is to
investigate possible ethnic bias in the allocation of woreda-level block grants, keeping in mind
Ethiopia’s constitutional objective of providing additional resources to historically underserved
populations.

18.      Caveats to note. It should be noted that learning materials are financed separately in
education, facilities above the health center are financed separately in health, in agriculture this only
include development agent spending, and road maintenance staff spending in roads. Clearly, results
found in the sectors are affected by spending from other levels of government, including capital
spending and non-salary recurrent costs in education. The results shown in health show the catalytic
effect of health extension workers on the results and does not include the contributions of capital
spending, spending on medicines etc., which are taken as given. The contribution of health extension
workers appears to be extremely important especially for the poor11. The results in agriculture
would not be possible without the contribution of other spending both public and private, and only
reflects the catalytic effective of agriculture extension workers (or development agents).

19.      Another objective of this study, in line with the WDR 2004 triangle of accountability concept,
is to assess PBS components designed to strengthen citizen voice as a critical element driving service
improvements. Following this causal logic, the study investigates the effectiveness of Citizen Voice
aspects of the program before turning to the effectiveness of the spending on outcomes.

20.     One caveat should be mentioned. As always, the results presented are subject to the quality
of data used. While the management information systems of the education and health systems,
especially the former, are fairly reliable and improving (not least through PBS support), there still
remains much room for improvement. Fortunately, our results in health and education are
confirmed by national level analysis of DHS data. Our agriculture analysis used agriculture sample
survey data, which is considered reliable.

Methodology

21.     This study relies on a database of woreda-level recurrent expenditure and outcome
information for a variety of health and education indicators at woreda level between 2008 and 2011.
Also included are woreda demographic characteristics, including the population, ethnicities, rural vs.
urban, and other variables drawn from the 2007 census. We use econometric modeling to assess the
association of increased local spending with the expansion of basic services and outcomes, and by
extension the efficiency of the PBS in meeting its development objective. The study also verifies the
woreda level findings in health and education using the household data from DHS 2005 and DHS
2011 including use of limited dependent variable (primarily probit) regressions to predict impact on
household behavior resulting from interactions with health extension agents.

rural/urban percentage and ethnicity. A variable for time was also included to isolate the time series
effects from other effects. Other control variables were percent rural and ethnicity of the woreda
(which is a good proxy for historical lags in development). The results presented in the main text are
from log-linear regressions, which we prefer because they eliminate the effects of extreme values
and allow for declining returns to scale. Linear regressions and quadratic regressions were also
estimated but not reported in the main report. They are in the Annex.

23.      The indicators evaluated are mostly drawn from the PBS Results Framework. In those sectors
for which no reliable outcome data at local level could be gathered – two different approaches are
followed one for agriculture and one for water supply and roads. In agriculture, zonal level data is
available for outcomes. By taking the average per capita woreda spending on agriculture as a proxy
for agriculture extension workers, zonal outcome data can be used to assess the effectiveness of this
spending. Data constraints are more severe for water supply and roads, forcing us to revert to desk
reviews.12

24.      It is difficult to overstate the difficulty of doing subnational empirical work on Ethiopia. As
far as can be gleaned from official sources, relatively little data is collected, the data is often of poor
quality, and few attempts are made to systematize the results into any obviously comparable
framework. A few illustrations are telling. Fiscal data on subnational expenditures in health,
education, agriculture, water, and roads were until very recently available only for EFY 2003. Their
geographic identifying codes and names do not match those of census data, whose geographic codes
and names vary in unpredictable but pervasive ways from fiscal data. The last census counted some
740 woredas, zones, and regions, but the fiscal dataset includes more than 850. Consolidating these
two yielded a dataset of 989 subnational units, 250 more than in the census.

12
  Normally, DHS has good water supply data but in the case of Ethiopia due some definitional changes the
water supply data between the two rounds of DHS are not compatible. This is also true for national data as
revealed in a recent census.
                                                                                                            18


25.     The analysis consists of three key stages. Stage I follows the approach of Faguet (2012) and
Faguet and Sánchez (2013), examining the relationship between woreda-level spending in each
sector and results in those sectors. Ideally we would use first differences on the outcome LHS
variables. But unfortunately the few years of data we currently have available make this impractical.
So instead we place levels on the LHS and in effect estimate trends.

26.     Stage II conducts an incidence analysis of woreda-level spending by quintiles, using the
wealth quintile breakdown from the DHS survey. The incidence analysis was done by allocating
improvements in health and education outcomes to each quintile by pro-rating the expenditure
increases to each quintile by the improvement in outcomes achieved for that quintile controlling for
the average improvement for all groups13. The results indicator for education was the net enrolment
rate which is directly affected by woreda recruited teachers where for health the results indicator is
average of three indicators which are directly affected by locally recruited health extension workers.
These are: increase use of contraception, increased rates of immunization, increased use of pre-
natal care and increased use skilled birth attendants.

27.     Stage III uses limited dependent variable regressions to examine the link between woreda
expenditure and sectoral results for different wealth quintiles14 to estimate probabilities of
households acting in a certain manner. This three stage analysis was limited to sectors where data
on woreda-level results was reliable, and corresponding household survey data on health and
education available. In the case of education, the third stage test was not considered necessary due
the direct linkage between woreda-level spending, which is mostly for teachers, and the Net
Enrolment Rate. This was needed for health because the linkage is more indirect. Woreda-level
spending is on health extension workers, and therefore the link between contact with health
extension workers and health sector outcomes was tested using DHS data.

28.     With regard to agriculture, results (or output data) was not available at the woreda level –
only at the zonal level. Incidence analysis was not possible, but the effect of agriculture extension
services by land-holding quintile was analyzed. In the case of water supply, a recent national census
found that the data was unreliable, and thus analysis was not carried out for this sector either
nationally or locally. But as this accounts for only 2% of woreda-level expenditures, this does not
really pose a problem. Finally, for roads – which account for only one percent of woreda-level
expenditures – this level of in-depth analysis was not possible.

Citizen Direct Voice and Accountability
29.    Ethiopia has increased the level of accountability of service providers through
decentralization which allows a closer link between the service staff and citizens. This has been
complemented with financial transparency, social accountability and a grievance redress
mechanism.

Decentralization

30.     Decentralization in Ethiopia allows for enforcement of the long route of accountability
through the woreda level of government. The Woreda’s are held responsible by Federal and
Regional Governments for the delivery of basic services and reaching the Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP) targets in these services and woreda leadership who actually recruit and


13
   This methodology was adopted due to the lack of data on direct use of different services by quintile. This
assumes a link between woreda recruited staff and results.
14
   Education and health quintiles were based on DHS quintiles while for agriculture the quintile estimates used
land-size quintiles.
                                                                                                           19


manage the teachers, health and agriculture extension workers. There is significant local
competition for these positions and office holders are keen to reach their service delivery targets.

31.      Unfortunately, woreda-level data from the pre-decentralization period are currently not
available. This means that we are unable to estimate the effects of decentralization per se, in the
sense of the transfer of expenditure and decision-making authority from upper to lower tiers of
government, on financial flows, service provision, or substantive outcomes. These are the common
questions about decentralization that the literature typically focuses on, which we hope to address
in future reports when data permit.

32.     But there are other, more micro-level questions that we can examine here. These concern
the effects of woreda-level discretion and decision-making on service quality and appropriateness to
local conditions. They are distinct from “big discretion? issues such as How should resources be
divided between investment and expenditure? How much should be spent on schools? Hospitals?
Roads? “Small discretion? questions, instead, concern issues such as On which side of a road or
stream should a new school be built? How should a vaccination campaign be targeted? When and
how exactly should a road be maintained? Such decisions are the bread and butter of local
government. They can increase the efficiency of public services by tailoring them to highly specific
local conditions and needs, thus squeezing more “bang? out of each public “buck?.

33.      Such issues are relevant in Ethiopia, and our still-limited data allows us to begin to address
them. Even though Ethiopia’s administrative decentralization comes with a lot of central directives,
decentralization has helped increase accountability – especially of service providers to citizens.
Although woredas operate under Federal guidelines, they still exercise a significant degree of “small
discretion? that affects the quality of local services and local life. In Ethiopia, while the decision to
allocate by sectors may be controlled due to central directives on staffing norms, the actual hiring of
staff is at the woreda level. This can be most important for matters such as staff attendance
(teachers, health and agriculture extension workers) because the hiring and paying authority is
present near where they work. In many countries where teachers are centrally recruited and
deployed – absenteeism rates tends to be very high close to 50%. The limited evidence currently
available in Ethiopia shows this to be about 15%15. Similarly the same study reports that only 10.4%
of respondents reported frequent absenteeism for health staff including health extension workers
whose rule is within community. The study also found that 96% of respondents reporting the
presence of agriculture extension workers in their kebele and 95% of them found them to be useful.
Absence from work makes the delivery of services impossible while presence allows the services to
be offered. This is the effect of small discretion. There is also evidence that a significant percentage
of the citizenry do contact their local governments with complaints.16 The limited evidence is that
decentralization does increase accountability and while this may be exercised by a limited section of
the population – it can have a positive effect on service delivery quality. Finally, Ethiopia’s
decentralization law also allows different ethnic/ language groups to request their own woreda and
also education in their own language – the latter can help increase learning effectiveness.

    These are based on initial results from baseline survey for Impact Assessment of PBS Social Accountability
component. This includes not just absence from school but also absence from the classroom. See Kamurase a
and Alibhai (2014)

Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA)

34.      Over the last five years, the Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) tools designed
under PBS have been rolled out and used to disclose regional and local-level budget and service
delivery information. As a result, more than 90% of all woredas and city administrations across the
country now post information on local budgets and service delivery targets and accomplishments
publicly. This is a significant change that has revolutionized transparency, as there was no such
public release of this key information before 2006. The effect of this has not been even all over the
country. In many regions, woreda officials are frequently challenged by citizens whereas in other
areas the effect is less. Over time this has been increasing the frequency of citizen’s raising issues of
budget and spending priorities with their local authorities. (see Annex C for more details).

35.     A recently conducted survey17 shows that 42.5% of respondents have seen FTA templates
posted in their jurisdictions, and 37% of those have discussed budget information with their
woreda/city officials, while another 26% have discussed the information with other citizens. In
addition to posting information, regions use radio and TV programs, brochures, t-shirts, and other
innovative means of information dissemination. Budget Literacy Training (BLT) was also delivered for
more than 230,000 citizens across the country in all woredas and city administrations. This has
contributed to enhance the understanding of citizens on budget process and service delivery issues.

36.      These efforts have helped improve citizen direct voice, with 37% of survey18 respondents
indicating that woreda and city officials had sought citizens views on budgetary issues, and 43%
revealing that officials had also sought the views of the people on the quality of public services.
Citizens have thus started to provide feedback on budget execution and participate in monitoring
project implementation. Creating linkage and synergies between FTA and Social Accountability will
play a significant role in promoting transparency and accountability in the system in years to come.

Social Accountability

37.     As a complement to the financial transparency and accountability results, the Social
Accountability program supports civil society organizations that improve opportunities for citizens to
provide feedback to local administrators and service providers. The social accountability component
piloted Community Score Cards, Citizen Report Cards and Participatory Budgeting. It also promoted
interface meetings between citizens and local authorities to provide feedback on service delivery.
During the earlier phases of PBS, social accountability was piloted in 86 woredas. During the current
phase, social accountability is being implemented in 224 woredas by a total of 49 Social
Accountability Implementing Partners (SAIPs) by supporting public service providers to deliver
improved quality of services in education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and rural roads,
in response to feedback from communities and citizen groups. PBS social accountability activities are
financed through a programmatic multi-donor trust fund administered by IDA, though without IDA
resources. During PBS Phase 3, the program will continue the use of tools piloted in the first phase,
including Community Score Cards, Citizen Report Cards, and Participatory Budgeting. Interface
meetings between users and providers of services, along with woreda and kebele officials, will also
continue, as will the development of agreed joint action plans monitored by joint committees of
service users and providers. Other social accountability tools will also be carefully considered based
on their value added, including participatory planning and budgeting, budget tracking, gender
responsive budgeting, and service charters (see Annex C for more details).

38.      The expansion of Social Accountability under the new phase of PBS is based on the findings
of an evaluation of the pilot phase.19 This found that the social accountability program had
increased citizen awareness of their rights, responsibilities, and entitlements to basic services, with
over 84% of those surveyed in pilot areas responding positively. Evidence showed that basic services
improved as a result of the joint service improvement plans drawn up between service providers and
users. The quality of engagement between citizens and service providers also improved as a result.
These findings bear out the prediction of the WDR 2004 model shown in Figure 1. Assessment was
not via formal evaluation, but relied more on recapitulative data; going forward a full evaluation has
been built into the design, and a baseline survey has been completed.

39.      An additional policy element being explored with the government is how to sustain
initiatives currently being implemented under social accountability. Initial thoughts point to a need
to strengthen linkages between social accountability and FTA, an evaluation of implementation of
recommendations on linkages, and an elaboration of more medium and long term choices based on
those evaluations.

Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM)

40.     A study20 conducted in Ethiopia under the auspices of PBS in 2011 found that GRMs exist in
several of the country’s regions using different regional level mechanisms established during the
past decade under the government’s various programs. However, the mechanisms were set up
differently and display significant variations in terms of legal underpinnings, government entity
responsible, accountability, procedures, and the finality and enforcement of grievance findings.

41.      PBS aims to help strengthen existing GRM offices at the regional/state level, including
contributing to information and public awareness of the services they provide, delivering technical
assistance to develop a common standard of grievance redress procedures, and capacity
development and training for grievance officers. PBS supports the opening of GRM offices in all
regions, and of Ethiopian Institution of the Ombudsman (EIO) branch offices, through dialogue and
by providing technical and financial support. It is currently financing capacity building trainings and
workshops conducted by the EIO for regional EIO branch offices and regional GRM officers, and
supporting studies and that will aid the standardization and improvement of the GRM system across
the country. It is an important contribution that supports the forum on which ordinary citizens can
air their complaints.

Effectiveness of Woreda Block Grant Spending
Association between Woreda Block Spending and Results: Education

42.      Over half of PBS IGFT resources channeled to local governments are used to hire primary
school teachers. According to the Demographic and Health Survey, between 2005 and 2011 the
primary net enrollment rate increased from 68 percent to 82 percent, and the primary completion
rate rose from 34 to 49 percent. (Secondary education expenditure is split between the woreda and
the region, and so has not yet been included in the analysis.) The analysis here focuses on the
association between Woreda level per capita education expenditures on enrolment rates and pupil-
teacher ratios. It does not consider non-salary recurrent costs in education which come from other
levels of government21 but this may not matter since in basic education teacher costs are more than
90% of total recurrent costs. The model also considers impact of the capital costs such as school
buildings which can drive enrolments. Capital expenditure is based on per capita expenditures at
the regional level since most capital spending is done by that level. The data is cross time pooled
data and a variable for time was also included to isolate the time series effects from other effects.
Other control variables were percent rural and ethnicity of the woreda (which is a good proxy for
historical lags in development). The results in Table 3 are from the log-linear regressions, which we
consider to be best form because they eliminate the effects of extreme values and allow for
declining returns to scale. Linear regressions and quadratic regressions were also estimated but not
reported here. They are in Annex-B.

43.      The study considered two education-related indicators - Net Enrollment Rate (NER) and
Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR). These are both included in the PBS 3 Results Framework as direct
objectives the project aims to improve. For both, there is a strong significant relationship with
woreda-level per capita recurrent expenditure, when controlling for the effects of rural/urban
percentage and ethnicity. Table 3 presents the main coefficients of interest from our regression
analysis. Full results are presented in Annex B. For every additional Ethiopia Birr per capita in
woreda education spending, NER increases by 0.20%. These results are all significant at the 1% level,
as well as robust to changes in specification. Similar results are seen with the PTR.

44.      About twenty percent of PBS financed IGFT resources at the local level are used in the health
sector, mainly for hiring frontline community health workers called health extension workers

45.      This study considered the association of expenditure on four health-related outcomes – the
Penta3 vaccination rate, percentage of pregnant women who received Antenatal Care (ANC),
Contraceptive Acceptance Rate (CAR), and percentage of Deliveries by Skilled Birth Attendants
(DelSBA). The first two of these are included in the PBS 3 Results Framework, while the latter two
were included in the Framework for PBS 2. Each is directly related to local-level health expenditure.
Table 4 presents the results. As for education, the data is cross time pooled data and variable for
time was also included to isolate the time series effects from other effects. Other control variables
were per capita capital expenditures (at the regional level) percent rural and ethnicity of the woreda
(which is a good proxy for historical lags in development. The results in Table 3 are from the log-
linear regressions which we considered to be best form because it eliminates the effects of extreme
values and allows for declining returns to scale. Linear regressions and quadratic regressions were
also estimated but not reported here. They are in the Annex.

46.     The results show that increased health expenditures by woredas improve rates of Penta 3
vaccinations, women receiving antenatal care, contraceptive use, and deliveries by SBAs. All of
these results are significant at the 1% level, and all are robust to changes in specification. Again as
for education, we only consider per capita woreda level spending which covers health extension
workers and health center staff. Non-salary and capital costs are not covered, but clearly can also
impact final results. HEWs can convince mothers to immunize their children, but the immunization
must also be available; these are financed separately.

47.      All of these indicators are directly related to the responsibilities of HEWs, where the majority
of local level recurrent health expenditure is directed. In terms of vaccination rates, HEWs are the
frontline workers meant to mobilize the community during immunization campaigns. They also are
the first source for pregnant women to seek ANC services, as well as being the primary spokespeople
informing the community of the importance of contraception in family planning. While not
technically “skilled birth attendants?, their focus on referral of pregnancies to those professionals in
health centers impacts the proportion of women who are able to give birth with a trained provider.

48.      A smaller percentage of local health expenditure is directed to the health center level. By
federal mandate, each of the 3,000 health centers is supposed to be staffed by one to three health
officers, depending on the characteristics of the host community. Each health officer is backed up by
a team of about four nurses. There is also at least one trained midwife at each health center. While
each of the indicators assessed could be subject to a mixture of influences between HEWs and
health center staff, the majority of the effect for all except deliveries by skilled birth attendant
would be expected to come from HEWs. Deliveries by SBAs would be influenced more equally by
both HEWs and health center staff.

Association between Woreda Block Grant Spending and Results: Agriculture

49.     Ethiopia relies heavily on agriculture. It comprises almost half of the country’s GDP and
employs around 80% of its people. PBS supports the agriculture sector through financing recurrent
costs at woreda level. The majority of these costs are directed towards the employment of
development agents (DAs). DAs are trained workers who provide extension services by teaching
community members the benefits of improved farming techniques. Such techniques can include the
use of improved seeds and fertilizer, and the importance of irrigation and erosion prevention,
among others. About twenty percent of PBS funds go to the agriculture sector.


50.    As in health and education, agricultural expenditure increased rapidly between 2008 and
2011. Concomitant with this increase, the percentage of fields that use extension services has more
than doubled. Figure 4 shows this trend for both variables. The agricultural data here, as well as
                                                                                                      25


much of the data presented in the rest of this section, is collected by the Central Statistical Agency as
part of its annual Agricultural Sample Survey (AGSS). This survey collects information from around
45,000 households and includes data from 500,000 fields from across Ethiopia’s nine regions as well
as Dire Dawa (a city state). In the analysis, the data has been aggregated at zonal level, as it is more
representative of the underlying population at this level.

Association of Extension Services with Productivity

51.      When cross-time pooled regressions are run on AGSS data between 2008 and 2011, there is
a significant effect of zonal agriculture expenditure on a variety of improved farming techniques
(Table 5). The regressions control for the same aspects as those for health and education – the
percentage of the population that is rural, and the ethnic composition of the zone. Here the
deviation in rainfall for both the current and previous year from the average rainfall between 1996
and 2011 at zonal level is also included as a predictor. In all regressions where an agricultural
variable is included on the left-hand side, both the current year’s as well as the previous year’s
deviation from average rainfall is a significant predictor. Full results are presented in Annex B.

Notes: Based on Probit models. Cross-time pooled data drawn from Agricultural Sample Survey data from 2008-2011,
pooled at zonal level. Number of observations: 191. Controls include current and previous years’ deviations from average
rainfall (calculated as the average between 1996 and 2011), zonal poverty rate, percentage of the zone’s population that is
rural, and the same ethnic groupings as used in the regressions above. Standard errors given in parenthesis. Significance is
defined as: ** at 5% level and * at 10% level.

52.      Although the effects appear to be relatively small, the results show that for several aspects
of improved farming techniques there are significant and positive associations with zonal per capita
agriculture spending. For every additional USD 1 per capita spent, for example, the probability that a
field in that zone will benefit from extension services increases by about 0.2% (assuming and
exchange rate of ETB20/USD). Specifically, usage of fertilizer and improved seeds has smaller
coefficients but remain positively significant. Irrigation is one technique that is not associated with
higher agriculture spending. This could be due to higher capital costs associated with irrigating fields,
and would therefore be dependent more on a particular zone’s expenditure in the water sector.

             Notes: Other includes hops and chat. The chart does not include sugar, which is not often grown on
              private land.

53.     The figure (Figure 5) shows the overall basket of crops produced by Ethiopian private
farmers in 2011 by production quantity, measured in quintales. Cereals, which include barley, teff,
wheat, sorghum, maize, oats, and rice, make up almost three-quarters of production. A further 15%
consists of pulses (e.g. beans, chick peas and lentils) and root crops (e.g. potatoes, carrots and
onions). Enset, fruit crops and coffee, which are more geographically confined, represent a smaller
proportion of overall production.

54.      The overall objective of agriculture spending is to increase the productivity of farmers’ fields.
Productivity is measured by yield, which is the ratio of quintals produced per hectare of land
cultivated. Cross-time pooled regressions between 2008 and 2011, with the log of yield of a specific
                                                                                                                             27


category of crop as the dependent variable, show strong positive relationships with log per capita
recurrent agricultural spending and crop yields. The control variables were - the percentage of the
population that is rural, the zone’s overall poverty rate, the deviation of the zone’s rainfall for the
current and past year from the average, and ethnic composition (this latter variable helps account
for geographical heterogeneity in crops’ production).

55.     Of the eight groups of crops grown in Ethiopia, four show positive and significant
relationships with agricultural spending (table 6). These five represent about 85% of the production
in the country. These results, combined with the effect of agriculture spending on extension services
given above, show the important catalytic role PBS IGFTfunds are playing in increasing farmers’
productivity levels. A caveat here is the role is only catalytic because the actual productivity increase
depends on a range of the private and public spending as well as investments in infrastructure which
are not included here. Full results are presented in Annex B.

EQUITY: Wealth, Gender, Geographic and Ethnic
Results of Woreda Block Grant Health Spending by Wealth Quintile

56.     As mentioned above, Ethiopia has already met its MDG Goal 4 of reducing the under-five
mortality rate (U5MR) by two thirds. This impressive achievement is due in no small part to rising
local health budgets. These increased resources finance staff who provide the services and promote
the healthy actions needed to reduce under-five mortality. The improvements seen in U5MR are
seen across other health indicators as well. Conveniently, Ethiopia’s Demographic and Health Survey
was conducted one year prior to PBS and again after five years of implementation, allowing the
study to analyze before and after changes by place of residence (urban vs rural) and wealth quintile.
                                                                                                                    28


           Figure 6: Percent Improvement, by Rural Quintile, between 2005 and 2011 for
                                    Selected Health Indicators




      Notes: Child and Under five mortality changes are multiplied by negative one to obtain overall improvement.
57.     Figure 6 demonstrates that there has been substantial improvement across all six indicators
examined between 2005 and 2011, and that – in the majority of cases – the bottom two quintiles
have increased most. The table is broken down by rural wealth quintile.22 As the majority of PBS
IGFTresources flow to rural areas, this breakdown helps to see the HEWs effect more clearly.
Contraceptive rates for the bottom two quintiles rose over 200%, more than twice as much as the
top two quintiles. Similarly, for measles vaccination rates, ANC, and delivery by a skilled provider,
the poorest quintile showed the largest improvement. All of these outcomes are highly influenced by
the presence of health workers in the field, which are financed by PBS IGFT expenditures.

58.      There is also improvement for the poorest quintiles in child and under-five mortality, more
so than for the richest quintile, but to a lesser degree than other quintiles. Unlike the other
variables, these outcomes are particularly susceptible to factors outside the control of local level
recurrent health expenditure. Food security, nutritional status, and a mother’s education all play a
larger role in driving these outcomes, some of which will more directly affect poorer individuals. It is
telling that there are larger improvements in child mortality as opposed to under-five mortality. This
is notable as it suggests that improvements in services under - through the package provided by
HEWs - are more targeted to children rather than infants




22
  Given the small urban population in Ethiopia, the sample size of wealth quintiles by urban residence
provided too few observations to be representative.
                                                                                                                          29

     NS is not significant. Number of observations varies by quintile, location and outcome. See annex for details.

59.     Based on data in the 2011 DHS, it also is possible to derive estimated rates of improvements
in some of these outcomes based on the contacts with HEWs (who are woreda financed). A question
in the 2011 survey asked whether a “family planning specialist or HEW? had visited the household in
the past year. As many of the outcomes fit nicely into a binomial response, e.g. use of contraception
versus no use of contraception, it was possible run a probit model where the response to the
question of an HEW visit was the right-hand side variable and the left-hand side was either the
“success? or “failure? to achieve the health outcome. This assumed that any contact with an HEW
would lead to multiple messages and not just family planning. The model coefficients were then
used to determine predicted probabilities for the specific outcome.

60.      Table 7 shows that HEWs had a significant effect across place of residence and wealth
quintile: a household was more likely to achieve an outcome if they had been visited by an HEW
than if they had not. This held across all outcomes for urban and rural location, and for three of the
four outcomes examined by wealth quintile, despite the small sample size problems of the latter.23
For example, the poorest rural households were 15% more likely to have a pregnant woman receive
antenatal care and 12% more likely to vaccinate their child against measles if they had received a
visit from an HEW than if not. Many of the outcomes are more likely the richer the household is. This
is most likely due to unobserved factors, the foremost of which is probably women’s education. Full
results are presented in Annex B.

Incidence Analysis of Woreda Block Grant Spending on Health and Education

61.     The incidence of woreda level health and education spending by quintile was calculated
based on using the results of such spending on education and health outcomes using the DHS 2006
and 2011 data. While this is not the most common form of incidence analysis where there is a
reliance more on facility and service information by income group, given the data constraints this
was the only method possible. It was nevertheless considered important to carry out the analysis.
The basic approach was to allocate the incidence of increase in per capita expenditures in the
sectors over the 2006-2011 period by quintile based on the ratio of the improvement in results in
that quintile to the average improvement in results (see Annex A, equation 4). In education there
was one results variable considered – net enrolment rate whereas in health the average of the
following results which can be affected by health extension workers was taken – ante-natal care,

23
  The sample size for any deliveries attended by a doctor, nurse, midwife or HEW was small. There were only
1,000 births delivered by one of these practitioners, making it difficult to obtain reliable estimates when
breaking them down by wealth quintile.
                                                                                                         30


vaccination, contraceptive use and births assisted by skilled birth attendants. The DHS 2006 and
2011 almost provide a natural experiment on the impact of Health Extension Workers (HEWs)
because the HEW system started between the two. As noted earlier, service use data from the DHS
2011 indicate that HEWs have had a proportionately very strong effect on the utilization of the
above services particularly for the bottom quintiles.

62.      The study found this woreda level education spending to be pro-poor, with the bottom 40%
benefiting from 56% of total spending, and the top quintile benefiting from only 13% of expenditure.
The incidence of per capita woreda-level spending on education was more than 2.5 times higher for
the bottom quintile than for the top quintile (see Table 4). Similarly for health, the analysis shows
that 63% of the incidence of woreda-level health expenditures accrued to the bottom 40%, whereas
only 10% accrued to the top quintile24. The benefit incidence of per capita woreda-level health
spending for someone in the bottom quintile was more than times that of someone in the top
quintile.

                           Bottom    Top 20%   Multiple by which Bottom quintile

63.       An on-going study25 applying a standard methodology to all countries also found that
primary education spending (which is mostly Woreda level) to be pro-poor while overall education
spending was not pro-poor. The pro-poor result for primary (woreda level) education spending
arrived at using a different methodology corroborates the use of the above less orthodox
methodology. That study found that the overall incidence of all public education spending on the
bottom 40% to be 33% and the figure is 34% for health. Thus, woreda level spending (PBS financed)
is significantly more pro-poor than overall spending in education and health.

Catalytic Effect of Extension Services by Landholding Quintiles

64.     Analysis of the catalytic effect of agriculture extension services by land-holding quintiles was
carried out using agriculture sample survey data. Data was grouped by land-holding quintiles, and
regression analysis was done by group. The dependent variable was the use of improved
techniques, defined as improved seeds, irrigation, or fertilizer, to estimate the probability of use of
improved techniques for each birr of spending on agriculture extension services. Key findings are
provided in Table 9; full results are presented in Annex B.

65.      Table 9 clearly shows that agriculture extension spending at woreda level increases the use
of improved farming techniques for all groups. The magnitude is relatively low in the bottom
quintile, which may reflect financial constraints to purchasing and investing in improved techniques.
Research on development constraints for the poor finds that among other things, input prices are a
major constraint for poorer farmers in adapting more productive crops26.

Gender Equity Analysis for Woreda Block Grant Spending

67.     Another question the study attempted to answer is whether there is a gender bias in PBS
expenditure. On the health side, the answer is an obvious yes. Female community members, along
with children, are the primary focus of HEW outreach. They benefit from a majority of the packages
delivered; see Box 1 above. Another way to answer this question is to look at the association of
expenditure on results data disaggregated by gender. This type of data is only available in the
education sector, and then only for select indicators.

68.    Table 8 provides key coefficients for education recurrent expenditure on primary Net
Enrollment Rate and Net Intake Rate, disaggregated by gender. Full results are presented in Annex B.
The coefficient for female primary school students is slightly higher than that of males for both NER
and NIR, but this difference is not significant. The results show there is no negative bias against
women in education expenditure, the sector where the majority of PBS IGFT funds are spent.

69.     It was already established that much of health spending is positively associated with
women’s access to services, including contraception, pre-natal care, and assisted child births. Access
to these services has a strong impact in reducing maternal mortality. Thus, woreda health spending
can also be considered pro-women.

70.      By contrast, evidence from the agriculture sector implies an apparent bias in outcomes
which was also found in the IFPRI study27. The reasons for the difference are not fully clear but could
imply a bias or choice of different crops cultivated by women or different quality and size of
landholdings. Table 9 shows the predicted probability of a field using improved farming techniques,
disaggregated by the head’s gender. Full results are presented in Annex B. About 13% of fields are
from female-headed households. When the household head is a woman, the household’s field is
significantly less likely to benefit from extension services, though the effect is relatively small. But
some caveats are in order: There will be many other factors influencing adoption of improved
farming techniques, the sample size for female headed households is small, and data quality could
be improved. Thus, these results only suggest that extension agents might be preferentially
targeting male-owned fields. It is an issue that needs to be analyzed, and policy responses
developed from such an analysis.

Federal System’s Role in Helping Lagging Areas and Groups
Regionally disaggregated Analysis for Woreda Block Grant Spending

71.     It is also possible to examine expenditure allocation across space. Figure 7 is a simple
scatterplot of per capita subnational expenditures across Ethiopia’s 718 woredas in 2010, where
each woreda is represented by a dot. ID numbers assigned by region are on the x-axis, which
naturally groups woredas on the chart by region, demarcated in red. The dashed yellow line shows
average expenditure in Ethiopia across all woreda, at ETB 183/capita.

72.     The majority of woredas are located in a band between ETB 150-250/capita. Lower outliers
are clumped near this band, whereas higher outliers range as high as ETB 1000. Where are these
outliers? If ETB 385/capita, 110% above the national average, is taken as the cut-off, Table 11 below
shows the results.

73.     Seven of the most favored woredas, including the five highest observations nationwide, are
in Gambella. This means over half of the woredas in Gambella spend more than 110% the national
average on the basic service sectors. Six more are in Beneshangul Gemuz, representing 30% of the
woredas in that region. These are amongst the historically backwards, economically more deprived
regions of Ethiopia. Another six woredas are in Tigray. By contrast, amongst the much larger regions
that have dominated government and the economy both now and under the Empire, Amhara has
only two woredas above ETB 385, and Oromia has six. The lowest observations appear in Amhara,
Oromia and Somali. Hence in terms of expenditure per capita, the current system broadly favors
Ethiopia’s historically disadvantaged regions at the expense of the historically dominant ones.

74.     The results shown above clearly demonstrate that the Ethiopian state has been successful in
implementing its constitutional mandate of giving preference to historically underserved or
vulnerable groups. At the same time the federal system also prioritizes underserved areas among
the larger more established groups such as the Amhara, Oromo and Tigrayan as demonstrated in
Table 12. Thus, the federal system has helped redress historical inequalities, which was the intended
objective.

Ethnic disaggregated Analysis for Woreda Block Grant Spending

75.      Ethiopia has a complex history28 that can explain some of the differences in regional levels of
development. In the late 19th century, areas consisting of today’s Beneshangul-Gemuz, Gambella,
Southern Nations and Nationalities, Afar, Oromia and Somali regions were brought under the feudal
system of the Ethiopian empire based in the highlands of north-central Ethiopia. Relations between
the newly integrated areas and the historic center of the empire were troubled. Owing to the
structural weakness of the center, successive Ethiopian governments did not command effective
control over the peripheries. Similarly, exploitative economic policies caused visible marginalization
and relative under-development. This dynamic of center-peripheral relations continued throughout
the empire and socialist eras. It was not until 1991 with the ascension of the EPRDF into power that
ethnic federalism took root in Ethiopia. One of the primary objectives of this new government was
to reverse this policy of ethnic homogenization and to promote “equitable and broadly shared?
economic growth among all regions. This involved affirmative action in terms of increased budget
allocation to historically less developed regions. This preferential treatment of previously
disadvantaged ethnic groups within Ethiopia is helping to create a more equitable distribution for
development to take place. However, while the small lagging groups fare well, the largest lagging
group the Somali do not get more resources per capita at the Woreda level that their lagging
development status would require. This seems to be due to the fact that the Somali region over the
four years that are covered in this analysis transferred only 49% of their federal block grant
resources to woredas compared to the average of 73% for all others excluding Addis Ababa which is
a large city and woredas need to do less.
                                                                                                                   29

76.      Ethiopia has 91 registered linguistic groups and 93 registered ethnicities, making it
impractical to include a full set of dummies for either variable, let alone both, in the econometric
estimations. Most of these account for less than one percent of the total population. Also, the five
largest ethnicities are heavily concentrated in their five home regions, implying that controlling for
region in the regression models is substantially similar to controlling for ethnicity. Hence the
econometric models focus on smaller ethnic groups, and in particular a subset of these that have
been historically disadvantaged. Using demographic data from the 2007 census, the study focuses
on the Nuwer (also spelled Nuer) and Anyiwak30 from Gambella. We combine all other ethnicities
representing less than 1.5 percent of the population into a separate grouping, called Other Small.
These categories are then compared against the largest ethnicities in the country, omitted from the
estimations, for example Amhara, Oromia and Tigrina, in terms of level of total woreda recurrent
expenditure per capita between 2008 and 2011. Other estimations not reported here substituted
linguistic dummies for ethnic dummies, with no significant change in results. Dummies for Ethiopia’s
twelve regions also mirror the main findings with respect to large vs. small ethic/linguistic groups,
and did not change any of the other findings substantially.

77.     Table 13 provides key results from these regressions; full results are presented in Annex B.
We see that ethnicities with a smaller proportion of the population receive a larger share of
recurrent expenditure. This is especially true for the Anyiwak ethnic group from Gambella, who
spend ETB755 more per capita than larger groups. The Nuwer receive substantially more as well –
ETB127. As the positive significant coefficient for the Other Small category shows, overall small
ethnic groups, who are also more likely to be at a relative historical disadvantage in terms of
development, receive a significantly higher proportion of recurrent expenditure.

78.      The Government of Ethiopia has made development of historically disadvantaged groups a
priority. Its system of fiscal decentralization transfers funds to local governments through a formula-
based system at the federal and regional levels. Of primary consideration in these formulas are
relative levels of development. One of this study’s main questions is: “Are woredas with a high
proportion of historically disadvantaged ethnic groups favored or disfavored by fiscal transfers? “
Higher distributions to such groups would indicate that PBS funding is pro-developmental.

Conclusions and Recommendations
79.      The evidence implies that decentralized spending at the woreda level is both effective and
pro-poor. The high correlation of spending to outputs estimates shown here imply that Ethiopia can
increase such spending further to accelerate progress towards its MDGs. In agriculture, increasing
access to rural finance for the poorest could help improve the pro-poor impact of PBS spending in
this sector. But quadratic forms also show declining returns to scale and therefore there is a limit to
what increased spending can achieve. Given the fairly large coefficients, a substantial impact can
result from increasing woreda level spending on these sectors.

80.      Some caveats are needed to qualify the above findings. In education, spending on materials
and other quality drivers is not included in woreda block grants. Teacher salaries, which are
included, are usually 80% to 90% of education spending. In health, woreda spending does not drive
the results but is more catalytic to increase the effectiveness of results from system wide spending.
Similarly, in agriculture development agents who are financed from the block grants play a catalytic
role as well to assure effectiveness of system wide spending.

81.     Some historically disadvantaged areas are significantly favored under the current regime.
The distribution of expenditure across space is broadly equal amongst Ethiopia’s woredas, with the

striking exception of a small number of woredas concentrated in the country’s most disadvantaged
regions that receive significantly greater resources. By contrast, the most disadvantaged woredas in
terms of resource flows are concentrated in the more developed, historically dominant regions. Four
majority-Anyiwak woredas are noteworthy for receiving the most public resources of all woredas in
the nation. Resource allocation by itself may not be enough to reduce historic disadvantages but
they can contribute to helping these groups catch up.

82.     While a lack of pre-decentralization data currently prevents us from analyzing the effects of
decentralization per se on financial flows, sectoral outputs, or substantive outputs, our post-
decentralization woreda-level data does allow us to say something about the effectiveness of
woreda-controlled service provision. This appears to be favorable. In contrast to the predictions of
some public management theories, the decentralized provision of services in Ethiopia is not
increasing regional, ethnic or gender inequalities in terms of investment inputs or service outputs.
Indeed, we found the opposite effect in education and health, where the impact of PBS financed
IGFT resources was disproportionately high amongst the bottom two quintiles, and for women.
Hence support for decentralized services in Ethiopia appears to be an effective use of development
partner resources from both efficiency and equity perspectives.

83.     The only exception to these findings is agriculture, where the impact of PBS financed IGFT
expenditures was smaller for the bottom quintile. This is likely related to many factors which could
include inability to pay for enhanced inputs, possibly poorer quality land and other factors.

84.      Although quantitative evidence is unavailable at present, descriptive evidence implies that
structured feedback sessions between citizens and service providers have helped to strengthen
citizens’ participation in pilot areas under ESAP1, on which basis ESAP2 is being implemented. This
experience, combined with the strong recommendations of theories of governance and
accountability, point to a need for continued application of social accountability tools, and seeking
acceptable policy options for sustainability in the Ethiopian context.

85.       It is difficult to overstate the difficulty of doing subnational empirical work on Ethiopia.
Creating the database required for this report has required a huge amount of work and
improvisation on the part of the research team. A major output of this study is the production of a
standardized database of woreda-level expenditures and characteristics, which will be made public.
The data will be combined with new data coming from ongoing data collection being financed by
PBS-3 and will also be used to prepare future studies under this programmatic knowledge services
task. It is our hope that this dataset will in time become a useful tool for researchers and students
elsewhere in Africa and beyond.
Annex A: Detailed Methodology and Sources of Data
Methodology

1.     This study relies on a database of woreda-level recurrent expenditure and outcome
information for a variety of health and education indicators at woreda level between 2008 and
2011. These are the only years of data available currently, although we hope to extend the dataset
over time. Also included are woreda demographic characteristics, including the population,
ethnicities, rural vs. urban, and other variables drawn from the 2007 census. We use econometric
modeling to assess the impact of increased local spending on the expansion of basic services and
outcomes, and by extension the efficiency of the PBS in meeting its development objective.

2.      It is difficult to overstate the difficulty of doing subnational empirical work on Ethiopia. As
far as can be gleaned from official sources, relatively little data is collected, the data is often of poor
quality, and few attempts are made to systematize the results into any obviously comparable
framework. A few illustrations are telling. Fiscal data on subnational expenditures in health,
education, agriculture, water, and roads were until very recently available only for EFY 2003. Their
geographic identifying codes and names do not match those of census data, whose geographic
codes and names vary in unpredictable but pervasive ways from fiscal data. The last census
counted some 740 woredas, zones, and regions, but the fiscal dataset includes more than 850.
Consolidating these two yielded a dataset of 989 subnational units, 250 more than in the census.
Many woredas are listed under the same name, and geographic codes in both data sets are not
unique. Missing data abounds.

3.     Creating the database required for this report has required a huge amount of work and
improvisation on the part of the team undertaking the empirical analysis. A major output of this
study is the production of a standardized database of woreda-level expenditures and
characteristics, which will be made public. It is our hope that this dataset will in time become a
useful tool for researchers and students elsewhere in Africa and beyond.

4.     Cross-time pooled regressions with the outcome variable of interest on the left-hand side
were run to evaluate the impact of per capita sector expenditure, controlling for rural/urban
percentage and ethnicity, over the four years. The outcome indicators evaluated are mostly drawn
from the PBS Results Framework. In those sectors for which no reliable outcome data at local level
could be gathered – two different approaches are followed one for agriculture and one for water
supply and roads. In agriculture, zonal level data is available for outcomes. By taking the average
per capita woreda spending on agriculture as a proxy for services offered by agriculture extension
workers, zonal outcome data can be used to assess the effectiveness of this spending. Data
constraints are more severe for water supply and roads, forcing us to revert to desk reviews. But
water supply and roads expenditure only account for 3% of total woreda-level spending;
agriculture, education and health, which are fully analyzed, amount to 97% of woreda-level
spending. Additionally, national surveys such as the DHS and Agriculture Sample Survey are used to
complement the analysis from the woreda-level data base.

5.     The analysis consists of three key stages. Stage I follows the approach of Faguet (2012) and
Faguet and Sánchez (2013), examining the relationship between woreda-level spending (a proxy for
service delivery as noted above in paragraphs 6 and 10) in each sector on results in those sectors.
We estimate

        lnOmt = ? + ?lnEmt + ?Rm + ?Cm+ηlnKmt +τt + ?mt                                       (1)
                                                                                                     38


where lnO is different outcome variables, such as the net enrollment rate or antenatal care usage,
capturing key outcomes in each sector. E is yearly expenditure per capita in the relevant sector; K is
capital expenditure per capita, R is the percentage of rural population in each woreda; τ is a
variable for the year to control for the time series effect in this cross time pooled data set and
C is a vector of demographic controls capturing the population percentage of certain historically
disadvantaged ethnicities that the analysis focuses on, all indexed by woreda m and, for
expenditure, by year t. “R? and “C? are taken from the census and do not change over time. The
above was also estimated using the quadratic form to check for decreasing marginal returns.

        Omt = ? + ?Emt +λEmt2 + ?Rm + ?Cm+ ηKmt+τt + ?mt                                  (2)

6.     While Log transformations are one of the most commonly used transformations,
interpreting results of an analysis with log transformed data is not straightforward. A log
transformation is often useful for data which exhibit right skewness (positively skewed), and
for data where the variability of residuals increases for larger values of the dependent variable.
When a variable is log transformed, note that simply taking the anti-log of your parameters will
not properly back transform into the original metric used. To properly back transform into
the original scale i t i s i m p o r t a n t to understand some details about the log-normal
distribution. In probability theory, a log-normal distribution is a continuous probability
distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.31


7.     Finally, a linear version was also tested.


        Omt = ? + ?Emt + ?Rm + ?Cm + ηKmt +τt + ?mt                                       (3)

For all the above equations, it is expected δO/δE≥0 and δO/δK≥0. Similarly δlnO/δlnE≥0 (that the
first partial derivatives) while in Equation (2) δ2O/δ2E≤0 (the second partial derivate). The expected
results imply positive association of the dependent variable with the independent variable which is
per capita woreda expenditures in the sector. Equation (2) also tests whether the association is
positive with a declining marginal impact.

8.    The form estimated in equation (2) allows us to verify if the returns to scale are declining
and the form in equation (1) reduces the effect of extreme values on the results.

9.     Stage II conducts an incidence analysis of woreda-level spending by quintiles, using the
wealth quintile breakdown from the DHS survey. The incidence analysis was done by allocating
improvements in health and education outcomes to each quintile by pro-rating the expenditure
increases to each quintile by the improvement in outcomes achieved for that quintile controlling for
the average improvement for all groups. That is,

        ∆Ei = (∆Ii/∆I)*∆E                                                                 (4)

                                                                                                         39


 where ∆Ei is the per capita increase in expenditure for quintile “i?, ∆E is the overall increase in
 expenditure per capita, ∆Ii is the change in outcome change for quintile “i?, and ∆I the outcome
 change for all quintiles. The results indicator for education was the net enrollment rate which is
 directly affected by woreda recruited teachers where for health the results indicator is average of
 three indicators which are directly affected by locally recruited health extension workers. These
 are: increase use of contraception, increased rates of immunization, increased use of pre-natal care
 and increased use skilled birth attendants. To illustrate further how this was calculated, the
 expenditures on health extension workers which is the main woreda level health spending is
 allocated to each quintile by the improvement made in health outcomes between 2006 and 2011
 by that quintile controlling for the average improvement for all quintiles. This method uses
 changes in results to attribute the incidence of expenditures as opposed to use of facilities which is
 the more common way. The results here are comparable to that being done for Ethiopia as part of
 a global study using standard methodology32. Those results also finds that primary education which
 is primarily funded at the woreda level to be pro-poor.

 10.    Stage III examines the link between woreda expenditure and sectoral results for different
 wealth quintiles, using DHS household survey data and limited dependent variable estimations as
 follows:

          Pi,q = f(ϴ ,Constant)                                                                (5)

 11.    In equation (5), Pi,j is the probability of improvement for household “i? in the quintile “q?
 and α whether the household has had contact or not with a health extension worker. ϴ is “yes? or
 “no? variable, with “yes? being coded 1 and “no? coded 0.

 12.    This form was estimated using a Probit limited dependent variable regression testing the
 following form for health:

        Pi,jq= ? + ?ϴi,q +?mt                                                                 (6)

 where P i,q is is whether housegold “I? in quintile “q? utilizes a particular health services measured
 as “1? for “yes? and “0? for “no?. ϴi,q is the whether or not household “I? in quintile “q? has had
 contact with a health extension worker with with “yes? being coded 1 and “no? coded 0.

        Pi,q = ? + ??lnEmt + ?Vm +?mt                                                         (7)

where P i,q is whether housegold “I? in quintile “q? adopts improved techniques measured as “1? for
“yes? and “0? for “no?., Emt is per capita expenditure on agriculture extension workers, Vm,t is a
vector of control variables including rainfall.

 13.     This three stage analysis was limited to sectors where data on woreda-level results was
 reliable, and corresponding household survey data on health and education available.

 14.    In the case of education, the third stage test was not considered necessary due the direct
 linkage between woreda-level spending, which is mostly for teachers, and the Net Enrollment Rate.
 This was needed for health because the linkage is more indirect. Woreda-level spending is on
 health extension workers, and therefore the link between contact with health extension workers
 and health sector outcomes was tested using DHS data.

 15.     With regard to agriculture, results (or output data) was not available at the woreda level –
 only at the zonal level. Incidence analysis was not possible, but the effect of agriculture extension
 services by land-holding quintile was analyzed. In the case of water supply, a recent national census
 found that the data was unreliable, and thus analysis was not carried out for this sector either
 nationally or locally. But as this accounts for only 2% of woreda-level expenditures, this does not
 really pose a problem. Finally, for roads – which account for only one percent of woreda-level
 expenditures – this level of in-depth analysis was not possible.

The PSIA Database

 16.     As mentioned in the main text, one reason an analysis of the sort undertaken here has not
 been undertaken until now is because of the difficulty in pulling together the various sources of
 data in one, multi-year, easily analyzable woreda-level database. The database that the team has
 constructed includes data from five ministries – Health, Education, Agriculture, Water and Energy,
 and Finance and Economic Development – as well as the Central Statistical Agency and the Disaster
 Risk Management and Food Security Sector of MoA. It also includes woreda-level poverty rates as
 calculated by CSA with World Bank technical assistance. As standardization of woreda codes and
 the transliteration of Amharic names into latin script is not yet consistent between ministries in
 Ethiopia, a lot of time was dedicated to aligning woredas from various sources into one consistent
 format. For consistency, the team used the Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia (2007) codes
 as its base.

 17.     The woreda data base includes information by year on expenditures by sector and key
 results by sector for health and education. The data includes woreda information on frequency of
 droughts, ethnicity and several other control variables. In addition, regional on per capita capital
 expenditures, zonal data on crop yields have been linked to the woreda level data. Moving forward,
 the team will update the database yearly, with each new sector’s data yearly results incorporated
 as they become available. Since this report has been written, the team has already incorporated the
 breakdown of education data by grades 1-4 and 5-8, which had not been available at the time of
 analysis. Similarly, the team hopes that researchers studying Ethiopia will supplement the database
 with data collected as part of their own research program. As time goes on, it is expected that the
 database will be continuously expanded, incorporating other useful sources of data. In the future,
 for example, the team hopes to incorporate local-level capital expenditure through time. The
 analysis that can be conducted using this data is a public good and should be available for
 researchers in Africa and elsewhere to avail themselves of.

Annex C: Financial Transparency and Social Accountability under PBS
1.        At the start of PBS in 2006, donors were keen to include elements into project design meant
to increase the transparency and accountability of its government-delivered services. This idea had
been advocated in the 2004 World Development Report – Making Services Work for Poor People –
as an effective tool to increase project effectiveness. PBS 1 included two components to that end.
Component 3 - Financial Transparency and Accountability – provided about USD11million mainly to
promote initiatives that disclosed budget information to the general public at local levels. It also
included Component 4 – Social Accountability – which provided about USD6million for piloting
innovative methods of improving citizens’ knowledge of their rights and responsibilities vis-à-vis
public service delivery. Social Accountability activities were implemented through civil society
organizations (CSOs) on the ground where the pilots were located.
2.        Due to a lack of familiarity of FTA within the Ethiopian government at the start, activities
were slow to get off the ground. However, after additional implementation support was provided,
four prototypes for FTA tools were developed, validated and disseminated to regions by the end of
PBS 1. These tools included laypersons’ guides understanding the budget processes and three
different templates needed to disseminate budget and expenditure information at local level. Use of
these tools by citizens was not achieved under PBS I, as initially envisaged, but the groundwork was
laid. Also, the baseline FTA Perceptions Survey (FTAPS) was finalized in June 2009.
3.        Social accountability work under piloted PBS 1 reached 80 woredas (approximately 12% of
the country). The projects focused on the four basic services sectors: education, health, water and
sanitation, and agriculture. CSO’s used techniques that were considered new in the Ethiopian
context, but represented good international practice, such as: Right Based Approach, Community
Score Cards, Citizens Report Cards and Participatory Budgeting as well as Focal Group and Interface
Discussions and Participatory Planning and Monitoring. Twelve civil society organizations were
engaged for this work. Though these activities were new for most of stakeholders, the projects
achieved the expected outcomes by adapting best practices of Social Accountability and creating a
learning initiative among participating citizens.
4.        Seeing the potential for very promising results, PBS 2 included substantial resources for the
scaling up and institutionalization of these initiatives. The activities themselves remained largely
unchanged. Under the FTA component during PBS 2, regions started posting their budget
appropriations to woredas on their websites. The FTA tools that were developed under PBS 1 were
rolled out to all regions, where they were customized to regional languages and local conditions, and
disseminated to woredas. Budget Literacy training, which had trained 1,500 people under PBS 1, had
expanded to 171,017. And, overall, FTA work became institutionalized in the Government public
finance system. By the end of the project, approximately 94 percent of woredas were posting budget
and expenditure data using the customized templates, with an average of 53 percent of service
facilities using the service delivery templates. Forty-three percent of citizens confirmed that woreda
officials had sought their views concerning the quality public basic services. And, the percentage of
citizens who reported that they have knowledge about the woreda budget increased from 13
percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2011.

5.      The scaled-up PBS 2 Social Accountability component was designed based on the findings of
an independent evaluation of the PBS 1 pilot phase. A key difference between PBS 1 and PBS 2 social
accountability activities was the shift away from individual service facilities to taking a sectoral
approach that engages institutions and key actors in the community in a more comprehensive
strategy. The activities were piloted in 86 woredas, in collaboration with 45 CSO partners. The results
from these woreda were strong. Community members were provided training, tools and
mechanisms that allowed them and their communities to assess service delivery and budget use and
develop joint action plans with service users to improve the quality of the services.

6.       PBS 3 is building on the foundations of the Financial Transparency and Social Accountability
laid during PBS 1 and 2. FTA activities now have a budget of almost USD12.5million. These activities
continue to improve the quality of budget and expenditure information to the public by refining and
simplifying the FTA tools. Budget Literacy Training will continue, which will expand information
awareness of citizens and of woreda and kebele council members. Other sectors will be engaged so
that they can institutionalize the FTA work in their respective offices and support service facilities by
disclosing their budget and service information to citizens. PBS 3 will roll-out its social accountability
activities to 170 woredas, which should bring the total number of woredas with SA activities to 344
woredas, representing about 4.5million service users. The financing available for this component
stands at USD20.5million. The impact of the project will be measured by an experimentally designed
impact evaluation. Existing methodologies will be refined, and new social accountability tools will
also be carefully considered based on their value added, including participatory planning and
budgeting, budget tracking, gender responsive budgeting and service charters. Overall, the
progression of FTA and social accountability activities under the PBS has seen a dramatic expansion
in the transparency and accountability of government-provided basic services.
Annex D: History of the relationship between central and peripheral areas
in Ethiopia – The Evolution of Today’s Federal State
History and Background

1.       The ethnic composition of Ethiopia is the result of a turbulent history. As it consolidated
itself during the medieval period, the country was comprised primarily of the Tigray, Agaw and
Amhara peoples. With Menelik II’s ascension to the throne in 1889, a period of territorial expansion
began, whose base was the province of Shoa in the current region of Amhara. Areas consisting of
today’s Beneshangul-Gemuz, Gambella, Southern Nations and Nationalities, Afar, Oromia and Somali
regions were brought under the feudal system of the Ethiopian empire. Following the battle of Adwa
in 1896 and the resulting European recognition of Ethiopian statehood, a series of border treaties
with the surrounding colonial powers were signed. The modern Ethiopia state was born.

2.       Relations between the newly integrated areas and the historic center of the empire were
troubled. Menelik sent governors from the center to administer the periphery, but owing to the
structural weakness of the center, successive Ethiopian governments did not command effective
control over the peripheries. Similarly, exploitative economic policies caused visible marginalization,
relative under-development, and less integration among the border regions within Ethiopia38. This
hold of the center over the peripheries continued to increase. According to noted Ethiopian historian
Bahru Zewde:

          The period after 1941 witnessed the apogee of absolutism. The tentative beginnings in
          this direction of the pre-1935 years matured into untrammeled autocracy. The power of
                                                                      39
          the state reached a limit unprecedented in Ethiopian history .

3.      The revised constitution of 1955 solidified the absolute powers of the emperor, claiming “His
dignity… inviolable and His power… indisputable?. It also entrenched Amharic as sole the official
language and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as the national religion.

4.      The period of socialist rule (1974-1991) saw no diminution in the center’s hold over the
peripheries and no change in the prevailing economic policies of exploitation. Despite the regime’s
appeal to a socialist ideology, the Derg was identified with an “Amhara suppresser‟ by the
nationalist liberation movements40. Any conduct promoting ethnic individualism, and thereby
challenging the state’s integrity, was outlawed.

5.     The victory of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front over the Derg in 1991
saw the reversal of over a hundred years of ethnic homogenization. As Chistopher Clapman says:

          The overthrow of the Mengistu government in May 1991 amounted to more than the
          collapse of a particular regime. It effectively marked the failure of a project, dating back
          to Menelik’s accession in 1889 of creating a ‘modern’ and centralized Ethiopian state
                               41
          around a Shoan core .

6.      Ethnic federalism now came to the fore in Transitional Charter, which allowed the rights to
self-determination of the country’s various “nations and nationalities?. Like the Charter, a new
constitution in 1995 recognized the rights of ethnic self-determination up to succession. It also
created a federal government with nine regional states divided along ethno-lingustic lines – Tigray,
Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Beneshangul-Gemuz, South Nations, Nationalities and Peoples,
Gambella, and Harari.

Data from 2007 census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency

7.      Economic integration and equitable development become a primary focus of the new
government. Meles Zenawi, the president of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, declared
in 1997 that:

           It is only through fast economic growth that is broadly shared by the population that we
           can hope for sustainable peace. And, therefore, one of the most important pillars of our
                                                   | 80


          program is fast economic growth that is equitable and broadly shared among the
                     42
          population

7.       The government adopted a policy of affirmative action towards developing regions whereby
Beneshangul-Gemuz, Gambella, Afar and Somali would be provided preferential treatment in terms
of budget allocation and increased enrollment in higher education. Even now, however, developing
regions still remain to be fully integrated into the economy of the Ethiopian state. Centralizatio n’s
legacy left few residents of today’s developing regions involved in running the regional
administrative structures.

8.       Until recently there remained little investment in social and physical infrastructure. Slowly,
the emergence of local native elite officially in charge of the regions, better investment in education,
health, infrastructure and others have shown the positive outcomes of the federalisation of
Ethiopia43. The preferential treatment of previously disadvantaged ethnic groups within Ethiopia is
helping to create a more equitable distribution for development to take place.

The Modern Ethiopian Federal State

8.      Decentralization of political, administrative and fiscal authority to regional and local
governments has been fundamental to this affirmative action strategy. The Government has a strong
commitment to decentralization and building a federal state, as enshrined in the 1995 Federal
Constitution. While the first wave of decentralization started only 20 years ago, the process should
be seen as a work in progress for which the underpinning institutional arrangements for success are
evolving and continue to require focused support.

9.       To date, Ethiopia has seen two rounds of decentralization. The first round (devolution) took
place during the transitional period from 1991 to 1994. This Proclamation devolved state powers to
geographically-defined ethno-linguistic groups and associated pieces of legislation were also passed
creating regional and woreda (district) councils. As necessary, regions could decide to establish
zones as intermediaries between regional and district administrations. In addition to giving them the
right to self-determination, these new regional units were granted a range of executive, legislative,
and judicial powers within their defined regions, and exercised jurisdiction over matters of social and
economic development as well as basic service delivery. Accordingly, regions were to create the
necessary internal institutional arrangements, including: a council; an executive committee; a
judicial administration office; a public prosecution office; an audit office; a police and security office;
and a service and development committee.


10.     Proclamation No. 7/1992 stipulated the regional governing units' revenue sources; these
included: tax revenues derived within their jurisdictions; fiscal transfers from the central
government; domestic borrowing; and other sources of income. The latter category was specified in
Proclamation No. 33/1992. However, due to capacity constraints, the regional governments were
yet unable to carry out their revenue assignments; as such, they were highly-dependent on grants
from the central government to meet their new expenditure obligations in the social sectors.

11.     In spite of what appears to be a rather elaborate set of governing arrangements, these new
regional governments remained subordinate to the central government. While the regional councils

were accountable to citizens living within their regional borders, legally they were also responsible
to Council of Representatives of the central government.

12.      The promulgation of the 1995 Federal Constitution signified the beginning of Ethiopia's
second round of decentralization. The Constitution affirmed the roles and functions of federal vs.
regional government. While the federal government retained authority over a broad range of
functions and responsibilities (e.g., fiscal and monetary policy, international trade), the regions and
woredas were given responsibility for ensuring basic service delivery in their respective jurisdictions.
The federal government retained authority over setting policies and standards in each of the major
social service delivery sectors.

13.      In 2002, decentralization was extended to the woreda level with woreda governments
expected to take on the bulk of service delivery responsibilities. Woredas receive block grants from
their respective regional governments which, like the federal-regional grants, are also governed by
formulas set by the regional governments and using broadly similar methodologies to that used in
the federal-regional grant.

14.      Decentralization to woreda level is crucial in the context of achieving an equitable
distribution of prosperity, as Ethiopian history, sociology, and ethnography, suggest that citizen-state
relationships are framed by alternative norms of political culture, power and state-society relations,
which are locally evolved, and have arisen in the context of historical processes of state formation44.
Concurrent with decentralization to woreda levels, budgets allocated for local level expenditures
have increased dramatically, and there have been impressive improvements in indicators of human
development, for example, in Net Enrollment and vaccination rates. The effects of the economic
policies that were in place for over a hundred years are, through the processes of decentralization
and affirmative action towards historically disadvantaged areas, resulting in a more broadly-shared
economic prosperity.

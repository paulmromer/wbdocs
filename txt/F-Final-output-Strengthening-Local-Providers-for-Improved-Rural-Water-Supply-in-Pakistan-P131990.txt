Executive Summary
1. This synthesis report details the process, outputs, intermediate outcomes, lessons learned and
   recommendations of the World Bank executed Technical Assistance (TA) on Strengthening Local
   Providers for Improved Rural Water Supply in Pakistan (P131990) implemented by the Water and
   Sanitation Program of the Global Water Practice. The development objective of this TA was to
   support the Government of Punjab (GoPunjab) in strengthening service provision by communities to
   ensure improved access to rural water supply, particularly for the marginalized and poor. These
   objectives were targeted through capacity building and introducing systems to better respond to
   community needs to manage rural water schemes via Community Based Organizations (CBOs).

2.   The TA had four major components to improve the sustainability of community managed rural
     water supply schemes in the province of Punjab.
      2.1        Back up Support Mechanism for CBOs: This TA designed a performance based support
      system for the 2,448 functional CBOs in Punjab to ensure that they can sustain their operations in
      the event of major technical failures. Support under this TA included the designing of the concept,
      qualifying criterion for CBOs to access to financial support for major repairs; listing of the
      qualifying expenditures (types of major repairs); development of the fiscal flows and the
      monitoring system. The GoPunjab subsequently approved this Back-up mechanism and allocated
      Rs. 250 M (US$ 2.5 M) in FY 2014-15 to enable CBOs to finance major repairs of their water supply
      schemes. In FY 2015-16, the GoPunjab again allocated Rs. 500 M (US$ 5.0 M) for this Back-up
      support mechanism.
      2.2        Improving Governance through ICT: This TA supported the introduction of an ICT tool
      for seeking feedback from the customers of Rural Water Supply Schemes on the status of water
      service delivery. This TA designed, implemented and integrated within the PHED’s Management
      Information System (MIS) a web based platform offering a mobile Short Messaging Services (SMS)
      and Interactive Voice Recording (IVR) to reach out to customers. This system was successfully
      piloted in 6 districts where 644 schemes were geo-tagged and 550,000 messages were sent to
      customers for feedback. The initiative GoPunjab is keen to scale up the system in the remaining 30
      districts of the Province (covering over 2,200 CBO managed schemes) under an on-going Public
      Management Reform Program.
      2.3        CBOs Performance Award Competition: This TA supported PHED in conceiving,
      designing and organizing three CBO Performance Award Competitions in the last three years.
      These CBO performance awards have evolved into a robust system for inviting applications (i.e.
      2,800 CBO chairman are encouraged through an IVR to submit an Expression of Interest to enter
      this competition), shortlisting applications (through third party field verification of the top 2 CBOs
      in each District), identifying winners (through a 30 minute interview of CBOs by sector experts and
      crowd sources SMS based voting amongst the best performing CBOs). Based on the success of
      these events, PHED is expected make this part of its annual plan through budget allocations in the
      FY 2016-17 Annual Development Plan.
      2.4        Capacity Building of Stakeholders: This TA undertook a training needs assessment of
      the CBOs and the Community Development Unit (CDU) of PHED in order to develop a tailor-made
      made training program for CBOs. Joint training sessions were organized for 100 PHED staff and
      300 CBO members on the social, technical and financial management aspects of rural water supply
      schemes. Special emphasis was made to identify local champions – mostly within the CBOs – who
      were groomed to share their practical expertise with their peers. The training has been rolled out
      in the nine divisional circles of PHED.



                                                                                                          6

3. This TA supported the PHED of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province to learn from the best practices
   of PHED Punjab. Following several meetings and field visits, support from this TA was requested for
   the designing and establishing of a “Sector Reform Unit (SRU)? in the PHED of KP. The SRU -
   established as “think tank? - is fire walled from the implementation of any infrastructure projects
   with the mandate to carry out research and planning, capacity building and monitoring. The unit
   was subsequently established and functional as of December 2015 with a budget allocation of Rs. 60
   M (US$ 6.00 M) for the next three financial years (2016-2019).

4. This TA was primarily focused on the province of Punjab having a population of 100 million with of
   which 60 percent population live in rural areas. The policy and institutional interventions of this TA
   will benefit all of the 2915 functional CBOs of the province. The training program developed under
   this TA supported the building of the capacity of 300 CBOs and 100 PHED staff. The ICT based
   feedback mechanisms and the CBO monitoring system introduced under this TA covered 644 CBOs
   in six pilot districts. The summary of the results of this TA are as follows:

5. From inception, this TA was focused on institutional strengthening and sustainability. The Back-up
   support mechanism for CBOs and ICT monitoring of scheme performance are extremely significant
   initiatives to have been integrated into the government system. Both these mechanisms will
   continue to contribute to improvements in the performance and sustainability of rural water supply
   in Punjab.

6. Lessons learned in the strengthening of community based rural water service providers through the
   implementation of this TA are that:
    Community can deliver and sustain services to rural consumers provided they are treated as an
       equal partner, given the institutional space to deliver and held accountable;
    The recognition of CBOs role by
                                                 Figure 1: Map of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

       not only get recognition but will
       have access to government
       support for major repairs if they
       perform;
      Consistency in policy and the
       approach of government on the
       model(s) of service delivery is
       critical. Clear sectoral goals
       coupled with in-house
       arrangements based on the
       local reality and past experience
       can deliver integrated results                                                  TA Focus

       communities to be leveraged

       with interventions which are
       low cost and easy to apply
       increases the likelihood that
       these will deliver results and will
       be replicated by the different
       stakeholders.

7. Recommendations to sustain the service delivery improvements and institutional changes achieved
   through the extension of this TA are:
   a. Punjab: should continue to support and build on the approach of providing rural water through
       a CBO managed system. Service quality, access and sustainability can be improved if the CBO
       management model is deepened further. Providing CBOs with a greater role in the rural water


                                                                                                       8

       supply project cycle combined with a mix of training, networking and backstopping will generate
       the capacity necessary to deliver better services. To support this shift it is recommended that:
        A dedicated administrative backstopping facility (like the SRU of PHED in KP) is established
           to help with policy and legal reforms, tariff setting and metering, monitoring and evaluation,
           local and global research to assist in the planning of future sectoral changes;
        The community development unit (CDU) is restructured to proactively support CBOs in the
           management of their piped water systems. This would require the CDU to support the
           training of CBOs through the recording and disseminating of best practices. The CDU should
           develop the capacity to enhance the performance of CBOs in the Punjab and become a
           recognized knowledge resource on community based O&M;
        A more formalized technical backstopping facility needs to be established that would
           proactively support CBOs in dealing with technical challenges in service delivery. This would
           range from advice on repairs and maintenance to major rehabilitations of systems;
        The scope of the CBO model be expanded to include the responsibility for identifying,
           designing and building rural water schemes. At present PHED is the lead agency in system
           development, and this can lead to disconnect with communities in terms of the
           appropriateness of the design and implementation of the scheme.
        A 2nd generation management model has sprung up in Punjab where CBO member
           (individually or collectively) are taking over the management of schemes from other CBOs.
           This sub-contracting by CBOs to individuals or groups appears to be performing well but it is
           informal and doesn’t have the backing of PHED. It is recommended that PHED assess and
           potentially strengthen this model thus offering an alternate to CBOs (who are not
           performing) and promoting an entrepreneurial culture in the water sector.

   b. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: should strengthen and mainstream the focus on the sustainable O&M of
      rural water supply schemes. Service quality, access, and sustainability can be improved if
      providers have a greater role in RWS project cycles while at the same time they build their
      capacity through a mix of training, networking, and technical/administrative backstopping. To
      support this process is the following are recommended:
       The taking over the responsibility of the schemes transferred by PHED is leading to a deficit
          in trust between the CBOs and PHED. PHED needs to re-engage with the community in the
          planning, construction and post construction of rural water schemes to ensure sustainability
          and ownership. There is a need to explore models that could be effective in KP, ranging from
          community management of all O&M to community support for PHED in service delivery;
       Sustaining the fire-wall of the SRU knowledge functions from the execution of projects is
          crucial to the success of the SRU. This means that the SRU should be supporting district
          PHED staff in the implementation of schemes and not implementing any infrastructure
          projects. Based on the analysis of the lessons from the field the SRU should take lead role in
          advising the PHED management in policy change and legal reforms, evaluation and planning,
          capacity building and monitoring.

Context
8. Pakistan is the world’s sixth most populous country, with a population of 191 million people and a
   projected population growth rate of 1.5%. Total Gross Domestic Production (GDP) is US$ 271 billion
   and per capita GDP is US$ 1,427 (2015) placing Pakistan in the category of Middle Income Countries
   (>US$ 1,215). Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon with 14 percent of the population living below
   the poverty line. Given the strong links between agricultural productivity, rural incomes and
   employment, agricultural water productivity has a high impact on growth and poverty reduction.

9. Pakistan is largely semi-arid, with average annual precipitation of less than 500 mm but with
   considerable year to year variation. The total average annual renewable water resource is 247
   Billion Cubic Meter (BCM), of which 192 BCM is surface water and 55 BCM is groundwater. Nearly all
   of these resources are in international basins (primarily the Indus basin), and around four-fifths flow
   into Pakistan from upstream countries. Climate change is expected to reduce water security as a
   result of melting glaciers and more variable and intense rainfall, meaning water availability will be
   less predictable and floods and droughts more common, with impacts greatest for the poor.

10. Despite high population growth, Pakistan almost met the Millennium development Goal (MDG)
    target of 93% access to an improved drinking sources (increasing from 86 percent in 1990 to 91
    percent in 2015 as per Joint Monitoring Program data). During this period, 76 million people (8,300
    people/day) gained access to improved water services (i.e. 4431 people/day in urban areas and
    3936 people/day in rural areas). Despite these significant achievements, the drinking water supply in
    Pakistan is intermittent and the water quality is poor.

11. The 1973 Constitution assigned the water supply and sanitation subject to the provincial
    governments. In 2009, the Federal government approved a ‘National Drinking Water Policy? and
    encouraged the provinces to prepare their provincial policies and strategies as per local resources,
    climate and situation. The role of the provincial government in water supply was further
    strengthened through the passing of the 18th Constitutional Amendment in 2010. While most of the
    Provinces have retained the responsibility for policy provision, human resource management and
    financing, they have largely devolved the service delivery function to local government institutions
    through their respective Local Government Acts.

12. Pakistan has four provinces and each province has a PHED responsible for rural water supply. These
    PHEDs are full-fledged provincial departments headed by a Secretary as principal accounting officer.
    The post of Chief Engineer(s) is the highest technical position to whom the field formation report.
    The PHEDs have undergone several major changes over the last 5 decades:
    - In the mid-1960’s, the PHED’s were established as highly professional organization for asset
        creation and handing over completed schemes to other authorities for O&M,
    - By the 1980’s, the PHED’s were also put in charge of O&M. However, with tariffs not being
        adjusted to cover costs, the operating expenditures quickly overshot the operating budgets. The
        absence of financial and technical resources for O&M then led to an increase in dysfunctional
        schemes. The rapidly deteriorating quality of rural water services and the steady rise in the
        number of failed schemes became an issue that warranted a paradigm shift in PHED’s.
    - In the early 1990’s, the government embarked on the Social Action Program (SAP) with the
        support of the major donors, in health, education and water sector. The SAP focused on
        community involvement in social sectors to improve the long term sustainability of
        infrastructure. Under SAP the four provincial governments adopted a Uniform Policy for PHEDs


                                                                                                       10

        (1994) which placed a greater role of beneficiaries in all aspects of scheme implementation (i.e.
        planning & monitoring, community contribution of 4.5% of the capital cost and taking over of
        the responsibility for O&M). The policy warranted all PHEDs to hand over completed schemes to
        beneficiary communities for O&M.

13. Apart from achieving the desired objective of strengthened community participation it was
    envisaged that community management would free up more resources to invest in bridging the
    piped water access gap. However, the lack of support to communities in the financial and technical
    management of schemes compromised their operations resulting in a growing number of
    dysfunctional schemes. This then required reinvestments to replace dysfunctional schemes leading
    to a service delivery model best understood as one of build-neglect-rebuild.

Punjab
14. Punjab is Pakistan’s most populous provinces with a population pf 100 million.1 The Province is rich
    in both surface and ground water resources, due to the five rivers that pass through the province.
    This has given rise to a large irrigation network with enough leakage to provide a ground water
    recharge network. The province can be divided into four drinking water zones; i) sweet ground
    water zone (53%) comprising of districts from central and southern parts; ii) brackish zone (29%)
    mostly located in southern part; iii) mixed (brackish/barani) areas (13%) comprising of southern and
    northern parts and iv) water scarce zone (5%) mostly located in north in Potohar belt.

                                                                          barani) areas

       29%                                             53%                Predominately water scarce zone




15. Access to water is extremely good with 95% of the population of Punjab having access to an
    improved water source2. The responsibility for water supply is assigned to the Water and Sanitation
    Agency (WASAs) in the five large cities, Municipal Committees in the in medium size towns and
    PHED in the rural areas. In 2011, the Provincial Cabinet approved a drinking water policy and
    recently the Province drafted a Municipal Water Act which is waiting for Cabinet’s approval. This Act
    requires the government to establish a “Water Commission? to regulate the abstraction, quality of
    water services and pricing of water.

16. The financial allocation for the water sector is around 4% to 5% of total Annual Development Plan
    (ADP) of the government. This is very low as compared to the health and education budget
    allocations of 23% and 29% respectively in 2015-16 budget. The PHED allocation in 2008-09 ADP was
    5.11%; in 2009-10 it was 4.99%; in 2010-11 it was 5.19% and in 2011-12 it was 4.90%.

17. The Uniform Policy for PHEDs (1994) has not been implemented consistently across all four
    provinces. To date, Punjab is the only province which is still not allocating any O&M budget for
    completed schemes which are the responsibility of beneficiary communities. As such, all 4,258 rural
    water schemes constructed by PHED in Punjab have been handed over to communities for O&M.

18. A typical PHED tube well based scheme designed for a single village serves 150 to 200 households;
    on average and costs Rs. 17,500,000 to 20,500,000 (US$ 175,000 to 205,000). The pump house,
    rising main, overhead reservoir and distribution network are main components of scheme and their
    specifications varies depending upon the water source and population. In many cases, land is
    donated by the community as well as a commitment to take over O&M of the schemes once they
    are completed.

19. The Punjab PHED is catering to the water needs of nearly 32% of the province’s 60 million rural
    inhabitants. The PHED has a Community Development Unit (CDU) responsible for social mobilization
    of communities at the various stages in the implementation of schemes. The unit staff interact with

                                                                                                      12

       CBOs which enter into an agreement with PHED through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
       to undertake the responsibility of O&M of the schemes. The MoU clearly indicates that PHED will
       not bear any operational cost and that the CBOs will be responsible for all repair and maintenance
       costs. The CBOs generate revenue primarily through the recovery of water charges from consumers
       with the average tariff ranging from Rs. 70 - 300/month (US$0.70 – 3.00).

20. As CBOs are responsible for O&M costs (i.e. electricity bills, operational staff salaries and repair) and
    therefore no recurrent cost (for schemes) is earmarked in the PHED budget. The major portion of
    the PHED budget is spent on the development of new schemes and the rehabilitation of
    dysfunctional schemes. The growing number of dysfunctional schemes eventually caught the
    attention of PHED management. Since there was no provision in the MoU for PHED to support CBOs
    in major repairs the only option was to take the schemes under the rehabilitation category. This
    means that every year the PHED would undertake rehabilitation of some of the dysfunctional
    schemes (depending on budget envelope) as part of the annual development program. This means
    that it takes at least one year (as the ADP cycle is one year) before the PHED could rehabilitate a
    dysfunctional scheme. In the meantime the community will switch to alternative (mostly
    unimproved) sources and the CDU will have to re-organize the CBOs again once the schemes is
    rehabilitated.

21. Punjab CBOS are operating as a body corporate (i.e. fully independent in managing their own affairs
    in regards to tariff setting, service timings, disconnection policies & subsidies to poor customers). In
    the case of the tariff, the policy requires “full cost recovery + emergency savings? from the
    customers. The tariff should cover the electricity cost, operational staff cost, O&M cost, repairs and
    a portion of savings to meet emergency operations. This requires sound financial management and
    all CBOs are encouraged to establish a joint account managed by the CBO office bearers. CBOs are
    however accountable to the PHED for their performance and quality of operations. As per the MOU,
    the CBOs have to submit a periodic report on their operations and financial management.

22. CBOs are accountable to PHED for performance and operations. As per MOU CBOS have to submit a
    periodic report on operations, financial and other matters. LG system in Pakistan had a gap from
    2009. New LG elections took place in December 2015 but the elected councilors have yet to start
    their functions.

23. PHED Punjab requested WB Technical Assistance in carrying out a diagnostic study to identify the
    root causes of CBO/scheme failures and to propose long term recommendations for improving the
    sustainability of CBO managed schemes. The details of this technical assistance including the
    process, results and lessons are discussed in next section of this report.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)
24. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) accounts for an estimated 10.5 percent of the country’s GDP and about
    14 percent of the population. KP’s population was 27.2 million in 20123 with 83 percent residing in
    rural areas with the capital Peshawar housing an estimated 2.2 million people. The population
    density in 2014 was 345 persons per square kilometer having more than doubled over the last 30
    years.4

25. KP is arguably the most crisis-affected province in Pakistan. Due to its proximity and close cultural
    ties to Afghanistan, KP has suffered from the fallout of the conflict in Afghanistan. This has given rise
    to a precarious security situation as well as a prolonged period of political and social instability. The
    influx of three million Afghan refugees over the past two decades (1.8 million of whom are still living
    in KP) has intensified the demographic pressure of a rapidly increasing population, placing additional
    strain on the province's resources. The Afghanistan conflict has also exacerbated local extremism,
    leading to hostilities between militants and Pakistan's security forces. This has far-reaching
    consequences on economic activity and has inflicted extensive damage on livelihoods, private
    property and public infrastructure.

26. The institutional responsibility for water service provision in the province is evolving with changes to
    the local government system. It is currently the case that the responsibility for water service
    provision lies with the Water and Sanitation Service Peshawar (WSSP)5 in capital of the province, the
    TMAs in the small and medium size towns and the PHED in the rural areas of KP Province. Access to
    piped water supply in the province was 31 percent in 2013-14 reflecting a significant decline from
    the 41 percent in 2011-12. This decline in use of tap water in offset by an increase in access to
    motorized pumps and springs6.

27. KP PHED has completed 4,110 drinking water supply schemes with a capital cost of about Rs. 10.00
    billion (US$ 100 M). Out of this, 1,682 schemes were completed prior to SAP, 992 schemes were
    completed under SAP, while the remaining 1,436 schemes were completed after SAP. Out of the
    above mentioned total 4,110 schemes, 2,748 are pumping based while 1,362 schemes are gravity
    based. The SAP had a mixed results in KP and PHED could not continue with Uniform Policy for
    PHEDs (1994) due to the political resistance to the community managed rural water model.

28. Under the Devolution Plan of 2001 the PHE Department was merged with the Provincial
    Communication and Works (C&W) Department. During 2001-2009 the creation of rural water
    schemes dropped substantially as PHE was an attached department and the bulk of the funding of
    C&W was earmarked for building and roads. In 2009 PHE was re-established as independent
    department for provision of rural water and drainage services in the province. Slowly and gradually
    the PHED has rebuilt its human and financial commitments. In 2011, the PHED started taking over
    the O&M of all of the community managed schemes. At the time of preparation of this TA it was
    envisaged that the PHED of KP will be exposed to the best practices of Punjab especially in regards
    to the support for the community management model. The support extended under this TA to KP
    PHED its process, results and lessons are discussed next sections of this report.

Overview of the Technical Assistance
29. Like many other infrastructure departments the focus of Punjab PHED has been on “asset creation?
    rather than “service delivery?. In the absence of strong monitoring & evaluation mechanisms, the
    department was mot internalizing the field lessons into its planning processes. While the
    department continues to construct approximately 70 new water supply schemes and rehabilitate
    roughly 100 schemes each per year under the ADP, as many of the functional schemes were
    becoming dysfunctional. Although the department has a community development unit with field
    based male and female staff, the focus of unit’s activities has only been on community formulation
    for the creation of new schemes rather than continuous support to the CBOs undertaking the O&M
    of existing schemes.

30. Punjab PHED had a long history of working with CBOs but was struggling to maximize the potential
    of CBOs to achieve the desired service delivery results (i.e. sustainable rural water supply
    operations). The increasing number of dysfunctional schemes and lack of capacity of CBOs were the
    main challenges which the PHED has been facing since early 2010. The GoPunjab therefore
    approached the World Bank seeking support to; a) strengthen the managerial, technical and social
    support to CBOs; and b) develop a system to ensure the sustainability of CBO managed schemes.

31. This TA was in line with the GoPunjab Drinking Water Policy 2011 emphasizing the strong
    engagement with communities at every stage in the implementation of rural water schemes (i.e.
    from planning, to construction, to O&M). Under the policy the GoPunjab has committed not only to
    reach out to the unserved population but also to strengthen community management models by
    addressing crucial bottlenecks and weaknesses. The policy also emphasized improvements in the
    monitoring of schemes handed over to communities and the integration of innovative approaches
    to build the capacity of both community and government officials. This TA sought to contribute to
    the commitments of the GoPunjab to achieve these policy objectives.

Scope of the TA
32. Strengthening the sustainable delivery of rural water services in the Punjab Province was the main
    target of this TA for which interventions both at policy/institutional level and grass root level were
    designed and implemented. The main components of the TA and results are described below:
        32.1 Back-up Support Mechanism: This TA supported Public Health Engineering Department
        (PHED) GoPunjab to design and implement a framework to assist well-performing CBOs to
        sustain the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of their schemes. The purpose of the Back-up
        support mechanism (the first of its type in the rural water sector in Pakistan) is to ensure that
        the 2,800 plus CBOs who are successfully managing their rural water supply schemes having met
        100% of the electricity charges and operational staff salaries are able to access the financial
        resources necessary major repairs. Analysis undertaken through this TA revealed many schemes
        becoming dysfunctional when they developed major faults. As per the existing Memorandum of
        Understanding (MoU) with PHED the CBOs were fully responsible for the O&M of schemes to
        the extent that PHED did not have any provision to extend any financial support for these
        transferred schemes.
        32.2 Improving Governance through ICT: This TA sought to extend support for the
        introduction of an ICT tool for seeking feedback from the beneficiaries of water service delivery
        rather than relying on PHED or CBO feedback. This required the development and integration of
        a web based platform offering mobile access to beneficiaries to gain feedback on the status of
        schemes and the performance of CBOs. This should enable provincial government (office of the


                                                                                                       15

        Chief Secretary and Chief Minister) access to the dashboard to obtain updates on the status of
        schemes without relying on PHED information.
        32.3 CBO Performance Award Competition: This TA sought to support the PHED to develop a
        system to a) infuse a positive spirit of competition among CBOs to improve services and b)
        provide a platform for networking and peer learning. This required the development of a system
        for the identification, short-listing and selection of the best performing CBOs. This also required
        the development of means to enable CBO members to exchange expertise with each other.
        32.4 Capacity Building of Stakeholders: PHED has a dedicated social mobilization unit with
        field based male and female staff. The Community Development Unit is responsible for social
        mobilization activities before the start of rural water supply schemes, during the construction of
        schemes and in the post hand-over phase. In reality, however CDU interaction with communities
        diminish as schemes become older. The capacity building component of this TA focused on
        capacity assessment and subsequently capacity enhancement of CBOs and CDU staff to improve
        the technical, financial and social management associated with sustaining rural water supply
        schemes.

Methodology
33. The methodology for the implementation of this TA was inclusive, result oriented and focused on
    institutionalization rather a standalone “project activity?. The client (PHED), CBOs and development
    partners (UNICEF) were consulted at every stage of the TA. A workshop was even organized with the
    stakeholders in which the objectives of TA were shared, seeking partnership and guidance in the
    implementation of this TA. All the initiatives of the TA were designed by the TTL and team, with the
    active support of the client and partners. Analytical pieces and idea papers were developed for each
    of the components that were then implemented following the approval of the GoPunjab. Firms were
    hired for specialized tasks (including field based activities) based on TORs that were shared with the
    client, their comments incorporated and their facilitation sought. As per the TORs the firms shared
    their strategy, plan and methodology of implementation with all stakeholders to build partnerships
    and consensus on the approach. Inclusive consultations were also organized by the firms to share
    their findings from field, the details of their proposed intervention and their tests of the results. Like
    the ICT firm organized three consultative sessions - in 1st it shared the methodology, in 2nd it shared
    the design of the web cum SMS cum IVR system and in last session the early findings from field were
    shared with stakeholders. Similarly the “Capacity Building? firm also shared it training plan and
    training material with stakeholders before imparting training activities in field. Two initiatives under
    this TA (i.e. the ICT and capacity building) were implemented by firms while the rest were
    implemented by the TTL and team.

34. Another key aspect of the methodology was the involvement of the client in the implementation of
    TA initiatives. In case of ICT initiative, CDU staff geo tagged the 644 schemes in the field using a
    purpose built mobile application. The CDU staff were trained by the hired firm in use of the mobile
    app through class room and field trainings. The firm undertook the validation and cleaning of the
    data collected by CDU while also performing a backstopping and troubleshooting role. The CDU staff
    collected over 113,990 mobile numbers of the beneficiaries of the 644 tube wells through a mobile
    based field survey. The active involvement of the staff of the CDU in the pilot initiative not only built
    the capacity of client but also enabled them to replicate and scale up the initiative without external
    funding. In the case of the capacity building contract, the firm not only involved the technical and
    CDU staff but also CBOs members as resource persons. This not only promoted peer to peer learning
    amongst CBO members and CDU staff but also provided a much needed boost to the confidence of
    the CBOs and the CDU.

                                                                                                           16

35. The Back up support system was designed and operationalized through an intensive process that
    included field assessments and diagnostics work to ascertain “why schemes fails? and “what would
    it take to sustain them?. In order to ascertain the status, causes and type of failure of schemes a
    third party assessment supervised by the district administration was carried out of all 4,258 rural
    water supply schemes. This assessment identified that 1,343 schemes (or 33% of the total number
    of schemes) were dysfunctional categorizing the schemes according to the cause of failure.

36. Analysis of the data showed that 49% of the dysfunctional schemes are not operating due to
    technical faults, 26% of the dysfunctional schemes have gone out of operation due to weak financial
    capacity in maintenance and 25% of the dysfunctional schemes have stopped operating due to
    managerial / social reasons amongst the beneficiary communities. The diagnostic further showed
    that the focus on asset creation, the absence of an M&E wing, the lack of interaction with
    beneficiaries (especially post hand over stage), the capacity constraints of both PHED and CBOs, the
    lack of a back-up support mechanism (for major repair) and the absence of any incentives for CBOs
    to perform were the major factors contributing to the failure of CBOs and schemes.

37. The field data also revealed that there are many schemes which are dysfunctional due to major
    technical issues requiring the deepening of bore wells, the re-winding, repair and replacement of
    electric motors, transformers and pumps. These major repairs were estimated to cost between Rs.
    0.5 - 2 million (US$5,000 –20,000). This requires an additional household contribution of between
    Rs. 2,500 – 10,000 (US$25 - US$100) to the CBOs which are managing these schemes on a cost
    recovery and user pays basis. This (contribution) is well beyond the capacity of poor households in
    Punjab who are willing to pay the monthly tariff of Rs. 70 – 300 (US$ 0.70-3.00) but unable to pay
    US$ 25-100 for major repairs. As a result, major repairs costing as low as US $5,000 led to the



                                                                                                      17

    abandoning of some schemes by CBOs when households were unwilling to contribute and PHED had
    no mechanism to respond to such incidents.

38. Although PHED has a time consuming process of reflecting dysfunctional schemes under the annual
    development program and finally repairing it, the communities which needed water on a daily basis
    were forces to switch to alternate mostly unimproved sources. As PHED has limited funds and as the
    cost for rehabilitation increases as schemes are left in a dysfunctional state, it is not possible for
    every dysfunctional scheme to be rehabilitated through the ADP.

39. This TA supported the identification of the root causes of dysfunctional schemes and worked on the
    establishment of a mechanism to sustain the services delivery focusing on occurrences when less
    than 1 to 5 percent of the capital cost is required to repair dysfunctional schemes.

40. The development of a back-up support program was based on inclusive consultations with the client
    and CBOs at all levels. Field surveys and data analysis were used to evaluate various options for the
    extension of back-up support. This process led to formulation of comprehensive back up support
    mechanism presented by the department and approved by Chief Minister of Punjab province as
    follows:
     Establishment of Rs. 250 M (US$ 2.5 M) back-up support fund with approximately Rs. 100,000
         (US$ 1,000)/- per scheme per annum for a total 2,448 functional schemes
     The fund is only authorized for major breakdown repairs including the development of a new
         source, the replacement of damaged mains, pumps, transformers, motors etc.
     CBOs will cover routine O&M as per MoU and will not use this fund for O&M
     Only CBOs that fulfill certain performance criteria (i.e. full cost recovery from users, no
         electricity bill arrears, up to date records) will be eligible to access support from this fund

41. Of the Rs. 250 M (US$ 2.5 M) budget allocated by the finance department of GoPunjab in FY 2014-
    15, only Rs. 61 M (US$ 0.6 M) was released with the rest of the funds lapsing in the government
    system. In FY 2015-16 the GoPunjab made a budget allocation of Rs. 871 M (US$ 8.71) for this
    initiative. The department has developed a process of transferring the funds through to the district
    office. A district committee of PHED field staff and district administration has also been established
    in every district to ascertain whether the CBOs qualify on above criterion or not. So far 1,684 CBOs
    have opened the requisite joint (CBO chairman and PHED engineer) accounts.

42. The density of mobile phones has grown enormously in Pakistan from 3.4 percent in 2003 to 79.8
    percent in December 2015. Smartphone penetration has grown at a steady pace from 13 percent in
    January 2013 to 31 percent by January 2015. Telecom has become the fastest growing sector in
    Pakistan in the last five years. Pakistan is the fifth largest country in terms of the usage of mobile
    phones with 139.9 million subscribers out of 185 million population. This TA internalized the mobile
    phone based applications as they offered considerable opportunities to improve the performance of
    community managed water supply schemes in rural Punjab.

43. Information and communications technology (ICT) has transformed many sectors in Pakistan and is
    rapidly changing how people communicate. Consumer banking and consumer industry has
    internalized various aspects of ICT to communicate with consumers. For the rural poor, the ICT
    sector in Pakistan also offers many low cost applications like mobile SMS, Interactive Voice
    Recording (IVR) calls, social media sites, e-learning platforms, user-friendly cameras and geo-
    referencing maps. Till now the potential of ICT has remained largely untapped in the rural water
    sector in Pakistan.

44. The ICT integration in PHED is part of a large province wide ICT program (funded by World Bank)
    which has successfully demonstrated results like reduction in corruption; improved efficiency of
    officials; improvement in services in health; education; domicile; police reporting; driving license
    and court cases in Judiciary.

45. This TA has piloted the ICT integration in rural water supply in Punjab with the objective of
    improving governance to impact the sustainability of schemes and continuity of services. It was
    proposed that a strong oversight mechanism using ICT tools will strengthen the ability of the
    government to ensure that the public sector investments in rural water sector are delivering
    services. In Punjab province, where community participation in rural water sector is the strongest
    amongst the four provinces, this TA has capitalized on this by deploying mobile technologies to
    obtain feedback from the beneficiaries rather than the service providers. This has sends a message
    to CBOs and PHED field staff that they are accountable for their performance.

46. Several meetings were held with PHED staff and select CBOs to agree on the theory and
    assumptions associated with the approach, to finalize the tools and modalities for mobile based
    monitoring. Six pilot districts were selected in consultations with the client, three which were
    relatively well-off (Faisalabad,
    Gujrat and Chakwal) and three         Figure 4: Geo Tagging and Spatial Information Survey Mobile App
    districts with poorer social
    indicators (R.Y Khan, Vehari,
    and Kasur). Existing PHED
    data revealed a total of 700
    schemes in these six districts.
    A tailor made mobile
    application was then
    developed for geo tagging
    and uploading spatial
    information of all functional
    schemes in these six districts.
    The data revealed that there
    are total 644 schemes (not
    700 as per PHED data) of
    which 608 were functional.
    All of the spatial data (i.e.
    photos, videos) were
    uploaded on the GIS map
    with the 608 geo tagged
    schemes. PHED staff was
    trained in geo tagging as part of capacity building of client.

                                                                                                            19

47. The PHED staff also collected data about number of connections in each scheme through meetings
    with CBO staff and searching through CBO records. A total of 140,479 connections were recorded in
    6 districts against 608 functional schemes. PHED staff also collected the mobile numbers of all
    beneficiaries of the 608 functional schemes through corner meetings and house to house surveys. In
    this exercise 113,990 cell numbers of beneficiaries were collected. A one minute voice message of
    the PHED Minister was recorded and sent to all 113,990 mobile numbers to inform them about this
    initiative of PHED seeking their co-operation. This IVR call was relayed twice to sensitize community
    to this PHED initiative and inform them about their role in service delivery.

48. A seamless open source dash board was developed on which all the features were uploaded and
    geo tagged. The dashboard was configured in such a manner as to enable:
     All water schemes of six districts to be viewed on google maps with their actual locations;
     Photographs of all scheme assets (pump house, OHR, office, rising main) to be viewed
     The functional status of each scheme to be viewed as per consumers feedback
     Technical, social and financial management details of each scheme to be viewed
     The GIS base dashboard to be updated remotely from an android mobile application
                                Figure 5: GIS Dashboard with Scheme Details




49. Over a period of 6 months over 550,571 SMS and IVR calls were made to the cell numbers of
    beneficiaries to ascertain the status of schemes. In the
    1st week of every month a simple system generated
    question was sent to all numbers asking a question
                                                                   Figure 6: Color Pins based on Customers Feedback

   “whether your scheme was functional last month?. Households were requested to reply by pressing
   1 for “yes? and 2 for “no?. On the basis of feedback of beneficiaries the system calculated the
   percentage of “yes? and “no? and assigned operational status colors to each scheme.
     Red (Dysfunctional): less than 30% of consumers responded with “yes?
     Green (Functional): more than 70% of consumers responded with “yes?
     Yellow (border-line): is border line where 31-70% of consumers responded with “yes?.
   Focus of the PHED is primarily on the yellow schemes to save schemes from turning “red? in next
   survey. The color coded schemes on the google map also enables the overall performance of CBOs
   and PHED to be assessed. More green schemes meaning that the majority of schemes are functional
   while more red shows a district in trouble.

50. By clicking on any scheme on the map one can find all the spatial information about the schemes in
    three categories (i.e. technical, financial and management). The PHED staff were trained to update
    the data in the system on periodic basis.

51. The system also features the capacity to send                             Figure 9: Flow of Responsibility and Actions
    mobile phone alerts to relevant PHED staff. If
    a scheme is shown red for last 2 months the
    system will send a mobile phone alert to
    relevant CDU staff to check the cause in the
    field and report back in the system. The CDU
    staff report on the cause of failure in the
    system and this forms the basis for the district
    head of PHED to assign actions to relevant
    staff. Once the action is taken by staff it is
    again reflected in the system. If any staff fails
    to take action on task assigned, a remainder is
    sent and finally after passing a threshold
    number of days a non-compliance report is
    sent to management.
                                                                       Figure 10: User Management Role based on Hierarchy

    has access to dash board and can view
    how many schemes were functional in
    each district in any given month, the
    actions taken by field staff on red
    schemes and compliance.

53. In addition to sending normal the
    monthly question on the status of
    schemes, the system has started
    sending one additional questions to consumers. These questions have been framed to obtain
    information on the number of hours of water supply per day, the average monthly water bill and the
    levels of satisfaction with the performance of the CBO.

54. Another important aspect of this component of the TA was obtaining information on the poverty
    dimensions of the CBO management of schemes. The three poor districts of R.Y Khan, Bahawalpur
    and Kasur were compared against the relatively well-off districts Chakwal, Gujrat and Vehari.

55. The data of Benazir Income Support Program (BISP)7 was used for the poverty ranking of these
    districts. Information on the tariffs, hours of supply, persons per schemes, concentration of the poor
    in each district was collected from the six districts. This data was used to calculate the status of
    service delivery, the concentration of infrastructure, the unit cost of production and revenue
    collection efficiency in both sets of districts.

       56. Major challenges were building the acceptability and ownership of this initiative within PHED
           particularly at the district level. Then the building of the capacity of PHED staff in geo-tagging,
           obtaining cell numbers of beneficiaries and authenticity of data was a big challenge. It took
           considerably more time than planned to get quality and credible data from the field. Inculcating a
           culture of relying to SMS and IVR calls by consumers was extremely difficult. Special awareness
           sessions were designed to build the confidence and habit of responding to SMS and IVR calls. This
           may also remain a challenge in future and require constant engagement with community.

       57. PHED has allocated Rs. 16 M (US$ 160,000) in FY 2016 to bear the cost of SMS and IVR calls to
           beneficiaries. The integration of this system has been completed with PHED MIS. The PHED through
           GoPunjab has approached the WB to scale up this pilot in remaining 30 districts of Punjab under on
           “Punjab Public Management Reform Program - PRMP?. UNICEF has also showed keen interest in the
           approach, methodology of this system and was impressed with results. UNICEF is in advance stage
           of negotiating with PHED on replication of this system for rural sanitation sector in Punjab. The
           biggest challenge which still lies ahead is the use of this tool by the middle management of PHED.

CBOs Performance Award Competition
    Outputs:                                    Annex G - 2nd CBO Performance Award Competition (PAC)

58. This TA component supported PHED in conceiving, designing and organizing the CBO Performance
    Award Competitions. The CBO Performance Award Competition (PAC) was an initiative which sought
    to:
     Infuse a spirt of competition among CBOs for improving services
     Provide a platform for networking, learning and show casing best practices
     Formally recognize services of CBOs
    The annexed report summarizes the approach, the process and the proceedings of the 2nd CBOs PAC
    that was conducted in 2013.

59. Through this TA the idea of the PAC was introduced, the concept note developed and financial
    support extended to organize the 1st and 2nd PAC with over 300 CBOs and PHED staff represented in
    each event. This TA introduced the concept of CBOs evaluation by independent panelists, devised
    the evaluation criterion of CBOs performance (based on IB Net indicators performance indicators)
    and provided logistical support to PHED. This TA not only tried to institutionalize this initiative within
    PHED but also expand development partner support for the PAC in collaboration with UNCEF.

60. The CBO Performance Award Competitions consists of four stages:
     Self-nomination of CBOs for PAC through Expression of Interest (EOI) form;
     Short listing of EOIs by PHED district staff;
     Field verification of shortlisted CBOs trough a 3rd party;
     Evaluation of shortlisted CBOs by a panel of judges.

61. Each step in the selection process comprised of a well-established judgement criteria for filtering
    out CBOs on the basis of their performance. In the 2nd CBOs PAC nearly 1,500 EOI forms were
    collected by CBOs, a total of 750 EOIs were submitted, 250 CBOs were shortlisted by district based
    PHED staff, 179 CBOs were subject to 3rd party validation of their performance and 67 CBOs were
    invited for a final round of evaluation by a panel judges in a three days gathering of CBOs.

62. The CBOs were awarded in the category of Best District CBO, divisional CBO and best provincial CBO.
    Other special awards were presented in categories such as 100 percent cost recovery, maximum
    savings, gender participation, innovation and record keeping. Some highlights of CBOs performance
    showcased in the last two CBO PACs include:
     CBOs realigning their rising main and distribution networks to minimize water losses including
        the extension of the distribution network and installation of new pumping (backup) machinery;
     CBOs utilizing their savings or leveraging other sources of funds to make major investments in
        the expansion and rehabilitation of schemes;
     CBOs investing in back-up power supplies in the form of heavy duty diesel generators in the
        wake of frequent power cuts;
     CBOs using computerized billing systems, running wireless and mobile phone based complaint
        redressal systems, maintaining bank accounts and carrying out annual audits of their accounts
        through professional chartered accounting firms;
     CBOs covering 100% of their operating costs (energy bills, salaries and maintenance) from
        consumers through flat or volumetric (metering households) tariffs.


                                                                                                           25

       CBOs covering the costs of installing meters from operational revenues to improve demand
        management, equity of service delivery and fair tariff setting.
       With CBO tariffs ranging from Rs. 70 – 500/month (US$ 070 – 5), many CBOs have significant
        savings with some CBOs having saved Rs. 32 M (US$ 320,000).
       CBOs are keeping good records and allowing open access to this information with women
        playing a vital role in some CBOs in maintaining these records.
       CBOs graduating and registering as NGOs to work in other social service sectors after gaining
        experience in the rural water sector.

63. The objective of this TA, apart from supporting PHED to host these events, was to institutionalize
    this process within the PHED system. As the major partner of PHED in conceiving and implementing
    the 1st CBOs PAC, this TA partnered with UNICEF in organizing the 2nd CBOs PAC. UNICEF is the lead
    partner for the 3rd CBOs PAC which is an indication of how this TA has fostered partnerships and
    influenced resources. The 3rd CBO PAC is currently in the 3rd stage (i.e. the 3rd party field verification
    of 260 shortlisted CBOs is currently underway). The fourth and final stage (i.e. the evaluation of
    shortlisted CBOs by a panel of judges) will be organized in May 2016 by UNICEF.

64. Integrating the CBOs PAC within PHED’s ADP remains a challenge. Although the senior management
    of the PHED is convinced of the benefits of the PAC the authorizing departments like Finance and
    Planning prefer to allocate government resources for hardware (construction of new schemes). By
    inviting representatives of the Planning and Finance Departments to the final stage of 3rd CBO PAC it
    is sought to convince them of the effectiveness of this platform so that they might approve the
    allocation of funds for PHED to finance the 4th CBOs PAC in 2017.

Capacity Building of Stakeholders
                                                               Annex F - Training Report of PHED and CBOs
     Outputs:
65. This TA component supported the capacity building of CBOs and PHED staff to deliver and sustain
    quality rural water supply services. This component was designed and executed to bridge the gap
    between PHED (technical and CDU staff) and CBOs. The annexed training report summarizes the
    content and results of the training of CBO and PHED staff.

66. Initial discussions were held with PHED senior management on the content of the training and the
    training modalities, the criteria for the selection of participants, the duration of the training and
    other logistics. The training was focused on social mobilization, M&E, communications, gender
    mainstreaming, financial management, customer services, technical aspects of scheme
    management, water quality, social accountability and hygiene.
     A total of eight training sessions were organized at the divisional headquarters. The participants
         of the training sessions were one third PHED staff and two thirds CBO members. Women staff of
         PHED participated as trainers and trainees to promote a greater role for women within CBOs.
     In each training session most of the content was delivered by PHED staff and CBO champions.
         These champions were identified through a process designed not only to identify capacities in
         particular areas (i.e. preventive maintenance; record keeping; meter reading; water quality) but
         also to build confidence and inspire the participants.
     All training manuals designed through this TA were approved by PHED. The materials developed
         through this TA to collate performance indicators, reporting templates and record keeping
         registers were also printed and shared with CBOs.

                                                                                                            26

Establishment of the Sector Reform Unit (SRU)
 Outputs:                                         Annex G – Concept Paper on Sector Reform Unit (SRU)

67. The establishment of the Sector Reform Unit (SRU) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) was an additional
    initiative supported through this TA. Following a series of meetings and field visits in Punjab by PHED
    staff from KP, the GoKP requested the support of this TA to establish the SRU within the PHED,

68. This TA supported the conception, design and establishment of the PHED SRU in KP as a think tank
    fire walled from the project based implementation of infrastructure. The SRU mandate is to
    undertake research, monitoring & evaluation, capacity building and supporting field units in the
    delivery of rural water services. The SRU is structured to be a demand responsive unit responding to
    the needs of field offices. In addition, the SRU will act as the focal point for donor coordination in
    the drinking water sector.

69. While this TA took the lead in designing the concept and the structure of the SRU, other partners
    like UNICEF and SDC are supporting PHED to strengthen the SRU by investing in the human resource
    and program needs of SRU. The allocation of RS 60 M (US$ 6.0 M) in the FY 2015-16 budget and the
    amendment of the PHED organogram to reflect SRU are the indicators of commitment of the
    Government of KP to this initiative.

70. A senior staff member has been assigned as Chief SRU and given staff by the department. A SRU has
    developed its two years program with support of partners and is procuring services of specialist to
    undertake the program activities. The annexed concept paper captures the rationale, structure,
    scope and mandate of SRU.

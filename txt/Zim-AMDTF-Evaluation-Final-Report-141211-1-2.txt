Executive Summary
The World Bank hired Castalia to carry out an impact evaluation of the Zimbabwe
Analytical Multi-Donor Trust Fund (A-MDTF, or “the Fund?). The A-MDTF’s
performance was assessed against the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) evaluation criteria.
The six criteria used in this evaluation are: relevance, effectiveness, impact, sustainability,
efficiency/accountability, and lessons learned.
The evaluation found that the A-MDTF succeeded overall in fulfilling its mandate. The
Fund was, and remains, relevant to its key stakeholders: the Government of Zimbabwe
(GoZ)—and by extension, the people of Zimbabwe—as well as donors. The Fund
achieved most of its targeted results, and delivered impacts that are generally in line with
expectations. However, the Fund did not operate as efficiently as it could have.
As the A-MDTF winds down in 2014, there are five key lessons that donors should
consider in designing the Fund’s successor, the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund
(ZIMREF). Donors should consider linking analytical work with programmatic funding,
so that analyses can lead directly to investments. ZIMREF should be designed to
facilitate even closer coordination of all donors in Zimbabwe, to help channel efforts and
magnify impact. ZIMREF should also be based on a robust monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) framework, which in turn will help donors scale up efforts to “tell the full story?
of how ZIMREF-led activities produce positive impacts in Zimbabwe. Donors should
also work with the World Bank to fine-tune administrative processes, so that ZIMREF
can operate even more efficiently than the A-MDTF.
The A-MDTF was—and remains—relevant to the needs of stakeholders (Section
4). The A-MDTF’s strategic objectives closely aligned with the strategic objectives of the
World Bank’s Interim Strategy Notes I and II for Zimbabwe. This means that the Fund
fit well within the World Bank’s overarching strategy for continued engagement in
Zimbabwe. The A-MDTF also met the needs of its core stakeholders: the GoZ and
donors. The Fund was “demand-driven,? relying on well-defined processes for matching
the priorities of both groups. Analytical work was supported mainly on topics where
shared priorities existed.
The A-MDTF was effective and made an impact—some impacts have been
sustained, or are likely to deliver sustained benefits (Section 5). This conclusion
was drawn from evaluating the Fund’s performance against the two targets for
programme-level impact, and by assessing the individual performance of a representative
sample of 11 activities. The sample provided a deeper level of analysis; these activities
produced most of the outputs, outcomes, and impacts that were expected. Overall, we
found that the Fund generally achieved its desired results: (1) help the GoZ build
capacity so it can respond when donors re-engage fully; and (2) keep the donors abreast
of and coordinated on key development challenges in Zimbabwe.
The A-MDTF was effective in delivering the outputs and outcomes that its activities
were designed to produce. This conclusion is based on two findings. First, the activities
in the sample produced nearly all of the outputs and outcomes that were expected. Eight
of the 11 activities in the sample (72 percent) produced all target outputs, while 10 of the
11 activities in the sample (91 percent) yielded all desired outcomes. Secondly, the Fund
chose activities where there were shared priorities among the donors and the GoZ (the
Fund was relevant). We relied on this approach because of limitations in programme-
level reporting—Annual Reports only indicated what outputs and outcomes were
produced by the activities, not what was expected from them.


                                               i
The A-MDTF was also moderately successful in stimulating impacts in Zimbabwe. Nine
of the 11 activities in the sample delivered activity-level impacts that contributed to the
Fund’s overall objectives. For four of these activities, the impacts that were achieved
were different from what was specifically targeted. This was likely because the Fund did
not accurately predict what impacts would be achieved; it does not suggest that the
activities were unsuccessful. Many of these impacts were also sustained. Six of the 11
activities in the sample (54 percent) delivered sustained benefits (or are likely to deliver
sustained benefits)—and one more activity may do so, once its outputs are produced.
The A-MDTF could have been more efficient in fulfilling its mandate (Section 6).
The Fund’s operational model was generally appropriate. Its funding levels, project mix,
and delivery models were all highly appropriate, though the Fund could have set more
realistic time frames for implementing the activities (given the political economy of
Zimbabwe), and human resources could have been better staffed. Funds were disbursed
efficiently, were spent in accordance with World Bank procurement procedures, and
were accounted for using the World Bank’s accounting rules for trust funds.
While the Fund documented key findings well, it did not disseminate these widely. The
website was not routinely updated, and even donors did not have easy access to many of
the outputs that were produced. Furthermore, the M&E framework was weak, which
hampered efforts to demonstrate the impact of the Fund, both to donors and to external
parties.
Based on the conclusions from this evaluation, we recommend that donors consider five
main lessons as the A-MDTF winds down and they look to design ZIMREF:
           1. Consider linking analytical work with programmatic funding (Section
              7.1.1). A core limitation of the A-MDTF was that it could not procure goods
              and services to actually implement the recommendations or findings arising
              from the analytical work (donors call this “programmatic funding?).1 This
              limited the impact of many outputs, because the GoZ faces severe fiscal
              constraints and because non-contributing donors may not have the same
              priorities as those contributing to the A-MDTF. Should donors decide not to
              provide programmatic funding through ZIMREF, closer coordination with
              programmatic funds (such as ZimFund) could help link analytical work with
              the implementation that is needed to effect change
           2. Facilitate even closer coordination of donors (Section 7.1.2). The Fund
              did well in coordinating the efforts of contributing donors, as well as some
              non-contributing donors (such as UNDP and UNICEF). However, more can
              be done to coordinate with programmatic funds (such as ZimFund), and to
              coordinate with—or be kept aware of—the development interventions of
              BRICS2 donors, such as the Chinese (who are particularly active in
              Zimbabwe). For example, work programmes could be synchronised so that
              ZIMREF-funded analytical work leads directly to programmatic funds being
              spent by ZimFund to implement the recommendations or findings derived
              from the analysis. In addition, informal dialogue with the missions of BRICS


1   For example, the Fund was able to provide technical assistance to the GoZ to overhaul its computerised financial
    management platform, but the Fund could not purchase needed hardware and software upgrades. Although in this
    case, the Fund was able to leverage its support to secure programmatic funding from outside donors.
2   Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS)




                                                            ii
   countries in Zimbabwe could achieve the goal of promoting coordination,
   without explicitly defining a more formal arrangement.
3. Ensure that a robust M&E framework is in place, and that it is used
   (Section 7.1.3). The A-MDTF did not have a robust framework to monitor
   and evaluate the performance of the Fund at a programme level. To ensure
   that ZIMREF makes the greatest impact—and that this impact is tracked—
   donors should agree on a well-defined M&E framework at the outset,
   complete with meaningful, measurable indicators of ZIMREF’s progress.
   They should also ensure that this framework, once defined, is actually used to
   help communicate the achievements of ZIMREF
4. Increase dissemination efforts and improve the quality of
   communication (Section 7.1.4). The A-MDTF could also have been more
   effective in communicating the findings from supported activities, and other
   key achievements of the Fund. Even before the A-MDTF winds down, the
   Secretariat should post all outputs that are fit for public consumption on the
   Fund’s website. It could also consider establishing a public information centre
   to help disseminate the outputs produced to-date. Under ZIMREF, donors
   should ensure that the Secretariat has the capacity to disseminate the outputs
   and communicate key findings timely, widely, and strategically
5. Fine-tune administrative processes to boost ZIMREF’s operational
   efficiency (Section 7.1.5). The Fund did not always operate as efficiently as it
   could have. For example, donors lacked access to a repository where they
   could obtain copies of the outputs their contributions had paid for. The Fund
   also did not define a programme-level approach to mitigating risk, and it often
   set completion timeframes and disbursement windows that may have been too
   aggressive given the political economic environment. Many of these issues
   could be solved through minor adjustments to administrative processes. This
   includes taking steps to increase the availability and transparency of records
   (A-MDTF funded outputs and internal progress reports), adopting best
   practices for mitigating project risk, building more flexibility to better respond
   to minor contingencies, and working with the World Bank to improve the
   Secretariat’s ability to deliver services to donors.

1          Introduction
The Zimbabwe Analytical Multi-Donor Trust Fund (A-MDTF) was established in 2008
in response to the protracted political and economic fragility facing Zimbabwe since the
late 1990s. The A-MDTF (“the Fund?) is supported by 13 donors3 and administered by
the World Bank.
The key objectives of the Fund are two-fold: to improve the capacity and accountability
of the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ), and to enable the World Bank and
international donors to remain abreast of the development challenges in Zimbabwe. By
achieving these objectives, the Fund donors aim to facilitate stakeholder dialogue and
reform policies that will eventually lead to increased economic growth and stability in
Zimbabwe.
To achieve its goals, A-MDTF funds analytical studies, technical assistance and expert
placements, data and information management system support, and knowledge
exchanges for Government stakeholders. Activities are carried out across three “thematic
areas? including economic management and governance, agriculture, and infrastructure.4
As the Fund winds down activities and concludes disbursements by 31 December 2014,
the World Bank and A-MDTF donors want to understand what the Fund did well, and
what lessons can be applied for the planned scale-up of the Fund. Specifically, Castalia
was engaged to evaluate the relevance, effectiveness, impact, sustainability, and efficiency
of the Fund to date. During this assignment, we also drew lessons and made
recommendations for improvements to the Fund.
This Impact Evaluation Report explains the findings of our evaluation. The report begins
with an overview of the A-MDTF, explaining more about the Fund’s activities and how
these are linked to the desired objectives (Section 2). Next, we briefly explain our
methodology for completing this evaluation (Section 3). Sections 4 through 6 present our
analysis and conclusions on the relevance, effectiveness, impact, sustainability, and
efficiency of the Fund. Lessons learned and recommendations for the successor to the
A-MDTF are provided in Section 7. Additional details from the evaluation that were not
included in the body of this report are located in Appendix A through Appendix I.




3   The donors are the World Bank (through its LICUS trust fund), and the aid agencies from Australia, Canada,
    Denmark, the European Union (EU), Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
    Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).
4   The Fund previously had four other thematic areas: (i) private sector development, (ii) governance and anti-
    corruption, (iii) human resources/basic service delivery, and (iv) social protection. All four were folded into existing
    thematic areas or cancelled.

2          Overview of the A-MDTF
Since the late 1990s, Zimbabwe has suffered from protracted fragility induced by
recurrent cycles of political and economic crises. More than a decade of economic
decline has severely compromised basic service delivery, public sector capacity,
infrastructure maintenance, and the investment climate for the private sector.
Zimbabwe has been in arrears with the World Bank since October 2000. As a result, it
has been unable to access regular development assistance from the World Bank, and
other major international finance institutions. Rather than fully disengage from
Zimbabwe, the World Bank has prepared an interim strategy for continuing to operate in
a limited capacity, so that it can resume normal Bank operations when conditions are
right. For the fiscal years 2005–2007, 2008–2009, and 2013–2015, the World Bank has
prepared Interim Strategy Notes (ISN I, II, and III, respectively) that lay out a roadmap
for closing knowledge gaps and facilitating dialogue on Zimbabwe’s key development
needs.
The A-MDTF was established as part of this roadmap. It was designed to (i) improve the
capacity and accountability of the GoZ, and (ii) enable the World Bank and international
donors to remain abreast of the development challenges there. These outcomes will
facilitate quick re-engagement of the donor community with the GoZ when it is no
longer in arrears and economic conditions warrant. The A-MDTF supports the
objectives of the ISNs through:
              Analytical work on the key development issues facing Zimbabwe
              Development of suitable instruments enabling Zimbabwe to respond
               quickly to changing country conditions
              Facilitating donor coordination.5
Since its inception in 2008, the A-MDTF has allocated US$21.9 million for its activities.6
These funds are split between two trust funds: US$14.0 million under the new trust fund
(TF071603), and US$7.9 million under the old trust fund (TF071603), which was
replaced after restructuring took place as a result of a Mid Term Review (MTR) in 2010.
Each donor’s contributions to the Fund are listed in Table 2.1, sorted from the largest
contributor to the smallest.

A-MDTF is currently winding down activities, and is scheduled to finish all
disbursements by 31 December 2014.
A-MDTF Thematic Areas
The A-MDTF allocates funds to specific thematic areas to focus efforts. The old fund
had seven thematic areas, but these were later reduced to three thematic areas based on
recommendations in the 2010 Mid Term Review. Figure 2.1 below illustrates this
consolidation.

As illustrated in the figure, the old Fund’s seven thematic areas were eliminated or
consolidated into three key areas:
               Economic Management and Governance—focuses on building capacity
                and strengthening institutions to support good governance and economic
                management, particularly after the decade-long crisis and hyperinflation.
                Activities often focus on budget support, poverty analysis, trade
                competitiveness, and supporting small businesses. This thematic area grew
                out of the old Fund’s Economic Analysis, Private Sector Development,
                Social Protection, and Governance and Anticorruption areas.
               Agriculture—focuses on strengthening national dialogue on agriculture
                development. Activities offer on technical assistance and analytical support
                to produce investment frameworks for small farmers, food security studies,
                and land reform analysis. This thematic area also existed in the old Fund.
               Infrastructure—targets future economic growth for Zimbabwe by
                investing in infrastructure development, including energy, information and
                communications technology (ICT), transport, water, and sanitation sectors.
                Activities often focus on impact studies of investment in various projects,
                and technical assistance. This thematic area also existed in the old Fund.7
Economic Management and Governance is by far the largest thematic area of A-MDTF,
receiving 56.4 percent of total funds. Infrastructure is the second largest thematic area
(21.6 percent of funds), and Agriculture is the smallest (13.0 percent of funds).
Activities of each thematic area are led by a Technical Review Group (TRG), which
includes specialists in the thematic areas. Thus the new Fund included three TRGs:
Economic Management and Governance Technical Review Group (EMGTRG),
Agriculture Sector Technical Review Group (ASTRG), and Infrastructure Technical
Review Group (ITRG).
A-MDTF Activities
Across the three thematic areas of the new trust fund, the A-MDTF supports four key
types of activities. The old trust fund supported seven types of activities, but given
feedback from the 2010 Mid Term Review these were consolidated into four key
activities, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.

Under the new trust Fund, the four types of activities include the following:
               Analytical studies—core diagnostic reports to support strategic planning
                and policy dialogue; diagnostic reports to support the preparation,
                implementation, and evaluation of donor investments; and sector-specific
                advisory reports
               Technical assistance (TA) and expert placements—assisting in policy

                ministries
               Data and information management (IM) systems—support to the GoZ
                to develop systems and databases that help capture information and manage
                the flow of data to support effective and efficient public policy
               Knowledge exchanges—workshops, conferences, and field visits aimed at
                enhancing country knowledge, improving capacity, and enabling better
                coordination among development partners.8
As explained in Figure 2.2, while pilots were still a type of activity offered by the new
Fund, no pilot activities were funded under the new Fund. Thus, it is not counted above.
A-MDTF so far has funded a total of 51 activities.9 Table B.1 (in Appendix B) lists each
activity by an ID number that we have assigned for the purposes of our evaluation, the
type of activity, its thematic area, and the funds allocated (in US$).

Organization and Governance of the A-MDTF
The A-MDTF is governed by a three-tier structure consisting of:
                A Policy Committee (PC), comprising representatives of each of the A-
                 MDTF donors, including a representative of the World Bank
                The A-MDTF Secretariat (“the Secretariat?), comprising World Bank
                 staff located in the Harare office in Zimbabwe
                Three Technical Review Groups (TRGs) with expertise in one of the
                 three thematic areas (EMGTRG, ITRG, and ASTRG). The TRGs are
                 composed of donors’ representatives with expertise in the respective
                 thematic areas, as well as non-contributing donors (such as the United
                 Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations
                 Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and other key stakeholders (at times, including
                 certain GoZ officials).
The highest level of authority in the A-MDTF is the Policy Committee (PC). The PC,
sets priorities for using A-MDTF funding, and approves activities. Activities are also
identified and recommended by the three TRGs, given their technical specializations in
the Fund thematic areas, but ultimately are approved by the PCs.
Once an activity is approved, the Secretariat disburses funds from the “Parent Trust
Fund? to individual “Child Trust Funds? for each activity, and oversees the management
of resources for activities. The Secretariat plans and carries out the procurement and
monitoring systems for all activities.10 The TRGs also monitor the progress of activities
and the technical work performed, and liaise with Government officials. Most A-MDTF
funded activities are carried out by consultants, although some work is executed directly
by World Bank sector experts.
A more detailed explanation of the organization and governance of the A-MDTF is
provided in Section 6.1. Also see the detailed diagram in Appendix D.
A-MDTF Theory of Change
It is best practice for donor-funded programs and trust funds to design a Theory of
Change that establishes the linkages between a programme’s planned activities, and the
desired effects. Specifically, a Theory of Change explains how a programme’s resources
(inputs) will fund activities and outputs, which should lead to the desired outcomes
and eventual impacts that the programme is trying to achieve.
The A-MDTF defines such a Theory of Change in its Operational Guidelines. We
illustrate this Theory of Change in Figure 2.3.




9    43 activities were listed in the TOR and the remaining eight activities were identified by Castalia through reviewing
     programme documents, including the Mid Term Review. These additional eight activities were confirmed with the
     A-MDTF Secretariat.
10   Except for activities funded by a recipient-executed child TF (RETF), of which there was just one in the A-MDTF.

       Figure 2.3 illustrates the activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts that the A-MDTF
       plans to achieve. However, not all of the activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts
       illustrated in the diagram are included in the correct category. We provide
       recommendations for improvements to the A-MDTF Theory of Change in Section 7.1.
       To illustrate how the A-MDTF Theory of Change should work, we use the example
       below of Activity 1.02 Determinants of the Productivity and Sustainability of Zimbabwe
       Irrigation (see Appendix A.1 for more details). For this activity, the A-MDTF allocated
       US$300,000 in donor funding (inputs) for a group of consultants to perform a study on
       small-scale irrigation in Zimbabwe; conduct a diagnostic analysis of investment returns
       on irrigation schemes; and facilitate discussions on investment options with the Ministry
       of Agriculture, Mechanisation, and Irrigation Development (MAMID) (activities). The
       output of this activity included a report to the MAMID explaining the proposed pre-
       investment framework. The Theory of Change then predicts that the MAMID will use
       this output to identify policy reforms and other actions that the GoZ needs to take to
       attract and maintain investment in the irrigation sector (outcome). The desired long-run
       impact is for the Government to apply this roadmap to create an operating environment
       that is conducive to increased investments in irrigation (impact).

3           Evaluation Methodology
Our methodology for evaluating A-MDTF involved three key stages:
                Project Inception and Refining the Methodology
                Data Gathering
                Data Analysis.
In the following sections, we further explain this three-stage methodology, focusing, in
particular, on the data gathering and analysis stages.
3.1         Project Inception and Refining the Methodology
During this first stage, we completed an initial review of the objectives and scope of the
A-MDTF. We then clarified each of the evaluation questions listed in the Terms of
Reference (TOR) given our clarified understanding of the objectives, scope, and activities
of the A-MDTF. The output of this stage was the Inception Report, delivered on 25 July
2014.
We then refined our approach to include two types of analysis:
                Top-down, “programme-level? approach
                Bottom-up, “activity-level? approach.
A mix of both methods was used depending on the evaluation question. Sometimes both
levels of analysis were used, and other times only one level was applicable. For instance,
some evaluation questions were only relevant at the programme level, such as “What
were the Trust Fund’s critical success factors and how did the Fund perform against
these?? For these questions, we gathered data on the Fund from annual reports and
operational guidelines, and by interviewing A-MDTF Secretariat staff.
Other questions were relevant to specific activities, for instance, “Are there any
unintended benefits or contributions made by the implementation of the A-MDTF
activities?? To answer these questions, we looked at the performance of specific A-
MDTF funded activities.
As defined in the TOR, this evaluation of the A-MDTF from 2008 to 2014 covers 43 A-
MDTF funded activities.11 Given the scope of work and budget for this evaluation, we
were unable to review the performance of all 43 activities. Instead, we adopted a
sampling approach to provide a robust representation of the Fund’s performance overall.
Sampling approach
Given the “population? of 43 A-MDTF activities, our team selected a stratified sample
of 11 activities based on five criteria of key importance to the Fund’s activities:
             Thematic area—(i) agriculture, (ii) economic management and governance,
              or (iii) infrastructure
             Type of activity—(i) analytical studies, (ii) technical assistance (TA) and
              expert placements, (iii) data and IM systems, or (iv) knowledge exchanges
             Recent or older activities—activity was funded under (i) the new trust fund
              (TF) or (ii) the old TF


11   Note that to date the Fund has supported 51 activities, but the ToR defines the scope of this evaluation as limited to
     these 43 activities.




                                                              8
          Closed or ongoing activities
          Activity value—expressed in US$ allocated to each activity.
The size of the sample was based on our team’s recommendations during the technical
proposal, on suggestions from the A-MDTF Policy Committee, and on the need to
provide a balance of having a detailed activity-level evaluation but still finishing within a
reasonable time limit and budget.
To select this sample of 11 activities, first the share of the population of activities was
calculated under each key criterion. Based on the distribution of the population across
these criteria, we then attempted to select a sample of 11 activities that represented the
population shares. Because there are five different criteria under consideration, we were
unable to completely match the distributions.
Table 3.1 below illustrates the share of the population of activities under each of the key
criteria, and the share of the sample of activities. As the table shows, we succeeded in
matching the population of activities somewhat—that is, the sample is generally
representative of the population of activities.

3.2         Data Gathering
During the second stage of our methodology, we gathered data through two main
exercises: (i) document reviews, and (ii) field visits and interviews. Both exercises are
described below.
Document reviews
Documents on A-MDTF funded activities and operations were provided by the
Secretariat. A comprehensive list of documents reviewed is provided in Appendix G (see
Table G.1).
During the document reviews our team also devised a numbering scheme to label each
activity with a unique identifier code to distinguish activities. Although we later
discovered the A-MDTF already has a unique numbering system (which relies on the
child TF numbers), these numbers are not always presented alongside activities in key
programme documents, and were, therefore, difficult to track. Thus the numbering
scheme developed by our evaluation team is used throughout this evaluation report.
The first digit of our numbering scheme refers to the Technical Review Group (TRG):
1=ASTRG; 2=EMGTRG; 3=ITRG. The next two digits refer to the specific activity,
and the final two digits specify the document number. Programme documents under this
scheme begin with “0.00? and are followed by the two-digit document number.
Field visits and interviews
Interviews were held with 35 stakeholders of the A-MDTF to gather information on the
Fund’s operations, design, activities, and performance. External stakeholders interviewed
included 12 GoZ ministries and agencies and nine non-state actors. Within the A-MDTF,
we met with the Programme Manager, the Finance Officer, the sector World Bank Task
Team Leaders (TTLs), two of three TRGs, and the PC. Among the donors, we spoke
with 11 staff representing six donors.12 A full list of interviews conducted is located in
Appendix H. Key stakeholders were identified by our evaluation team, in consultation
with the Secretariat.
Interviews were held in person and over the phone. One of our team members (Mr. John
Miller) travelled to Harare, Zimbabwe to join our two local team members, Dr. Lighton
Dube and Ms. Nomasomi Mpofu, from 4 August 2014 through 13 August 2014 to
conduct interviews. Follow-up interviews were held through mid-September, including
in-person interviews conducted by Ms. Ikepo Oyenuga, a Senior Evaluator on our team.13
Our team designed structured questionnaires to use during interviews with each key
stakeholder (such as the A-MDTF Secretariat, GoZ ministries, donors, and other
stakeholders with knowledge of the activities). Examples of these questionnaires are
provided in Appendix I.
3.3         Data Analysis
The data that our evaluation team gathered—both quantitative and qualitative—during
document reviews and stakeholder interviews were aggregated in Microsoft Excel and
synthesised to produce the key findings in this report. Quantitative data were analysed to
understand questions such as the nature of fund disbursements (how funds were spent),
the appropriateness of timeframes (if the Fund’s activities were concluded on time), and

12   These donors were Australian Aid, the European Union’s EuropeAid, the UK Department for International
     Development (DFID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the Swiss Agency for
     Development and Cooperation (SDC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
13   Ms. Oyenuga was in Harare for another assignment.

so on. Qualitative, anecdotal evidence was summarised in a matrix matching our evidence
and key findings for each pair of a given activity or evaluation question.
We also produced a series of diagrams that helped us examine the Fund’s design and
processes. These diagrams were informed by programme-level documents, such as the
Operational Guidelines, as well as interviews with members of the PC and the Secretariat
Based on the analysis performed in this stage of the evaluation, we drew conclusions on
the extent of the Fund’s relevance to key stakeholders; the effectiveness, impact, and
sustainability of activities in its portfolio; and how efficiently it fulfilled its mandate. As
we drew conclusions for these evaluation criteria, we also identified lessons that the
donors could learn from the Fund’s experience, and made recommendations for future
development interventions in Zimbabwe.

4           Relevance
Evaluating the relevance of the A-MDTF means checking that the objectives and
approach of the Fund are aligned with the needs of beneficiaries, and with the goals of
other stakeholders. The Fund’s key stakeholders are the Government of Zimbabwe
(GoZ)—and by extension, the people of Zimbabwe—as well as donors. Other
stakeholders include non-contributing donors (such as UNDP and UNICEF) and non-
state actors (such as NGOs) that are active in the same thematic areas as the Fund.
This may seem simple and unnecessary; however, this step is essential. The DAC
guidelines have rightfully listed this due diligence as the first step in conducting an
evaluation. If the Fund’s stated objectives were not aligned with w hat the GoZ and
donors expected, then it is unlikely that the Fund will have achieved its objectives. To
determine whether the Fund was relevant, we focused on two questions:
               To what extent has the A-MDTF helped to implement ISN I and II
                strategic objectives?
               How closely are the A-MDTF objectives and approach aligned to key
                stakeholder needs?
In the second question, we interpreted “approach? to mean how the Fund planned to
support the objectives of its key stakeholders—that is, the thematic areas that the Fund
focused on.
4.1         Did the A-MDTF Help Implement ISN Strategic Objectives?
The A-MDTF was conceived as a key component of the World Bank’s strategy for
engagement in Zimbabwe from fiscal years 2005 to 2009, as defined in ISNs I and II.14
To determine the relevance of the Fund, it is therefore important to check that the
Fund’s objectives aligned with those of the ISNs.
As shown in Table 4.1, the objectives of the A-MDTF closely aligned with those of ISNs
I and II. The Fund’s objectives were clearly defined in the Operational Guidelines and
were confirmed by the Secretariat during stakeholder interviews. We therefore conclude
that the A-MDTF was well aligned to implement the strategic objectives of ISNs I and
II.

4.2         Was the A-MDTF Aligned to Stakeholder Needs?
The A-MDTF was designed to be “demand-driven.? This means it was designed to
support analytical work on topics where there was a demonstrated need by the GoZ, and
where these needs overlapped with the donors’ priorities in Zimbabwe. This demand-
driven approach was followed in practice, as the Fund’s objectives and approach were
closely aligned with the needs of its stakeholders.
The Fund closely aligned with the Government’s priorities
The choice of thematic areas—both at inception and following the MTR—was intended
to match the priorities of the GoZ. In fact, this is one of the five core principles that
donors followed15 from the OECD’s “Principles for Good International Engagement in
Fragile States? within the Paris Agenda.16
The Government’s priorities during the implementation of the A-MDTF were
documented in several strategic plans published by the Ministry of Finance: (i) the Short-
Term Emergency Recovery Programme (STERP), (ii) STERP II,17 (iii) the Medium Term
Plan (MTP), and the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socioeconomic Transformation
(Zim ASSET). The key priorities defined in these documents are summarised in Table
4.2. We compared the GoZ’s priorities over time against the Fund’s thematic areas. All
but three of the GoZ’s priorities were targeted by one (or more) of the A-MDTF’s
thematic areas, as shown in the TRG column. This analysis revealed that the Fund’s
thematic areas closely aligned with the priorities identified by the GoZ.

To confirm our finding, we also asked GoZ officials to confirm if the A-MDTF generally
met many of the Government’s key priorities. The officials we interviewed unanimously
confirmed that the thematic areas chosen by the Fund matched the needs of the GoZ.
The Fund also aligned with donors’ priorities
As previously illustrated in Figure 2.1, at inception the Fund chose seven thematic areas:
(i) economic analysis; (ii) private sector development; (iii) governance and
anti-corruption; (iv) agrarian issues; (v) infrastructure rehabilitation; (vi) human

resources/basic services delivery; and (vii) social protection. These were based on an
initial inventory of donors’ interest when the Fund was established, the results of which
are shown in Table 4.3.

Following the MTR, the number of thematic areas was reduced from seven to the
current three: (i) agrarian issues, (ii) economic management and governance, and (iii)
infrastructure. Donors made this choice following the MTR, which found that two of the
thematic areas (social protection and human resources/basic service delivery) were
already being adequately supported by other donors outside the A-MDTF. In addition,
three separate thematic areas (economic analysis, private sector development, and
governance and anti-corruption) were combined into economic management and
governance, to seize on potential synergies between these thematic areas.18
Conclusions on alignment with stakeholder needs
We conclude that the A-MDTF succeeded in choosing thematic areas that were relevant,
both to the GoZ and to donors. The A-MDTF routinely examined the priorities of the
GoZ—as documented in its strategic economic development plans and confirmed
through ongoing dialogue facilitated by the Harare-based TTLs for each sector—to
ensure that the Fund’s thematic areas remained relevant to the Government’s evolving
priorities. The A-MDTF also identified donors’ interests when the Fund was initially set
up, and later these areas were refined to eliminate duplication of efforts among the Fund
and other donors in certain thematic areas (for example, the SPTRG and HRBSTRG
were cancelled for this reason following the MTR).

5          Effectiveness, Impact, and Sustainability
Evaluating the A-MDTF’s effectiveness, impact, and sustainability is at the core of our
evaluation. Answering the questions relating to these Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) criteria allows us to determine if:
               The A-MDTF (“the Fund?) achieved what it set out to do (effectiveness)
               The A-MDTF made measurable impacts (impact)
               The impacts delivered are likely to continue after A-MDTF funding ceases
                (sustainability).
We relied on our sample of activities to answer most of the 11 questions specified in the
TOR for these evaluation criteria. Answering these questions at a programme level was
more difficult because the annual reports—which represented the most comprehensive
record of activities funded by the A-MDTF—did not report the targets for each activity.
Thus, we could not assess how the Fund performed against expectations. Instead, we
assessed the 11 activities in our sample to determine if they did or did not produce a
desired result, and then drew conclusions on the performance of the Fund as a whole
based on the results from this sample. Where possible, we used what programme-level
information was available to support any conclusions that were based on the sampling
approach.
Because many of the effectiveness, impact, and sustainability evaluation questions are
closely related, we organise our responses accordingly: First, we present our findings on
the effectiveness of A-MDTF in achieving targeted outputs and outcomes (Section 5.1).
Secondly, we present our findings on the impacts of the Fund (Section 5.2). Thirdly, we
respond to the remaining effectiveness, impact, and sustainability questions, which are
grouped together in Section 5.3. We conclude by presenting our finding on the overall
effectiveness of the Fund (Section 5.4).
5.1        What Outputs and Outcomes Were Achieved?
The most basic measure of the Fund’s effectiveness is whether it achieved its planned
outputs and outcomes.
Each activity funded by the A-MDTF had a unique set of expected outputs19 and
outcomes20—no two activities were exactly alike. As a result, the only way to evaluate
whether the expected outputs and outcomes were achieved for the entire Fund would be
to have a robust reporting framework that tracks both the planned and achieved outputs
and outcomes for each activity over time. Such results are commonly tracked by donor
programs in a “logframe?—a tool used to track results achieved against targeted outputs
and outcomes. Logframes allow donor programs to aggregate data across multiple
outputs and outcomes to measure the overall effectiveness of a programme.

     outputs.?

The A-MDTF did not have a robust reporting framework
The A-MDTF did not have such a reporting framework. Rather, the annual reports
(which constituted the most comprehensive record of work carried out under the
A-MDTF) only reported the outputs that had been produced to-date and in some cases,
either the outputs or the impacts (or both) that had been observed.
Thus, there was no baseline against which to compare programme results, nor were there
consistent results reported for all activities. Put another way, the comprehensive
programme records tracked the work that had been done, but it never checked if this was
the work that should have been done.
Methodology for evaluating outputs and outcomes for the sample of activities
Without this type of aggregate reporting framework, it was not possible to evaluate the
A-MDTF’s overall effectiveness using this standard approach. Instead, we used an
alternative approach that used key findings on effectiveness of the sample of activities
as one of the inputs to determining the overall effectiveness of the Fund. Our
conclusions on the Fund’s effectiveness—achieving the outputs and outcomes it set out
to achieve—are, therefore, presented in Section 5.4.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the A-MDTF at the activity level, we reviewed the
concept notes (CNs) for the 11 activities in our sample. Each CN identified the planned
outputs (to be produced using the funds allocated), as well as the outcomes that were
expected given these outputs. We then compared the planned outputs and outcomes
against what was actually achieved, which was determined by reviewing documents (such
as the annual reports) and interviewing stakeholders.
The results of our activity-level analysis are provided in Table 5.1. The table presents our
understanding of the following:
          Planned outputs at activity inception versus what was actually achieved
          Planned outcomes at activity inception versus what was actually achieved
          A summary of what happened as a result of these outputs and outcomes
           (the impacts)
For each output and outcome, the table explains what was expected and what was
achieved. The cell is highlighted green and marked with a check mark only if the targeted
outputs or outcomes were fully achieved.
This table is designed to present a holistic picture of what the activity did and how it
made a difference. Brief summaries of the activities’ scopes and timelines are presented
in Appendix A.
Following Table 5.1, we provide a general analysis of the activity data. A more detailed
discussion of these activities’ impacts, and what they mean for the overall impact of the
A-MDTF, is presented in Section 5.2.

The sample of activities generally produced targeted outputs and outcomes
The analysis presented in Table 5.1 demonstrates that the 11 activities in the sample
generally produced the outputs and outcomes that were expected. There were three
exceptions, each explained below.
Activity 1.12, Study on Land Reform, is still ongoing. Therefore, we cannot yet
determine if the targeted outputs and outcomes were achieved. We have seen draft final
versions of the thematic reports and synthesis report and we understand that those will
be finalised by October 2014.
Activity 2.04, Poverty Analysis, did not produce the exact outputs that were expected,
but rather produced different outputs. This was largely because the Zimbabwe National
Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) did not grant the consultants hired by the A-MDTF access
to the underlying poverty dataset (PICES). As a result, the scope of work was redefined
so that the consultants provided TA to ZIMSTAT statisticians to support the quality of
their work, commented on the Poverty Report, and provided training on GIS mapping
techniques. However, even given the different outputs produced, the target outcomes
were still achieved.
Activity 3.05 was generally successful. This activity was designed to be flexible, and
therefore adaptive to the changing needs of the GoZ. Funds were used from this activity
to support at least six small, quick-turnaround requests from the GoZ (in addition to the
Water Forums and Policy Notes)—all of which are identified in Table 5.1. However,
three sets of target outputs (as defined in the CN) were not fully produced. Only 6 of 12
targeted Water Forums were hosted, and only 10 of 12 targeted Policy Notes for the
Water Forums were produced. In addition, we found no evidence of support provided
by the A-MDTF to improve the website of the National Action Committee (NAC) for
the water sector.
The outputs produced by the sample of activities were high quality
Overall, we found that stakeholders almost unanimously agreed that the Fund’s outputs
(studies, reports, TA, and other analytical support) were all very high quality and targeted
to their needs.
In one instance—support to the GoZ for preparation of the ZAIP and the CAADP
(1.03)—the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation, and Irrigation Development
(MAMID) and the task team leader (TTL) for the ASTRG both acknowledged that the
consultants that were hired lacked sufficient local knowledge of Zimbabwe to provide
useful outputs. Even in this case, the problem was quickly resolved by replacing the
consultants with new consultants who were able to produce a draft ZAIP to the full
satisfaction of the GoZ and the TTL.
As previously mentioned, we present our conclusions on the overall effectiveness of the
A-MDTF in Section 5.4, after answering other relevant evaluation questions that are
closely related and support our programme-level conclusions in the following sections.
5.2    What Impacts Were Realised?
Five of the evaluation questions specified in the TOR examine the same question in
slightly different ways: did activities supported by the A-MDTF deliver any impacts, and
if so, what are those impacts? The exact questions are:
          How were the outputs of different interventions used, or what were the
           plans for utilisation?




                                             27
          What are the changes stimulated or caused by A-MDTF funded projects, if
           any?
          To what extent have the activities contributed to sound policy or strategy
           formulation?
          Are there new initiatives caused by the implementation of the A-MDTF
           funded projects?
          Are there any unintended benefits or contributions made by the
           implementation of the A-MDTF activities?
Because these questions are so closely related, we group our responses together in this
section. Each question is answered in the sections below, referring to the impact data
collected for the 11 activities in our sample (and which were summarised in Table 5.1).
Where possible, we also use data collected at a programme-level.
5.2.1 How Were the Outputs of Different Interventions Used?
If the Fund’s outputs were used for other purposes or not used at all, this would decrease
the likelihood that the intended outcomes and impacts would happen. To assess if the
Fund’s outputs were used as intended, we asked stakeholders if they found the outputs
useful and, if so, how they used them.
For seven of the activities in the sample (64 percent), the outputs were used precisely as
expected at activity inception. For example, Activity 3.07 National Water Policy, the
concept note explains that donors expected the GoZ would use the Technical
Background Documents to inform the drafting of its water policy. Our interviews
confirm that this is exactly what happened. We spoke to the TTL for the Zimbabwe
Infrastructure Technical Review Group (ITRG) and the Ministry of Environment,
Water, and Climate (MEWC) and found that these documents were used to form the
country’s water policy. In fact, the MEWC referred to these documents as the
“backbone? of the National Water Policy.
There were four cases (36 percent), where the outputs were not used at all or where they
were not entirely used as expected. These exceptions are explained further below:
          Study on Land Reform (1.12)—the Ministry of Lands and Rural
           Resettlement (MLRR) has disengaged from the A-MDTF due to increased
           sensitivities surrounding land issues following the 2013 elections. Although
           this activity is still ongoing and the outputs have not been produced, it is
           highly unlikely they will be used in any official capacity
          Support to 2014 Budget Preparation (2.02)—the Ministry of Finance and
           Economic Development (MFED) used the Aide Memoire and
           accompanying Economic Growth and Recovery Notes that were produced
           with A-MDTF funding to help set the GoZ’s 2014 budget. However, one
           notable exception was that the GoZ granted wage increases to civil servants,
           despite being advised otherwise by World Bank experts
          Poverty Analysis (2.04)—ZIMSTAT did not grant the consultants access
           to the PICES data needed to produce the outputs as intended. Rather,
           ZIMSTAT prepared the Poverty Report internally with TA from the hired
           consultants. Instead of receiving a complete Poverty Map, ZIMSTAT
           statisticians were trained on mapping techniques
          Zimbabwe Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme (2.10)—We
           found no clear evidence of the outputs being taken up by the Ministry of


                                            28
                   Mines and Mining Development (MMMD), other than the recommendation
                   in a study on licensing regimes to procure a computerised mining cadastre.
This analysis shows that most outputs produced by the activities in the sample were
mostly used as planned. However, donors can reasonably expect that not all outputs
funded by the A-MDTF will be (or were) used as planned because this is ultimately up to
the GoZ. Where possible, being flexible to the needs of GoZ helped to still achieve the
desired end result. For instance, with the Poverty Analysis (2.04), the A-MDTF did well
to work with ZIMSTAT when consultants were not allowed access to the PICES data.
The result was that the Poverty Report was still produced, and some capacity was built
within ZIMSTAT by training its statisticians on poverty-mapping techniques.
5.2.2 What Are the Changes Stimulated by A-MDTF Projects?
This question essentially asks what impacts were observed as a result of an activity being
undertaken. However, to fully understand A-MDTF’s success in achieving impacts, we
must also consider what impacts were expected at activity inception, and how well the
A-MDTF performed against these expectations.
The Fund achieved the target impacts defined at the programme-level
At the programme level, the Operational Guidelines specify two impacts that are
expected from the A-MDTF:
                Donors and the World Bank remain abreast of, and are coordinated on, key
                 development challenges
                GoZ builds capacity to respond when economic conditions warrant
                 re-engagement of the donor community.21
The A-MDTF has generally succeeded in stimulating these two impacts. This is based on
the review of programme documents (such as the annual reports and the Mid Term
Review) and interviews with donors, Secretariat staff, and GoZ ministries.
For example, during interviews donors consistently mentioned that TRGs and Policy
Committee (PC) meetings provided a much needed forum for discussing key
development challenges and coordinating donor engagement.
There were also numerous examples of the GoZ’s capacity being built as a result of
A-MDTF funding, among them:
                Department of Irrigation staff learning to collect data in the field, enabling
                 future studies on other irrigation sector issues (activity 1.02)
                Over 1,800 GoZ finance officers and staff being trained on using the
                 Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) system to
                 enter revenue and expenditure data and produce financial reports (activity
                 2.17)
                The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) learning how to quickly
                 and accurately estimate water quality at geographically disperse sites using
                 remote satellite imaging, in turn slashing personnel costs that would
                 otherwise be required for field visits (activity 3.02).

The Fund achieved many of the target impacts at the activity-level
We also attempted to evaluate whether the activities in the sample succeeded in achieving
their own, unique target impacts. Impacts that were expected from individual activities
included influencing policies, stimulating institutional reforms within key sectors, or
informing the design of new government programmes, among others. Five of the 11
activities in the sample (45 percent) succeeded in achieving their target impacts, as
shown in Table 5.2.22 An additional four activities (36 percent) yielded some impacts,
although they were not exactly those that were targeted at activity inception. Expected
impacts were identified from the CNs, while impacts achieved were identified from the
latest annual report in which each activity appeared. To support these findings, we also
drew from information collected during the stakeholder interviews.
We note that though this analysis may suggest the Fund was unsuccessful in yielding
desired impacts, we believe it tells another story: that the impacts that were targeted at
the outset of the activity may not have been realistically defined. Many of the targeted
impacts were far “downstream? of the activity itself. For example, one target impact of
the National Water Policy (activity 3.07) was to induce “accelerated rehabilitation,
improved maintenance, and improved management of water and sanitation
infrastructure.? However, because this is an end result that would necessarily take time
and would be contingent on many other factors (other than formulation of the policy
itself), this may not have been an appropriate target to set. As a result many of the
activities yielded positive impacts that contributed to the Fund achieving its overall
targets, but strictly speaking may not have fully met the target impacts of the activity.




22   1.12 Study on Land Reform is ongoing, and therefore we cannot evaluate whether the expected impact has been
     achieved. However, we believe it is unlikely because the MLRR has disengaged from the CLaRP process. Therefore,
     it is counted as one of the six activities that did not achieve its expected impact.

Based on our programme and activity-level findings, we conclude that the A-MDTF was
moderately successful in stimulating changes (impacts). However, we qualify this
conclusion by emphasising that the lack of a programme-level, robust monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) framework made it impossible to prove clear links between A-MDTF
outputs and the outcomes and impacts that were observed. Document review and
stakeholder interviews allowed us to fill some gaps by attributing the impacts described in
Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 to A-MDTF interventions—but only in some cases. In many
others, we were unable to use these techniques alone to demonstrate that an observed
impact was solely the result of the A-MDTF intervention.
5.2.3   To What Extent Have the Activities Contributed to Sound Policy or
        Strategy Formulation?
This question is particularly relevant because of the analytical nature of A-MDTF’s
work. The Fund was designed to lay the foundation for future donor engagements with
the GoZ, by supporting analytical work across key thematic areas. If the analytical work
led to improvements in policies and strategies, these improvements signal to donors that
the GoZ has the capacity and commitment to engage on topics where the priorities of
the GoZ and donors overlap.
To answer this question, we investigated whether the outputs that were produced under
each of the 11 activities in the sample informed any policies or strategies.23 We first
asked GoZ ministries how the analytical work funded by the A-MDTF may have
informed their policymaking decisions. When the ministry stakeholders identified
examples, we also asked if they thought the same policies or strategies would have
resulted without the analytical work performed with A-MDTF funding.
Our activity-level analysis revealed contributions to policy or strategy formulation
resulting from 9 of the 11 activities in the sample (82 percent). Of these nine activities,
six provided “major? contributions, meaning that the GoZ stakeholders thought that the
analytical work funded by the A-MDTF was the largest factor that contributed to the
formulation of the policy or strategy. The remaining three activities provided “minor?
contributions, meaning that the analytical work influenced the policy outcome, but was
not the largest contributing factor. Only two activities in the sample did not lead to any
measurable contributions to policy or strategy formulation:
               1.12 Study on Land Reform
               2.10 Zimbabwe Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme.
The full results of this analysis are presented in Appendix C (see Table C.1).
This analysis suggests that the A-MDTF was largely successful in producing analytical
work that ultimately led to the formulation of policies or strategies by the GoZ.
5.2.4 Are There New Initiatives Caused by the A-MDTF Projects?
We understand “initiative? to mean other government or donor-supported programmes
and activities. Given this definition, this question is important because it can signal
whether the A-MDTF had a lasting and sustainable impact by spurring follow-on
activities. These follow-on activities could be more analytical work, similar to that funded
by the A-MDTF, or other types of activities, such as investment in key sectors.


23   Our approach was informed by the framework used by the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility’s (PPIAF)
     Monitoring and Evaluation Methodology.




                                                          34
To answer this question, we first assessed what new initiatives may have been expected at
the beginning of the activity. We reviewed the CNs from our sample of 11 activities and
interviewed GoZ and donor stakeholders to identify how many activities were expected
to have follow-on initiatives.
Based on this review, only 5 of the 11 activities in the sample were expected to produce
new initiatives. For example, according to the CN for activity 2.17, donors expected that
the initial Zimbabwe Public Financial Management System (PFMS) work might lead the
GoZ to continue future development on the IFMIS, enabling increased functionality on
the platform.
To confirm that these expected initiatives actually occurred and to identify any
unplanned follow-on initiatives, we interviewed the GoZ ministries and donors. The
analysis found that 6 of the 11 activities in the sample actually led to new initiatives being
undertaken by donors or by the GoZ. For example, as a result of the Water Forums
supported by 3.05 Flexible TA for Infrastructure, the MEWC is seeking to continue the
dialogue and sector coordination by convening similar TA forums on a less frequent
basis (due to funding restrictions). The full results of this analysis are presented in
Appendix C (see Table C.2).
This activity-level analysis, therefore, suggests that the A-MDTF was moderately
successful in stimulating new initiatives.
5.2.5  Are There Any Unintended Benefits or Contributions Made by the
       Implementation of the Activities?
The purpose of this question is to understand whether the A-MDTF-supported activities
may have led to any benefits or contributions that were not anticipated when donors
approved the activity.
To answer this question, we looked for evidence of unintended benefits or contributions
resulting from the 11 activities in the sample. Evidence was drawn from reviewing
programme documents, and interviewing key Government and donor stakeholders.
During these interviews, whenever possible, we also asked questions to determine the
level of attribution of these unintended benefits and contributions to the A-MDTF
funded activities. This allowed us to conclude if the A-MDTF funded activities were
necessary to create these unintended benefits and contributions.
Of the 11 activities in the sample, in just one instance were unintended benefits or
contributions identified and attributed to an A-MDTF engagement: 2.10 Zimbabwe
Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme. In this case, the A-MDTF had been funding
various studies, workshops, and dialogues on mining sector policy issues, including
taxation, licensing, and revenue transparency. During this activity, the World Bank
mining experts were unexpectedly granted access to the diamond fields controlled by the
Zimbabwe Army, thus allowing these experts to gather more information that helped
inform the dialogue. The TTL for the EMGTRG confirmed that this would likely not
have happened without the ongoing policy dialogue that was maintained with A-MDTF
funding.
We also found two other instances of unintended benefits or contributions attributed to
A-MDTF-funded activities that were outside the sample of 11 activities. Both cases were
identified through stakeholder interviews:
           2.08 Small Business Survey—the Microfinance Wholesale Trust is a
            donor-funded facility that on-lends to microfinance institutions throughout
            Zimbabwe. The Trust used the A-MDTF-funded Small Business Survey to


                                              35
             help re-focus its lending programs to respond to the needs of the informal
             economy, which increasingly dominates the Zimbabwean economy. While
             this is not a surprising result, it was not anticipated by donors when funding
             the survey
          3.02 Water Quality Monitoring Strategy—this activity was originally
           designed to enable a rapid assessment of water quality in watersheds using
           remote sensing techniques, and without requiring costly field visits. As the
           techniques were developed and validated, the University of Zimbabwe
           researchers supported by the A-MDTF discovered that the same techniques
           could also be used to allow a rapid assessment of dam reservoir levels. The
           EMA is now looking to also implement this application of the remote
           sensing techniques
Our activity-level analysis yields very limited evidence that the A-MDTF led to
unintended benefits or contributions in Zimbabwe. Rather, we found that it was far more
common for the activities to achieve what was intended, or less in some cases (as shown
in Table 5.1).
5.3     What Were Other Factors Influencing Effectiveness, Impact,
        and Sustainability?
The remaining five evaluation questions address different aspects of the effectiveness,
impact, and sustainability of A-MDTF-funded activities:
          Are the targeted beneficiaries aware of project interventions meant to assist
           them? (Effectiveness)
          What are the perceived benefits? (Impact)
          Are the results and impacts of A-MDTF’s activities likely to continue after
           funding has stopped? (Sustainability)
          How effectively did the Fund manage risks related to its activities, including
           financial risks, reputation risks, political risks, social risks, and environmental
           risks? (Effectiveness)
          What were the Trust Fund’s critical success factors and how did the Fund
           perform against these? (Effectiveness).
We respond to these five questions in the following sub-sections. Analysis was based on
a mix of information collected from the sample of 11 activities and, where appropriate,
programme-level information.
5.3.1   Are the Targeted Beneficiaries Aware of Interventions Meant to Assist
        Them?
For the A-MDTF to have a meaningful impact on the targeted stakeholders, it is
important that the stakeholders actually knew about the work A-MDTF was funding. If
targeted stakeholders were unaware of the Fund’s intervention, they would be less likely
to use the documents, training, and other benefits supported by the Fund, thus lowering
the Fund’s effectiveness.
To answer this question, we identified the Fund’s targeted beneficiaries, and determined
their level of awareness of the A-MDTF intervention. We interviewed the targeted
beneficiaries identified during our field visit to Zimbabwe, asking about their awareness
of our sample of 11 activities.
We identified two types of beneficiaries:


                                             36
                Direct beneficiaries—GoZ ministries that were the counterparts for A-
                 MDTF studies, TA activities, knowledge exchanges, or information
                 management system implementations
                Indirect beneficiaries—private sector and non-state actors with a vested
                 interest in policies that may have been influenced or supported by an
                 A-MDTF activity. This could include chambers of commerce, farmers’
                 unions, think tanks, or NGOs.
In preparation for our field visit, we assembled a matrix of targeted beneficiaries for the
activities in the sample. This matrix included all direct beneficiaries identified in the CNs,
as well as indirect beneficiaries that we hypothesised might have had knowledge of the
work funded by the A-MDTF24.
In total, we identified 35 unique beneficiaries (both direct and indirect). Of these 35
beneficiaries, we interviewed 24 (68 percent)—due to time restrictions—to determine
their level of awareness of A-MDTF-supported activities. For each sample activity, we
assessed the level of awareness of all relevant beneficiaries for that particular activity.
Certain beneficiaries were interviewed for more than one activity.
From our interviews, we found that a majority of the beneficiaries we interviewed (75
percent) were aware of A-MDTF, and the sample of A-MDTF supported activities. All
16 of the direct beneficiaries we interviewed were aware of the activities we asked about,
while 67 percent of indirect beneficiaries (35 of 52) were aware of these activities.25
By thematic area, beneficiaries were most aware of ITRG activities. Of the 10
stakeholders we interviewed about ITRG activities, nine were aware of the activities (90
percent). Of the 23 stakeholders interviewed about ASTRG activities, 18 were aware of
these activities (78 percent). Of the 21 stakeholders interviewed EMGTRG activities, 11
were aware of these activities (52 percent). We also asked about the one activity in the
sample from the former SPTRG: Feasibility Study for Adapting the Public Works
Approach in Private Sector Projects, Government and Municipality Civil Works (4.01).
Of the three targeted beneficiaries questioned, two out of three (67 percent) were aware
of this activity.
It should be noted here that there was one key beneficiary that we were unable to speak
with: MLRR. While the MLRR was a key targeted beneficiary for activity 1.12, Study on
Land Reform, we were unable to verify this beneficiary’s awareness of the activity due to
political sensitivities in Zimbabwe on land reform issues. However, we do have anecdotal
evidence from the TTL for the ASTRG and the Barefoot Education for Africa Trust
(BEAT) that technical experts within the MLRR are following this work (though no
public acknowledgement has been made).
Based on our sampling approach, we conclude that the A-MDTF ensured that direct
beneficiaries were aware of the analytical work relevant to them, while indirect
beneficiaries were not always aware. The Fund did particularly well in ensuring that both
direct and indirect beneficiaries were aware of activities within the ITRG. In general, the
A-MDTF failed to engage indirect beneficiaries in the private sector, as well as NGOs

24   Our list was not designed to be exhaustive, given the number of NGOs (at least 1,200) and other indirect
     beneficiaries operating in Zimbabwe.
25   Although we interviewed 35 unique beneficiaries, we hypothesised that some beneficiaries were aware of more than
     one activity (we confirmed this was true in many cases). For the purposes of illustrating awareness of activities, we
     count each beneficiary-activity combination separately.




                                                            37
(particularly those working on civil society issues). Private sector organisations, such as
industry and trade associations, did not always have knowledge of the A-MDTF’s work.
Some NGOs (including the Poverty Reduction Forum Trust) even declined our
interview requests because they had no knowledge of the A-MDTF.
5.3.2 What Are the Perceived Benefits?
Having identified which beneficiaries were aware of A-MDTF’s activities, we asked them
what benefits they received from this sample of activities. Understanding the benefits
received by targeted stakeholders is important for defining the impacts achieved by the
Fund.
Based on these interviews, we found that the A-MDTF generated two key types of
benefits for the targeted beneficiaries:
          Increased dialogue among stakeholders—according to target
           beneficiaries, the Fund fostered dialogue among stakeholders. This was
           particularly relevant for the agriculture sector, because previously the GoZ
           had not held consultations for key agriculture issues. Likewise, A-MDTF’s
           activities in the water sector succeeded in facilitating consultations and
           dialogues among key sector participants
          Increased technical capacity—target beneficiaries agreed that the Fund
           built technical capacity in key government institutions, such as ZIMSTAT,
           the MFED, and the MEWC. For example, the A-MDTF-funded work with
           ZIMSTAT led to significant improvements in the quality and credibility of
           statistical products
A summary of the key benefits identified through interviews with targeted beneficiaries
are presented in Table 5.3. Benefits are identified per activity in the sample.

1.02 Determinants of the           The Department of Irrigation identified two benefits:
productivity and sustainability     – The secondment of GoZ staff to the study team helped build capacity to carry out future field-based studies on irrigation issues
of Zimbabwe irrigation              – The study itself helped the GoZ to realise the need for improved sector coordination on irrigation investments
                                   Zim-ACP said that the study was very helpful because it found that a third of the irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe are fully functional,
                                    another third are only partially functional, and the final third are not functional at all. In doing so, it laid bare the challenges to be

1.03 Support to the                The Permanent Secretary of Agriculture thought that the TA provided a significant boost toward enabling private sector investment in
Government of Zimbabwe              the agriculture sector. He views the ZAIP as an essential precursor to opening up the sector to much needed investment
towards preparation of its         According to the African Institute for Agrarian Studies (AIAS), the process of producing the ZAIP and signing onto the CAADP

2.04 Poverty Analysis              ZIMSTAT identified three benefits:
                                    – This activity provided the funding that was needed to produce the first analysis of poverty in Zimbabwe since 2001
                                    – The training on mapping techniques that the consultants hired by the A-MDTF helped build the capacity of ZIMSTAT
                                    – The participation of the consultants in reviewing and commenting on the study helped improve the credibility of the Poverty Report
2.10 Zimbabwe Mining Sector  The MMMD credited the A-MDTF with helping build capacity within the ministry by providing access to technical expertise that would

                             The ZASMC indicated that the workshops and studies supported under this activity were useful in that they allowed for networking
                              within the mining sector
                             The Chamber of Mines perceived two benefits:
                              – The GoZ is tendering a computerisation of the mining cadastral system, which will result in reduced conflicts between miners and
                                 farmers, and among miners themselves
                              – The “Diagnostic Study on Modernisation of the Mineral Licensing System? is helping shape the Chamber’s own conceptual thinking

Activity                      Benefits Identified by Targeted Beneficiaries
2.16 ZIMSTAT—System            The Director General of ZIMSTAT indicated that the involvement of international statistics experts (with A-MDTF support) provided
Wide Approach to Statistics     yet another way to underpin the integrity and credibility of the statistical products generated by ZIMSTAT. He emphasized that
                                ZIMSTAT has a high level of technical capacity, but that the TA enabled ZIMSTAT to improve its reputation for providing accurate,
                                independent statistics
                               Five organisations (ZMWF, FAO, NANGO, UNICEF, and CFU) indicated that the quality of ZIMSTAT’s statistical data and reports
                                has significantly improved over the past two years
2.17 Zimbabwe PFMS             The training built capacity within the GoZ to enter data and run reports using the IFMIS. Before, users were not using the system
Technical Assistance            efficiently and productively
                               The MFED is now in a position to analyse the revenue and expenditure from global revenue down to the lowest unit in the
                                Government (except for district councils, which is a forthcoming system upgrade)
3.05 Flexible TA for           The Director of Water Resources at the MEWC stated that the Water Forum provided a recurring opportunity to convene all of the key
Infrastructure                  stakeholders to think about the major challenges facing the water sector
                               From the MEWC’s perspective, the peer-to-peer learning visits were highly valuable because they allowed key stakeholders in the water
                                sector understand how sector reforms can be achieved (such as privatisation, introduction of prepaid meters, and so on)
3.07 National Water Policy     The Director of Water Resources at the MEWC identified two benefits:
                                – The Technical Background Documents “provided the backbones of the National Water Policy?
                                – The A-MDTF’s assistance provided an impetus to convene all of the stakeholders in a way that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred
                               The Director of Urban Authorities at the MLGPWNH stated that prior to the A-MDTF’s support that led to the National Water
                                Policy, the GoZ didn’t have a sector policy. Referring to the constant crises facing the sector, the Director said “we were just constantly
                                fighting fires. Now [that we have a policy], [we] are starting somewhere. It forced us to think about the structural questions…?
                               ZINWA indicated that without the support from the A-MDTF, it would have taken many more years to generate the knowledge
                                provided by the Technical Background Documents and inputs to the drafting of the National Water Policy
4.01 Feasibility Study for     The MPWLSW identified three benefits:
Adapting the Public Works       – It helped the GoZ take stock of its public works programme and understand whether it was making a difference in the communities
Approach in Private Sector        where it was being implemented
Projects, Government and        – It enabled reforms to the programme, and the development of an operational manual to ensure that the programme created a
Municipality Civil Works          meaningful impact
                                – It helped bring donors such as USAID, the UN World Food Programme, DFID, and FAO to participate in the productive
                                  community works programme

5.3.3    Are the Results and Impacts Likely to Continue after Funding Has
         Stopped?
In Section 5.3.2, we identified two impacts that were broadly achieved by the A-MDTF:
(i) increased dialogue among stakeholders, and (ii) increased technical capacity in key
government institutions. We also identified the specific impacts that were achieved by
each activity in the sample (see Table 5.1). Yet, the question remains: how sustainable are
these impacts without continued support from the A-MDTF?
To assess the sustainability of impacts from closed projects, we asked beneficiaries if
these impacts had, so far, continued after A-MDTF funding stopped. For ongoing
projects, we assessed the likelihood that benefits would continue in the future. For
instance, if the A-MDTF outputs are currently being used to shape future plans, then the
benefits will likely continue. We also asked key stakeholders their view on whether these
benefits would be sustained in the future. The results of this analysis are presented in
Table 5.4.
Table 5.4: Likelihood of Sustained Results and Impacts for the Sampled Activities
Activity                     Are the Results and Impacts Likely to be Sustained?
1.02 Determinants of the     Maybe—Although the targeted impacts have not yet been achieved,
productivity and             the MEWC reports that a National Irrigation Policy is forthcoming,
sustainability of Zimbabwe   which may implement many of the recommendations contained in
irrigation                   this study
1.03 Support to the          Yes—The ZAIP and signing of the CAADP compact set into
Government of Zimbabwe       motion an ongoing process to fully validate the ZAIP and continue
towards preparation of its   the process toward attracting private investment in the agriculture
Agriculture Investment       sector. This will continue independently of any continued support
Plan and the CAADP           from the A-MDTF donors
1.12 Study on Land           No—The activity is still ongoing, but it is unlikely to produce any
Reform                       impacts because of continuing sensitivities surrounding land reform
                             issues
2.02 Support to 2014         No—The activity was a TA that was designed to support the 2014
Budget Preparation           budget cycle, rather than to produce sustained benefits for the
                             MFED
2.04 Poverty Analysis        No—The largest impacts were realised shortly after the activity was
                             concluded. The analysis contained within the Poverty Report is
                             static and over time its value will decline, therefore it cannot be
                             expected to have sustained impacts
2.10 Zimbabwe Mining         No—The MMMD indicated that continued donor support is
Sector Policy Advisory       necessary to acquire knowledge of international best practice in the
Programme                    mining sector, and to gain access to technical expertise
2.16 ZIMSTAT—System          Yes—The NSDS that was developed and finalised with support
Wide Approach to             from this TA is being used by ZIMSTAT to define what products
Statistics                   (surveys, censuses, and so on) it produces over the four-year
                             planning horizon (2011–2015) and what resources are required to
                             produce each product. This document will help the agency secure
                             funding so that it can produce high-quality statistics through at least
                             2015
2.17 Zimbabwe PFMS           Yes—Several successor TA activities have been carried out to
Technical Assistance         continue support for developing and deploying new features for the
                             IFMIS. Even once funding ends for these activities, having a robust

Activity                     Are the Results and Impacts Likely to be Sustained?
                             IFMIS is likely to have lasting impacts for the economy. By
                             enabling accurate and rapid financial reports and improving
                             electronic bookkeeping, the public is likely to benefit from
                             improved government service delivery
3.05 Flexible TA for         Yes—The GoZ plans to continue the academic seminar format of
Infrastructure               the Water Forum (although less frequently), even after A-MDTF
                             funding terminates. Having a forum to discuss key sector issues and
                             promote debate on potential solutions will support improved water
                             resource development and water supply in both urban and rural
                             settings. ZINWA is likely to implement performance contracts to
                             boost collection rates, which will improve ZINWA’s financial and
                             operating health
3.07 National Water Policy Yes—The NWP set into motion a restructuring of the water sector,
                           including redefinition of roles and responsibilities among GoZ
                           agencies and parastatals. The GoZ is working to execute this
                           reorganization, which requires harmonisation of other policies, as
                           well as enabling legislation to be passed by Parliament. Once
                           complete, the restructured sector should enable improved service
                           delivery for urban and rural water supply, as well as best practice
                           management of water resource development and water quality
4.01 Feasibility Study for   Yes—This initial study has led to a revitalisation of the Productive
Adapting the Public Works    Safety Net Programme (PSNP), and has enabled the GoZ to
Approach in Private Sector   continue the programme with the support of donors (outside the
Projects, Government and     A-MDTF). Without the technical underpinning provided by this
Municipality Civil Works     study, it is unlikely that the programme would have secured donor
                             funding to continue operations


In summary, six of the 11 activities (54 percent) have delivered sustained benefits (or are
likely to deliver sustained benefits) beyond the duration of A-MDTF funding. One
additional activity (1.02) may yield sustained benefits, if its target impact is achieved. Four
of the 11 activities (36 percent) are unlikely to produce any sustained benefits—either
because no measurable impact was achieved (such as activities 1.12 and 2.10), or because
the impacts were never intended to be sustained (such as activities 2.02 and 2.04).
While in some cases the work supported by the A-MDTF was unlikely to be carried
forward in the short term without outside donor funding (such as activity 4.01 and 2.17),
the benefits of the activity are nonetheless sustainable. This is because absent this initial
analysis, these programmes would have lacked the technical underpinning to justify
donor support to carry out programmatic work (which cannot be funded by the
A-MDTF). In fact, both the PFMS project and the PSNP have benefitted from
programmatic funding from outside donors.
Given the analytical and abstract nature of the work supported by the A-MDTF, it is
difficult to say with full confidence that its impacts will be sustained. However, based on
our assessment of the sustainability of the sample of A-MDTF activities, we conclude
that these examples provide credible (though not conclusive) evidence that the Fund has
contributed to sustained impacts in Zimbabwe.
5.3.4 How Effectively Did the Fund Manage Risks Related to Its Activities?
Another measure of effectiveness is how well a programme is able to identify and
manage its risks. By identifying risks early on, the programme can devise appropriate


                                               42
mitigation strategies, and thus deliver benefits more effectively. It is also important to
check if the programme identified new risks during implementation, and took steps to
mitigate them.
Risks to A-MDTF activities can be categorized into three main areas:
               Financial risks—such as constraints on donor funding or delays in
                disbursement
               Reputation risks—such as harm to the donors’ or the Bank’s credibility
                resulting from contextually inappropriate interventions or policy
                recommendations
               Political risks—such as a lack of GoZ buy-in for specific activities due to
                political sensitivities.
The TOR also identifies a fourth risk category for the A-MDTF activities: social and
environmental risks.26 However, given the analytical, policy-oriented nature of A-MDTF’s
activities, we did not find this risk particularly relevant to the Fund. Therefore, our
analysis does not penalize the effectiveness of A-MDTF for instances where social and
environmental risks were not considered.
Risk identification and mitigation at the programme level
To determine how effectively A-MDTF managed risks, we first examined what risks
were identified at the programme level, and what plans the Fund had in place to mitigate
them.
In its inception documents, which include the Administrative Agreement (AA) and the
Operational Guidelines, the Fund never identified any risks or strategies to mitigate risks.
The A-MDTF’s 2010 Mid Term Review (MTR) did identify the following risks to the
Fund:
               Donor harmonisation and coordination
               Slow government response
               Priorities becoming misaligned
               Multiple roles for the World Bank
               Supervision from the field and headquarters (Washington, DC).
However, the Secretariat (in particular, the A-MDTF Manager) was unable to identify
how these risks were systematically mitigated across the A-MDTF’s portfolio.
Risk identification and mitigation at the activity level
Based on the sample of activities, this evaluation found that the A-MDTF failed to
systematically identify risks and risk mitigation strategies when defining and approving
activities.
Of the 11 concept notes reviewed for the sample of activities, only three notes explicitly
identified risks, and only one concept note defined mitigation strategies (2.17 Zimbabwe
PFMS Technical Assistance).


26   Social risks can include harm to social groups (particularly the poor) resulting in full or in part from an A-MDTF
     intervention. Environmental risks can include harm to the environment resulting in full or in part from an A-MDTF
     intervention.




                                                           43
We also reviewed risks identified in the Grant Funding Request (GFR) documents for
the sample of 11 activities. For each A-MDTF activity approved, a corresponding GFR
was generated internally for World Bank staff. Each GFR requires a description of
potential risks and strategies to mitigate these risks.
Our review of the GFR documents also indicated that A-MDTF did not perform a
robust risk-identification or mitigation analysis before implementing activities. Many
GFRs identified potential risks to activities, but did not outline mitigation strategies. We
also found instances where some risks were identified, but the full range of potential risks
was not considered. For instance, GFRs often identified political risks, but did not
mention relevant financial or reputational risks. Thus, the risk of exhausting donor funds
before finishing the activity (financial) or consultants providing contextually
inappropriate recommendations or using politically controversial language (reputational)
were not always considered.
Although risks and mitigation strategies were not commonly identified at the beginning
of the activity, we did identify two cases (activities 1.03 and 3.07) where risks and
mitigation strategies were identified while implementing the activity.
We also note that of all the activities in the sample, 2.17 Zimbabwe PFMS Technical
Assistance, had the most comprehensive and credible risk mitigation strategy. The
activity defined 12 unique risks and corresponding mitigation strategies. It is perhaps not
surprising that this activity encountered only minimal implementation problems. The
biggest problem was with the consultants hired to carry out training. Even so, the
activity’s risk management framework helped resolve the problem: the consultants were
later debarred from winning future work on PFMS assignments.
Had the A-MDTF used a more robust and systematic approach to identify and manage
risks, the Fund may have been more effective. For instance, the lack of a risk
management strategy could, perhaps, partly explain why the closing dates and
disbursement windows for the Fund were extended on several occasions (more on this in
Section 6.1.4). During the programme, activities were often extended due to insufficient
buy-in from the GoZ, or because of delays caused by the GoZ counterparts (which may
have been indicative of insufficient buy-in or capacity to actively engage with the
A-MDTF). Had this risk been identified early on, perhaps some of these extensions
could have been avoided. However, we acknowledge that some of these extensions may
have happened regardless due to the changing political economy.
Nonetheless, it is important to define risks and mitigation strategies during project
inception, so that the risk management processes are institutionalised early on into the
activity. This process should be done consistently across all programme activities, and
should consider the full range of relevant risks to the programme.
5.3.5    What Were the Trust Fund’s Critical Success Factors and How Did the
         Fund Perform?
Critical success factors are features of the design and operation of the A-MDTF that
were necessary for the Fund to perform well, that is, to deliver the expected results
(outputs, outcomes, and impacts). Identifying these success factors is critical for
understanding what made the A-MDTF effective, so that the factors can be taken into
consideration in designing future programs.




                                             44
These critical success factors were not formally defined by A-MDTF,27 rather, we
identified them during our interview with the Secretariat MDTF Programme Manager.28
According to the Manager, the key critical success factors included the following:
                Donor commitment and engagement
                Secretariat understanding of the GoZ bureaucracy and its priorities
                Buy-in from GoZ
                Flexibility of the Fund
                Access to information and a communications strategy
                Availability of local World Bank specialists
We then assessed how the Fund performed on each of these six factors, using
information from our document review and stakeholder interviews. The results of this
analysis are grouped by success factor below, followed by our general conclusions on this
evaluation question.
Donor commitment and engagement
Donor commitment can be measured in terms of financial contributions and the level of
participation in the Fund’s TRGs and the PC.
Donors had varying levels of financial commitment to the Fund, ranging from
US$300,000 to nearly US$7.3 million. While contributions ranged, nearly all of the
donors who contributed to the old TF also contributed to the new TF. Two donors—the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland (formerly FINNIDA) and the Canada Department
of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development (formerly CIDA)—opted-out of the new
TF , while the World Bank was advised not to contribute (in the MTR) to avoid conflicts
of interest as a donor and Fund administrator.
Participation in the Fund also varied. From interviews with the TRGs, the PC, and the
Secretariat, we found that some donors were highly engaged in the Fund while others did
not participate at all in certain TRGs, and in some instances rarely participated in the PC.
These donors generally had smaller in-country staff, and therefore did not have sufficient
capacity to actively engage in A-MDTF governance.
Donor participation at both the TRG - and the PC-level is important given the level of
responsibility these groups have in operating the fund. In particular, the role of the TRGs
is to consider the technical merits of proposals for new activities, and make an informed
recommendation to the PC of whether or not to fund the activity. The PC then holds the
authority to approve or reject activity proposals, based on the recommendations of the
TRGs and the donors’ overall priorities, which are expressed within the forum of the PC.
Thus, it is critical for donors with expertise in each of the Fund’s thematic areas
(infrastructure, economic management and governance, and agriculture) to participate in
the TRGs so as to make informed decisions on which activity proposals to pursue.
Similarly, it is important for donors to participate in the PC to inform the direction of the
Fund and the activities pursued.

27   This was determined after checking with the A-MDTF and reviewing the 2009 and 2011 Operational Guidelines,
     the Administrative Agreement, and other inception documents.
28   We also asked donors and other Secretariat staff what they thought the critical success factors were, but they did not
     have any additions to the factors already listed by the Programme Manager.




                                                             45
Secretariat understanding of the GoZ bureaucracy and its priorities
Understanding the needs of the Fund’s targeted stakeholders is the first step in designing
an effective programme. Without a strong understanding of GoZ’s key priorities and
needs, and how it operates, it would be difficult to design activities to meet these needs.
To assess how well the World Bank Secretariat understood the GoZ and its priorities, we
spoke with GoZ stakeholders. Representatives from five different Government
ministries and agencies29 agreed that the World Bank staff had a strong relationship with
the GoZ, and that they were able to proactively identify the Government’s needs and
priorities.
Evaluating the extent to which the A-MDTF’s activities were aligned with the needs of
GoZ will also be part of our relevance analysis in the next draft of this report.
Buy-in from the GoZ
After pursuing activities aligned with GoZ needs, A-MDTF still needed to get enough
Government buy-in to successfully implement activities, and ensure that the end-
products would be put to use.
From our conversations with GoZ stakeholders, we found that many ministries and
agencies generally felt engaged and actively consulted during the A-MDTF activity
conceptualization and implementation stages. For instance, during activity 1.03 to
support the Zimbabwe Agriculture Investment Plan (ZAIP), the Secretariat worked
closely with the MAMID staff to meet the GoZ’s needs. From our conversations with
the Permanent Secretary of Agriculture, we understand that the initial consultants
selected for the activity were not well-suited to meet the GoZ’s objectives for drafting
the agriculture investment plan. To resolve the situation, the Secretariat worked with
MAMID staff to find consultants that better suited the GoZ’s needs; the new consultants
worked in close consultation with MAMID staff to draft the ZAIP
We found similar Government buy-in for the development of the National Water Policy
(activity 3.07). Our conversations with the Director of Water Resources at MEWC, and
the Director of Urban Local Authorities with the Ministry of Local Government, Public
Works, and National Housing (MLGPWNH) revealed that both stakeholders felt
“involved from the beginning? in developing the policy. Specifically, they both stated
that they were routinely consulted to provide feedback on the technical background
documents that were delivered by the consultants, and which served as the “backbone?
of the policy.
However, we also found cases where Government buy-in was lacking. For instance,
donors and the Secretariat readily acknowledged that the Ministry of Lands was not
directly engaged during the analytical work on land-reform issues (including the Study on
Land Reform, activity 1.12). This was a sensitive issue in Zimbabwe, and thus inhibited
direct engagement with the Ministry. One donor in particular expressed frustration with
the Government’s overall level of engagement on ASTRG activities, indicating that there
were fundamentally differing perspectives between the Government and donors on
agricultural policy.
The Secretariat and many of the donors we spoke with acknowledged that the level of
GoZ buy-in varied depending on the type of activity and sector. By the donors’ own
admission, this was somewhat intentional, and done for various reasons.
29   Including the MEWC; the MAMID; the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); the Environmental
     Management Agency (EMA); and the Ministry of Public Works, Labour, and Social Welfare (MPWLSW).




                                                     46
Donors often sought a mix of activities with different levels of risk. For instance, the
payroll audit and the mining sector activities were considered “high risk, high reward.?
As one donor stated, “[we] weren’t sure how far it would go but there was the potential
for transformational impact. In many of these cases, it turned out there wasn’t the
political will.?
On the other side of the spectrum, support to upgrade and roll-out Public Finance
Management System (PFMS) was considered a “low risk? activity. This was because there
was a “willing counterpart? and “a lot of support internally [within the GoZ]?.
Flexibility of the Fund
The Flexible TA activities were a particularly relevant and successful vehicle for ensuring
that the GoZ’s needs were met in a timely manner.
For example, by allocating some funds to the Flexible TA for Infrastructure activity
(3.05), the Fund was able to respond rapidly to the Government’s needs as they arose.
This included an assessment of water supply in Bulawayo and the infrastructure policy
note to inform the 2014 budget preparation.
Although some flexible activities were implemented, the Secretariat explained that the
Fund was not as flexible as it could have been for three main reasons:
               The AA created the additional administrative burden of requiring all donors
                to re-sign if any one donor decided to increase its contribution
               The AA also created additional administrative burdens to extend the
                disbursement window (as was done several times given politically-driven
                delays of activities)30
               The A-MDTF’s mandate limited the types of activities that could be
                supported.
The MEWC also indicated that the Fund could have been more flexible by responding to
requests more quickly, and by being open to funding more types of activities. For
example, the MEWC said that the process for reviewing and approving activity concepts
is “very onerous and can easily go on forever.? The Ministry said that there were a few
instances where requests were made for rapid TA, but the window of opportunity closed
before the A-MDTF could complete its internal review processes.
In addition, the MEWC also said that the Flexible TA was sometime “limited in terms of
the scope of what it could cover.? As an example, he said that the MEWC wished that
the A-MDTF could provide support not only for analysis, but also to help implement the
findings and recommendations of the studies.
Access to information and a communications strategy
Disseminating A-MDTF funded reports is important for spreading the findings of A-
MDTF supported studies, and thus spreading the intended benefits. It is also important
to disseminate A-MDTF information to the donor community to increase donor
support.
The donors we interviewed unequivocally agreed that the A-MDTF website was not
properly used to publish final reports and other outputs supported by the Fund. Findings
from our document reviews also confirmed this result. During the evaluation data

30   These administrative burdens were primarily driven by the need to secure approval from each donor’s headquarters
     before amending the AA to allow for increased contributions or extended disbursement windows.




                                                          47
collection stage, we faced significant challenges obtaining information on the A-MDTF
from web-based sources, including from the A-MDTF website.
Notably, the A-MDTF website is missing two of the three Annual Reports (2011 and
2013), and has only posted 14 reports and other documents. By comparison, we received
over 170 non-proprietary documents from the Secretariat for the purposes of this
evaluation. Presumably, there are dozens more documents that were produced under the
A-MDTF that could have been published online.
Donors also agreed that the A-MDTF lacked a communications strategy to “tell the
story? of the Fund, both to the public, and to the donors’ senior management staff. For
example, one donor indicated that there was a “mismatch between what donors
wanted—short, snappy summaries—and [the long reports produced]?. As a result, the
work supported by the A-MDTF “was hard for the embassies here to ‘sell’ back to
headquarters.?
Another donor echoed this sentiment, stating that while some studies were confidential
or sensitive, “many others could have been more widely communicated.? On the topic of
proper tailoring of outputs for various stakeholders, the delegation indicated that they
could not send the reports that were being produced as-is to their senior management
because “they would never read it.?
As a result of the limited dissemination and often inappropriate communication
strategies, the outputs supported by the A-MDTF were likely less effective than they
could have been. During our stakeholder interviews, one donor stated that the Fund’s
failure to use the website, and to market the studies and outputs appropriately, “limited
the potential impact of those analytical pieces.?
Availability of local World Bank specialists
Identifying GoZ needs requires World Bank specialists to be available, and interacting
with the Government stakeholders. These local specialists are crucial for achieving
effective and well-designed activities targeted to the needs of GoZ.
In general, GoZ stakeholders spoke positively about the level of engagement and
availability of local World Bank specialists. For example, the Permanent Secretary of
Agriculture said that local World Bank staff would “quiz? MAMID staff to identify the
Ministry’s needs. The staff then developed and shepherded activities through the
approval process to secure the necessary funds to implement these activities. In
particular, the TA for the ZAIP (activity 1.03) was cited as a success.
The EMA also recognized the availability of local World Bank specialists. A
representative from the EMA said that a local World Bank technical expert worked with
them to identify their needs and to secure funding to carry out urgent analyses. On one
occasion, World Bank staff worked with the EMA to quickly analyse mercury pollution
in the environment.
According to the Secretariat,31 after more local World Bank staff were assigned following
the Mid Term Review, the ability of the A-MDTF to respond to requests greatly
improved, particularly for rapid TA requests. This view was seconded by the TTL for
EMGTRG, “after teams were moved to Harare, it became much easier and rewarding to
interface with the GoZ.? The same TTL also indicated that relationships were
strengthened between the TTLs and donors once more local staff were assigned.

31   Identified through interviews with the Secretariat and by reviewing the A-MDTF Annual Reports.




                                                          48
Unfortunately, donors have indicated that since the recent World Bank restructuring
efforts, some local specialists have been withdrawn from the Harare office. Donors
claimed this is now stretching the Secretariat’s ability to actively engage with the GoZ.
Two of the three sector TTLs are now located in Washington.
Conclusions on critical success factors
Based on the evidence presented above for the six critical success factors, we draw the
following key conclusions:
          The A-MDTF performed inadequately against the success factor “access to
           information and a communications strategy.? This result was supported
           unequivocally by evidence found through document reviews and from
           interviews
          The A-MDTF performed particularly well against two critical success
           factors: (1) Secretariat understanding of the GoZ bureaucracy and its
           priorities, and (2) Availability of local World Bank specialists. We note that
           these two factors are correlated: having an adequate team of local specialists
           is likely to increase the level of understanding of the GoZ and its policy
           priorities. Thus it makes sense that if the Fund performed well on one of
           these success factors, it would also perform well on the other
          The A-MDTF performed reasonably well against the remaining three critical
           success factors: (1) donor commitment and engagement, (2) buy-in from
           GoZ, and (3) flexibility of the Fund. As explained above, evidence from our
           evaluation indicates that the Fund performed well against these success
           factors, with only a few minor exceptions.
5.4    Was the A-MDTF Effective Overall?
We found that the A-MDTF was generally effective in achieving its objectives—its target
outputs and outcomes. This conclusion is based on the key findings for two questions:
          Did the sample of activities we reviewed achieve their target outputs and
           outcomes? (effectiveness of the sample)
          Did the Fund spend its resources on the right things? (relevance of the
           Fund)
We used this approach because the Fund’s M&E framework did not provide a response
to the basic effectiveness question—were target outputs and outcomes achieved?—for
all of the activities. Answering the question in this manner would have required
comparing the targets established in the CNs for each of the activities in the A-MDTF
portfolio against the results reported in the Annual Report. However, this approach was
outside the scope of this evaluation.
As our analysis effectiveness throughout this section showed, the sample of activities
produced many of the target outputs that they set out to produce, and many of the target
outcomes were ultimately achieved. We also found that nine of the 11 activities in the
sample also stimulated some of the impacts that were expected by donors. We, therefore,
conclude that the sample of activities was effective.
In addition, the Fund did all the right things to ensure that it stayed relevant to the
analytical needs of the GoZ. The Fund was closely aligned with the strategic objectives of
ISNs I and II, and it was also closely aligned with the needs of donors and of the GoZ
(as shown in Section 4). The Fund also relied on a robust process for determining
funding priorities, which involved routine consultations with the GoZ (facilitated by


                                            49
Harare-based World Bank staff), technical dialogue on activity proposals within the
TRGs, and higher-level deliberation among the donors within the PC. As we show in
Section 6.1.1, while these processes were not always followed exactly, the Fund generally
succeeded in ensuring that those activities that enjoyed mutual buy-in from the GoZ and
donors actually received funding.

6           Efficiency and Accountability
Assessing the A-MDTF for efficiency and accountability involves checking (i) that the
Fund delivered value for money; (ii) that donors can verify how their funds were spent;
(iii) that the Fund’s design and operations were suitable for its objectives; and (iv) that
there were processes in place to ensure the Fund was using least-cost options to achieve
expected results. To be efficient and accountable, the Fund needed to have strong
systems in place to manage costs, monitor interventions, and disseminate key findings.
Our evaluation of efficiency and accountability is based on the four evaluation questions
in the TOR:
               How appropriate has the A-MDTF’s operational model and programmatic
                design been for the stated objectives? (Section 6.1)
               How effectively were activities designed and supervised? (Section 6.2)
               How effectively were funds distributed, used, and accounted for? (Section
                6.3)
               How effectively were key findings documented and disseminated? (Section
                6.4)
6.1         How Appropriate Was the A-MDTF’s Operational Model and
            Programmatic Design?
The way that the A-MDTF is structured plays a large part in how effectively and
efficiently it can achieve its objectives. To answer this question, we examined how the
Fund was organised and its rules and processes were defined (Section 6.1.1); how well it
staffed the Secretariat (Section 6.1.2); and if it distributed funds appropriately among, and
within, activities in its portfolio (Section 6.1.3). We also examined how the Fund set
target timeframes for completion (Section 6.1.4); whether it chose the right activities to
meet the Fund’s objectives (Section 6.1.5); and if the Fund chose the right ways of
producing the analytical work (Section 6.1.6).
6.1.1 Organisational structure and governance
We assessed the organizational structure and governance of A-MDTF as defined in the
AA,32 and the Operational Guidelines. These documents define the operational
framework of A-MDTF, setting out the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in
the Fund, and explaining the processes in place for identifying activities for the Fund to
support.
Roles and responsibilities within the A-MDTF
The A-MDTF organisational structure consists of three key entities: the Policy
Committee (PC), the Secretariat, and the Technical Review Group (TRG). Figure 6.2
illustrates the roles and responsibilities of these key entities.

                  shown in Appendix D (see Figure D.1).


       As illustrated by its position in the figure, the PC has the highest level of authority in the
       A-MDTF. The PC is responsible for setting the funding priorities and reviewing
       proposed activities, and thus guides the direction of the Fund and the activities it
       supports.
       The PC is supported by a Secretariat, which carries out all administrative functions of the
       Fund and liaises between the PC, the TRGs, and the GoZ. The Secretariat oversees all
       disbursements of funds and monitors the implementation of activities.
       The three TRGs contain specialists in each of the three thematic areas: economic
       management and governance, agriculture, and infrastructure. Given this expertise, the
       TRGs provide the technical underpinning for decisions on how the Fund’s resources are
       spent, and they monitor the progress of ongoing analytical work. They offer
       recommendations to the PC on which activities to support, given the high-level
       objectives set by the PC.
       A more detailed summary of the roles and responsibilities of each of these entities, as
       well as the staff members included in each entity, is provided in Table 6.1 below.

As explained in the table, the Secretariat is tasked with several different roles, each of
which has responsibilities vital to the operation of the Fund. These roles include the
Programme Manager, the Finance Officer, the Procurement Officer, Programme
Assistants, the sector TTLs (one per TRG), and the TTLs for each activity (child TF). A
complete description of these roles and their responsibilities is presented in Appendix E
(see Table E.1).
The Fund had clearly defined roles and responsibilities for donors and the Secretariat, as
well as a sensible organisational structure to ensure proper management of the donors’
funds. This laid a good foundation for the Fund to fulfil its mandate.
Process for setting funding priorities
To assess the A-MDTF’s process for setting the strategic direction of the Fund, and
approving activities, we reviewed the Operational Guidelines.
As explained in the Guidelines, each year the A-MDTF is supposed to review its strategy.
During this review, the PC identifies funding priorities for the year with support and
consultation from the Secretariat, the TRGs, and the GoZ. The A-MDTF revisits these
priorities on a quarterly basis to identify any corrections necessary to respond to
changing political or economic circumstances. Figure 6.2 illustrates this process.

             While the process for setting funding priorities was well-defined, our findings indicate
             that this process was not always followed. We spoke with donor representatives from all
             three TRGs; three representatives indicated that the PC often did not follow the annual
             strategy review cycle. One representative commented that there was often “no strategic
             thought [at the PC level],? and that the TRGs would often prioritise activities at the
             request of the PC (and outside the prescribed planning cycle), only to have the PC reject
             the list and request another. In one instance, the PC “spent a year trying to come up with
             priorities?. Another donor’s representative described the interface between the PC and
             the TRGs as “cumbersome,? because the donors in the PC did not effectively use the
             annual strategy review to develop a clear strategic direction.
             One representative did, however, comment that the prioritisation exercise went
             “smoothly,? in part thanks to the interface between the sector TTL and the PC.
             Process for identifying and developing activities
             After setting priorities, the Fund identifies and develops activities. This process is
             designed to be “demand-driven?—that is, based on a combination of the key needs of
             the GoZ and donors’ priorities in Zimbabwe. The sector TTLs are usually responsible
             for identifying the need for analytical work in Zimbabwe, and then developing activities
             to meet these needs.
             Throughout the process, donors are expected to provide significant input. First, the
             TRGs are intimately involved in shaping the CNs and determining which are ultimately
             recommended for approval. Then, the PC has the final authority to approve or reject a
             CN for funding. Figure 6.3 illustrates this process.

      To be approved for funding, the CNs should contain:
                      A plan for how activities will lead to action
                      A results framework (with measurable indicators and clearly articulated risks
                       and mitigation measures) and clear M&E arrangements
                      A dissemination/communication plan, including how the GoZ will be
                       engaged and an assessment of the level of demand within the GoZ for the
                       work
                      An itemised budget and quarterly disbursement plan
                      A standard cover sheet, summarising the objectives, scope, budget, and time
                       frame for the activity.33
      Unfortunately not all CNs adhered to this format. For instance, from our review of the
      sample of activities, we found only one activity (activity 4.01) included a results
      framework in its CN. None of the activities in the sample included a quarterly
      disbursement plan, a risk identification and mitigation strategy, or a discussion of cross-
      cutting issues (such as gender, environment, and governance) in the approved CNs.
      Going forward, it will be helpful to ensure all CNs meet the format defined by the A-
      MDTF. This will not only help the Fund select activities to support, but also to track the
      success of each activities against the plan.
      Conclusions on the governance and organisational structures
      The Fund had clearly defined roles and responsibilities for donors and the Secretariat, as
      well as a sensible organisational structure to ensure proper management of the donors’

funds. The Fund also did well to define a process for setting funding priorities and
identifying activities, though this process was not always followed.
Donor interventions in the future should be sure to closely follow the framework for
defining priorities and activities. This will allow a more robust tracking system of activity
performance, and will help increase communication across donors when setting funding
priorities.
6.1.2 Human resourcing
Evaluating human resourcing means assessing how well the Fund team was staffed—
were the right people in the right roles, and were all the right roles in place? We focused
this section on an evaluation of how well the Secretariat was staffed, because this was the
only part of the Fund’s organisational structure for which staffing was needed.34 An
assessment of the consultants hired to perform the A-MDTF-funded work is provided
later in Section 6.1.6.
We found that the staff roles for the Secretariat are well-defined35 and appropriate. In
particular, the Fund did well to increase the level of responsibility delegated to the
Secretariat, as was recommended in the MTR.36
However, we identified two key staff positions that could have helped the Secretariat
better fulfil its mandate:
                A part-time M&E specialist
                A part-time communications specialist.
Staffing these positions could have helped fill some of the gaps we identified during our
stakeholder interviews. For example, donors indicated that the Fund lacked a
communications strategy. According to these donors, a communications strategy could
have helped expand the impact of the Fund, both by disseminating A-MDTF-funded
outputs to a broader range of stakeholders, and by helping to “sell? the story of the
A-MDTF to the donors’ senior management.
Donors and the Programme Manager also indicated that an M&E specialist could have
helped donors and the TTLs devise a results framework for activities, so that these
results could be tracked accurately and consistently across the A-MDTF portfolio.
We also found that the A-MDTF may not have enough staff overall. For example, three
donor representatives in the TRGs suggested to us that they often found difficulties
requesting fact sheets or other activity summaries from the Secretariat due to resource
limitations. In addition, three donors in the PC indicated that the Secretariat did not
adequately synthesise the issues in advance of PC meetings. This meant that the PC often
delved into details of specific activities, instead of focusing on the high-level strategic
issues. In both instances, donors emphasised this was not a competency issue—rather, it

34   As described in Section 6.1.1, the membership of the PC and the TRGs were defined based on the AA. The PC is
     composed of donors, and therefore the Fund had no role in selecting who sat on this committee. Similarly, each
     donor appointed their own staff to sit on the TRGs. Other members of the TRGs included the sector TTLs (who
     are considered part of the Secretariat, and thus evaluated in this section); outside development partners, such as
     UNDP and UNICEF; and on occasion, GoZ representatives. Outside development partners and GoZ
     representatives participated on a volunteer basis, and therefore were not part of the staffing decisions made by the
     Fund.
35   The staffing needs of the Secretariat are defined in the Operational Guidelines (as briefly described in Section 6.1.1,
     and detailed in Appendix E).

                                                             56
was an issue arising from insufficient human resources. In fact, as one donor put it, the
World Bank’s recent restructuring (in which some staff were recalled to Washington) has
“stretched the Secretariat [thinly].?
Overall, the A-MDTF did well to clearly define roles for World Bank staff and TTLs in
the Secretariat. The Fund also took the recommendations in the MTR and expanded the
role of the Secretariat.
In the future, donors should ensure that that all roles allocated to the Secretariat have a
specific team member in place to carry out the work. In particular, specialists in M&E
and communications should be hired. Processes should also be put in place to scale up
the Secretariat during implementation of a Fund, if the donors determine more support is
needed.
6.1.3 Funding levels
We examined the funding levels in two ways: (i) how the A-MDTF distributed funds
among activities, and (ii) how the A-MDTF distributed funds within activities. The
Fund generally set appropriate funding levels for the activities in its portfolio, and it
allocated costs appropriately within each activity.
Distribution of funds among activities
An analysis of disbursements at the programme-level (see Figure 6.4) reveals that most of
the programmatic funds went to the EMGTRG (53.5 percent), with just 19.5 percent
going to the ITRG, and 13.3 percent to the ASTRG. The Fund disbursed 10.1 percent to
for administrative fees and expenses,37 and the remaining 3.6 percent was disbursed to
the cancelled SPTRG and HRBSTRG.
However, this distribution of funds is more evenly spread when considering the breadth
of issues that were addressed by the EMGTRG—among them, budget formulation,
governance and civil service reforms, mining sector policy, and of course the ongoing
PFMS TA (which alone totalled nearly $2.2 million over the duration of the A-MDTF).
We were unable to test whether these allocations were driven by the level of activity
within each TRG.38 Nonetheless, the emphasis on activities within the EMGTRG seems
appropriate, given the urgent need for macroeconomic and public sector reforms in
Zimbabwe. The disbursement of funds to the other existing TRGs (ASTRG and ITRG)
could reflect a more opportunistic approach, where openings for engagement with the
GoZ may have been limited due to political constraints (such as with land reform)—so
activities were only funded where these opportunities closely aligned with donors’
priorities as set by the PC.




37   This does not include the cost of staff time incurred by World Bank TTLs that were assigned to manage individual
     child TFs. These staff costs are embedded in the allocations for each activity (child TF).
38   The Secretariat and the TRGs did not maintain a record of all of the activity proposals or CNs that were considered
     compared those that were approved.

                  By activity type, the A-MDTF allocated most of its funds to analytical studies
                  (47.9 percent) and technical assistance (29.5 percent).39 The remaining funds were spent
                  on data and IM systems (12.3 percent, of which 93 percent went to the PFMS TA
                  activities), administration (10.1 percent), and knowledge exchanges (0.2 percent).
                  The A-MDTF generally allocated funds in small amounts; 55.2 percent of activities spent
                  less than $300,000, and an additional 34.5 percent spent less than $600,000.
                  These funding levels were in line with the closest benchmarks we could find: the
                  CAADP MDTF40 and the Middle East and North Africa MDTF (MENA MDTF), both
                  of which are World Bank-administered trust funds that largely support analytical work.
                  The CAADP MDTF allocated funds in the range of $30,000 to $800,000 for analytical
                  support and TA to support African institutions in adopting and using the CAADP.41The
                  MENA MDTF allocated funds in the range of $30,000 to $600,000 for analytical support




                  39   We categorised activities according to the primary purpose of the activity. For example, many of the analytical
                       studies and TA activities had validation or stakeholder workshops that could be considered knowledge exchanges;
                       however, we did not categorise these as such because the workshops were not the primary purpose of the activity.
                  40   The CAADP MDTF is a distinct trust fund that exists to support countries that are implementing the CAADP.

and TA to strengthen governance, increase social and economic inclusion, and create an
enabling environment for access to jobs (particularly for youth and women)42.
The GoZ officials and donors we interviewed, confirmed that the funding levels for
individual activities in the sample were sufficient to achieve the desired outputs. These
stakeholders also commented that the A-MDTF should have gone farther—by pairing
the analytical work with follow-on programmatic funding to implement the
recommendations or programmes. While the current framework of the Fund does not
allow for providing programmatic fund, donors may want to consider allowing this kind
of funding in the future.
Distribution of funds within activities
Among the activities in the sample, most of the funds disbursed were spent on
consultants’ fees (nearly 65 percent), with World Bank staff costs43 and media/workshop
costs making up an additional 27 percent. We calculated these cost allocations based on
data extracted from the World Bank’s internal accounting system, and provided to us by
the Secretariat.
For comparison, we also calculated these relative allocations by cost element for all
activities in the A-MDTF portfolio, using the latest financial report to donors produced
on 30 September 2014 (see Table 6.2).

Consultants’ Fees
From Table 6.2, we see that consultants’ fees were by far the largest category of spend—
64 percent of costs in the sampled activities, and 54 percent across all activities in the
AMDTF portfolio. We investigated these costs, to determine if these costs are
reasonable.
Specifically, we looked at the average daily rate of the consultants hired for the sampled
activities, and found the rates to be reasonable. The AMDTF program team provided
daily rates and total consultant costs for ten activities. Seven of these activities were
carried out by individual consultants (several consultants hired for each activity); the
remaining three were contracted out to consulting firms. The average daily rate for
individual consultants in this sample was approximately US$570—which compares well
with consulting fees commanded by infrastructure advisory specialists for work in
Africa.44
Two of the three activities contracted out to firms cost less than US$200,000 in
consulting fees. The third was higher—at US$345,000, however this was for the most
extensive piece of work of the activities in our sample, the PFMS Technical Assistance.
Travel
We also note that the share of travel expenses, both for the sample and for the Fund,
may be higher than expected for a “typical? consulting contract (based on our own
experience as development consultants). This was because many World Bank staff were
not based locally, and therefore were flying in from abroad. For example, the mining
sector TTLs are based in Washington, DC and routinely flew to Harare to participate in
meetings with the MMMD and other stakeholders. For the activities in the sample, nearly
half (49 percent) of the travel expenses were associated with World Bank staff based
outside of Harare. An additional 34 percent of these travel expenses were incurred by
consultants whose travel expenses were not embedded in their contracts.45 This appears
to have been a strategic decision, to keep the Fund’s operations in Zimbabwe lean, an d
to fly in specialists as needed. It would be difficult to reduce these costs given the
weaknesses in local capacity that we have previously discussed.
Overall, these allocations appear reasonable, given the A-MDTF’s emphasis on
producing analytical work that also requires close consultation with the GoZ and other
stakeholders—however, we were unable to find a relevant benchmark to verify this
conclusion.46
6.1.4 Time frames
The A-MDTF was established in February 2008, and the first Grant Funding Request
(GFR) was approved on 7 July 2008 for the administration and management of the Fund.

44   From our experience, consultants typically charge fees in the US$600 – US$800 range, per day, for similar
     assignments. International consultants are more expensive, commanding no less than $800 per day for such
     assignments
45   A-MDTF Secretariat. Internal World Bank Accounts. 26 October 2014.
46   We attempted to gauge these allocations of funds against a relevant benchmark, such as other World Bank-
     administered trust funds. However, the World Bank does not publish data on how trust fund costs are allocated by
     cost element in any public database. We were also unable to locate financial reports for other, non-World Bank trust
     funds that provided sufficient detail to carry out a meaningful benchmarking. For more information on the
     transparency of World Bank-administered trust funds, see World Bank—Independent Evaluation Group. 2011. “An
     Evaluation of the World Bank’s Trust Fund Portfolio: Trust Fund Support for Development.?

           The closing date was originally scheduled for 31 December 2011. However, following the
           MTR in 2010, the Fund was recapitalised and a new TF was established. Since the MTR,
           the closing dates for the old and new TFs have been repeatedly extended to allow for
           completion of the work programmes, as illustrated in Figure 6.5.

           Both TFs have an end disbursement date of 31 December 2014, with work stopping
           approximately four to six months prior (depending on whether the activities are
           recipient-executed or Bank-executed). These deadlines were extended because of delays
           in implementing the activities. From our interviews with the Secretariat and with donors,
           we understand these delays arose from:
                      The exhaustion of funds and delayed replenishment of these funds by
                       donors
                      The amendments required to the AA to re-open the recipient-executed
                       window
                      The World Bank’s internal review processes, including approval of CNs by
                       the Bank’s Sector Management Units (SMUs)
                      Activity-specific delays—mainly due to the changing political environment,
                       and in particular the 2013 elections. Following the change in government,
                       access to some senior officials was limited (even when GoZ buy-in may
                       have previously existed), thus constraining donors’ interest in engaging on
                       certain topics.

These delays are also evident in the sample of activities. In our sample, the average time
overrun was 15 months, as illustrated in Table 6.3. Only one project (activity 2.02) was
completed prior to the planned completion date.

Note:    Where closing dates were not updated in the respective GFRs, we relied on closing dates
         published in the 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports, or based on interviews with the sector TTLs.


Given that the changing political environment in Zimbabwe is not a controllable or
predictable factor, it makes sense that some of the activities would go over their planned
time. Administrative delays also contributed to the time overruns, which may have been
controllable.
We conclude that the time frames of the A-MDTF should probably have been estimated
more conservatively, though we acknowledge that it is difficult to predict. Furthermore,
given the consistent time overruns observed across the sample, it appears that the Fund
did not learn from prior delays when setting target completion dates for more recent
activities.
Setting accurate time-frames for each activity is important because it affects the overall
operations timing of the Fund. The final end disbursement date for the old TF is now
three years after the scheduled closing date that was set at the Fund’s inception (two
years late in the case of the new TF).

6.1.5 Project mix
The distribution of activities at the programme-level (see Table 3.1) appears to be
appropriate for the economic and political context in Zimbabwe. The A-MDTF selected
a mix of projects that represented the donors’ interests in a range of issues across the
three thematic areas. At the same time, this mix also reflected varying levels of interest on
the part of the GoZ.
For example, the donors indicated that they intentionally selected a mix of projects that
balanced risk with potential reward—as measured by the GoZ’s explicit interest in the
activity. In doing so, donors hoped to maximise impact while hedging portfolio risk.
“High risk, high reward? activities included the payroll audit (activity 2.20), mining sector
work (activities 2.09, 2.10, and 2.11), and the study on land reform (activity 1.12), among
others. Examples of “low risk? activities included the PFMS work (activities 2.12, 2.13,
and 2.17), the National Water Policy (activity 3.07), and the support to the ZAIP and
CAADP (1.03), all of which had clear levels of commitment from the GoZ.
GoZ agencies who benefited from the A-MDTF unanimously agreed that the right mix
of projects was selected to address the GoZ’s high priority needs for analytical work.
However, these same stakeholders also added that it would have been more helpful if A-
MDTF was also able to respond to the follow-on programmatic needs of GoZ.
We conclude that the mix of projects selected for support from the A-MDTF was
efficient for mitigating risks, and also relevant to the needs of the GoZ.
6.1.6 Delivery models
To understand if the delivery models used by the A-MDTF were appropriate, we
considered three key sets of questions for each activity in the sample:
           Did the activities succeed in imparting knowledge or capacity to the
            activity’s beneficiaries? Did the activity provided knowledge or institutional
            capacity that wouldn’t otherwise exist?
           Did the A-MDTF use the right consultants and activity structures? Did the
            consultants possess adequate regional and functional expertise? Was the
            activity structured in a way to fit the vagaries of local institutions, such as the
            sensitivities facing a GoZ agency or ministry?
           Did the activities make contextually appropriate recommendations? Did the
            recommendations that were provided reflect an appropriate range of views,
            such that they were appealing to donors, the GoZ, and other non-state
            actors (where applicable)?
This activity-level analysis showed that the A-MDTF generally used appropriate and
effective delivery models. We based this on the following findings:
           Nine of ten completed activities in the sample succeeded in imparting new
            knowledge or capacity. The only activity that did not was the PFMS TA
            (activity 2.17), where the training that were provided failed to build
            meaningful capacity within the GoZ, partly because the consultants were not
            effective trainers, and partly because of a “brain drain? (once adequately
            trained, GoZ employees would leave for better-paying jobs)
           Nine of eleven activities in the sample selected the right consultants and
            used the right activity structures. In one instance (activity 1.03),
            inappropriate consultants were initially selected, but were later replaced and
            the activity was completed to the satisfaction of donors and the GoZ. In


                                              64
             another instance (activity 2.17), the consultants that were hired did not
             deliver adequate training to the GoZ on the IFMIS system (though they
             were later debarred from future work)
           All ten completed activities in the sample made contextually appropriate
            recommendations.
The full results of this analysis are presented in Appendix C (see Table C.4).
6.1.7 Conclusions on the operational model
The evaluation shows that the operational model for the A-MDTF was mostly
appropriate.
We found that the funding levels, project mix, and delivery models were all highly
appropriate given the needs of the GoZ and donors, and the overall goals of the Fund.
However, while the processes for setting funding priorities and approving activities were
well-defined, they were not always followed. This does not indicate that the governance
and organisational structures themselves were inappropriate, but that these processes
should be followed more consistently.
We identified two other important areas for improvement to the operational model: time
frames and human resourcing. The consistent time overruns on A-MDTF-funded
activities suggests that the time allocated per activity was perhaps not reasonable, taking
into account the political risks and administrative processes that can create delays in
implementation. A-MDTF did well to improve human resourcing given
recommendations in the MTR, but further improvements could be made. These include
adding more staff to the Secretariat overall, and, in particular, including a Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) Specialist and Communications Specialist.
6.2    How Effectively Were Activities Designed and Supervised?
The proper design and execution of a monitoring framework is vital: without it, it is
nearly impossible to credibly assess the effectiveness of an intervention. To answer this
question, we considered (i) how adequate the indicators that existed were, (ii) how well
results were tracked and monitored, and (iii) what improvements (if any) were made to
the M&E framework.
The indicators that were defined were inadequate
The Operational Guidelines specify a results framework for the A-MDTF, which defines
indicators for the Fund’s target outputs and outcomes (see Table 6.4). These indicators
are inadequate, however, because they are neither easily measureable nor meaningful.
Table 6.4: Target Outputs and Outcomes
                  Outputs                                            Outcomes
 Core diagnostic reports disseminated in the         Improved country/economic knowledge
  following sectors:                                  Improved policy dialogue with the GoZ and

While we recognize the inherent challenge in defining a meaningful, measurable results
framework when the Fund is supporting such a diverse portfolio of activities, it is vital to
more precisely define indicators whenever possible. For example, the MENA MDTF
operates in a similarly fragile environment and performs analytical work similar to the
A-MDTF. Even so, it has clearly defined indicators for outputs and outcomes that are
objectively measurable (see Figure 6.6).
Figure 6.6: Excerpt of the Results Framework for the MENA MDTF




Source: The World Bank. November 2013. MENA MDTF Annual Report..


As briefly mentioned in Section 6.1.1, we found little evidence of results frameworks at
the activity level. Only one of the 11 activities in the sample defined a results framework,
which clearly articulated the target outputs, outcomes, and impacts, and their
corresponding indicators to facilitate ongoing M&E. As a result, to the extent that data
were reported at the programme level for the activities, they were not based on any
consistent, year-to-year M&E framework.




                                                  66
The tracking and monitoring framework was weak
Because the M&E framework was weak at the programme level, it necessarily weakened
the tracking and monitoring of results that occurred. From the Fund’s inception in 2008
to 2010, there were no annual reports produced that documented the progress of the
A-MDTF and its activities.
The Fund did produce annual reports for 2011 through 2013.47 However, these reports
each used a slightly different reporting matrix for the activities in the Fund’s portfolio .
The end result was that the tracking and monitoring of the activities was inconsistent
from year-to-year, and so was not robust enough to provide an outside party (such as our
evaluation team) an objective assessment of the performance of the Fund against its
goals.
At the activity level, the tracking and monitoring of results was no better. Each sector
TTL produced their own sets of periodic progress reports for donors, none of which
identically matched the reporting matrices used in the annual reports. Notably, these
periodic reports were an improvement over what existed before, as they only began in
response to a recommendation in the MTR. We also found that internal records, such as
the GFRs, were not updated as activities were closed out, making it difficult to verify
information as simple as the date on which the final deliverable was sent to the GoZ (the
“client?). This meant that the information being collected at the activity level could not
have been “rolled up? to the programme level without additional information being
collected from the Secretariat, the donors, and the GoZ beneficiaries.
Conclusions on effectiveness of the design and supervision of activities
It is clear that the indicators selected for the A-MDTF and its activities were inadequate.
We strongly encourage donors and the World Bank to consider jointly designing a more
robust set of indicators in future interventions in Zimbabwe (and in other fragile states).
Without adequate indicators, it is difficult to credibly monitor and evaluate the
effectiveness of an intervention, which in turn undermines any claims of impact or value
for money from a donor intervention.
In turn, because the design of the M&E framework was weak, the process of tracking
and monitoring results was also necessarily weak. Annual reports were produced for the
three years following the MTR, yet the lack of a consistent framework made comparisons
across time impractical. Notably, although donors and the Secretariat agreed that the
M&E framework is a design flaw of the Fund, the MTR’s only explicit mention of this
matter was a recommendation to provide periodic financial and progress reports to the
PC (which was done).
6.3         How Effectively Were Funds Managed?
In this question, we explore how well the A-MDTF carried out its fund management and
administration activities. Specifically, we discuss the following points: (i) how timely was
the A-MDTF’s disbursement of funds for activities, (ii) whether it delivered these
activities within budget (and according to World Bank procurement procedures), and (iii)
whether it properly accounted for the funds held in trust.




47   These were not an explicit recommendation in the MTR, but coincided with an increased focus on transparency and
     accountability, which was emphasised in the MTR.




                                                          67
The funds were disbursed in a timely manner
Funds were generally disbursed in a timely manner, as demonstrated by the disbursement
rates, a common metric used by the World Bank in evaluations of MDTFs (see Table
6.5). The disbursement rates for the new TF were reasonable compared with World
Bank-administered multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) that support analytical work similar
to the A-MDTF48. The disbursement rate for the old TF in fiscal years 2011 and 2012
were also reasonable, while the disbursement rate in 2013 stalled. This was likely due to
the delayed re-opening of the recipient-executed window, for which some of the
remaining funds had been earmarked. The average disbursement rate (calculated from
the inception of each TF) was 13 percent for the old TF and 20 percent for the new TF.

The funds were spent within budget
Table 6.6 shows that all of the activities in the sample were completed within budget.
Notably, activities 1.12 and 2.16 came in significantly under budget—however, both are
anomalies. The Study on Land Reform (1.12) is ongoing and therefore has not fully
committed its funds. Meanwhile, the scope of activity 2.16 was significantly reduced
because the consultant did not require as much time as was budgeted to provide the TA
to ZIMSTAT.

Bank procedures, including Operational Policy 8 (OP 8), which governs how the Bank
engages in fragile states; Operational Policy 14.40 (OP 14.40), which governs how the
World Bank administers trust funds51; and the Trust Fund Handbook, which is an
internal document that provides guidance for the structuring and management of Bank-
administered trust funds.52
While we did not perform a financial audit (because it was outside the scope of this
evaluation), the Fund’s accounting practices are subject to a management attestation
made annually by the World Bank and its independent auditors for all trust funds
worldwide.53
Additionally, the Secretariat provided all financial reports that we requested, including the
breakdown of costs (by cost element) for each activity in the sample, using the
World Bank’s SAP accounting platform and internal bookkeeping systems. This gave us
reasonable confidence that the Fund was accurately and appropriately accounting for all
receipts and disbursements.
The Fund also followed all applicable World Bank procurement procedures, and relied
on a full-time procurement specialist located in the Harare office.54 While we are unable
to independently verify the execution of these procedures, we did find that the Secretariat
did not maintain a master procurement plan—though it is specified in the Operational
Guidelines.55 The Secretariat explained that no plan was maintained because of the
inherent challenges associated with maintaining a long-term plan when the Fund’s
strategic work programme is not defined on a similar long-term basis.
6.4         How Effectively Were Key Findings Documented and
            Disseminated?
Evaluating whether key findings were documented and disseminated makes sense only
for activities that were designed to produce a study or other analytical output. Of the
activities in the sample, seven met this criterion—although 1.12 Study on Land Reform is
an ongoing activity and, therefore, we cannot answer this question for that activity. These
activities were:
                1.02 Determinants of the productivity and sustainability of Zimbabwe
                 irrigation
                2.02 Support to 2014 Budget Preparation

                2.10 Zimbabwe Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme

                4.01 Feasibility Study for Adapting the Public Works Approach in Private
                 Sector Projects, Government, and Municipality Civil Works.
The remaining four activities56 all constituted “embedded? TA placements where the
outputs that were provided were technical reviews, drafting services, and training—
outputs that did not lend themselves to documenting findings.
The Fund documented its key findings well
The A-MDTF did a commendable job of documenting the key findings of analyses
supported by the Fund. All six of the completed activities in the sample for which key
findings would have been expected, actually documented these findings clearly in their
respective final reports or outputs. In many cases, these findings were clearly laid out in
an executive summary so that even a busy government official could find and understand
the key messages.
The Fund did not effectively disseminate these findings
Where the A-MDTF fell short was in sharing these key findings with all the right people.
That is, key findings were always documented, but the outputs containing these findings
could have been disseminated to more beneficiaries.
That said, for all six completed activities for which key findings were documented, these
findings were always shared with the direct GoZ beneficiaries. For example, the policy
recommendations document produced for the National Water Policy (3.07) was shared
with the MEWC, the MLGPWNH, ZINWA, and other GoZ entities. Similarly, the study
on determinants of irrigation productivity (1.02) was shared with the MAMID.
However, many of the outputs (and thus, key findings) were never disseminated more
widely, to stakeholders outside of the GoZ. Of the six activities in the sample for which
key findings were documented, key findings from just two activities were posted on the
A-MDTF website (activities 3.05 and 3.07). Even so, not all of the key findings generated
by 3.07 Flexible TA in Infrastructure were posted: 4 of the 10 Water Forum Policy Notes
were posted, while none of the other key findings resulting from this activity were
posted.
During stakeholder interviews, we also asked indirect beneficiaries if they had seen the
key findings in writing, or if they were aware of them. We found three primary reasons
for which indirect beneficiaries were aware of the key findings:
                Two non-contributing donors—UNICEF and UNDP—were intimately
                 aware of the findings, because they had funded complementary parts of the
                 activity (as in the case of 3.07 National Water Policy), or because they had
                 representatives who participated in the TRGs
                Two donor-affiliated organisations—Zim ACP and SERA—were also aware
                 of the activities, because of connections to USAID representation in the
                 TRGs and on the PC


56   These were activities 1.03, 2.04, 2.16, and 2.17.




                                                         71
          Two NGOs—AIAS and BEAT—were also aware of the key findings,
           because their staff had been hired to carry out the work, or because they had
           participated in workshops or stakeholder consultations.
However, many private sector organisations (including Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI), Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC), and Zimbabwe
Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners Council (ZASMC) were not aware of the key findings
for activities in the sample. In addition, the staff we interviewed at the National
Association of Non-Government Organizations (NANGO) (which represents over
1,200 NGOs in Zimbabwe) were unaware of key findings, or had even seen any of the
studies.
We conclude that the A-MDTF effectively documented key findings whenever
applicable, but mostly disseminated these findings within the nucleus of GoZ staff and
donors that were intimately involved in the activities.

7      Lessons Learned
As donors and the World Bank look to design the successor to the A-MDTF in
Zimbabwe—the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF)—lessons from the
A-MDTF experience should be considered. In this section, we answer the remaining
three questions in the TOR:
          What key lessons, both already captured and not yet captured, should
           stakeholders consider when developing future interventions? (Section 7.1)
          To what extent did the A-MDTF build on the individual and collective
           strength of the participating partner institutions towards the attainment of
           objectives and what are recommendations for future engagements?
           (answered within our discussion on key lessons for donors, Section 7.1.2)
          How did the A-MDTF document, disseminate, and use lessons learned
           during the implementation phase? (Section 7.2).
7.1    What Key Lessons Should Donors Consider for Future
       Interventions?
We identified five main lessons that donors should consider in designing ZIMREF (and
in some cases for the A-MDTF, as it winds down). Donors should consider:
       1. Linking funding for analytical work with programmatic funding to implement
          the findings of these analytical studies
       2. Facilitating even closer coordination of donors—both among those that will
          contribute to ZIMREF, and those that will not, but will remain active in
          Zimbabwe
       3. Ensuring that a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is built
          and used so that ZIMREF’s performance can be assessed fully and objectively
       4. Increasing dissemination efforts and improving the quality of communication
          to better “tell the story? of the A-MDTF and ZIMREF
       5. Fine-tuning administrative processes to boost ZIMREF’s operational
          efficiency.
7.1.1 Link funding for analytical work with programmatic funding
One of the most common critiques of the A-MDTF—both from the donors and from
the GoZ officials we interviewed—was that findings or recommendations generated by
some of the Fund’s analytical work were not implemented. In such instances, the GoZ
had limited fiscal capacity to self-finance implementation projects, while donors in
Zimbabwe may have had other priorities for bilateral engagement with the GoZ.
This funding gap could be resolved—and many more of A-MDTF-supported analyses
put to direct use—if donors could consider including “programmatic? funding in
ZIMREF. By programmatic funding, we mean grants for capital investments, such as
rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure or the purchase of computer
equipment to enable the roll-out of the PFMS to all local districts. This type of funding
would ensure that the recommendations or findings that are generated by analytical work
can be implemented through the procurement of services to improve the lives of
Zimbabwean citizens. If made available, this programmatic funding could require cost
sharing with the GoZ to ensure that its incentives are properly aligned with donors’.
Should donors decide not to provide direct programmatic funding through the


                                           73
AMDTF’s successor, closer coordination with programmatic funds (such as ZimFund)
could provide an option for implementing these projects. Section 7.1.2 explains this idea
in more detail.
7.1.2 Facilitate even closer donor coordination
The A-MDTF succeeded in facilitating strong coordination among contributing donors,
and among some partner institutions that did not contribute—such as UNDP and
UNICEF. We found just two cases where coordination could have been stronger: (i) the
analytical outputs of the A-MDTF could have been more closely linked to investments
made by the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (ZimFund), and (ii) donors could have
attempted to coordinate with BRICS57 donors (such as the Chinese, who are very active
in Zimbabwe). Our findings on donor coordination are presented in Table 7.1.

   their efforts on specific                A-MDTF efforts. We asked about the efforts of both

   analytical topics                        contributing donors, as well as non-contributing donors (such
                                            as UNDP and UNICEF) that participate in the governance of
                                            the Fund

                                $1.9 million in funding from DFID, UNDP, and UNICEF
                               TA for the PFMS (2.17)—which leveraged $3.5 million in
                                funding from DFID, AfDB, and UNDP to cover the
                                equipment costs (servers, software, and so on) associated
                                with the necessary upgrades to the SAP platform used by
                                the MFED
   The PC and TRG formats                   The donors unanimously confirmed the usefulness of the PC
   were very effective means of             and TRG in facilitating donor coordination. They indicated
   coordinating donor efforts,              these forums were particularly valuable when donors wished

   facilitating dialogue that               mining sector issues because the PC and TRG provided safe
   wouldn’t otherwise occur                 places to have frank conversations
       The A-MDTF could have                The A-MDTF coordinated on some activities, such as the
       worked better with                   Water Sector Investment Analysis (3.03) and the Engineering
~      ZimFund                              TA to the City of Harare (3.08). In addition, both funds had
                                            ad hoc arrangements to keep each other abreast of proposed
                                            or ongoing activities. For example, the ITRG reviewed some

57   Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS)




                                                              74
                                        of ZimFund’s concept notes to provide input on proposed
                                        projects.

                                        However, these coordination arrangements could have been
                                        more explicit and formal. For example, the MTR
                                        recommended establishing a fee-based arrangement for the
                                        TTL for the ITRG to also contribute time to the ZimFund.
                                        This recommendation was never adopted. There was also no
                                        synchronisation of work programmes, so that an analytical
                                        output from the A-MDTF could lead directly to
                                        implementation (with ZimFund support)
   The A-MDTF did not                   Donors on the ITRG lamented this lack of coordination,
   coordinate with the block of         given how much investment the Chinese (in particular) have
   donors from the BRICS                been making in the water sector in Zimbabwe. In some cases,
?
   countries—Brazil, Russia,            their investments have been counterproductive to the efforts
   India, China, and South              of Western donors that participate in the A-MDTF
   Africa


Our analysis of donor coordination reveals two key recommendations. First, even if
donors choose not to allow programmatic funding in ZIMREF (as we recommended in
Section 7.1.1), donors should consider building tighter linkages with ZimFund (or its
successor) to ensure that the two funds are more closely coordinated. For example, work
programmes could be synchronised, so that funds that are allocated by ZIMREF for
analytical work are linked to programmatic funds earmarked by ZimFund to implement
the recommendations or findings derived from the analysis.
Secondly, donors should consider how to coordinate efforts with outside donors (such as
BRICS countries), or at a minimum, how to remain abreast of their work in order to
avoid duplication of efforts. One donor on the ITRG suggested that while the Chinese
may be reluctant to participate in a multi-donor arrangement, the A-MDTF donors could
still coordinate with the Chinese on a one-on-one basis, with one donor selected to liaise
with the Chinese mission in Zimbabwe.
7.1.3 Build a robust M&E framework
The A-MDTF did not have a robust framework to monitor and evaluate the
performance of the Fund at a programme level (see Section 5.1). In designing future
interventions (such as ZIMREF), donors should ensure the results framework is robust
and that there is sufficient capacity to carry out M&E. A robust framework should
include:
               A coherent Theory of Change. The Theory of Change for the programme
                should be logical, and should adhere to the standard definitions of inputs,
                activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts.58 We provide an example of what
                this Theory of Change might look like for the A-MDTF in Figure 7.1
               A comprehensive logframe with adequate programme-level targets.
                Once the Theory of Change is defined, it is best practice to define a
                comprehensive logframe that defines indicators that measure the outputs,

   outcomes, and impacts for the entire trust fund—as well as targets for each
   of these indicators. To be useful, these indicators should be specific,
   measurable, accurate, and timely
 Well-defined M&E processes. During implementation, the Fund
  administrator can use this logframe (if properly designed), to track the
  results against these targets. A logframe improves accountability, facilitates
  robust monitoring and evaluation, and helps communicate the achievements
  of the Fund. It can also help the Fund administrator and donors detect any
  implementation issues early on.

7.1.4 Improve how the Fund communicates its achievements
The A-MDTF could have also been more effective in communicating the findings from
supported activities, and other key achievements of the Fund. The A-MDTF did not do
as well as it could have in disseminating the knowledge generated, either internally with
donors’ senior management, or externally with broader stakeholders. As a result, donors
missed a crucial opportunity to “tell the story? of the A-MDTF.
One immediate improvement that the Fund can make is to update its website59 with all
outputs (analytical studies, TA final reports, policy notes, and so on) that are approved
for public release.60 The Fund could also consider establishing an information resource
centre at the World Bank office in Harare (and in possibly one or two other suitable
locations throughout Zimbabwe). This resource centre could offer hard copies of key
outputs, such as the Public Expenditure Notes (2.25) that have already been printed, and
provide access to electronic copies of all outputs.
In designing ZIMREF, donors should consider requiring the World Bank to include a
part-time communications specialist as a core member of the Secretariat. To ensure that
the ZIMREF website is properly maintained, this specialist should be capable of basic
website updates. The specialist should also have expertise in developing key messages for
high-level government officials. This is particularly important for activities involving land
reform issues, the mining sector, and other politically sensitive topics, where buy-in from
these officials is necessary for meaningful impacts to be made.
7.1.5 Boost operational efficiency of the Fund
The Fund could have also operated more efficiently and effectively if a few minor, but
important administrative processes had been adopted. These are grouped into the
following four sub-sections.
Increase access to, and transparency of, records for donors
Donors need to have access to the outputs (reports) that they have paid for. A common
complaint was that even the co-chairs of the TRGs61 did not have copies of the outputs
produced by the Fund. This particularly impeded the on-boarding process for new
members of the TRGs or the PC, where having access to these records could have
ensured a smooth transition. Before the A-MDTF closes, it should provide copies of all
outputs produced to-date to the contributing donors.62
Donors should also have access to the internal records that will help them understand
how the Fund is performing. In designing ZIMREF, donors should ensure that they are
granted self-service access by the Secretariat to all of the Fund’s important records.63




59   The A-MDTF website can be found at http://go.worldbank.org/1EDGI695T0.
60   According to the World Bank’s Policy on Access to Information. See World Bank. 2013. “Policy on Access to
     Information.?         http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/07/17952994/world-bank-policy-access-
     information (accessed 8 October 2014).
61   The donors who rotated in this capacity
62   This should be facilitated by the recommended updates to the A-MDTF website, assuming the Secretariat adopts
     that recommendation.
63   “Self-service? means that donors should not need to request documents from the Secretariat. Rather, donors should
     be able to access these files themselves.




                                                           78
These records include the outputs of activities, relevant monitoring reports (such as
periodic progress reports prepared by the sector TTLs), and financial reports.64
In addition, the files should be clearly organized and labelled so that outside parties (such
as new donor staff, evaluators, researchers, and so on) can accurately identify all
documents related to a specific activity. For example, during the data collection stage of
our evaluation, we discovered instances where Annual Reports referred to the same
activity using a different name. All documents contained within the Fund’s filing
system—such as CNs, internal progress reports, Annual Reports, and outputs—should
reference the appropriate child TF numbers assigned to the activities in the Fund’s
portfolio. Improved organization will ensure that the monitoring, evaluation, and
communication of the Fund’s activities will be consistent and transparent.
Adopt best practices for mitigating project risk
The Fund did not have a good risk mitigation strategy (Section 5.3.4), which partially
contributed to implementation delays. A better approach would have been to produce a
risk identification matrix and mitigation strategy for each activity. This would have
demonstrated that the potential risks are known, and that there are steps that could be
taken to minimize their potential impact on the successful implementation of the Fund.
Similarly, the Fund did not centrally monitor procurement of consultants, although it is
specified in the Operational Guidelines (Section 6.3). While we did not identify any
specific examples of negative effects, having a master procurement plan is generally
considered a best practice to mitigate any implementation delays resulting from
procurement challenges. Even if the Secretariat cannot maintain a long-term
procurement plan, a short-term plan could help monitor the procurement status for all
activities that have been approved or are in the pipeline (within a given year’s work
programme), and to identify any potential issues in the procurement process.
These should continue to be design features contained in ZIMREF’s operational
guidelines. Furthermore, donors should verify that the Secretariat has fulfilled these
requirements, before the first disbursements of funds are made at the inception of the
Fund, and periodically thereafter (this could be done as part of the Annual Report).
Build more flexibility to better respond to minor contingencies
The closing date of the Fund was repeatedly extended due to implementation delays.
Among the activities in the sample, all but one took longer than expected at inception
(Section 6.1.4). During interviews with the sector TTLs, we discovered that many of
these delays were associated with the political economic environment, which could have
been managed through a risk mitigation strategy.65 Longer timeframes for completing the
activities would also have been appropriate, to accommodate any unforeseen delays.
Setting timeframes that were too aggressive led to unnecessary transaction costs
associated with (i) amending the Administrative Agreement (AA) to extend the closing
date, and (ii) amending World Bank contracts with the hired consultants.66 Going
forward, donors should consider setting longer timeframes, both for ZIMREF itself and
for each activity that is approved.

64   Donors currently have access to financial reports through the World Bank’s Client Connection webs ite. However,
     the Secretariat stated in its Annual Reports that donors did not use this feature.
65   As previously mentioned, many of the activities in the sample did not have such a strategy.
66   Each amendment to the AA required the signed approval of each donor, which led to delays due to the donors’
     internal concurrence processes.




                                                             79
In addition, the Secretariat and donors both claimed that the AA was unable to
accommodate minor contingencies—such as when donors wished to contribute
additional funds, or when the end disbursement date needed to be extended due to
activity implementation delays. For each contingency, the AA was amended accordingly
and each donor had to re-sign the amended agreement. If possible, ZIMREF donors and
the World Bank should try to structure a more flexible agreement, to avoid the delays
and costs associated with these amendments.
Improve services provided by the Secretariat to donors
The Secretariat provided quarterly financial reports to all donors. For any interim
financial reports, the Secretariat trained donors on using the World Bank’s Client
Connection portal to obtain real-time data. This was intended to reduce administrative
time spent responding to ad hoc requests. However, the Secretariat reported in the MTR
and the 2011 Annual Report that donors did not use this system, but instead requested
the Secretariat to produce interim reports. The Operational Guidelines of ZIMREF
should explicitly mention the availability of the Client Connection portal to service these
needs. This will ensure that the Secretariat’s time is spent wisely.
In addition, donor representatives on the PC complained of instances where the
Secretariat had not adequately prepared for PC meetings. Specifically, they indicated that
the Secretariat sometimes failed to fully synthesise the decisions to be made, so that the
PC could focus on strategic decision-making instead of details relating to specific
activities. Assuming there is a PC in the ZIMREF design, the Operational Guidelines
should clearly define how the Secretariat should prepare for these meetings.
7.2     How Did the Fund Document and Use Lessons Learned?
The A-MDTF had an explicit mechanism for documenting lessons learned for the
operation of the Fund, and monitoring whether these recommendations were later
adopted. The Fund adopted many (but not all) of the lessons that were learned during
implementation.
The first time that lessons were documented for the A-MDTF was in the MTR in 2010.
The Annual Reports in 2011 through 2013 continued to do so, in addition to reporting
on the implementation status for prior years’ recommendations.
Many of the lessons in the MTR addressed the structure of the A-MDTF, and how to
improve effectiveness and operational efficiency. The majority of these
recommendations were adopted. For example, the number of thematic areas supported
by the Fund was reduced from six TRGs to the current three TRGs (see Figure 2.1).
Similarly, the types of activities supported by the Fund were consolidated. As mentioned
in Section 2, the prior activity definitions (some of which overlapped, such as studies and
surveys) were streamlined into five core activity types: (i) analytical studies, (ii) TA and
expert placements, (iii) support for data and IM systems, (iv) knowledge exchanges, and
(v) pilots. In addition, the Secretariat was strengthened, and the roles and responsibilities
of all members of the Fund’s organisational structure were clarified. This was done in
response to the MTR’s recommendation that the World Bank assign more, qualified staff
to fulfil the Secretariat’s mandate; and that the responsibilities of the various groups (the
PC, the Secretariat, and the TRGs) should be clearly defined.
However, not all lessons in the MTR were adopted. For example, the MTR called for “a
detailed monitoring matrix of all activities to keep track of procurement stages.? No such
matrix was ever developed. Similarly, the MTR recommended improving
communications, by (i) developing a strategy (in consultation with communications
experts from the World Bank), (ii) enhancing the website to serve as a dissemination tool,


                                             80
and (iii) targeting dissemination of analytical work to key stakeholders (beyond the direct
beneficiaries). While the Secretariat developed a communications strategy, they did not
achieve the expected results: the website is still not kept up-to-date and the wider
dissemination was never realised.
We also reviewed lessons (and accompanying recommendations) that were documented
in the 2011, 2012, and 2013 Annual Reports. While the Fund took action on many of
these recommendations, the results sometimes fell short. For example, in the 2011
Annual Report, it was recommended that the Secretariat should review each CN for
environmental and gender issues (where possible). The 2012 Annual Report indicated
that this was never done, and our own review of CNs for the activities in the sample
confirms this. Appendix F presents a full analysis of which lessons learned were
documented in the MTR and Annual Reports—and whether the recommendations were
implemented.

Appendix A: Summaries of Activities in the Sample
A.1      Determinants of the Productivity and Sustainability of
         Zimbabwe Irrigation (1.02)
The A-MDTF allocated $300,000 to produce a study defining the investment and policy
options for improving the productivity and sustainability of the irrigation sector in
Zimbabwe. The study was divided into three parts:
            A desk study of literature on small-scale irrigation in Zimbabwe
            A diagnostic analysis of the determinants of investment returns for an
             agreed subset of smallholder irrigation schemes, including a field survey of
             these schemes
            A detailed discussion of investment options for improving income
             generated from smallholder irrigation schemes, and sustainable management
             of the schemes under review (and similar schemes).
The intended beneficiary was the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation, and Irrigation
Development (MAMID), and particularly the Department of Irrigation (a
semi-autonomous entity within the Ministry).
The original timetable is presented below.

A.2      Support to the Government of Zimbabwe towards Preparation
         of its Agriculture Investment Plan and the CAADP (1.03)
The A-MDTF allocated $500,000 to help the GoZ draft the Zimbabwe Agricultural
Investment Plan (ZAIP), in line with the country’s commitments under the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) to allocate at
least ten percent of the national budget in pursuit of a sustained agricultural growth rate
of six percent.
The four consultants to be hired by the A-MDTF would work in close collaboration with
staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation, and Irrigation Development



                                                    82
(MAMID), and under the supervision of the ZAIP Task Force (ZAIP-TF), which was
created by the GoZ to direct the preparation of the investment plan. They would support
the ZAIP process through to the Technical Review stage, when the CAADP would
review the draft ZAIP and recommend additional revisions to comply with the
programme.
The intended primary beneficiary of the activity was the MAMID, and specifically the
ZAIP-TF. Secondary beneficiaries include:
            Donors with a vested interest in investing in agriculture in Zimbabwe (such
             as the EU, DFID, USAID, and the development programs of Australia,
             Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the UN)
            Farmers’ unions, NGOs, and private enterprises in the agriculture sector.
The original timetable is presented in below.

A.3      Study on Land Reform (1.12)
The A-MDTF allocated $473,000 for analytical studies and technical assistance (TA) to
help the GoZ design and implement the Comprehensive Land Reform Programme
(CLaRP), a Government-driven process whose goal is to consolidate the land reform
programme in the following ways:
            Adopting and implementing land tenure policies and regulations
            Reforming the land survey process and land administration structures and
             regulations
            Completing the backlog on land valuation and compensation for past
             acquisitions, and streamlining policies and procedures for future acquisitions



                                                   83
            Strengthening the land dispute and conflict resolutions systems, structures,
             and procedures
            Building capacity within the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement
             (MLRR), the intended beneficiary of this activity.
The funds were allocated to hire teams of national and international consultants to assist
in writing background papers in six thematic areas: (1) land tenure; (2) land valuation and
compensation; (3) land conflict/dispute resolution; (4) land administration; (5) land use
planning and productivity; and (6) land survey, registration, and cadastre. These
background papers would be validated in stakeholder workshops before being finalized,
and used to draft policy briefs to inform the CLaRP.
The original timetable is presented in below.

A.4     Support to 2014 Budget Preparation (2.02)
The A-MDTF allocated $200,000 to provide technical assistance to the GoZ in
formulating its 2014 budget. The work was carried out by World Bank staff economists,
with support from consultants.
It consisted of producing 16 Growth and Recovery Policy Notes, each one focused on a
specific sector, such as mining, agriculture, civil service, land reform, education, and so
on. These notes informed an Aide Memoire submitted to the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, which outlined key challenges and
constraints for economic growth, as well as recommendations for setting budget
priorities.
The intended beneficiary is the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MFED), which is tasked with submitting the annual budget to Parliament for its
consideration.
There was no concept note produced for this activity, as it was a continuation of TA for
budget preparation performed in prior years. The timeline below is reconstructed based
on an interview with Nadia Piffaretti, the former TTL for the EMGTRG.

A.5      Poverty Analysis (2.04)
The A-MDTF allocated $200,000 to produce an updated poverty analysis of Zimbabwe.
The analysis was to be based on the latest baseline survey of income, consumption, and
expenditure patterns conducted by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency
(ZIMSTAT)—the 2011 Poverty, Income, Consumption, and Expenditure Survey
(PICES).
The analysis was designed to produce three outputs: (i) a report describing the
demography of poverty in Zimbabwe, (ii) a poverty map that linked the survey results
with geographic data, and (iii) policy notes that described the nature of poverty in various
sectors (such as agriculture, healthcare, education, mining, and so on). The analysis would
be executed by a combination of consultants to be procured by the World Bank and the
Bank’s own staff.
The intended beneficiaries of the activity were ZIMSTAT, the Ministry of Finance, and
the Ministry of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion. After inception, both
ministries merged to form the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, MFED.
Downstream beneficiaries would have included other government ministries and
parastatals that design and implement poverty alleviation or reduction programs, such as
the Ministry of Public Works, Labour, and Social Welfare, as well as donors and
development partners.
The original timetable is presented below.

A.6        Zimbabwe Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme (2.10)
In 2010, the A-MDTF allocated $180,000 to provide “just-in-time? analytical and
advisory support on high priority policy issues requiring urgent action by the GoZ. As
envisioned, this advisory programme would advise on (i) mining taxation policy and (ii)
mining revenue transparency. The initial work was scheduled to take place over a two-
year period beginning January 2011 and concluding June 2012.
As the political economic environment changed and reallocated funds became available
through the A-MDTF, the scope of work for this activity evolved. The mining revenue
transparency work was separated into a distinct A-MDTF activity with its own budget,
after an initial workshop on mining revenue transparency in October 2011 that was
supported by the Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme. In addition, the allocation
was increased to $235,000, to allow for an expanded scope of work that also included
licensing and domestic procurement in the mining sector (in addition to the ongoing
taxation work).
This new work and additional funding allocations were agreed to on an informal basis via
e-mail communications, instead of a formal concept note being drafted and approved.
The revised scope of work was scheduled to be completed by June 2014.
The intended beneficiaries were the Ministry of Mining and Mining Development and
the Ministry of Finance. Downstream beneficiaries could include the commercial and
small-scale miners, who would benefit from taxation reforms and other mining sector
policies.
A.7        ZIMSTAT—System-Wide Approach to Statistics (2.16)
The A-MDTF allocated $25,000 for technical assistance to help the Zimbabwe National
Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) validate its National Strategy for the Development of
Statistics (NSDS) for 2011–2015. The NSDS is a strategic roadmap for the statistical
products (surveys, censuses, and so on) that ZIMSTAT will produce over the 5-year
planning horizon. To help secure funding for the various components of this roadmap,
ZIMSTAT requested the input of an independent statistical expert to review the
priorities and costing of the NSDS.
The direct beneficiary of the TA was ZIMSTAT, although downstream beneficiaries
include the users of the data that would be produced under the NSDS. ZIMSTAT has
identified the following types of statistics users: government agencies and parastatals;
parliament; the private sector; researchers; farmers; the media; civil society organisations;
the general public; and development partners and international organisations67.
The original timetable is presented below.

A.8     Zimbabwe PFMS Technical Assistance (2.17)
The A-MDTF allocated $710,500 to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development (MFED, formerly Ministry of Finance, to
reconfigure and strengthen the GoZ’s budgeting, budget execution, financial control, and
reporting system—the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). The PFMS is a
deployment of the SAP enterprise resource planning platform, an industry-standard
package used by the private and public sector alike.
The PFMS had become inoperable during the hyperinflation crisis in 2008 and 2009, as
the system was not built to accommodate the number of hyperinflationary digits. Out of
necessity, budget execution, budget control, and recording of transactions became
manual processes. Activity 2.17 was designed to help the MoF reactivate and reconfigure
the system so that it could once again be used to computerise the GoZ’s fiscal
accounting and control functions.
At the conclusion of the TA, the SAP system should have been capable of:
           Supporting the GoZ’s cash budget, including integrated budget control
           Accounting for all foreign currency transactions in one ledger for the
            Consolidated Revenue Fund
           Automating bank account reconciliations
           Performing accounting and controlling functions for the National
            Development Fund, a separate account for donor funds.
The activity’s workflow was split into two phases, with two cross-cutting activities: (i)
providing support for on-the-ground process and systems users, and (ii) building capacity
to manage future changes to processes and systems. The tasks for each phase are
specified in the timeline below.

A.9     Flexible Technical Assistance for Infrastructure (3.05)
The A-MDTF allocated $300,000 in funds for three purposes: (i) to fund a series of
Water Forums that facilitated dialogue within the Zimbabwe water sector and with
international practitioners on pressing issues; (ii) to respond to rapid technical assistance
requests from the GoZ with a per-request scope less than $50,000; and (iii) to provide
support to the National Action Committee (NAC) and its subsidiary National
Coordinating Unit (NCU) in improving their current networking and knowledge
management of the water sector.
There were six Water Forums hosted. The Water Forums were originally scheduled to
occur monthly for one year (12 meetings); although in practice they were convened less
frequently (every two to three months). Topics included:

                                                   88
The target beneficiaries were various GoZ ministries with responsibilities within the
water sector. These include:
          Ministry of Environment, Water, and Climate (MEWC), formerly the
           Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management (MWRDM)
          Ministry of Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing
           (MLGPWNH)
          Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development (MOTID), formerly
           the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Infrastructure
           Development
          Ministry of Energy and Power Development
          Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA)
          Environmental Management Agency (EMA)
          Urban and rural councils, such as the City of Harare.
The Flexible TA for Infrastructure child trust fund opened in September 2012 and was
intended to be depleted by December 2013.
A.10 National Water Policy (3.07)
The A-MDTF allocated $300,000 to provide TA to the Ministry of Water Resources
Development and Management (MWRDM) in formulating a draft National Water Policy
(NWP). The A-MDTF’s contribution was matched with $70,000 from UNICEF and
$50,000 from the Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP).
The work was divided into two phases. Phase I involved drafting Technical Background
Documents, one in each of three focus areas:
          Water Resources Management
          Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
          Urban Water Supply and Sanitation.
In Phase II, the Policy Task Force (PTF) of the GoZ’s National Action Committee
(NAC) drafted the NWP based on the policy recommendations contained in the
Technical Background Documents. In addition:
          The PTF received technical assistance from the same consultants to help
           draft the policy
          The PTF received technical assistance from the World Bank’s technical
           experts in the form of comments on drafts of the policy, as well as
           participation in stakeholder meetings.
The direct beneficiaries of the activity are the GoZ, and particularly the ministerial
members of the water sector National Action Committee (NAC). The governance of the
water sector in Zimbabwe is presented in Figure A.1, which illustrates the roles played by
the GoZ, donors, and other stakeholders.

A.11 Feasibility Study for Adapting the Public Works Approach in
     Private Sector Projects, Government, and Municipality Civil
     Works (4.01)
The A-MDTF allocated $400,000 to conduct two analytical studies to inform the design
and implementation of social protection policies and interventions. One of the studies
focused on adapting a proposed food-for-work (“public works approach?) programme
to private sector projects, as well as Government and municipality civil works. That is, a
consultant was hired to identify projects that could be amenable to the proposed food-
for-work scheme.
The intended beneficiary of the study is the Ministry of Public Works, Labour, and Social
Welfare (MPWLSW), which is tasked with designing social protection policies and
interventions, including the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), under which the
proposed food-for-work scheme would be implemented. Downstream beneficiaries
would include the private and governmental entities that benefit from the civil works
undertaken through the PSNP, as well as the poor that benefit from the resulting cash
transfers
The study was to be completed within 1.5 months of beginning, but no later than
December 2010. This timeframe matched the target completion timeframe for the sister
study focusing on the design of the food-for-work programme itself.

Activity                              Contributions to Sound Policy or Strategy Formulation
1.02 Determinants of the              Major—The GoZ is using the results of the study to help inform the design of a National Irrigation Policy. The TTL indicated that
productivity and sustainability of    the Department of Irrigation within the MAMID “highly appreciated? the work because it helped the GoZ understand why
Zimbabwe irrigation                   productivity of irrigation had been steadily declining
1.03 Support to the Government        Major—The TA provided to the GoZ to develop its Agricultural Investment Plan was instrumental. By the Permanent Secretary’s
of Zimbabwe towards preparation       own admission, the draft language provided by the consultants was adopted in nearly its entirety into the final ZAIP
of its Agriculture Investment Plan
and the CAADP
1.12 Study on Land Reform             None—Land issues are highly sensitive and the Ministry of Lands has been reluctant to engage directly with the A-MDTF or donors
                                      on these matters
2.02 Support to 2014 Budget           Minor—In its 2014 budget, the Ministry of Finance largely followed the advice provided in the Aide Memoire and accompanying
Preparation                           Growth and Recovery Notes, with one significant exception: civil service wage reform. In this instance, the GoZ ignored the World
                                      Bank experts’ recommendations
2.04 Poverty Analysis                 Minor—ZIMSTAT indicated that the PICES data and the Poverty Report were used:
                                       By the Ministry of Finance in producing its 2014 budget
                                       By the GoZ to support its stance in wage negotiations with civil servants
                                       By the President in his Food and Nutrition policy announced in 2013
2.10 Zimbabwe Mining Sector           Minor—The Mining Sector Policy Advisory Programme has provided useful TA and analysis for the GoZ, although there is little
Policy Advisory Programme             evidence of the work leading to specific policies or strategies in the mining sector
2.16 ZIMSTAT—System Wide              Major—The scope and cost validation provided by the TA helped provide credibility to the NSDS, which is now being used by
Approach to Statistics                ZIMSTAT as its statistics product roadmap over the current five-year planning horizon
2.17 Zimbabwe PFMS Technical          Major—The improvements to the underlying IFMIS and accompanying public financial management processes enabled informed
Assistance                            decision-making by the GoZ, such as the formulation of its annual budget and prioritisation of public services
3.05 Flexible TA for Infrastructure   Minor contributions to policy or strategy formulation, such as:
                                       Numerous GoZ officials and donors indicated that the Water Forums convened using funds from this activity provided an
                                        opportunity for the key stakeholders to discuss the major challenges facing the water sector, although we were unable to attribute

Appendix I: Examples of Interview Questionnaires
The following questionnaires indicate the types of questions that we asked of different
stakeholders during our field visits, and during follow-up interviews. We prepared
questions for four broad groups of stakeholders, distinguished by their level of
knowledge of the A-MDTF:
         Direct and indirect beneficiaries of activities—entities such as the relevant
          GoZ ministries that were direct counterparts to the implementation of an
          activity, as well as non-governmental entities (such as NGOs, private sector
          associations, and so on) that would have knowledge of certain activities (see
          Table I.1)
         A-MDTF TTLs and project managers—A-MDTF Secretariat staff that
          were responsible for overseeing the implementation of activities, including the
          sector TTLs (see Table I.2)
         Senior A-MDTF managers—A-MDTF Secretariat staff, such as the
          Programme Manager and the Finance Officer, that would have knowledge of
          the high-level objectives and performance of the Fund but not necessarily
          detailed knowledge of any specific activity (see Table I.3).
In the following tables, we present questionnaires that we prepared for one activity: 2.04
Poverty Analysis. In advance of the field visit, we prepared similar sets of questionnaires
that were tailored for each of the stakeholders we intended to interview.

                          Has the Poverty Report been finalized? If so, was it a useful
                            analysis of poverty in Zimbabwe? How would you rate the outputs
                            in terms of their quality and usefulness to you?
                          What exactly were the poverty report, the poverty map, and the
                            policy notes used for?
                          Were there any policy recommendations arising from the poverty
                            analysis? Were they adopted? If any policy decisions were made as
                            a result of the poverty analysis, were there other factors that
                            influenced the outcome of the policy decisions?
                          Did the poverty analysis activity enable future analyses to continue
                            without additional support? Were any analytical techniques learned
                            by ZIMSTAT staff?
                          For how long do you expect the poverty analysis will remain used
                            and useful by the GoZ and other stakeholders?
                          What problems, if any, did you encounter during implementation
                            of the activity?

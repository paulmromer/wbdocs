Box 1.1: Facing a Broad Set of Shocks and Stresses in Beirut

Home to more than half of Lebanon’s population, Beirut is growing rapidly while fostering a strong and vibrant private
sector. In parallel, the city faces a growing spectrum of risks stemming from climate change, natural hazards (i.e.
                                              flooding, severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami), refugees and mass

                                              and political shocks further challenge the sustainable development of the city.

                                                    In late 2006, an accident resulted in the shutdown of the Koeberg nuclear plant in the Cape Town area. Because of the accident’s magnitude
                                                    and limited generator reserves or transmission capacity to meet this shortfall, the area would have suffered from several months of
                                                    chronic black outs. The power company (ESKOM) supported a program to reduce energy demand and avoided a catastrophic black out.

                                                    Two years later, ESKOM faced a second blackout, this time at a national scale. The World Bank was
                                                    requested to help mitigate the power crisis given that the system was both energy and peak capacity
                                                    constrained. The Bank supported three fronts of work. The first included a rapid design of a rationing
                                                    program that mirrors a program instituted in Brazil in 2001. In Brazil this program helped the country
                                                    save 20 percent of energy over nine months without any black or brown outs. Such programs are
                                                    considered one of the most effective utility interventions to manage power rationing on the demand side.

                                                    The second aspect of the Bank program was a simplified demand management program that enabled
                                                    large customers to reduce/displace off-peak consumption. The third initiative was to establish a standard
                                                    offer model where the utility could “buy” energy efficiency and load reduction resources at an agreed
                                                    price. As such this is equivalent to a tariff in the energy efficiency space. Based on this program, the
                                                    concept has been able to manage 700 MW of peak capacity that ESKOM can use to manage their power
                                                    system. This model has also been adapted to improve energy efficiency in a number of other countries.

Box 4.2: Performance-based Contracting in Brazil
In an effort to explore new options for road financing, the World Bank provided through
performance-based contracts for rehabilitation and road maintenance (cReMa). The project
consists of components to support institutional strengthening for road financing and management,
and other investments to support sustainable road accessibility and safety. The project’s second
component investment supported a performance-based state highway rehabilitation and
maintenance ‘program’ for improved sustainability and safety. This component includes investments
in performance-based contracts for the maintenance and rehabilitation of 1685 km of identified
roadways in Bahia, along with rehabilitation and maintenance works under CREMA contracts
of an additional 685 km of highways. By including road rehabilitation and maintenance in the
performance-based contract, the project investment better supported the long-term resilience
of the roadways. As such the provision was made to ensure that the rehabilitated roads would be
able to withstand the impact of high intensity climate events such as excess rainfall and floods.
Additional investments under the project included feeder road improvements, improved drainage
systems, etc. Such investments also support the long term resilience of the Bahia road network.

BOX 4.4: Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (ISMEP)
With 15 million inhabitants, Istanbul is not only the most populous province, but also Turkey’s financial, cultural and industrial
heartland, accounting for 28 percent of national GDP, generating 38 percent of the national industrial output and 44 percent of
its tax income. With 188 of Turkey’s 500 largest industrial companies located in Istanbul, and as the center of production, import
and export, USD 82.5 billion of Turkey’s GDP is at risk from Istanbul’s exposure to multiple hazards, primarily earthquakes.

Over the past decade, ISMEP has helped improve Istanbul’s preparedness for a potential earthquake by enhancing its institutional
and technical capacity for disaster management and emergency response, strengthening critical public facilities for earthquake
resistance, and supporting measures for better enforcement of building codes. The investment has resulted in:

•	                                                  1258 high-risk buildings, including schools and hospitals, being strengthened, directly benefitting about 1.5 million people;

•	                                                  added value and service life to those buildings in retrofitting to the value ofUSD 227 million; and

•	                                                  a difference between the undamaged asset value ‘with’ and ‘without’ the project of avoided direct damages in the amount of USD 728 million.

Initially supported with a € 415.26 million (USD 550 million) IBRD loan and additional financing, ISMEP has leveraged another
€ 1.36 billion from the European Investment Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank and Islamic Development Bank, which
will continue financing risk reduction for critical public facilities until 2020 under ISMEP implementing arrangements.

BOX 4.5: Using Analysis for Safe and Resilient Cities in Ethiopia
Ethiopia has one of the fastest growing urban populations in the world. It is projected to triple from 15 million in 2012 to 42 million in
2034, growing at 5.4 percent a year. The CityStrength Diagnostic approach that was developed and successfully piloted in Addis Ababa
in early 2015 informed the Government of Ethiopia’s decision to scale up the urban resilience technical assistance (TA) program to nine
other regional capitals - Adama, Assossa, Bahir Dar, Gambella, Harar, Hawassa, Jigjiga, Mekelle, and Semera-Logia, and Dire Dawa City
Administration. This program builds on the CityStrength Diagnostic approach, while improving the rigor of the approach by adding hazard
mapping, a review of building framework and a quick assessment of emergency response management capacity in urban areas.

The initial assessment found that all those regions are facing increased exposure to floods and fire. A majority of them are
exposed to earthquake risk but are not taking any actions to prepare for an earthquake event. They are all facing a number
of urban stresses, including acute water shortages, a housing shortage, an increasing number of traffic accidents, and
unemployment. Moreover, these cities are projected to triple in population by 2037, more than tripling their current built up
area. These regional capitals are at a crossroads where decisions made today about the type and location of infrastructure,
services and buildings will affect the overall safety of the cities and increase in exposure and climate impacts.

Consultative analysis found that substantial savings could be made in lives and future economic losses if investments are made to improve urban
resilience. These relate both to the long term cost savings in urban services and resilient infrastructure development, and the safeguarding of
hard earned development gains. For example, improved flood management practices (involving compliance with regulatory requirements for
land use) would reduce the average annual loss to about USD 93 million from the current level for a net annual savings reduction of about USD
230 million each year. As a result, five main priorities areas and investments were identified to enhance resilience in these regional capitals:

                                     •	   Effective management of rapid urban growth in a risk-sensitive manner focusing on the most vulnerable;

                                     •	   Better management of floods and water scarcity;

                                     •	   Improvement of disaster preparedness including fire safety and response;

                                     •	   Improvement in building a regulatory framework to mitigate seismic risk; and

                                     •	   enhancement of overall safety of the built environment, and support towards key sectoral priorities.

                                                    Belo Horizonte, Brazil’s sixth largest city, has a high poverty rate which is unevenly distributed throughout the city
                                                    and is highly correlated with housing conditions, inequality, access to jobs, and gender. The World Bank provided
                                                    a USD 200 million development policy loan (DPL) to the city in 2013 in support of inclusive urban development
                                                    to reduce vulnerability of the poor, promote green and sustainable practices, and enhance socially and fiscally
                                                    sustainable urban governance. The loan built upon ongoing reforms in housing development, resettlement, social
                                                    programs, climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and results-based management.

                                                    During the loan implementation period, the Municipality adopted ambitious participatory decision-making
                                                    mechanisms to foster direct citizen inclusion and ownership of budget allocation, policy decisions, and planning.
                                                    The city also embraced state-of-the-art resettlement policies and practices. It spearheaded an innovative approach
                                                    to reach the most vulnerable families, designing a specific development action plan for those families not reached
                                                    by existing social programs by tailoring to their specific needs. Finally, the city developed and implemented
                                                    a municipal climate change action plan and strengthened its disaster early warning and reporting system.

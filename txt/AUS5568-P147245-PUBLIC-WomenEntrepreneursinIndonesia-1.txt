Foreword

The world today believes that supporting women entrepreneurs is vital for economic growth. As
economic opportunities increase, unprecedented numbers of women are entering the world of business
and entrepreneurship. The number of women entrepreneurs has risen in global economy including
in developing countries. However, the majority of women entrepreneurs in developing countries are
still operating in small and micro enterprises with very little growth. Most women entrepreneurs run
businesses in the informal and traditional female sectors. There is still prevalence of gender gaps in
critical skills to run successful businesses. While education for women is making major progress along
the years, women often still lack vocational and technical skills, as well as work experience to enable them
to run large businesses. Women are also reported to be less likely to have access to information and
communications technology (ICT) which plays a significant role in the highly integrated global market.
The other constraint, that is major, is the lack of finance.

Numerous programs have designed to support MSMEs in general, but not many of them targeted
women entrepreneurs in particular. Some of them have served women entrepreneurs under the
umbrella of micro-enterprises, without distinguishing the unique needs of women-owned firms. The
others have viewed women entrepreneurs primarily through the lens of poverty reduction. In addition,
not much existing study that tried to analyze about women entrepreneurs; its unique characteristics and
its specific challenges and needs. The Lack of comprehensive data about MSMEs that owned by women
also becomes one of challenges to design a right programs or policies to support women entrepreneurs.

This study aims to understand the specific characteristics, challenges, and opportunities of women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia. By understanding the real condition of women micro-entrepreneurs in
Indonesia, it is expected to be able to define the right policy recommendation and supports to promote
the women entrepreneurs. To be different to other existing study on MSMEs and women entrepreneurs,
this study investigate the large number of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia across provinces that
cover java and non-java regions. In addition, the study also shifts the focus from poverty reduction to a
growth imperative.

I hope that this study serves to begin the process of discussions and dialog on this important issue
across stakeholders in Indonesia. I also hope that this study can fill the gap of existing study on women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia and contribute as base study to design right initiatives to support women
entrepreneur in Indonesia. The World Bank Group stands ready to support the Government of Indonesia
as it works to support women entrepreneurs to accelerate its growth and improve its role to support
Indonesia economy.

Executive Summary

The Government of Indonesia and the World Bank Group (WBG) share a vision of an equitable and
prosperous Indonesia aligned with the twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and increasing shared
prosperity. This study, carried out by the World Bank’s Finance & Markets Global Practice at the request
of the Ministry of National Development Planning, examines how to support women entrepreneurs in
Indonesia through the lens of these shared goals.

Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and its tenth largest economy, is currently undergoing
a period of significant economic transition. The economic tailwinds of the past decade - rapid growth
in Indonesia’s key trading partners particularly China, high commodity prices, and significant growth in
consumption of an emerging middle class - have now become headwinds.

The Government of Indonesia’s Mid-term Development Plan (RPJMN 2015-2019), reflects its strategy
to meet these new economic challenges. The RPJMN highlights the important role of Micro, Small,
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), citing the need to improve the competitiveness and productivity of
MSMEs, which contribute 47% of GDP and 57% of employment in Indonesia.

One of the highest return opportunities available in supporting MSMEs in Indonesia comes in the form
of support to women-owned enterprises. Women make up an exceptionally large and growing share of
the self-employed in Indonesia, and yet they operate smaller and less productive enterprises than men.
Serving women entrepreneurs effectively heralds the opportunity to both reduce extreme poverty, by
supporting entrepreneurs at the bottom of the pyramid to escape poverty traps, and to increase shared
prosperity, by growing the incomes and employment of women-owned enterprises.

Of course, support to women entrepreneurs is in itself not a novel idea, and a multitude of initiatives
from government, private sector, and civil society have targeted women entrepreneurs in Indonesia
in the past. But why, after decades of programming, does there remain a large gap between women-
owned and male-owned enterprises? Who exactly are the women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and what
do they need to thrive? Which institutions are best poised to meet their needs, and in what ways? These
are some of the key questions the present study aims at addressing.

The premise of this study is that amongst the very large pool of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia,
there are diverse and heterogeneous needs. One of the most critical and overlooked cohorts of women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia are the fast-growing ‘gazelles’, which with the right support have the potential
to catalyze much broader economic growth and development. This study builds on experience of the
World Bank’s Finance & Markets Global Practice in designing interventions to finance and support these
types of high-potential women entrepreneurs.

The study begins with an overview of existing literature and lessons on women entrepreneurs, both
in Indonesia and around the globe. It then incorporates comprehensive, original analysis on both the
demand-side and the supply side. On the demand-side, the study includes one of the largest, dedicated
surveys of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia to date, covering over 1600 women entrepreneurs




                                                                                                       1

across the country. This is complemented on the supply-side by in-depth interviews with 344 financial
institutions, business development providers, and local government respondents, as well as qualitative
case studies with seven financial institutions that work with women entrepreneurs.

The study finds that programs targeting women entrepreneurs in Indonesia in the past have often
yielded sub-optimal results because of their inability to target the right firms. Often, programs and
policies are designed to serve all women entrepreneurs with a standardized intervention, usually focused
on ‘poverty reduction’.

Global evidence suggests that segmenting women entrepreneurs into distinct categories can help to
better meet individual needs (World Bank, 2014). A useful typology involves distinguishing between
‘growth-oriented’ women entrepreneurs, who demonstrate the ability and willingness to expand their
enterprise, and ‘necessity’ entrepreneurs, who enter entrepreneurial activity out of a lack of alternatives
and are unlikely to change their business trajectory.

The typology of ‘necessity’ and ‘growth-oriented’ is not merely semantic: these entrepreneurs require
support through distinct types of interventions and activities. While necessity entrepreneurs can
benefit from well-designed poverty reduction programs, the growth-oriented are better targeted with
entrepreneurial support programs. These two approaches mirror the twin goals of eliminating extreme
poverty and increasing shared prosperity.

Our findings suggest that approximately 15% of women entrepreneurs can be classified as ‘growth-
oriented’ entrepreneurs, who are very likely to expand their businesses, and as they do, to hire female
employees. Although this segment exhibits very distinct and unmet needs, there exists a ‘missing target’
phenomenon in which they are the least served by existing interventions.

The study provides a number of targeted recommendations to address this ‘missing target’ and to
accelerate the growth of these enterprises. At the same time, the study acknowledges that a large
proportion of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia remain on the precipice of extreme poverty, and the
report provides some broader recommendations for improving existing programs serving this cohort
also.

The key findings and recommendations of the report, in these two areas, are as follows:



Increasing Shared Prosperity by Reaching the ‘Growth-
Oriented’ Segment

    1.	 Tailor Credit Products

    Key Finding: The greatest unmet demand for credit amongst Indonesian women entrepreneurs
    comes from the growth-oriented segment. These borrowers are unlikely to benefit or be sufficiently
    served by existing group lending schemes, which are prevalent throughout the country. The growth-
    oriented have financing needs that are significantly greater than the 10 Million Rupiah group loan
    ceiling, and the frequent and mandatory group meetings which are useful for less experienced
    entrepreneurs present a significant opportunity cost to them.

    Recommendation: Interventions need to increase access to finance for the ‘missing target’ of
    women entrepreneurs who are growth-oriented and do not benefit from group lending schemes
    but cannot access commercial banks. This should involve developing tailored credit products for
    women entrepreneurs, with loan sizes ranging from approximately 50 Million to 500 Million Rupiah.
    Lessons can be drawn from successful projects targeting growth-oriented women entrepreneurs in
    other countries (Text Box 1). Specifically, tailored credit products could include:

    i.)	 Individual Loans: Helping MFIs and small lenders focused on group lending ‘upscale’ to
           provide larger, individual loans to women entrepreneurs, or helping larger financial institutions
           ‘downscale’ to reach this segment.
    ii.)	 Movable Collateral: Supporting introduction of movable collateral, including equipment,
           accounts receivable, inventory and intellectual property rights – rather than only against fixed
           assets such as buildings or land, which most women do not have.
    iii.)	 Women-owned Assets: Broadening asset collateral to include items such as jewelry or gold,
           likely to be owned by women. Although these assets might not by themselves secure a loan,
           they could be used in combination with other appraisal and securitization.
    iv.)	 Data Innovations: Introducing data-driven appraisal techniques, such as tablet- based
           psychometric testing, which can utilize large pools of data to predict the likelihood of default
           and enable lending without traditional collateral.



    2.	 Help Lenders Enter the Women’s Market

    Key Finding: 76% of financial institutions surveyed see women entrepreneurs as a profitable market
    segment, but less than 3% have dedicated products or strategies to serve women. At the same time,
    growth-oriented women entrepreneurs express strong unmet demand for credit, even at prevailing
    market interest rates. Financial institutions can reach these borrowers profitably, but will need added
    incentives to accelerate their outreach and product development.

    Recommendation: Technical assistance for selected financial institutions can help them to develop
    women-tailored credit products, and lines of credit or credit guarantee schemes can incentivize
    actual lending and mitigate risk, until financial institutions develop commercially viable products.
    A two-step process could involve (i) a high-quality technical assistance program with five to ten
    selected institutions to develop strategies and financial products for women entrepreneurs, followed
    by (ii) an attractive line of credit offered through a wholesaling operation, or a credit guarantee
    scheme to mitigate risk. Initial under-writing of this nature could catalyze the launch and roll-out of
    the new products, and could be drawn down over an agreed timeframe.



    3.	 Stimulate Women’s Insurance Market

    Key Finding: Very few women entrepreneurs in Indonesia possess insurance, due mainly to high
    cost and lack of awareness, and absence of targeted products. Lacking insurance, women utilize
    business profits to pay for emergencies, rather than directing these earnings back into productive
    uses such as technology investments or hiring new employees, limiting their growth. Moreover,
    women entrepreneurs personal and business lives are closely linked, and women are more likely to
    face business interruptions from life events that men will not face, such as pregnancy, childbirth, and
    maternity leave.

    Recommendation: There is a need to accelerate outreach of insurance products for women
    entrepreneurs, especially life insurance, property insurance, and business interruption insurance.
    Working with insurance providers to develop women-tailored products and partnering with women’s
    business associations to bring down premiums through group plans would make insurance products
    more appealing to women entrepreneurs. Packaging insurance with other products, for example
    through additional loan fees which could cover insurance premiums, would enable women to own
    insurance without having to purchase it directly as shown in the selected qualitative studies.



    4.	 Explore Equity Investing and Angel Investing

    Key Finding: Angel investors can provide equity to high-potential but unbanked women entrepreneurs.
    This is already happening on a small-scale in Indonesia, with small networks such as ANGIN starting
    to direct private funds to MSMEs in exchange for equity stakes and a share of recurring profits. While
    promising, the market for equity investment in MSMEs in Indonesia is still nascent. Growing it could
    be a source of tremendous opportunity in the coming years.

    Recommendation: Explore providing liquidity and incentives to existing angel investors and equity
    investors to target high-potential women entrepreneurs. This could involve providing capital
    infusions for lending to women entrepreneurs, or providing partial risk mitigations to encourage
    broader outreach. Adapting regulations to make equity investment simpler for investors, networks,
    and MSMEs themselves could compound these investments, and catalyze the growth of the equity
    investment market.

 5.	 Support Individualized Business Consulting

 Key Finding: The main type of BDS on offer is business training courses. These are often supply-
 driven, and participants are likely to be smaller, older, and less educated than the average. Growth-
 oriented entrepreneurs shy away from these business trainings, but might benefit from one-to-one
 consulting or mentorship services, that can help them with specific challenges such as expanding
 into new markets, improving business practices, and connecting to global value chains.

 Recommendation: Explore support for intensive business consulting models for a smaller sub-set of
 women entrepreneurs. Since there are already a number of incubators and personalized coaching
 and consulting firms on the market, a matching grants scheme could add value. Growth-oriented
 entrepreneurs could be screened and given the opportunity to apply for grants that would cover
 a portion of the costs for their businesses to obtain consulting or technical services from private
 providers of their choice. Mentoring and support between women entrepreneurs could also be
 impactful. Creating and facilitating a network of high-potential women entrepreneurs to meet,
 exchange knowledge, and form partnerships could help them improve business activities and
 expand to new markets.




Eliminating Extreme                           Poverty by Supporting the
‘Necessity’ Segment

 1.	 Support Cross-overs into Male-Dominated Sectors

 Key Finding: Women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are concentrated in low-value sectors, in particular
 trade and service. These entrepreneurs state that intensive competition is the biggest challenge they
 face. Male entrepreneurs out-earn women entrepreneurs by a significant margin. Global evidence
 suggests that when women enter the male-dominated sectors, earning differentials diminish
 significantly. Usually women entrepreneurs are not aware of the potentially lucrative opportunities
 from transitioning into male-dominated sectors.

 Recommendation: Supporting women to get into male-dominated sectors over time can help to
 reduce the persistent inequality between earnings of male and female entrepreneurs. This can
 be done through entrepreneurship programs that incorporate more technical training in male-
 dominated sectors such as mechanics or carpentry and other customized services to facilitate this
 process of crossover; or through grants and intensive support to lower entry costs of women into
 profitable male-dominated sectors. Education from an early age and role models that can raise
 awareness of the benefits of working in different sectors can also be effective.




                                                                                                  5

    2.	 Pilot and Test Mobile Savings

    Key Finding: Over 80% of women entrepreneurs run profitable enterprises, with average monthly
    profits of about 2.5 Million Rupiah, and profit margins of 20% to 30%. However, very few women
    entrepreneurs have a savings account. Unlike male entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs face an
    expectation of diverting business profits for household expenditures. Women do set aside some
    portion of their funds, by saving with arisans or with friends outside their household. Global evidence
    shows that mobile savings accounts are particularly beneficial for women entrepreneurs, since they
    allow for more privacy and address time use, mobility, and safety constraints faced by women in
    visiting banks.

    Recommendation: Products which enable women to save and transact privately and inconspicuously
    may help them to set aside a greater portion of their earnings. Working with financial institutions as
    well as telecom providers to identify and provide seed support for developing or rolling out basic
    mobile savings accounts that can be marketed to women entrepreneurs would be one way to do
    this. Testing various approaches to mobile savings through impact evaluations could help to shed
    light on how to better serve women entrepreneurs in this segment.



    3.	 Provide more women-targeted Business Development Services

    Key Finding: While outreach to women entrepreneurs is strong and the menu of services provided
    is sufficiently diverse, most providers of business development services do not feel that women
    entrepreneurs require a specific product or approach, distinct from other MSMEs. Training and
    support to women-owned enterprises is rarely tailored for women, with very few providers indicating
    the presence of gender-sensitive business development service content, or approaches such as flex-
    hours or on-site childcare facilities proven to attract women.

    Recommendation: Improve the supply of more-gender sensitive and women- targeted business
    development services. Training modules on gender discrimination, dealing with harassment,
    managing male employees or negotiating with male suppliers can strengthen the value and benefit
    of training or consulting for women entrepreneurs. Rather than standalone provisions, these can be
    packaged with other business development services. Provision of free childcare services and flexible
    schedules can help meet the needs of women entrepreneurs who are already juggling business and
    household responsibilities. Moreover, business development services have an important role to play
    in linking credit-worthy women entrepreneurs with appropriate financial institutions in order to
    resolve information asymmetries and facilitate women's access to capital.



    4.	 Test Adaptations to Existing Interventions

    Key Finding: Existing interventions targeting necessity women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, including
    large-scale programs such as PNPM, can be adapted to improve the likelihood of benefiting them.
    A worthwhile investment would be to explore ways to improve delivery of the 10 Trillion Rupiah
    in PNPM Revolving Loan Funds transferred to women in urban and rural areas. Multiple reviews



6
        WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




of the PNPM program have found that the women-targeted savings and loans program is ‘rarely
managing to change the overall economy of the family’ and that ‘activities are very small scale
and enabled women to invest in very low return activities’ (World Bank, 2014). Providing loans to
necessity women entrepreneurs without changing the economy of the family is destined to produce
sub-optimal results.

Recommendation: There are complex political economies at play, but testing new approaches
could yield new learnings and improve effectiveness. These could include converting revolving loan
fund activities in poverty alleviation project such as PNPM into grants to be transferred to women
entrepreneurs on the condition that they open a savings account; testing in-kind capital transfers
to minimize the diversion of capital from women’s businesses to their households (kin tax); piloting
approaches to engage men and alter business sector decisions or household labor allocations;
providing assistantship for market access; and training for business skills such as financial literacy
and management, product development etc. Rigorous measurement of differential benefits and
impacts for male and female entrepreneurs within existing programs would also help to maximize
effectiveness for women entrepreneurs within these large-scale projects.

Introduction
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




Introduction

Women are on the rise. Globally, women’s income is projected to reach $6 Trillion by 2017, and, by
2028, women are expected to control close to 75 percent of discretionary spending worldwide (IFC/AXA,
2015). As economic opportunities increase, unprecedented numbers of women are entering the world of
business and entrepreneurship. In Indonesia, women own about 23% of small and medium enterprises,
and the proportion of businesses owned by women is growing significantly faster than those owned by
men (Asia Foundation, 2013).

Amidst growth, however, inequality persists. In Indonesia, the average woman-owned firm is significantly
smaller than the average male owned-firm in terms of profits, sales, and employees. Women-owned firms
are more likely to face financing and business environment constraints, and as a result are less likely
to grow at pace with male-owned firms. The trend of course is not unique to Indonesia; an estimated
70% of women-owned enterprises around the world are either unserved or underserved by financial
institutions, amounting to a financing gap of $285 Billion (IFC, 2014).

Globally, early movers will gain strong advantages by harnessing the growth of women-owned enterprises
and unlocking solutions to the challenges they face. The Asia Pacific economy is estimated to be able
to grow by $89 Billion annually, if women are able to achieve their full economic potential. In Indonesia,
average output per worker would increase by 11% if women-owned firms operated in the same sectors
and had the same access to productive resources as their male counterparts (Asia Foundation, 2013). A
diverse range of economic research shows that addressing the financing gap faced by women-owned
enterprises is one of the highest-return opportunities available in emerging markets.

Numerous initiatives have targeted women entrepreneurs in Indonesia in the past, but have often yielded
sub-optimal results. Some of these initiatives have served women entrepreneurs under the umbrella of
micro-enterprises, without distinguishing the unique needs of women-owned firms. Other initiatives
have viewed women entrepreneurs primarily through the lens of poverty reduction, and have aimed to
empower vulnerable women to run and maintain an enterprise, often home-based and in the informal
sector. While worthwhile, interventions that target micro-enterprises broadly, and interventions that
address the needs of only the most vulnerable women entrepreneurs, are not sufficient to unlock the full
potential of women entrepreneurs in the country.

This study, conducted by the World Bank’s Finance & Markets Global practice, shifts the focus from
poverty reduction to a shared prosperity imperative. The premise of the study is that amongst the
exceptionally large pool of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, there are diverse and heterogeneous
needs. One of the most critical and overlooked cohorts of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are
the fast-growing ‘gazelles’, which with the right support have the potential to catalyze much broader
economic growth and development. This study builds on experience of the World Bank’s Finance &
Markets Global practice in designing interventions to finance and support these types of high-potential
women entrepreneurs.




                                                                                                      9

The study consists of one of the largest, dedicated surveys of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia to
date, as well as in-depth interviews with financial institutions, business development providers, and
local government. Our findings are encouraging. Amongst a population of 20 to 30 Million women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia, our data estimates that approximately 15% can be classified as ‘growth-
oriented’ entrepreneurs who are capable of expanding their firms. The estimated size of this growth-
oriented cohort in Indonesia is significantly larger than estimates in other-country comparators.

The growth-oriented women entrepreneurs identified in our data exhibit strong unmet demand for
financial and non-financial services, and the benefits to serving them are palpable. Our analysis shows
that this population of growth-oriented women entrepreneurs is more likely to participate and benefit
from publicly-supported interventions, and is more likely to grow as a result of access to services. As
they grow, these enterprises will not only contribute meaningfully to economic output and growth, but
also employ women in higher numbers than men, heralding an opportunity to reduce persistent gender
inequalities in employment in Indonesia.

The report that follows begins with an overview of lessons and good practices in understanding
and serving women entrepreneurs. It then aims to first categorize the large population of women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia into discernible, targetable segments, including a segment of the highest
potential entrepreneurs. Based on this categorization, the report diagnoses the needs of each market
segment, and provides concrete recommendations for improving programming and interventions to
better reach the growth-oriented. The study also provides insight into how existing interventions may be
tweaked to better serve women entrepreneurs who are not on a growth trajectory. Improved targeting,
the study suggests, is likely to enhance delivery of services, and to unlock the tremendous growth
potential of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.

and Lessons

                                          Key Points

1.	 There are a very high number of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, even
    compared to neighboring countries.
2.	 There are more women that run micro enterprises than men. Most women entrepreneurs in Indonesia
    are ‘pushed’ into self-employment, due to high female unemployment and a lower share of women
    than men in formal wage employment.
3.	 Past programs and policies targeting women entrepreneurs have yielded sub-optimal results,
    due to imprecise targeting. Even though most women operate micro-enterprises, their firms are
    heterogeneous and have highly varied needs.
4.	 An effective way of segmenting the market of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia is to classify
    women entrepreneurs into a ‘growth-oriented’ segment, who are likely to grow their enterprises,
    and a ‘necessity’ segments, who require other types of support. Necessity and Growth are not the
    same as Micro and Small.
5.	 Global evidence suggests that necessity women entrepreneurs are likely to benefit from savings
    promotion schemes and in-kind capital transfers, while growth-oriented women entrepreneurs
    are likely to benefit from individual credit, tailored insurance schemes, and one-to-one business
    consulting.

A multitude of studies and analyses of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia have proliferated in the
past decade. The existing research is broad in scope, and covers a variety of topics, ranging from the
success of group lending schemes for rural women entrepreneurs, to the profile of women in the fashion
industry. This rich body of literature has started to provide a glimpse into the heterogeneity of women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and the diverse challenges they face.

Since there are no nationally representative data sets on women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, the extant
studies tend to draw generalizations about women entrepreneurs from limited data. Still, as the body of
knowledge grows, some trends are emerging in the research on women entrepreneurs in Indonesia. In
addition, the global database of knowledge on women entrepreneurs is growing rapidly. In particular,
experimental and impact evaluation evidence is beginning to reveal patterns and trends in ‘what works’
for supporting women entrepreneurs, and many of these lessons are likely to have resonance for
initiatives supporting women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.

The following chapter summarizes some of the literature on women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, as
well as the literature in supporting women entrepreneurs around the globe. In doing so, it begins to
illuminate the situation of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and the types of support they might need.


A.	 MSMEs and the Indonesia Economy
Despite slowing down in recent years, Indonesia’s growth trajectory remains impressive. Indonesia’s
economy grew 4.8% in 2015, and is on track to achieve 5.3% growth in 2016 (World Bank, 2015).
Indonesia’s economy is the largest in Southeast Asia and the tenth largest in the world, as measured
by purchasing power parity. At the same time, social welfare indicators in the country have shown little
progress for the last several years. The unemployment rate decreased only slightly from 6.3% in 2013 to
5.9% in 2014 (BPS, 2015), the Human Development Index increased only marginally from 72.3 in 2010 to
73.8 in 2014, and the Gini coefficient has remained at a consistent 4.1 since 2012. With a total population
of 252 Million, the absolute number of poor people in Indonesia is still high.

While growth has been tangible, then, development remains elusive. In the drive towards more inclusive
and sustainable growth, the Government of Indonesia has recognized the pivotal role of Micro, Small
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Indeed, MSMEs will be a critical element of growth and poverty
reduction, considering their outsize role in Indonesia’s economy. In 2013, MSMEs represented more
than 99% of the total number firms in Indonesia with an estimated total of over 57 Million firms. Micro
and small enterprises (MSEs) alone contributed 43% of the GNP (Ministry of Cooperative and MSMEs,
2013). Even compared to neighboring countries and analogous economies in the region, the share of the
economy occupied by MSMEs in Indonesia is exceptionally large.

Public impetus and policy frameworks to support MSMEs in Indonesia are abundant. The National
Medium Term Development Plan (2015-2019) emphasizes the need for equitable distribution of growth,
and recognizes the key role of MSMEs in this distribution. Additionally, the National Strategy for Financial
Inclusion emphasizes the need to increase access to finance to all people, including credit from the
financial sector for MSMEs. The large MSME sector was widely recognized as having helped maintain the
country’s economic resilience during the financial crises of 2008-2009 and MSMEs are therefore seen as
a priority area of support.




                                                                                                       13
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




The important role of women entrepreneurs is also being increasingly recognized in Indonesia. Over
half of MSMEs in Indonesia are estimated to be owned by women (Asia Foundation, 2013), due to the
large concentration of women-owned micro-enterprises. At the same time, the rate of women’s business
ownership is also increasing faster than that of men, as policies and culture begin to tilt in favor of
women entering the world of business. With high female unemployment and underemployment, the
Government of Indonesia has encouraged women to enter into self-employment. Like male-owned
MSMEs, women-owned enterprises have been considered as a buffer and safety valve in order to
support economic growth and provide alternative employment for those who cannot access formal
labor markets.

While support for MSMEs has been enshrined in public policy and recognized as a key engine of growth,
the actual track record of programs to support MSMEs in Indonesia has been mixed. There are over 50
national SME programs and scores of sub-national ones, but few have achieved tangible or sustainable
results. Though well-funded, past initiatives have had limited impact in addressing the binding constraints
that enterprises face. Though large and comprehensive in scale, these programs have suffered from poor
data, imprecise targeting and the inability to reach the right firms (Ministry of Finance, 2015). The fact
that the vast majority of Indonesia’s MSMEs exist informally compounds the challenge of monitoring
and understanding their status and needs.

What is known about Indonesia’s MSMEs is that access to finance is their most prevalent challenge.
Bank Indonesia data showed that MSME loans in 2011 represented only 21.5% of total bank credit. And
amongst these enterprises, women entrepreneurs tend to receive significantly less credit than men do.
World Bank Enterprise Survey data shows that only 41% of firms with a listed female owner in Indonesia
have an account at formal financial institution, compared to 56% of those with only male owners.
Similarly, 13% of firms with a female owner have accessed a loan from a formal financial institution,
compared to 21% of male-owned firms (World Bank, 2010). The challenges faced by MSMEs and women
entrepreneurs are also non-financial, amongst them access to business premises, challenges hiring and
retaining skilled workers, and intensive competition.

Building on the momentum for more effective support to addressing the constraints faced by MSMEs in
Indonesia, the analysis that follows attempts to better understand the needs of the specific segment of
women entrepreneurs, with a view to developing more targeted initiatives to reach them in the future.



B.	 Who are the Women Entrepreneurs?
The absolute number of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia is very high. In 2011, the Ministry of Women
Empowerment and Child Protection estimated that there are 55,206,444 micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) in the country, of which 60%, or 33 Million, are owned by women, representing
almost a quarter of the active labor force (Melissa et al, 2015). The 2014 Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor estimated that of Indonesia’s total adult female population of 85 Million, approximately 26%,
or 22 Million are active entrepreneurs (GEM, 2015). While estimates vary due to different classifications
of women entrepreneurs and incomplete data, all approximations suggest a high absolute number of
female entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and a very high proportion of the adult female population engaged
in entrepreneurship.

In addition to being high in number, the proportion of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia is growing.
The proportion of women entrepreneurs as a share of all SMEs in Indonesia was estimated at 23%

The high absolute number of women entrepreneurs and the high proportion of women engaged in
entrepreneurship in Indonesia is most likely indicative of large entry costs, especially of women, into
formal labor markets (Hallward-Drimeier, 2013). Most women entrepreneurs in Indonesia turn to
entrepreneurship out of necessity – for example due to lack of employment opportunities – rather than
in pursuit of profit and employment opportunities. As the figure below demonstrates, Indonesia has a

I.	 Existing Policies for Women Entrepreneurs

Much of the policy framework concerning enterprise support in Indonesia is centered around micro
enterprises and small enterprises. Law number 20/2008 on MSMEs provides the official classification
Figure: Male and Female Labor Force in Indonesia
of MSMEs, and defines each category of firm according to asset and sales or annual revenues. In turn,

by sales and annual revenues. While this provides a useful lens for understanding the structure of private
sector, it is a less useful distinction when thinking about how to effectively serve enterprises. Indeed,
amongst all of these enterprises, the needs and demands are highly heterogeneous, even for enterprises
in the same size broad size category.

Since many women entrepreneurs operate micro-enterprises, there is a common tendency to diagnose
their needs in a uniform way. Rather than size, effective delivery of services to MSMEs requires
a segmentation based on realistic future trajectories of enterprises. A more useful distinction for
policymakers when categorizing the total population of women entrepreneurs is to distinguish between
the ‘necessity’ entrepreneurs, and the ‘growth-oriented’ entrepreneurs. Broadly speaking, necessity
enterprises are those which have been ‘pushed’ into self-employment, and are running a business as
a forced alternative to formal employment. In contrast, growth-oriented enterprises are those which
have a strong desire and a capacity to grow over time. Across the globe, evidence shows that these two
groups face different challenges and have very different needs.

The terms ‘necessity’ and ‘growth’ should not be equated and are not synonymous with the terms
‘micro’ and ‘small’. Not all micro enterprises are necessity enterprises, and not all small enterprises are
growth enterprises. The data in this study finds that over 90% of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are
micro entrepreneurs, but that amongst these micro entrepreneurs there are both necessity and growth-
oriented segments. Amongst the contingent of small enterprises, there are also a mix of necessity
and growth-oriented entrepreneurs. This fundamental distinction is key to understanding and serving
women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.



II.	 Necessity and Growth-Oriented Entrepreneurs

The majority of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia fall into the category of ‘necessity’ enterprises. These
entrepreneurs often run self-operated, home-based businesses. They often start the enterprise out of
necessity, because they cannot enter the formal labor market. In many cases, they manufacture products
from their homes, such as handicrafts, traditional food, and clothing items or are otherwise concentrated
in the trade and service sectors of the economy (Melissa et al. 2015).

In contrast, growth-oriented women entrepreneurs can be broadly defined as those with the desire and
the  capability to expand their business. Unlike necessity entrepreneurs, who entered business because

female growth entrepreneurs are defined here as those who wish to grow their firms, not only those
                                          Indonesia    East Asia    World
with firms that are already established or growing. Even amongst micro firms, a significant number are
growth-oriented.

Segmenting the population of growth-oriented from amongst the total population women entrepreneurs
is an inherently imperfect exercise, since the definition of growth-oriented is not based on an objective
criterion  such as
 Table: Criteria  ofsize of the
                     Small,     business,
                             Micro         but is instead

III.	Evidence on Necessity Entrepreneurs

While necessity entrepreneurs comprise a large segment of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Indonesia,
in most cases, they are unlikely to grow beyond their existing size, and many will fail. Often, this is because
the entrepreneurs do not have a proclivity to grow, and because existing interventions misdiagnose their
needs.

Global evidence suggests that many microcredit-focused entrepreneurship programs for necessity
entrepreneurs are effective in increasing access to finance, but ineffective in supporting business growth.
A seminal 2013 randomized experiment entitled ‘The Miracle of Microfinance’, found that the impact of
standard group-based microfinance on entrepreneurs in India, which had long been seen as a catalyst
for business growth, was not as transformative as had been thought (Duflo and Banerjee, 2013). In 2015,
a series of six of the most rigorous randomized evaluations on microfinance conducted to date, covering
diverse microfinance interventions in six countries across the globe, all concluded similarly that the actual
impact of microfinance interventions was modest, and had usually been over-stated (Banerjee, Karlan,
Zinman, 2015). These studies found that while microcredit can increase access and smooth incomes for
the poor, loans are usually too small to transform businesses and help them grow.

When it comes to necessity women entrepreneurs, the likelihood of benefiting significantly from
microfinance alone is even slimmer. Evidence suggests that small loans or grants – which are often
the focus of entrepreneurship support programs – may have modest impacts on male clients, but are
usually not sufficient to help necessity female-owned necessity firm to grow for two reasons: sector
concentration and societal pressures (Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014).

The concentration of necessity women entrepreneurs in low-value sectors is a major impediment to their
success. Recent research has suggested that controlling for other factors such as firm size, education,
and business experience, business sector emerges as the most important determinant of earnings
differentials between female and male entrepreneurs (Campos et al, 2013; Alibhai et al, 2015). Women
entrepreneurs across the globe tend to sort into lower-productive business sectors, and are usually
under-represented in more high-growth sectors. Even with capital infusions, women-owned enterprises
in low-growth and low-margin business sectors are unlikely to be able significantly increase revenue in
a manner that will enable them to grow their earnings sustainably.

Capital diversion is another challenge, which reduces the benefit of microfinance to necessity women
entrepreneurs. Numerous studies suggest that poorer women entrepreneurs are more likely than more
established ones to be subject to a ‘kin tax’, where they direct capital intended for their businesses to
family members or community networks. In some studies, women are pressured by spouses and family
members to divert capital away from their businesses (Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez, 2013 in Buvinic and
Furst-Nichols, 2014). In many cases, however, the women entrepreneurs themselves choose to direct
capital to family members or for other immediate needs separate from their business (Fafchamps et al,
2014 in Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014). Small capital infusions may therefore be helpful to necessity
women entrepreneurs in smoothing consumption or supporting household expenditures, but they are
unlikely to help their enterprise to grow or provide long-run benefits.




                                                                                                          19

Business development services and training are also often ineffective for necessity women entrepreneurs,
at least in terms of increasing earnings, helping business survive, or fueling their growth. Evidence of
business training programs in Pakistan (Gine and Mansuri 2014), Peru (Valdivia 2011), and Sri Lanka
(de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2012) find that business training rarely has a measurable effect on
profits or on business survivorship for women micro-enterprise owners. The lack of positive outcomes
is common to both female and male entrepreneurs. However, outcomes of business training are even
poorer from women than for men due to binding external constraints faced by women and not men,
such as presence in lower-margin business sectors, more household duties, and limited mobility.

While capital and traditional business development services do not generally yield tangible impacts
for necessity women entrepreneurs, other interventions do show signs of success. In-kind transfers of
capital, such as purchases of inventory or livestock, have been observed to nudge women to maintain a
focus on their business and not divert the money to family or other non-business uses (Fafchamps et al.
2014 in Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014). Savings products for women entrepreneurs also show positive
impact for poor and necessity entrepreneurs, especially when they protect the privacy of women. When
women have personal savings accounts in which they can save without the knowledge of family or
community, they are more likely to accumulate savings over time. Mobile savings accounts in particular
have shown evidence of enabling women to save privately and inconspicuously, reducing the diversion
of earnings to others.



IV.	Evidence on Growth-Oriented Entrepreneurs

For women entrepreneurs operating larger enterprises, especially those which are growth-oriented, the
situation is remarkably different. Growth-oriented women entrepreneurs are more likely to benefit from
access to finance, especially credit, and are more likely both to grow their businesses and to repay loans
(Klapper and Parker 2011). Although these enterprises may be the most likely to grow, however, they are
often the most capital-starved.

While access to finance for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs is more likely to be successful,
financial institutions often must adapt to meet their needs. A key impediment for growth-oriented women
entrepreneurs is that they are likely to fall into a ‘missing middle trap’, where financial services provided
to poorer women through microfinance institutions, cooperatives, and rural lenders are too small to
meet their needs, but at the same time larger commercial banks do not have tailored or customized
products which are attractive to them.

Global evidence shows that large, individual loans are a critical need for the segment of growth oriented
women entrepreneurs (Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014). Often outreach to growth-oriented women
entrepreneurs can be achieved through upscaling of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) to disburse larger
loans and reach a higher level of the market, or through downscaling of commercial banks, to disburse
smaller loans and reach a lower level of the market. More sophisticated and tailored financial products
such as collateral alternatives and women-tailored insurance products can also be effective and profitable.

With regard to business training, evidence suggests that targeting motivated, self-selected women
entrepreneurs is the key to achieving impact (Xu and Zia, 2012 in Buvinic and Furst Nichols, 2014). While



 20
             WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




business training generally does not have large impacts on increasing profits for women entrepreneurs,
one to one follow up such as coaching and mentoring are often very effective and demanded by women
entrepreneurs. This intensive consultancy support is more cost effective and may work better for larger
women-owned firms who express a clear demand (Buvinic and Furst Nichols, 2014).

two distinct target groups. Generally, very poor and poor women need an intensive package of services
to break out of low-value sectors and pressures from family and community. Interventions targeting
these groups should focus on poverty alleviation. Growth-oriented women entrepreneurs are likely to
reap more benefits from entrepreneurship interventions, and can often expand their businesses when

constraints are lifted. Interventions targeting this group are likely to have economic growth benefits, as
the enterprises grow and contribute more broadly to employment and output.

Evidence from Indonesia tends to reflect the global body of evidence. The lack of targeting has surfaced
as a binding constraint to effectively supporting women entrepreneurs across the country (Tambunan,

I.	 Why target growth-oriented WEs?

Women entrepreneurs are a growing segment globally. Women-owned firms in the United States, for
example, are consistently growing at over twice the rate of male-owned firms (23 percent vs. 9 percent),
while growth in the number of women entrepreneurs in East Asia is 3.6 percent faster than growth in the
number of male entrepreneurs (Accenture, 2015). Cross-country evidence confirms what is also intuitive:
as these enterprises grow, they are employing more women, in greater proportion than men. Growth
oriented women entrepreneurs therefore represent a remarkable dividend opportunity for increasing
women’s employment and enhancing gender equality.

Evidence from other countries suggests that the proportion of growth oriented amongst the total
population of entrepreneurs could total approximately 3% of the total population of women entrepreneurs
(Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014). Our own data, which follows, suggests that the proportion of growth-
oriented entrepreneurs in Indonesia is significantly higher, potentially totaling as many as 15% of the
total population of entrepreneurs.

Based on the experience in Indonesia to date, as well as on global evidence on women entrepreneurs,
this study takes the position that targeted programming for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs
could be highly effective and could yield significant gains on both economic and social indicators.
The absolute number of growth-oriented entrepreneurs in Indonesia should be of less significance for
policymakers than the potential impact of targeting this market segment. The following are some of the
key benefits of addressing the constraints faced by growth-oriented women entrepreneurs:

•	 Economic Impact. Lifting constraints for women-owned enterprises that have the potential to grow
   can yield outsized economic and labor market gains, since these firms constitute a large share of
   employment and GDP in Indonesia. Evidence from other countries illustrates this clearly. As a result
   of women-focused business support programs launched in the United States in the late 1990s,
   women-owned firms in increased from 6% of total employment in 1997 to 13% of total employment
   in 2014, today employing 15.9 Million workers (Womenable, 2015). These women-owned firms have
   also demonstrated more resilience and generated more jobs than male-owned firms following the
   2007 financial crisis (Womenable, 2015).

•	 Female Employment. In addition to being a significant net job creator, growth-oriented women
   enterprises are also very likely to hire more women employees as they grow, helping reduce gender
   inequality in the labor market. Global data from the World Bank’s Enterprises Surveys suggests
   that female-led firms tend to employ more female workers than male firms, after controlling for
   sector, age, and type of firm (Cirera and Qursum, 2014). Evidence from Southeast Asia suggests that
   women-owned SMEs in Indonesia have 45% female employees, while male-owned firms have only
   27%., and that women-owned firms are 16% more likely to hire female workers than male-owned
   firms (Asia Foundation, 2013). As women-owned enterprises grow, they employ more women, often
   even helping necessity entrepreneurs’ shift into the more formalized labor market.

•	 Women’s empowerment. In addition to the clear economic benefits to targeting growth-oriented
   women entrepreneurs, there is also a case to be made from the perspective of women’s empowerment
   writ large. As women entrepreneurs grow and demonstrate increasing levels of success, they are




                                                                                                   23
             WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




   likely to inspire and serve as role models for the next generation of women entrepreneurs. The lack of
   women role models, especially in sectors such as the tech industry, is a major reason why ambitious
   young women do not aspire to careers as entrepreneurs. As constraints are lifted and growth-
   oriented women entrepreneurs in Indonesia realize their full potential, they will create a positive
   image for other women, and likely increase women’s activity in growth-oriented entrepreneurship
   in the future.

The findings from our comprehensive survey of women entrepreneurs, which follows, add deeper insight
into some of the challenges faced by Indonesia’s women entrepreneurs, and into the avenues for best
supporting them.

      The Women Entrepreneurship Development          MFIs; and (ii) helping the MFIs build up a
      Project (WEDP) is a $50 Million International   high quality MSE loan portfolio based on

      entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. The project began
      in 2012.                                        WEDP has made rapid and sustained
                                                      progress since its launch in 2012. The WEDP

      related technical support to participating

      1.	 Exceeding Targets: WEDP’s line of credit was 90% disbursed before the half-way point
          of the project. As of January 2016, the project has provided loans to over 4,000 women
          entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship training to 7,500. It is amongst the World Bank’s
          highest-disbursing and highest-rated projects in the region, and was awarded a Vice
          Presidential Unit (VPU) Award in 2015.

      2.	 Reaching the underserved: WEDP is successfully reaching its target segment of under-
          served women entrepreneurs, who have the desire and potential to grow their businesses.
          76% of WEDP clients have never taken a loan before.

3.	 Catalyzing growth: According to initial survey data, the average WEDP loan has resulted
    in an increase of 24% in annual profits and 17% in net employment for Ethiopian women
    entrepreneurs, one year after taking the loan. These female-owned businesses are
    continuing to grow, as the impacts of capital investments play out. Repayment of loans
    stand at 99.6%.
4.	 Unlocking needed capital: One of WEDP’s objectives was to increase loan sizes, since
    most Ethiopian women-owned enterprises were stuck in a trap where loans offered by
    microfinance were too small to meet their needs. For repeat borrowers, loan sizes have
    increased on average by 870%.
5.	 Improving capacity of lenders: Through the technical assistance component, WEDP
    is building the capacity of Ethiopia’s MFIs to lend to women entrepreneurs. The MFI’s
    improved ability to appraise, resulted in their capacity to reduce the collateral requirements
    from an average of 200% of the value of the loan to 125%. At the same time, WEDP MFIs
    are developing new loan products and recognizing new forms of collateral such as post-
    date cheques and business inventory, to secure loans.

   “With WEDP, the MFIs’ appetite for risk has increased. Previously, they provided loans in
 small amounts of $1000. Now, they are making WEDP loans averaging over $10,000. Plus,
they have taken part in a capacity building program, which helped them assess these larger
loans using cash flow analysis and risk mitigation techniques. So the MFIs are strengthening
  both in terms of loans disbursed as well as in their knowledge of lending” (Beimnet Foto,

Women Entrepreneurs in Indonesia

                                             Key Points

1.	 Women entrepreneurs in Indonesia demonstrate high levels of financial know-how and financial
    literacy, which are not correlated with their level of education. They contribute significantly to
    household income – contributing on average 62% of the income of their households.
2.	 In the households in which they live, women entrepreneurs defy commonly held notions about
    gender dynamics in Indonesia. By and large, women entrepreneurs have equal decision making
    power and are empowered within their households. Spouses are very supportive of their wives
    spending time at the business.
3.	 At the same time, women entrepreneurs have limited access to assets that can secure loans. Women
    report lack of collateral as their top challenge in accessing finance. 88% of women’s households
    possess buildings or land that could be used as collateral, but only 21% of women actually have
    these assets registered in their name.
4.	 Approximately 15% of women entrepreneurs can be classified as growth-oriented. While estimates
    vary, the proportion of growth-oriented entrepreneurs globally is thought to be below 5%, indicating
    significant growth potential in Indonesia.
5.	 Surprisingly, growth-oriented enterprises are just as small, informal, and in the same sectors as
    necessity enterprises. While they look similar, however, the growth-oriented are significantly more
    likely to keep written financial records, are more likely to have business plans, have broader customer
    bases, and have higher profit margins and turnover.

The previous chapter provided a broad understanding of the heterogeneity of women entrepreneurs
in Indonesia, and of the need to target services to meet the needs of differing market segments. The
sections that follow draw on the findings of field research conducted by the World Bank’s Finance and
Markets Global Practice in 2015.

The study combines demand-side and supply-side analyses. Through one of the largest dedicated surveys
of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia to date, the study captures some important characteristics of this
population, as well as the challenges and opportunities they face. Through a comprehensive survey of
financial institutions, business development service providers, and local government, the study examines
the perceptions and challenges of service providers themselves in reaching women entrepreneurs. The
demand-side and supply-side quantitative data are complemented by more in-depth qualitative data
collection with selected financial institutions aimed at discovering some successful initiatives already in
place to support women entrepreneurs.



A.	 Methodology
In total, the study collected data and information from 1,633 women micro and small entrepreneurs, 135
Financial Institutions, 97 Local Government officials, and 112 Business Development Service providers,
and 7 women credit programs in 8 provinces across Indonesia.



I.	 Quantitative

The quantitative data collection consisted of interviews with 1,633 women entrepreneurs and 344 service
providers which include local government, financial institutions, and business development services
providers.1 The entrepreneur survey covered a population of 1,633 women micro and small entrepreneurs
in eight provinces across Indonesia, making it the largest and most comprehensive survey of women
entrepreneurs in Indonesia to date. The survey used multi-stage cluster sampling, and concentrated on
areas and sectors that were likely to yield large numbers of growth-oriented women entrepreneurs. A
detailed description of the sampling is included in the annex to the report.

While the demand-side sample is not nationally representative due to the large absolute number and
wide dispersion of women entrepreneurs across the country, it does provide a good approximation of
urban women entrepreneurs across the country. The data from our study on the general characteristics
of women entrepreneurs also mirrors the basic data about self-employed women which is available
through household surveys done through the Government’s National Socio-Economic Survey
(SUSENAS), and therefore provides a good foundation for understanding the broader population of
women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.




1	        The data collection was undertaken by a local survey firm, Definit, who were selected competitively based
on their previous experience working on large-scale enterprise surveys. Data collection spanned from June –
September 2015. Local authorities were involved at all stages in the sampling and implementation of the research.

The supply side data collection was synchronized with the demand-side data collection, to ensure a focus
on the same population. The supply side exercise targeted 3 to 5 local institutions in each enumeration
area, consisting of Financial Institutions, Local Government and BDS providers. The respondents for
the supply side questionnaire were drawn from the demand-side results and then confirmed with local
government in each enumeration area. The total number of respondents was 344 institutions.

II.	 Qualitative

The qualitative data collection captured lessons learned from supply side actors, namely bank and non-
bank financial institutions that have provided credit programs for female entrepreneurs in Indonesia.
The aim of the qualitative study was to understand the potential and challenges in providing credit
facilities, and to gain insight into the development of financial products which cater specifically for the
needs of female entrepreneurs.

The qualitative data collection consisted of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGD).
Qualitative researchers were equipped with a semi-structured interview (SSI) guide, a manual for
recording field notes, and an outline for a case study report. The study was conducted at the national
and regional/district level, with a sample of 7 financial and non-financial institutions. Priority was given
to institutions which provide financial services for females in the areas where the demand side study was
implemented, and which and have served the female clients for a minimum of 3 years.

Interview respondents were selected using a snowballing technique. Interviews started from management
level staff to understand about the policy, management, and organization; continued to the field level




                                                                                                               29

staff such as marketing, account officer, facilitators to understand about the implementation; and were
complemented with interviews with two or three clients to see how the services have been delivered.

B.	 Profile of Women Entrepreneurs
Existing studies on women entrepreneurs in Indonesia offer limited insight into overall patterns and trends
regarding women entrepreneurs in Indonesia as a whole, due to small sample sizes. The data at hand,
drawing on a sample of 1,633 women entrepreneurs in 8 provinces, helps to illustrate a comprehensive
profile of women-owned micro and small enterprises.

I.	 Personal Characteristics

 a)	 Age, Marriage, and Life Paths

The mean age of women entrepreneurs in our sample is 45 years old and most entrepreneurs (69%)
are above 40 years old. The majority of women entrepreneurs (82%) are married, and a significant
proportion (11%) are widowed. On average, women entrepreneurs have about 14 years of business
experience, and often this has involved running multiple businesses over time.

Most entrepreneurs seem to have engaged in self-employment at the time of or shortly after their
marriage. This paints a picture of most women entrepreneurs as opening a business around the time of
their marriage, attempting multiple businesses over time, and eventually establishing a somewhat stable
enterprise that contributes to their household, though doesn’t seem to grow significantly over time.

households own a building, and 90% own a two-wheeled vehicle. In principle, ownership of these fixed

                                             Usually, homes and vehicles are registered to male family members,
rather than to women. The disparity in 4.9%        ownership of assets between men and women is a global
                               Bachelor
phenomenon, but in this context it is likely one of the barriers which prevents women entrepreneurs
from accessing credit.

sectors where women entrepreneurs are concentrated are manufacturing (24%) and services, such as
hotels and restaurants (13%).

In the manufacturing sector, nearly all of the businesses are small-scale, home-based industries that
produce food, beverages, and textiles. In the trade sector, almost all of the businesses run by women
entrepreneurs are grocery stores. The government and social services sector mostly consists of beauty
salons and tailoring services.

The large majority of women-owned enterprises, 97%, are informal and unregistered. By and large, these
are micro-enterprises operating in the informal sector. Most enterprises are fully woman-owned, with
89% of enterprises reporting that they are the primary business owner, and 94% reporting that they have
the main responsibility in running the business.

III.	Market Segments

 a)	 The Growth Orientation Index

In order to better understand the differing profiles and needs of different market segments, our
study constructed a growth-orientation index using a combination of questions from the demand-
side questionnaire. Numerous previous studies have highlighted the challenges of identifying which
entrepreneurs are growth oriented. A predisposition to growing one’s enterprise is based upon both
ambitions and capacity, so measurement requires an examination of whether an entrepreneur wants to
grow, and whether they have taken actions indicative of growth.

While our definition is far from perfect, it does begin to give an indication of varying ambitions and
entrepreneurial activity amongst women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.3 To construct the index, we looked
at ambitions and perspectives of entrepreneurs with regard to future growth, and then at the actual
actions they had taken in their businesses over the last 12 months. Each respondent was scored based
on their answers to the index of questions, and the scoring system enabled us to segment respondents
into three categories: necessity, stable, and growth-oriented.

The indicators comprising the score were as follows:
•	 “What was the primary reason you started this business?”
•	 “How would you classify this business (growing, decreasing, or remaining the same)?”	
•	 “Does the current state of the business meet your desired goals?”
•	 “Compared to one year ago, has the number of your buyers or customers increased, decreased, or
   stayed the same?”
•	 “In the past 12 months, did you hire any new workers?”
•	 “In the past 12 months, did you develop and new products?”
•	 “In the past 12 months, did you invest in machinery or production methods?”
•	 “In the past 12 months, did you open a new branch or expand your market to a new area?”
•	 “Which of the following forms of promoting your business did you use over the past 12 months (list
   of 9 possible marketing techniques)?”
•	 “Do you plan to do any of the following in the next 12 months (list of 13 possible activities)?”



 b)	 The Segments: Growth-Oriented, Stable, and Necessity
The data reveals that the highest proportion of women entrepreneurs fall into the necessity category, in
line with global evidence. These entrepreneurs generally have little ambition to grow their enterprises,
and therefore demonstrate no action towards growing their enterprise. The second-largest segment fall
into a middle category of ‘stable’ entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs often exhibit some desire to grow
their business, but have not taken concrete actions to do so. The growth-oriented, the smallest segment,
show both a desire to grow, and evidence of having taken action to grow. The breakdown was as follows:


3	       It is also important to note that there are endogenous and interacting relationships amongst the variables
comprising the index, and this imperfect analysis is only an approximation rather than a rigorous construct for
measuring growth orientation.




                                                                                                              39
              WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




•	 47.4% of women are necessity entrepreneurs, who appear to have started their business as a
   means to supplement household income, who report unchanging or declining trends in customer
   base and business growth, and who have taken few actions to expand their business beyond its
   current state.
•	 37.2% are stable entrepreneurs, who mostly began their businesses out of necessity to supplement
   household income, but showed some signs of desire to grow their businesses.
•	 15.4% of entrepreneurs are growth-oriented entrepreneurs, who entered business by identifying
   an opportunity, or by taking advantage of a unique skill or background, and who show consistent
   signs of business growth.

 c)	 Understanding the Segments

There are some important similarities between growth-oriented and non-growth-oriented women
entrepreneurs. Generally, all segments are concentrated in the trade sector, reflecting the large overall
concentration of women in trade. As well, across the growth spectrum, the vast majority of women
entrepreneurs are operating micro-enterprises in the informal sector. While the proportion of registered



 40
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




enterprises and small enterprises is higher amongst the growth-oriented, it still represents a very small
absolute number. Only 3% of the growth-oriented enterprises are registered, and only 13% are non-
micro enterprises. What the classification suggests is that the growth-oriented and the non growth-
oriented do not look significantly different on the surface: they operate in the same sectors and with the
same types of enterprises.

While similar on the surface, the business practices of growth-oriented entrepreneurs differ notably from
those of others. The growth-oriented are significantly more likely to keep written financial records, and
more likely to have business plans, for example. The outreach of their enterprises is also broader, with
customers and suppliers extending across the district, rather than only through their own village. As a
result, turnover is higher, as are profit margins.

In addition to differences in business practices, plans, and profits, growth-oriented also show markedly
different demand for services such as loans and training. This key distinction is one which can help to
inform the way in which entrepreneurship support programs in Indonesia might be targeted in the
future. The sections that follow delve into the varying demands of these segments in more detail.



                             Text Box 3: Supporting Crossovers



    What is the largest determinant of the differences in income between male and female
    entrepreneurs?

    Sector choice.

    Entrepreneurs in traditionally male sectors such as construction, IT, or manufacturing consistently
    out-earn counterparts in female concentrated sectors such as retail trade or services. When
    women enter into the male-dominated sectors, however, their incomes increase dramatically
    and the difference with their male counterparts diminishes.

    In cases such as Indonesia, where there is a very large concentration of female entrepreneurs
    in low-productivity and low-growth sectors, supporting crossovers is likely to be the only way
    to generate significant growth in female-led enterprises. Crossing over in this context refers to
    both entry into different sectors that have higher productivity and within-sector diversification
    into higher value-added activities. This type of intervention needs to be integrated into support
    programs for women entrepreneurs.

    So, why don’t more women enter male-dominated sectors? Two recent studies, in Uganda and
    Ethiopia, add some insights and recommendations.




                                                                                                          41
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




     Campos et al. (2013) suggest in the Uganda case study that cross-over firms out earn non-
     crossover firms, and that the key to entering the male-dominate sectors is for women
     entrepreneurs to have trusted male role models that can inspire and mentor them to enter the
     new sectors. Reaching out to community leaders was also an important strategy for increasing
     the acceptance of women entrepreneurs in society.

     Alibhai et al. (2015) found that in Ethiopia, profits for women-owned firms in crossover sectors
     were double those of firms in non-crossover sectors. However, women often didn’t know about
     the benefits of entering the more lucrative business sectors, and had little information on the
     earnings of peers in these sectors. With awareness, the women entrepreneurs were more likely
     to choose to enter a new sector.

     Two types of programs may be useful in building crossover capabilities: (i) entrepreneurship
     programs that incorporate more technical training and other customized services to facilitate
     this process of activity crossover, and; (ii) project-oriented programs that target specific
     sectors and activities and support links to particular supply chains with business and technical
     training and access to markets. One example of a successful crossover program in Bangladesh
     supported women entrepreneurs’ entry into the clean cook stoves value chain by providing
     access to credit and incorporating other organizations, such as business associations, into the
     program.

     While ‘crossovers’ approaches are very new and the exact avenues for supporting these
     transitions are as yet unclear, their potential impact is substantial, and experimenting with
     crossover interventions could yield significant results.

              Text Box 4: Business Plan Competitions to Identify
                       Growth-Oriented Entrepreneurs

How can we target growth-oriented entrepreneurs? An experiment in Nigeria shows that
a business plan competition can be effective in identifying entrepreneurs with the highest
potential.

The Youth Enterprise With Innovation in Nigeria (YouWiN!) program is a business plan
competition launched by the President of Nigeria in October 2011, aimed at encouraging
innovation and job creation through the creation of new businesses and the expansion of
existing ones.

To be eligible, applicants had to be a Nigerian citizen, age 40 or younger, proposing the
creation or expansion of a business venture in Nigeria. Of the 23,844 applicants, the top 6,000
were selected for a four-day business plan training course. Following the course, the program
selected 1,200 winners to receive business grants averaging $50,000 each.

Making up the group of winners were those with the top 300 scores nationally; the 180 with
the top score in their region; and 720 chosen randomly from a pool of 1,841 semifinalists to
allow a rigorous impact evaluation. The impact evaluation used this randomized experiment to
compare winners with the remaining 1,121 semifinalists as the control group. Three rounds of
follow-up surveys were taken one, two, and three years after the application.

What impact did winning have? For new firms it increased the likelihood of survival over
three years by 37 percentage points and the likelihood of having 10 or more workers by 23
percentage points. For existing firms it increased the likelihood of survival by 20 percentage
points and the likelihood of having 10 or more workers by 21 percentage points. Winning led
to a 23 percent increase in profits for new firms and a 25 percent increase for existing ones
and to more innovation for both groups. The implied real return on capital was 1.5 percent a
month.

By the end of year three the 1,200 winners were estimated to have generated more than 7,000
new jobs. On cost per job-year generated, the program compares favorably with stimulus
programs in the United States and with programs in developing countries to provide vocational
training, busi-ness training, wage subsidies, or small grants to microenterprises.

The results of this evaluation show that a business plan competition can be successful in
identifying entrepreneurs with high potential and that supporting them can lead to significant
results in increasing frim growth and employment.

Section 3: Access to Financial Services

                                            Key Points

1.	 Most financial institutions see women as a profitable segment, but very few institutions recognize
    that they have unique needs, such as alternative collateral requirements. Most financial institutions
    have some form of dedicated product for micro and small enterprises, which they disburse in a
    standardized format to both women and men.
2.	 There is a long history of Grameen-style, group-lending for women entrepreneurs. This serves
    necessity entrepreneurs reasonably well, but is not adequate for the growth-oriented, who need
    loans much larger than the 10 Million Rupiah ceiling of group lending.
3.	 The 15% segment of growth-oriented WEs exhibit the strongest demand for credit by a significant
    margin, and are the least served. These women entrepreneurs need tailored, individual loan products,
    anchored around alternative collateral mechanisms.
4.	 Demand for insurance products is nascent, and women entrepreneurs are heavily uninsured.
    Products such as life insurance, property insurance, and business interruption insurance could serve
    a critical need, especially amongst growth-oriented women entrepreneurs. Tapping into business
    associations and networks to develop women-centric insurance schemes could enable providers to
    offer group rates and bring down premium costs.
5.	 Necessity women entrepreneurs’ show signs of a ‘kin tax’, where their business profits are diverted
    to family expenses. A combination of savings education campaigns and mobile savings accounts

Access to financial services, especially credit, has been frequently cited as a binding constraint for women
entrepreneurs and for MSMEs in Indonesia at large. The World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (2009) identified
access to finance as the top reported challenge of Indonesian firms. Myriad other studies have also
pinpointed access to finance as a critical constraint to growth of firms of all sizes and sectors in Indonesia
(Mahmud and Huda, 2011; Struyk and Haddaway, 2011; Mourourgane, 2012).

According to existing literature, a large proportion of Indonesian women entrepreneurs have a demand
for finance, but are either unable to access it, or are unable to access it in the amounts they require.
The main reasons for this are a lack of proper documentation such as audited financial statements,
high transaction costs in searching for appropriate services, lack of collateral, tedious documentation
requirements, and lack of business networks (Women World Banking, 2016). High interest rates are an
additional deterrent for women entrepreneurs in accessing credit in Indonesia (Asia Foundation, 2014).

Policymakers are well-aware of the challenges, and numerous large and small-scale interventions aimed
at resolving credit constraints for women entrepreneurs have already been implemented. Guarantee
schemes, interest subsidy schemes, and revolving loan funds for MSMEs generally have addressed
some of the key constraints. While impactful, however, these interventions have also been identified as
suffering leakages and inefficiencies, often due to incorrect targeting and poor coordination.4

The section that follows attempts to add insight into the differing needs of the identified segments of
the population of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia, focusing on what specific financial interventions
might offer value and to whom.



A.	 Financial Sector Overview

I.	 Financial Sector Landscape

The financial system in Indonesia is dominated by banks. Of the total formal financial assets in Indonesia,
banks manage about 79%. Other non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) which are registered as credit-
providers in Indonesia are micro-finance institutions, multi-finance institutions, pawnbroker, Venture
Capital Companies, and Infrastructure Finance Companies (OJK, Jan 2016), but even combined these
institutions comprise a small portion of the country’s assets relative to banks.

Credit from the banking sector (commercial and rural banks) to MSMEs in 2015 was IDR830.7 Trillion, or
19% of total credit (BI, 2015). Amongst this, most of the credit was given to medium scale enterprises
which took 47% of total MSME credit. The banking sector has been showing robust growth with a Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 20.4%, a Loan To Deposit Ratio (LDR) at 89.7%, and Non-Performing Loans
(NPLs) at 2.6% in October 2015, much lower than the threshold 5% by OJK.




4	       The evaluation report, “Developing a Synergy in Financing Programs to Promote People’s Economy”
prepared for Ministry of Finance highlights that the major government credit programs (guarantee schemes, interest
rate subsidy schemes, revolving loan funds) “might not have the right target” and have “overlapping targets”.

The broad picture of the financial sector in Indonesia, then, is one which is dominated by commercial
banks, which exhibit health performance and profitability. Despite the large share of MSMEs in the
Indonesian economy, banks direct only a very small proportion of their credit portfolio to MSMEs, and
they shy away from lending to smaller enterprises due to information asymmetries and perceived risk.

Indonesia is currently building a dual credit system where the Financial Services Authority (OJK) will
maintain a credit registry system while at the same time allowing private credit bureaus to operate in the
country. The dual credit reporting system also plans to capture supporting data for credit including from
land registry (National Land Office), vehicle registry (Indonesian National Police), moveable asset registry
(Ministry of Home Affairs), and public services companies (Telecommunication, Electricity, Water, etc).

Under the Trust Fund of Financial Inclusion Support Framework, World Bank Group has been supporting
OJK and BI in the current reform of credit reporting system in Indonesia. A secured transactions registry
which has been developed will allow banks and other financial institutions to register movable collateral
from MSMEs in a common registry, enabling more MSMEs to borrow without relying on traditional
collateral (land or buildings). The system is yet to be adopted by lenders, but holds promise for the
future.

The broad picture is financial sector infrastructure which has only partial coverage, and does not provide
lenders the full confidence they need to lend without traditional forms of collateral. While reforms are
being undertaken, a meaningful entrance of banks into the MSME space will require incentives and
support.



B.	 Supply of Finance

I.	 What Financial Products Are Available?

Financial institutions in Indonesia report significant outreach to women entrepreneurs. However, the
extent to which women are served varies significantly amongst different types of financial institutions. At
the bottom of the pyramid, government programs and non-bank financial institutions (MFIs, Coops, and
Pawn Shops) have strong outreach to women for credit and savings products. Amongst banks, outreach
to women is significantly weaker. Still, banks overwhelmingly view women entrepreneurs as a profitable
market segment, with 67% of banks reporting that the prospect of giving credit to female entrepreneurs
is profitable.

While banks reach fewer women entrepreneurs than non-banks, banks and non-banks alike lack
dedicated facilities for women entrepreneurs. Most financial institutions have some form of dedicated
product for micro and small enterprises, which they often disburse in a standardized format to both
women and men. The lack of targeted, dedicated products is slightly less of an issue of non-banks than
for banks, which rarely if ever offer targeted products for women entrepreneurs.

While banks, the dominant player in the financial sector, are reaching some female borrowers, it will be
difficult for them to meet the growing demand of women entrepreneurs, unless they are able to adapt
their products and services to cater to women.

Most financial institutions reach women through micro credit schemes. Micro credit schemes are usually
operated using the ‘Grameen’ model, where each borrower belongs to a group, and peer pressure within
the group serves as a form of social collateral to secure the loan. For an individual woman entrepreneur,
the maximum amount she can borrow from a micro credit scheme of this nature is 10 Million IDR. The
provision of micro credit access is usually accompanied with a micro saving product, which functions
either as a principal or compulsory savings account. A number of financial institutions and borrowers
alike noted that the group lending schemes are valuable for some women entrepreneurs, but not
appealing for larger or growing entrepreneurs, who require loans larger than 10 Million Rupiah, or who
are ready to graduate from group lending.

              Text Box 5: Examples of Tailored Financial Products
                           for Women Entrepreneurs



As financial institutions begin to recognize the market potential of women entrepreneurs,
new products are emerging to better reach them. Evidence suggests that tailoring products
improves outreach substantially, and can resolve access gaps between women and men.

Insurance: Women entrepreneurs’ business and personal lives are tightly linked - events in
their personal lives such as pregnancy, childbirth, and maternity leave impact on their income-
generating activities. Since they face high demands on their time for household work and
childcare, women face a higher risk of business interruption, and have a greater need for income
protection insurance against personal shocks. Insurance products which provide standard
business interruption protection bundled with protection for a diverse set of women-specific
personal and health needs including maternity, female-specific check-ups, legal protection
(such as refunding legal expenses related to divorce) and assistance at difficult times such as
disability in the case of widowhood can be invaluable in protecting the income-earning ability
of the female policy holder.

Lending: One of the most widely acknowledged constraints faced by women entrepreneurs is
a lack of access to credit due to a lack of collateral. Collateral alternatives targeted to women
entrepreneurs can be a powerful way of expanding outreach to credit-worthy borrowers who
do not possess traditional forms of collateral. Data-driven solutions are beginning to present
feasible, profitable models for financial institutions to tailor to unsecured lending to women
entrepreneurs. Psychometric testing, which involves administering a tablet or mobile-phone-
based multiple choice test to loan applicants to determine credit-worthiness, has shown
significant potential for women borrowers. By classifying uncollateralized women borrowers
into risk buckets, the technology allows a financial institution to predict which borrowers are
likely to default, and which are likely to repay, and to lend with limited or no collateral.

Savings: Family and external pressure influence women’s decision to save. This is especially
the case for poorer women entrepreneurs and necessity entrepreneurs, who are pressured
to divert earnings to the household instead of re-investing them in business. ATM cards and
branch banking tend to be problematic for these women entrepreneurs, since their accounts
and savings behavior become visible to family and to those around them. Mobile money can
provide women with sufficient autonomy and privacy to invest cash in the business rather than
in the extended family. Mobile savings and transaction accounts targeted to micro women
entrepreneurs can therefore be an invaluable product.

II.	 Motivation for Serving Women Entrepreneurs

Despite the limited engagement by banks, and the shortage of tailored products for women
entrepreneurs by banks and non-banks alike, the majority of all financial institutions nonetheless see
women entrepreneurs as a profitable market segment, with whom they want to engage.

Overall, 73% of financial institutions state that the prospect of lending to women entrepreneurs is
very good. The majority of financial institutions find women entrepreneurs to be credit-worthy and
responsible clients, even in comparison to men. For example, 78% of financial institutions agree with the
statement “women micro entrepreneurs are more diligent to save than men micro entrepreneurs”, and
53% believe that, in general, women micro entrepreneurs are actually better at repaying loans than men
micro entrepreneurs.

Profitability alone is not the only reason for reaching out to women entrepreneurs. Through in-depth
interviews with financial institutions, our qualitative work uncovered more insight into the motivations
for serving women entrepreneurs. The main drivers for serving women entrepreneurs were (i) market
potential assumption; (ii) social mission; (iii) perceptions of good character of women entrepreneurs; and
(iv) support from national and international networks. Specific reasons given by financial institutions for
serving women entrepreneurs were as follows:

1.	 Market Potential
     •	 More than 90% MSMEs are micro and small enterprises
     •	 More than 60% micro enterprises are women
     •	 Half of North Sumatera population are women
2.	 Social Mission
     •	 Empowering women means empowering the household
     •	 Empowering women will increase household income
     •	 Empowering women will help improve livelihoods and alleviate poverty
3.	 Women’s Character
     •	 Women debtors are more responsible and punctual than men when repaying the loan
     •	 Women are more easy to be organized as a “group” of borrowers
     •	 Women are more committed to using the loan for livelihood activities
4.	 Networks
     •	 Lesson learned from Grameen bank model for developing the women program
     •	 Local and international network for sharing experiences
     •	 Available funding support for women’s micro program start up

entrepreneurs are provided in the annex of the report.

III.	Limitations in Serving Women Entrepreneurs


Despite strong motivation, financial institutions expressed a number of common limitations that hinder
their ability to serve women entrepreneurs. When we compare statements from financial institutions
with statements from women themselves, we find that some of these hindrances seem to be firmly
grounded in reality, while other seem to be perceptions that may not be entirely accurate.

Many financial institutions, including ASPPUK, MBK, ItQaN, and SBW, observe that women have an
unequal position in their family and society, and that they have less voice in their families and less
ability to make decisions in the household, making it hard for them to run a business successfully. While
some entrepreneurs express this challenge themselves, the quantitative survey data reveals that most
women entrepreneurs do have decision-making capability in their households, and feel empowered in
controlling household finances and disagreeing with their spouses when needed. Similarly, financial
institutions also express that women entrepreneurs have less business education and less knowledge to
make their enterprises grow. The quantitative data suggests that while women entrepreneurs do indeed
have low levels of education, their financial knowledge of how to make basic calculations and how to
understand market forces, is in fact quite high.

The misdiagnoses of women entrepreneurs by financial institutions might be one impediment to
serving women entrepreneurs effectively. Re-considering some commonly held beliefs about women
entrepreneurs might be important for these institutions. In addition, ensuring that women are well
represented in the institutions themselves – as branch staff as well as in management – should help to
develop a closer understanding of the actual needs and challenges of female clients.

While some challenges are rooted in perception of service providers and may be more nuanced in
reality, other challenges are confirmed by financiers and entrepreneurs alike. For example, SBW, ASPPUK,
and KOMIDA find that women business activities mostly have limited start-up capital. This is confirmed
by women entrepreneurs themselves, who report high incidences of resorting to family savings as a
source of start-up capital. ANGIN reports that women business are mostly un-bankable because they
do not have collateral; the lack of collateral is reported as a top challenge by women entrepreneurs
themselves also.

C.	 Demand for Finance
I.	 Varying Access and Demand

A large proportion of women entrepreneurs express a demand for financial services, especially credit,
savings, and insurance. There is a gap between demand and access for all services in all segments,
suggesting strong evidence of a need for financial services. There are significant variations, however, in
demand for services amongst each market segment. Demand for credit and for insurance is strongest
amongst growth-oriented entrepreneurs, but entrepreneurs in every market segment demand savings.

supply-side survey

II.	 Access and Demand for Loans

Women entrepreneurs surveyed have significant unmet financing needs, and this is especially apparent
amongst the growth-oriented. Amongst the growth-oriented, 73% of entrepreneurs stated that they
demand a loan for their business. However, over the past 12 months, only 31% received a loan from
formal financial institutions. Amongst the stable and survival, 68% and 54% of entrepreneurs stated that
they demand for loan for their business while 30% and 20% received loans. The largest demand gap is
amongst the growth-oriented entrepreneurs.

Demand for savings is strong amongst all entrepreneurs, and especially amongst the necessity
entrepreneurs. Growth-oriented entrepreneurs also express a demand for more sophisticated financial
products, namely insurance and money transfers, at a higher rate than other segments.

While demand exists in all segments, there appear to be clear trends, in line with the evidence base
on women entrepreneurs. Growth-oriented women entrepreneurs need large loans to fuel business
expansion, while necessity entrepreneurs are already relatively well served by the wide availability of
microfinance group lending. Growth-oriented entrepreneurs show slightly more demand for niche
financial services, such as insurance and money transfers, likely because they recognize the long-run
benefits to their enterprises. Savings are more of a priority for the stable entrepreneurs, who seem to be
less well served than they could be by formal sources.

While many demand loans, some borrowers reported a disparity between the purpose for which they
applied for the loan, and the actual use of the loan. Many women entrepreneurs (71%) took loans for
working capital, but only a small proportion (47%) indicated that the loans were for working capital
in the loan application, and instead reported they were for various investment purposes. A significant
portion of women entrepreneurs also directed their loans to household expenditures such as childcare,
health, or emergencies. This diversion is concentrated amongst the necessity entrepreneurs, suggesting
that it could be due to the ‘kin tax’ phenomenon, where necessity women entrepreneurs use business
credit for family and household expenditures, or other expenditures.


 a)	 The Loan Applicants: Larger and Younger

In looking at the specific qualities which are associated with the likelihood of applying for a loan from a
bank, several interesting findings emerge. There is a statistically significant difference in the number of
employees, profits, and years of experience of women entrepreneurs who apply for loans, compared to
those who don’t. In general, the loan applicants have businesses that are 30 to 40% larger in employment
and revenue than the non-applicants. At the same time, the applicants tend to be significantly younger
enterprises. These findings confirm the strong demand for credit amongst the most growth-oriented
enterprises.

Interestingly, however, it appears that very few loan applicants at formal financial institutions are rejected
for loans. Amongst 236 respondents who applied for loans, 220 or 93%, were approved and received
                        10%
loans with an average size of 31,500,000 IDR. Additionally, the amount of the loan granted was on
average very close to the 5%amount requested, for those who were approved, with an average of 95% of
the requested amount approved.

What the loan application data suggests is that while few women entrepreneurs apply for loans, the ones
who do, are very likely to receive them. They are also likely to receive them in the amounts requested.
This implies a sort of ‘filtering out’ of applicants, where women entrepreneurs who feel they are not
eligible

                                              2009
not applying for a loan confirms this trend: while some women entrepreneurs do not need a loan or are
afraid to apply for one, there is a sizeable segment of women entrepreneurs who do not apply for loans
because they do not have collateral (19%) or because interest rates are too high (24%).

The data seems to suggest that women entrepreneurs who need finance self-select into two groups:
those who apply for loans and almost always receive them in the amounts requested, and those who
                    Figure 12 Sources of Collatera l Provided, Banks and Non -Banks
do not attempt to apply because they either don’t find the terms attractive or because they do not have
collateral.

 c)	 Reasons for Not Saving

The reasons for not accessing savings and insurance are not dissimilar from the reasons for not accessing
credit. Savings prevalence amongst women entrepreneurs is clearly low. Our survey found that 40% of
women entrepreneurs have a savings accounts in a bank. This figure is very similar to 2009 data from the
World Bank Enterprise surveys which found that 41% of firms with a female top manager had a savings
or checking account, and this figure is especially low compared to global benchmarks.

The main reason that women entrepreneurs do not have savings, according to respondents, is because
they do not have excess funds. However, the detailed profitability analysis of enterprises suggests that
                                    Figure 15 Savings in Banks and Mean Profit Margin
most of the enterprises do have a surplus at the end of each month, after accounting for expenditures.
One possibility to explain this discrepancy is the notion of a ‘kin tax’ suggested in other literature,
                                   Women entrepreneurs who don’t save cite ‘lack of

that for other financial services, with only 12% of respondents currently stating that they need insurance.
On closer inspection, however, there seem to be a large segment of women entrepreneurs who lack
awareness of the benefits of insurance. This finding is in line with a recent in-depth study of the insurance
market for women in Indonesia, which found that “cost, awareness, and a lack of targeted products are

Generally, while the prevalence of health insurance is very high, other types of insurance are not utilized
by women entrepreneurs. Cost of premium seems to be the main reason why women don’t purchase
insurance. At the same time, many women state that they do not understand the benefit of insurance
products. Marketing and awareness raising for women entrepreneurs about the value of non-health
insurance, such as accidence and life insurance, could likely help to increase utilization rates and ensure
that women-owned enterprises are suitably protected.

D.	 Gaps and Recommendations
I.	 Credit

Our data reveals significant unmet demand for credit by women entrepreneurs. Overall access to credit
for MSMEs in Indonesia is lower than regional and global averages. Within this, women entrepreneurs
access credit less than male entrepreneurs in Indonesia. While some women entrepreneurs naturally
self-select out of applying for credit because they don’t need it, or because they are sensitive to the
high price of credit, a sizeable portion of women entrepreneurs demand credit even at prevailing market
rates, but do not make it to the stage of applying for credit. Usually, these applicants ‘filter out’ because
they do not have adequate collateral and know that they will not be eligible for a loan. Sources of
collateral provided by women for loans are predominantly houses or vehicles.




                                                                                                        61
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




The unmet demand for credit is strongest amongst the growth-oriented. Regression analysis shows
similarly that business size is a major factor in determining determine who accesses loans, and that loan
applications are concentrated amongst women entrepreneurs with higher profits and more employees,
as well as amongst relatively younger enterprises. Qualitative analysis with financial institutions similarly
reveals a common challenge: growing women entrepreneurs are not well-served by the limited size of
microfinance loans which cap out at 10,000,000 IDR, and need to be able to access larger loans to fuel
business growth.

Unmet financing needs of women entrepreneurs can best be met by focusing on the needs of the
growth-oriented. These women entrepreneurs need tailored loan products, anchored around alternative
collateral mechanisms. Helping financial institutions to develop innovative collateral alternatives that can
screen in women entrepreneurs on high-growth trajectories with high likelihood of repaying loans could
go a long way in extending credit to credit-worthy women entrepreneurs. While financial institutions
may be slow to adopt novel technologies, public sector support to financial institutions aimed at piloting
and underwriting innovative mechanisms for supporting women entrepreneurs could help them to
move more quickly, and to extend their reach to better serve women entrepreneurs that are likely both
to repay loans and grow their enterprises.



II.	 Savings

Similar to credit, savings rates for women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are both lower than those for
male entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and lower than regional and global benchmarks. Entrepreneurs in all
market segments demand savings, but the demand seems to be most pronounced amongst necessity
entrepreneurs, who state that the reason they don’t save is because they do not have excess funds.
These same entrepreneurs are also very likely to be mixing household and business expenditures.

The finding that women entrepreneurs are not able to set aside business profits in savings accounts is
a finding is in line with the phenomenon of a kin tax by which women entrepreneurs are expected to
channel business earnings back into the household, at the expense of re-investing in their enterprises.
One method to improve the ability of women entrepreneurs to save some portion of their business
earnings is to offer a private and confidential way for them to save. Income less visible to family and
extended networks is income that women entrepreneurs can direct into savings and business investment.
Already, many women entrepreneurs seem to have identified informal mechanisms for savings, and a
majority of entrepreneurs keep money with neighbors, friends, and arisans.

Mobile savings accounts for women entrepreneurs can be an effective mechanism for ensuring
privacy and autonomy in savings behavior. Marketing mobile savings accounts for necessity women
entrepreneurs who seem to be more likely to divert potential savings to household expenditures
could provide the needed privacy and autonomy to increase savings amongst this segment of women
entrepreneurs. Since mobile savings accounts already exist in Indonesia, working with banking agents
to market these to women entrepreneurs could help to increase take-up. Testing various approaches to
mobile savings through piloting and measuring impact could help to shed light on how to better serve
women entrepreneurs in this segment.

III.	Insurance

Although demand for insurance products amongst women entrepreneurs in Indonesia is still nascent,
many women entrepreneurs admit that this is because they don’t have an adequate knowledge or
understanding of how insurance products available on the market actually work. Insurance products
have significant relevance for women entrepreneurs. Lacking insurance, women are likely to use
profits or savings to pay for emergencies, rather than using it for productive uses such as technology
investments or hiring new employees, and this can be a major impediment to growth. Moreover, women
entrepreneurs personal and business lives are closely linked, and women are more likely to face business
interruptions from life events that men will not face, such as pregnancy, childbirth, and maternity leave.

A very low proportion of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia possess insurance other than health
insurance. Other products such as life insurance, property insurance, and business interruption insurance
could serve a critical need, especially amongst growth-oriented women entrepreneurs. While women
entrepreneurs generally do not engage with insurance providers, a very high proportion are engaged
with women entrepreneurship associations and networks. Tapping into these associations and networks
to develop women-centric insurance schemes could also enable providers to offer group rates and
bring down premium costs. Matching insurance brokers with women’s associations could therefore be a
powerful way of expanding much-needed insurance to women entrepreneurs.



                Text Box 6: Supporting Women’s Business Associations


    Business associations are important vehicles for supporting women entrepreneurs in Indonesia.
    Business associations can provide a forum for women entrepreneurs to network with the
    female role models, develop linkages with buyers and suppliers, and access information about
    available services and markets.

    Data suggests that women in Indonesia are 33% more likely to use business associations than
    men and that the women entrepreneurs who interact frequently with associations are also the
    ones who are mostly likely to grow their firms (Asia Foundation, 2014). Indonesian women also
    seem to be more actively engaged in associations than women entrepreneurs in neighboring
    countries.

    Designing relevant, effective supports for women entrepreneurs can therefore be improved by
    working with existing business associations. Two of Indonesia’s leading networks, IWAPI and
    ASSPUK, are outlined below.




                                                                                                     63
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




     IWAPI or Indonesian Women Entrepreneurs Association was founded in 1975 by two
     women entrepreneurs from Palembang, South Sumatra. IWAPI was established as a means
     for Indonesian women entrepreneurs and for women who want to become independent
     entrepreneurs to promote and develop their business. IWAPI aims to connect the Indonesian
     women entrepreneur with a potential market and sources of fund that are ready to help them
     from the financial side.

     To achieve the objectives, there are several engagements that IWAPI provides for its members,
     such as: facilitating trainings for MSMEs; improving access to the sources of financing; providing
     information for members (including market information, price information, exhibitions,
     business opportunities); marketing and promoting business of members.

     IWAPI do not exclusively limits its membership criteria; it is open for all Indonesian women
     entrepreneurs from all business sector and scale. IWAPI currently has 260 branches in 32
     provinces with more than 30,000 women entrepreneurs as its members. The members are of
     85% small and micro businesses, 13% medium enterprises and 2% large enterprises.

     ASSPUK, or Association for Women in Small Business Assistance, was formally established
     as an association in 2001, financed by the British Council. The members of ASPPUK are non-
     governmental organizations that have a concern to develop and empower women micro
     entrepreneurs.

     One of main program of ASSPUK is to facilitate and strengthen its non-government
     organizations (NGOs) members in advocacy, networking, and fundraising which in turn will
     benefit women small-micro entrepreneurs. Another main program is to strengthen women
     small-micro entrepreneurs through facilitation, business assistance, training, and networking
     that are provided by NGOs of ASPPUK members. In addition to that, ASPPUK also initiates the
     establishment of women micro entrepreneurs’ networks at district levels to organize women
     entrepreneurs into groups locally.

     ASPPUK also has a concern to strengthen the access of women small-micro entrepreneurs to
     economic sources, including access to loan/credit. ASPPUK works with financial institutions to
     support to try to design services that can take account of the needs of its women entrepreneur
     members. Today, ASPPUK has 54 NGOs members which have broad networks in 20 provinces
     and 77 districts.

          Text Box 7: How Angel Investors Can Help Startup Firms

Angel investors are generally defined as wealthy individuals who fund early-stage entrepreneurs
and serve as mentors or advisors to help them grow. Globally, angels are on the rise. Angels
are estimated to have deployed $24.1 Billion of capital in 2014, up from $17.6 Billion in 2009.
Over the past five years, investments by angel groups have doubled in Europe and the Unites
States. Angels are often not professional investors, and are uniquely and personally focused
on the firms they back.

A recent publication from the National Bureau of Economic Research studied 13 angel
investment groups in 12 nations — Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany,
Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. They gathered data
on 295 startups funded by these angel groups and 1,287 not funded, and compared similar
firms.

The findings are unambiguous: Firms which are backed by angel investors are more likely to
survive, create more jobs, and have a greater chance of successfully exiting the startup phase
than otherwise comparable firms without this support. Startups that have angel backing are
at least 14 percent more likely to survive for 18 months or more after funding than firms that
do not. Angel-backed firms hire 40 percent more employees, and angel backing increases the
likelihood of successful exit from the startup phase by 10 percent, to 17 percent. In countries
other than the United States, angel-funded firms are also more likely to attract follow-on
financing.

Across nations, firms that attracted a high level of interest among angel investors were more
likely to grow, issue patents, win new rounds of funding, and have a successful exit from the
startup phase.

Indonesia is already ahead of the curve, when it comes to angel investing. The Angel Investment
Network of Indonesia (ANGIN) was first launched in 2013 under the Global Entrepreneurship
Program Indonesia (GEPI). ANGIN was established with the specific goal of addressing the
challenges faced by female entrepreneurs, who in many cases are not bankable and who are
not able to meet the conditions required by formal financial institutions to submit applications
for loans of working capital. This network was established by gathering together 15 female
Indonesian business leaders to form a single investor group, the purpose of which was to
provide funding and facilitation to entry-level female entrepreneurs.

ANGIN funds enterprises in the form of equity and without any requirement for collateral and
imposition of interest. In return, ANGIN receives repayments and a share of profits at the end
of the investment period, or it received a percentage stake in the company after the




                                                                                                   65
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




     investment has commenced. In addition to providing financial capital, ANGIN also provides
     support in terms of capacity building through the provision of mentoring, access to networks,
     and business consultations.

      As of 2014, four female entrepreneurs had received funding from ANGIN, each in the amount
     of 300 Million to 500 Million Rupiah. While still operating at a very small scale, ANGIN has the
     potential to mobilize Indonesia’s nascent angel investor community and bring their support to
     bear in supporting some of the most high-potential but unbanked female-owned enterprises

                                            Key Points

1.	 There is a mis-match between available business development services and participation by women
    entrepreneurs. Only 12% of entrepreneurs have ever utilized BDS.
2.	 Non-users express demand and willingness to pay for business development services, but are often
    unaware of available opportunities. Generally, participants tend to be smaller businesses run by
    older and less educated entrepreneurs.
3.	 For necessity entrepreneurs, competition is a major challenge. Training and skills development which
    can help some women entrepreneurs in low-value and highly competitive sectors transition such
    as food production, beauty salons, and mini grocery stores transition into higher-growth sectors in
    areas such as construction, manufacturing, and technology could be a valuable area of intervention.
4.	 For growth-oriented entrepreneurs, high-quality consulting services including one-to-one
    management consulting, could help catalyze business growth. Engaging business networks in the
    delivery of these services would be critical.

In addition to financial services, high quality business development services can help women-owned
MSEs to improve business practices, connect to broader markets, increase productivity, and ultimately
grow in size and earnings. These services may include, for example, training, counselling and advice,
information provision, technology development and transfer and business linkages.

Despite their intuitive appeal, the existing evidence on business development services (BDS) suggests
that interventions need to be very well thought-out and carefully targeted, since many have been shown
to have little to no impact. The challenge is particularly acute for women entrepreneurs, who are even
less likely than their male counterparts to benefit from business development services due to their
concentration in low-value sectors, and the high transaction cost of providing quality services to them.

Still, the demand for business development services in Indonesia is palpable, with both types of women
entrepreneurs, local government, and private providers expressing a clear need for the provision of high
quality services. The analysis that follows aims to assess the specific market segments in which business
development services might be best targeted, and the specific types of interventions which seem likely
to benefit them most.



A.	 Supply of Business Development Services
Strong government support for MSMEs and entrepreneurs in Indonesia over the past few decades has
enabled a number of business development service providers to grow and evolve. The majority of BDS
providers in Indonesia receive some sort of public support, and the BDS market is largely subsidized by
government and donor institutions, although many BDS providers also collect nominal service fees from
clients. While the transition to a market-oriented BDS sector is a more optimal long-term arrangement,
public subsidies are not uncommon for early-stage BDS markets, and are an indication of a proactive
government approach to supporting MSMEs.

Our supply-side data consists of surveys with 112 BDS providers across the country. Amongst these BDS
providers, outreach to women entrepreneurs is very strong. 70% of all beneficiaries of BDS are female,
and 30% are male. In terms of actual services offered to women entrepreneurs, the menu is diverse.
BDS providers offer a wide range of supports to women entrepreneurs, and most BDS providers offer
a combination of training, consulting, mentoring/counselling, networking, and even facilitating access
to finance. The most commonly provided form of BDS are consultation services and training, which are
offered by 43% and 41% of total 112 BDS providers from the surveys. Some BDS providers (24%) also
provide loans from internal sources of funds directly to women entrepreneurs. From the perspective of
BDS providers, the market outlook for BDS provision in Indonesia is healthy. 60% of BDS providers felt
that women entrepreneurs are willing to pay for BDS services.

While outreach to women entrepreneurs is strong and the menu of services provided is sufficiently
diverse, most providers do not feel that women entrepreneurs require a specific product or approach,
distinct from other MSMEs. 86% of BDS providers feel that the challenges in running the business faced
by women micro-entrepreneurs are the same as the challenges faced by MSMEs generally, and 91% feel
that the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in accessing loans are the same as the challenges
faced by MSMEs generally.




                                                                                                    69

The specific offerings of BDS providers within training, mentorship, and consulting to women-owned
enterprises are rarely tailored for women, and are mostly focused around technical skill areas. Few if
any providers indicated the presence of gender-sensitive business development service content, such as
sessions on gender discrimination, dealing with harassment, managing male employees or negotiating
with male suppliers. There is, then, significant room for improvement in incorporating more gender-
sensitive and women-targeted BDS.

                                   sample of women entrepreneurs had ever received any business development
Overall, only 12% of our fullEntrepreneurship
services. In most cases,        these entrepreneurs participated in a business or entrepreneurship training

                                       Accounting
reflection of low demand. The majority of entrepreneurs who participated in BDS in the past felt that the
services helped them     to run

Considering the high level of satisfaction with BDS amongst those who participate, it is difficult to
understand why many women do not participate. The picture that emerges is that many women are not
aware of the opportunities for BDS. 46% of women who didn’t participate in training said that the reason
they didn’t participate was only because they didn’t know about the existence of a business training
program. However, the reasons for not attending vary amongst the growth-oriented and necessity
entrepreneurs.

Indeed, while participation is low, data suggests a significant unmet demand for business development
services amongst women entrepreneurs. Most women entrepreneurs who participated in business
training paid a small fee for participation, on averaging amounting to 288,000 IDR. While the fee paid
was often only nominal and likely only covered a small portion of the actual delivery cost, it is indicative
of healthy demand and willingness to pay for BDS. There are many women entrepreneurs who express
a demand for improving their business skills, and even a willingness to pay for BDS, but who have not

What the data suggests, then, is that BDS participants are primarily the less growth-oriented women
entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs may be the ones participating because they are the most likely to
be targeted by service providers, which from qualitative data are often focused on poverty alleviation
and on targeting the most vulnerable. The section that follows unearths why this trend of BDS focused
on the more vulnerable women entrepreneurs is a problematic one.



III.	Impact of BDS on Enterprises

Global evidence suggests that the impact of business training, on necessity women entrepreneurs
is limited (Campbell et al 2015, Buvinic 2015). The data from our study on women entrepreneurs in
Indonesia supports this trend. If there was an impact of business training on participants, we might
expect to see a change in some forms of business knowledge or business practices amongst the BDS
participants, compared to similar participants who had not participated in BDS.

We conducted a simple regression analysis, controlling for the main factors that might influence a
participant’s business knowledge. When controlling for education level, years of experience, and business
size, we found no statistically significant difference in the percentage of correct answers to series of
business knowledge questions for participants and non-participants in business training. We also did not

find evidence of any impact of participation in business training on outcomes such as keeping written
financial records, or existence of a business plan.

Without time series and control group data, our analysis is only partial and we cannot make strong
conclusions about the impact of business training on the Indonesian women entrepreneurs who
participated. However, our cursory analysis indicates that there is not a strong relationship between BDS
participation and some of the outcomes of interest that a policymaker would normally expect a business
development service to impact upon. The regression results are presented in the annex.

C.	 Gaps and Recommendations

I.	 Tailored BDS for Women Entrepreneurs

Women entrepreneurs ostensibly face some obstacles in running their businesses that men do not. For
many entrepreneurs, for example, a top reported challenge they face is how to balance their duties in
the home and those in their business. Despite the need for BDS tailored to women entrepreneurs, very
few BDS providers tailor their services for women entrepreneurs. Female trainers, curricula with example
of female businesses and business sectors, flexible hours to accommodate mothers and provision of
childcare services at training sites are some examples. Working with BDS providers to incorporate ‘soft-
skills’ and women-focused BDS which can help overcome women-specific needs and challenges should
be a direction for future support. An additional concern commonly stated by women entrepreneurs
is that there is too much competition. BDS which can help some women entrepreneurs in low-value
and highly competitive sectors transition into higher-growth areas could be another valuable area of
intervention.




                                                                                                    75

II.	 Individualized Support: Consulting, Incubators, Mentorship for the Growth-
     Oriented

The existing BDS available has been accessed by only a small proportion of women entrepreneurs, who
tend to be less educated and have smaller businesses. More impact might be achieved by targeting
those women entrepreneurs who are on an existing growth trajectory. These entrepreneurs are not likely
to participate in lengthy trainings, but might benefit form one-to-one consulting or mentorship services,
that can help them with specific challenges such as expanding into new markets, improving business
practices, and connecting to global value chains. Women’s business incubators can be especially effective
for women entrepreneurs, as a place where they can come together for peer-to-peer learning through
mentorship and networking.



III.	Involving Business Associations

The important role of business networks also emerges in the literature about women entrepreneurs in
Indonesia. Women in fact tend to utilize business networks and associations in Indonesia more than their
male counterparts. Women entrepreneurs tend to utilize these networks to share operational challenges
and seek support in resolving them. Leveraging existing networks and trusted their relationships with
women entrepreneurs is therefore a good pathway for both marketing and delivering new services for
women entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Growth-oriented women entrepreneurs are highly engaged with
women’s business and entrepreneurship associations.

           Conclusion and
          Policy Implication




                                                                              77
Conclusion and Policy
Implication

This study attempted to make the case for segmenting the market of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia,
in order to better target future interventions. The underlying thread and key premise of the study is
the need for different services for different segments of women entrepreneurs, based on their growth
trajectories.

The study builds on experience of the World Bank’s Finance & Markets Global practice in designing
interventions to finance and support high-potential women entrepreneurs around the world. The
recommendations that follow therefore focus in on specific interventions to reach the growth-oriented
segment. At the same time, our analysis also touches upon broad recommendations for supporting
Indonesia’s necessity entrepreneurs, who comprise a large share of the overall population of women
entrepreneurs.


Targeting
      Key Finding: Programs targeting entrepreneurs and women entrepreneurs in Indonesia in the
      past have often yielded sub-optimal results because of their inability to target the right firms
      (Tambunan, 2010). Often, programs and policies are designed to serve all women entrepreneurs
      with a standardized intervention, or are simply targeted at ‘micro’ or ‘small’ firms. Evidence globally
      suggests that segmenting the market of women entrepreneurs into distinct categories can help to
      better meet individual needs (World Bank, 2014). Our findings suggest that approximately 15% of
      women entrepreneurs can be classified as ‘growth-oriented’, and that this segment has very distinct
      and unmet needs.

      Recommendation: Interventions need to be targeted based on growth ambition, not based on
      whether an enterprise is micro or small. Most women entrepreneurs in Indonesia operate micro-
      enterprises, but amongst these there is a sizeable proportion of growth-oriented. Experiences
      targeting growth-oriented entrepreneurs in other countries can be utilized to model interventions.

  Once appropriate interventions for the growth-oriented are designed, there are several ways to
  target the right participants:
   i.)	 New Criteria: Instead of firm size, use criteria such as evidence of revenue growth and existence
          of financial records as entry conditions for programs.
   ii.)	 Panels: Establish expert interview panels, comprised of distinguished women entrepreneurs
          and leaders, to screen entrepreneurs for their ambition and ability to grow.
   iii.)	 Competitions: Support business plan competitions for women entrepreneurs, to attract the
          highest-potential ideas and firms
   iv.)	 Business Associations: Use women’s business associations, such as IWAPI, for both marketing
          and delivering new services for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs.



Increasing Shared Prosperity by Reaching the ‘Growth-
Oriented’ Segment

  1.	 Tailor Credit Products

  Key Finding: The greatest unmet demand for credit amongst Indonesian women entrepreneurs
  comes from the growth-oriented segment. These borrowers are unlikely to benefit or be sufficiently
  served by existing group lending schemes, which are prevalent throughout the country. The growth-
  oriented have financing needs that are significantly greater than the 10 Million Rupiah group loan
  ceiling, and the frequent and mandatory group meetings which are useful for less experienced
  entrepreneurs present a significant opportunity cost to them.

  Recommendation: Interventions need to increase access to finance for the ‘missing target’ of
  women entrepreneurs who are growth-oriented and do not benefit from group lending schemes
  but cannot access commercial banks. This should involve developing tailored credit products for
  women entrepreneurs, with loan sizes ranging from approximately 50 Million to 500 Million Rupiah.
  Lessons can be drawn from successful projects targeting growth-oriented women entrepreneurs in
  other countries (Text Box 1). Specifically, tailored credit products could include:
  i.)	 Individual Loans: Helping MFIs and small lenders focused on group lending ‘upscale’ to
         provide larger, individual loans to women entrepreneurs, or helping larger financial institutions
         ‘downscale’ to reach this segment.
  ii.)	 Movable Collateral: Supporting introduction of movable collateral, including equipment,
         accounts receivable, inventory and intellectual property rights – rather than only against fixed
         assets such as buildings or land, which most women do not have.
  iii.)	 Women-owned Assets: Broadening asset collateral to include items such as jewelry or gold,
         likely to be owned by women. Although these assets might not by themselves secure a loan,
         they could be used in combination with other appraisal and securitization.
  iv.)	 Data Innovations: Introducing data-driven appraisal techniques, such as tablet- based
         psychometric testing, which can utilize large pools of data to predict the likelihood of default
         and enable lending without traditional collateral.

             WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




     2.	 Help Lenders Enter the Women’s Market

     Key Finding: 76% of financial institutions surveyed see women entrepreneurs as a profitable market
     segment, but less than 3% have dedicated products or strategies to serve women. At the same time,
     growth-oriented women entrepreneurs express strong unmet demand for credit, even at prevailing
     market interest rates. Financial institutions can reach these borrowers profitably, but will need added
     incentives to accelerate their outreach and product development.

     Recommendation: Technical assistance for selected financial institutions can help them to develop
     women-tailored credit products, and lines of credit or credit guarantee schemes can incentivize
     actual lending and mitigate risk, until financial institutions develop commercially viable products.
     A two-step process could involve (i) a high-quality technical assistance program with five to ten
     selected institutions to develop strategies and financial products for women entrepreneurs, followed
     by (ii) an attractive line of credit offered through a wholesaling operation, or a credit guarantee
     scheme to mitigate risk. Initial under-writing of this nature could catalyze the launch and roll-out of
     the new products, and could be drawn down over an agreed timeframe.



     3.	 Stimulate Women’s Insurance Market

     Key Finding: Very few women entrepreneurs in Indonesia possess insurance, due mainly to high
     cost and lack of awareness, and absence of targeted products. Lacking insurance, women utilize
     business profits to pay for emergencies, rather than directing these earnings back into productive
     uses such as technology investments or hiring new employees, limiting their growth. Moreover,
     women entrepreneurs personal and business lives are closely linked, and women are more likely to
     face business interruptions from life events that men will not face, such as pregnancy, childbirth, and
     maternity leave.

     Recommendation: There is a need to accelerate outreach of insurance products for women
     entrepreneurs, especially life insurance, property insurance, and business interruption insurance.
     Working with insurance providers to develop women-tailored products and partnering with women’s
     business associations to bring down premiums through group plans would make insurance products
     more appealing to women entrepreneurs. Packaging insurance with other products, for example
     through additional loan fees which could cover insurance premiums, would enable women to own
     insurance without having to purchase it directly as shown in the selected qualitative studies.



     4.	 Explore Equity Investing and Angel Investing

     Key Finding: Angel investors can provide equity to high-potential but unbanked women
     entrepreneurs. This is already happening on a small-scale in Indonesia, with small networks such
     as ANGIN starting to direct private funds to MSMEs in exchange for equity stakes and a share of
     recurring profits. While promising, the market for equity investment in MSMEs in Indonesia is still
     nascent. Growing it could be a source of tremendous opportunity in the coming years.




80
         WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




 Recommendation: Explore providing liquidity and incentives to existing angel investors and equity
 investors to target high-potential women entrepreneurs. This could involve providing capital
 infusions for lending to women entrepreneurs, or providing partial risk mitigations to encourage
 broader outreach. Adapting regulations to make equity investment simpler for investors, networks,
 and MSMEs themselves could compound these investments, and catalyze the growth of the equity
 investment market.



 5.	 Support Individualized Business Consulting

 Key Finding: The main type of BDS on offer is business training courses. These are often supply-
 driven, and participants are likely to be smaller, older, and less educated than the average. Growth-
 oriented entrepreneurs shy away from these business trainings, but might benefit from one-to-one
 consulting or mentorship services, that can help them with specific challenges such as expanding
 into new markets, improving business practices, and connecting to global value chains.

 Recommendation: Explore support for intensive business consulting models for a smaller sub-set of
 women entrepreneurs. Since there are already a number of incubators and personalized coaching
 and consulting firms on the market, a matching grants scheme could add value. Growth-oriented
 entrepreneurs could be screened and given the opportunity to apply for grants that would cover
 a portion of the costs for their businesses to obtain consulting or technical services from private
 providers of their choice. Mentoring and support between women entrepreneurs could also be
 impactful. Creating and facilitating a network of high-potential women entrepreneurs to meet,
 exchange knowledge, and form partnerships could help them improve business activities and
 expand to new markets.




Eliminating Extreme                           Poverty by Supporting the
‘Necessity’ Segment

 1.	 Support Cross-overs into Male-Dominated Sectors

 Key Finding: Women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are concentrated in low-value sectors, in particular
 trade and service. These entrepreneurs state that intensive competition is the biggest challenge they
 face. Male entrepreneurs out-earn women entrepreneurs by a significant margin. Global evidence
 suggests that when women enter the male-dominated sectors, earning differentials diminish
 significantly. Usually women entrepreneurs are not aware of the potentially lucrative opportunities
 from transitioning into male-dominated sectors.

 Recommendation: Supporting women to get into male-dominated sectors over time can help to
 reduce the persistent inequality between earnings of male and female entrepreneurs. This can
 be done through entrepreneurship programs that incorporate more technical training in male-




                                                                                                 81
             WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




     dominated sectors such as mechanics or carpentry and other customized services to facilitate this
     process of crossover; or through grants and intensive support to lower entry costs of women into
     profitable male-dominated sectors. Education from an early age and role models that can raise
     awareness of the benefits of working in different sectors can also be effective.



     2.	 Pilot and Test Mobile Savings

     Key Finding: Over 80% of women entrepreneurs run profitable enterprises, with average monthly
     profits of about 2.5 Million Rupiah, and profit margins of 20% to 30%. However, very few women
     entrepreneurs have a savings account. Unlike male entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs face an
     expectation of diverting business profits for household expenditures. Women do set aside some
     portion of their funds, by saving with arisans or with friends outside their household. Global evidence
     shows that mobile savings accounts are particularly beneficial for women entrepreneurs, since they
     allow for more privacy and address time use, mobility, and safety constraints faced by women in
     visiting banks.

     Recommendation: Products which enable women to save and transact privately and inconspicuously
     may help them to set aside a greater portion of their earnings. Working with financial institutions as
     well as telecom providers to identify and provide seed support for developing or rolling out basic
     mobile savings accounts that can be marketed to women entrepreneurs would be one way to do
     this. Testing various approaches to mobile savings through impact evaluations can shed light on
     how to better serve women entrepreneurs in this segment.



     3.	 Provide more women-targeted Business Development Services

     Key Finding: While outreach to women entrepreneurs is strong and the menu of services provided
     is sufficiently diverse, most providers of business development services do not feel that women
     entrepreneurs require a specific product or approach, distinct from other MSMEs. Training and
     support to women-owned enterprises is rarely tailored for women, with very few providers indicating
     the presence of gender-sensitive business development service content, or approaches such as flex-
     hours or on-site childcare facilities proven to attract women.

     Recommendation: Improve the supply of more-gender sensitive and women- targeted business
     development services. Training modules on gender discrimination, dealing with harassment,
     managing male employees or negotiating with male suppliers can strengthen the value and benefit
     of training or consulting for women entrepreneurs. Rather than standalone provisions, these can be
     packaged with other business development services. Provision of free childcare services and flexible
     schedules can help meet the needs of women entrepreneurs who are already juggling business and
     household responsibilities. Moreover, business development services have an important role to play
     in linking credit-worthy women entrepreneurs with appropriate financial institutions in order to
     resolve information asymmetries and facilitate women's access to capital.

4.	 Test Adaptations to Existing Interventions

Key Finding: Existing interventions targeting necessity women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, including
large-scale programs such as PNPM can be adapted to improve the likelihood of benefiting them. A
worthwhile investment would be to explore ways to improve delivery of the 10 Trillion IDR in PNPM
Revolving Loan Funds transferred to women in urban and rural areas. Reviews of the PNPM program
have found that the women-targeted savings and loans program is ‘rarely managing to change the
overall economy of the family’ and that ‘activities are very small scale and enabled women to invest
in very low return activities’ (World Bank, 2014). Providing loans to necessity women entrepreneurs
without changing the economy of the family is destined to produce sub-optimal results.

Recommendation: There are complex political economies at play, but testing new approaches
could yield new learnings and improve effectiveness. These could include converting revolving loan
funds activities in poverty alleviation project such as PNPM into grants to be transferred to women
entrepreneurs on the condition that they open a savings account; testing in-kind capital transfers
to minimize the diversion of capital from women’s businesses to their households (kin tax); piloting
approaches to engage men and alter business sector decisions or household labor allocations;
providing assistantship for market access; and training for business skills such as financial literacy
and management, product development etc. Rigorous measurement of differential benefits and
impacts for male and female entrepreneurs within existing programs would also help to maximize
effectiveness for women entrepreneurs within these large-scale projects.

Sampling Methodology


A.	 Survey Area
The survey on “Empowering Women Micro-Entrepreneurs in Indonesia” was conducted in eight provinces
in Indonesia; i.e. 1) North Sumatera; 2) West Sumatera; 3) West Java; 4) Central Java; 5) Yogyakarta; 6)
East Java; 7) Bali; and 8) South Sulawesi. The survey was conducted in 16 districts (kabupaten/kota), and
in each district the survey was conducted in three sub-districts (kecamatan). In each district, the survey
was conducted in one village. In total, the survey was conducted in 48 villages, where 38 villages (80
percent) were urban areas and 10 villages (20 percent) were rural areas.
The selection of sample areas was explained in detail as follows:

1.	 The selection process of sample provinces was conducted according to some factors of consideration
    as follows:
     i.)	 The selection of provinces was based on the distribution of the number of women micro-
           entrepreneurs in Indonesia, according to the data of National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS)
           2013 that showed that 57 percent of women micro-entrepreneurs were located in Java and 43
           percent were located outside Java.
     ii.)	 The selection of provinces also considered the provinces that had MSMEs with high prospect
           of growth.

3.	 After that, the districts that were selected as the samples in each selected province were those with
    relatively high Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), the level of population density, and the
    ratio of the number of women entrepreneurs to population in the relevant provinces. The selected
    districts in general were the capital of the provincial and/or the outskirts.

4.	 In each selected district, there were three selected sub-districts that had the prospective development
    of micro-enterprises run by women.

5.	 In each selected sub-district, the selected village was that with prospective development of micro-
    enterprises run by women. The selection of the surveyed village was conducted by maintaining the
    proportion between urban and rural areas that had been mentioned before. The categorization of
    village as urban and rural areas was based on the data of PODES 2011.

The areas of survey were presented in detail in Table 22.

B.	 The Sample of Survey
This study consisted of two types of survey, i.e. the demand-side survey and the supply-side one. The
demand-side survey focused on the mapping of business condition of women micro entrepreneurs,
business development service (BDS) that were needed, and the obstacles encountered to develop their
business. Meanwhile, the supply-side survey mapped the role of various institutions in supporting women
micro-entrepreneurs and their potential in providing business development service (BDS) to women
micro entrepreneurs in the areas where the businesses were operated. In this regard, the respondents
of the demand-side survey were different from the respondents of the supply-side one (see Figure 1).

I.	 Sample of Demand side Survey

The respondents of the demand side survey were women who were 18 - 60 years old and had/run the
business in small and micro scale. The definition of the micro and small enterprises in this survey referred
to the definition of Statistics Indonesia, i.e. the business that has 0-19 employees and furthermore the
women had the right of ownership of the business. For each surveyed village, there were 32 respondents
that were targeted in the demand-side survey.



II.	 Sample of Supply side Survey

The list of the potential respondents of the supply side survey was based on the information that was
given by the respondents of the demand side survey. The list of the potential respondents of the supply
side survey consisted the name of institutions that provided the services to the respondents of demand
side survey, either in the form of financial or non-financial services, either they charged fees or not.
The institutions that provided the services ranged from banks, non-bank financial institutions, local
government, BDS providers, or individuals.




                                                                                                                   91

In addition to the data that were obtained from the respondents of the demand side survey, there were
additional data of financial service providers to MSMEs that were obtained from the local government,
financial institutions, and BDS providers in the survey areas, where the demand side survey was conducted.

The additional sampling process was carried out as follows:

1.	 The survey team visited the local government to obtain the additional information of the potential
    respondents in related village.
2.	 The information that was asked covered the profile of the institutions (name, address, phone
    number), contact person, the business scale of the institution, the type of service.
3.	 If the appropriate additional respondents were found, they would be added into potential respondent
    list then the survey team verified and recommended the relevant potential respondents.
4.	 The survey team wrote the priority of visit of each recommended potential respondent.
5.	 Verification and selection of the additional potential respondents according to two factors:
          a.	 Prioritize the formal institution than the informal institution.
          b.	 Prioritize the potential respondents that had wider outreach.
6.	 The selection result and the priority level of the respondents were given to the survey team.

The respondents of the supply-side survey consisted of three types of respondents, i.e. local government,
financial institutions, and BDS providers.

1.	 The category of local government was represented by village government, district government, and
    district government (Local Office of Social Affair, Local Office of Industry, Trade, and Cooperatives,
    and MSME Agency (Disperindagkop).
2.	 The category of financial institution was represented by commercial bank, BPR, cooperation, BMT,
    pawnshop, and other financial institutions.
3.	 The category of BDS providers was represented by the local government units that dealt with MSMEs,
    Businessmen Association, Communication Forum, bank units that were related to the development
    of MSMEs, foundations, and individuals.

The respondents of the supply-side survey were located within the range of 10 km from the respondents
of the demand-side one, either in the same village or in the different village from the demand-side survey.
In each surveyed village, the targeted samples of the supply-side survey were three to five respondents,
with minimum one respondent of each category of respondents. The number of respondents of the
demand-side survey or the supply-side one is presented in Table 2.

ANNEX C
Summary of Selected Case Studies:
Examples of Seven Financial Institutions with Special Credit
Program for Women Entrepreneurs in Indonesia

I.	 Angel Investment Network (ANGIN) Indonesia

Founded in 2013, ANGIN Indonesia was the first official investor network to be established in Indonesia
under the Global Entrepreneurship Program Indonesia (GEPI), with the United States Department of State
providing support for the establishment of GEPI as a means to promote and develop entrepreneurship
to foster economic development in developing nations. ANGIN was established with the specific goal of
addressing the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs, who in many cases are not bankable because
they are not able to meet the conditions applied by formal financial institutions for loans of working
capital. This network was established by 15 Indonesian women business leaders who formed an investor
group to provide funding and facilitation to early-stage women entrepreneurs.

By 2014, four women entrepreneurs had received funding from ANGIN, with the total value of funding
amounting to 2.2 Billion IDR. ANGIN hoped that, by the end of the investment period, the supported
entrepreneurs would achieve autonomy and would qualify to receive funding from other sources in
order to further develop their businesses.

ANGIN provided funding only to entrepreneurs with existing businesses in the initial stage of development,
with the value of the provided funding ranging from 300 Million to 500 Million IDR, according to the
need of the business, with funding provided in the form of equity. Participating entrepreneurs could
then make further requests for financing on the basis of the needs of their developing businesses. The
scheme did not require collateral or specific documents as a precondition to apply for financing. The
timeframe for the investments ranged from three to five years. The financing could be utilized for the
purpose of business expansion, for operational needs, and/or for the purchase of business equipment.
In addition to providing capital assistance, ANGIN also provided capacity building and other support,
including mentoring; expanded access to business networks; expanded access to both domestic and
foreign markets through participation in trade fairs; and assistance with the acquisition of business
permits.



II.	 Association for Women in Small Business (ASPPUK)

The Association for Women in Small Business Assistance (Asosiasi Pendamping Perempuan Usaha Kecil,
ASPPUK) is a networking organisation established on an understanding that the majority of micro-
entrepreneurs in Indonesia are women. Through its vision and mission, ASPPUK aims to empower
Indonesian women micro-entrepreneurs to enable them to gain access to and control over economic
resources. To achieve this goal, ASPPUK has established networks of female entrepreneurs at the district
level. In turn, these networks establish groups of women entrepreneurs at the village level and links them
to financial institutions to enable them to access capital.




                                                                                                     97
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




ASPPUK provides financing that is intended to meet the specific needs of women. Women make deposits
and loan repayments in cash at monthly meetings or to managers who visit members of groups in
their homes, with the system of home collection suiting women who are busy with domestic duties or
who operate their businesses from their homes. ASPPUK has established two credit schemes, one of
which is intended to enable women to establish or expand their business, and the other to meet their
specific personal or family needs, such as to meet the educational needs of their children. In addition to
providing financing, the organisation also assists members with the procurement of raw materials; the
arrangement of marketing activities; and with training to enable women to manage the financial aspects
of their businesses.

The most significant challenge faced by ASPPUK is in facilitating loans involving large sums. With the
ceiling for loans at less than 10 Million IDR, the loans provided by ASPPUK are often insufficient in value
to meet the needs of women with expanding businesses. In the future, ASPPUK hopes to be able to
increase the value of the capital within its network through the establishment of a multi-level cooperative
structure, involving loans and savings groups at the village level as the primary cooperative, with these
primary cooperatives depositing the capital with financial institutions established at the district level and
serving as secondary cooperatives.



III.	PT. Bank Pembangunan Daerah Sumatera Utara - Kredit Permaisuri
     Program

Kredit Permaisuri is a product offered by Bank Sumut specifically to meet the needs of women.
Initially, this credit product was developed in cooperation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to
assist survivors of the earthquake in Aceh and Nias. After the cooperative arrangement with the ADB
ended, Bank Sumut continued to offer the product. It took the decision to maintain the product both as
a manifestation of its commitment to the development of micro and small enterprises owned by women
and because the Grameen methodology that the product utilizes has been demonstrated to have a
significant positive impact on improving incomes and welfare, and thus supports the achievement of
Bank Sumut’s vision.

The Kredit Permaisuri program requires applicants to be women either operating a small business or
intending to establish such a business; to be married or at least 21 years of age; and to be a permanent
resident in an area where a branch office of the bank is located. In addition, in lieu of collateral, the Kredit
Permaisuri program requires applicants to be members of a group, with the solidarity lending (tanggung
renteng) system applying. There are a number of mandatory steps in the establishment of such groups,
including area identification, market scanning, social and credit investigation (SOCI), compulsory micro-
finance group training, group identification testing, and a number of others. These steps are required
to ensure that data is reliable and that members are of good character, as a means of reducing the risk
of failure to repay loans. Another condition is that the group must have a joint saving account with a
minimum balance to a value of at least 10 percent of the current loan ceiling and that the individual
borrower must have her own account, with these requirements intended to prevent situations where
borrowers are unable to meet their obligations to repay the loans. All participants in the Kredit Permaisuri
program are covered by insurance and provided with the opportunity to graduate to participation in the
Sumut Sejahtera (SS II) credit program, which offers loans to a maximum value of 50 Million IDR.

A number of policies are under consideration to further develop the Kredit Permaisuri program, including
the targeting of women operators of businesses in the community; increases in the loan ceiling from
5 Million to 10 Million IDR; and the formal reading of the members’ pact and prayers at meetings as a
means of building good character and preventing risks associated with moral hazard.



IV.	Sharia Cooperative BMT ItQan

The Sharia Cooperative BMT ItQan (BMT ItQan) is a syariah-based cooperative located in Bandung. To
provide financing to its members, this cooperative utilizes the Grameen group-lending system, which
the founders believe provides an appropriate model to improve the socio-economic circumstances of
the community the cooperative serves and to fulfill its vision of providing syariah-based micro-credit
services to a large number of low income households. BMT ItQan focuses on providing services to
women because of the critically important role women play in managing household finances; because
women are believed to be more conscientious about repaying debts; and because women are more
inclined to socialize in groups.

BMT ItQan provides financing to groups of women living in close proximity to each other, with these
groups being known as rembug pusat. The maximum value of the financing provided to a member
increases incrementally following the repayment of previous financing provided to that member, with
an initial value of 1 Million IDR and a maximal value of 10 Million , and with a timeframe for repayment
of either 25 weeks or 50 weeks. Cooperative members receiving financing enter into syariah-based
contracts known as murabahah or ijarah.

BMT ItQan also strongly encourages its members to cultivate the habit of saving, including by providing
financial literacy classes, with these classes provided in cooperation with other institutions. Members are
encouraged to develop their social awareness by contributing to charity, with donation boxes passed
around at every rembug pusat meeting.

BMT ItQan presently maintains seven branch offices, most of which are located in areas not served
by banks or other non-bank financial institutions, with these locations selected to facilitate access to
financial services by members of underserved and financially excluded communities. One challenge
faced by BMT ItQan is the difficulty of serving members with expanding businesses who require higher
values of financing. To address this, in the future, BMT ItQan plans to offer non-group based, individual
financing to its members.



V.	 Mitra Dhuafa Cooperative (KOMIDA)

The Mitra Dhuafa Cooperative (KOMIDA) is a national cooperative whose entire membership consists
of women from low income households. KOMIDA was established to facilitate access to affordable
microcredit for its members and thereby to enable them to start up or expand a business as a means
to increase their incomes and improve their livelihoods. In order to ensure that the credit provided by
KOMIDA is affordable and accessible, borrowers are not required to provide collateral.




                                                                                                      99
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




Members can access KOMIDA’s products by establishing a group consisting of five to eight women,
with the group holding regular weekly meetings. Although borrowers are required to be in a group,
loans are made on an individual basis. Peer group pressure and the joint liability (tanggung renteng)
system are applied to ensure that members maintain discipline in repaying their loan installments. The
value of loans provided to members may increase incrementally, with low-value initial loans followed
by loans of higher value in later disbursement rounds if the borrower attends weekly meetings regularly
and maintains discipline in the repayment of installments. As of September 2015, KOMIDA has 234,000
members and a total of 100 branches, located both on and off Java. As of December 2014, the total value
of KOMIDA’s assets stood at 286.6 Billion IDR, while the proportion of non-performing loans (NPL) in its
portfolio stood at 0.21 percent.

KOMIDA offers five types of loan products, these being general loans, educational loans, micro business
loans, agricultural loans, and water and sanitation loans, with the ceiling for these loans ranging from 5
Million to 10 Million IDR. The majority of members utilize their loans to engage in agricultural business
or in the food trade, or to operate a small kiosk selling basic household goods (warungan). While
members generally feel that these loans meet their needs during the early stages of establishing their
businesses, some members with expanding businesses feel that the ceiling for the loans offered is too
low. KOMIDA is continuing to develop its products to meet the evolving needs of its members and to
attract new members to join, with innovative developments in terms of the types of loan, loan ceilings
and the design of the loans, with flexible timeframes for the repayment of loans and with members able
to select a timeframe from a range of choices and/or to complete their payments ahead of schedule.
Another interesting feature of the products offered by KOMIDA is the linkage between loans products
and its savings products, with borrowers required to deposit 5 percent of the total value of the loan that
they receive in a savings account at the time that the loan is disbursed. Through Grameen Bank and its
network, KOMIDA has received the support it needs to establish itself and to develop as an institution,
with this support taking the form of funds, advice, and consultations.



VI.	Mitra Bisnis Keluarga Ventura (MBK Ventura)

PT Mitra Bisnis Keluarga Ventura (MBK) is a legal entity structured as a limited liability company with a
license to operate as a non-banking financial institution and as a provider of venture capital. PT Bina
Usaha Keluarga (BUK), MBK’s parent company, holds a majority stake in this company. MBK’s capital
has been provided by its shareholders and by social investors, commercial banks, and both local and
international credit guarantors.

MBK was established to provide working capital specifically to women from low income households
on Java. All of MBK’s clients are women. MBK only offers a single product to its clients, this being a
basic working capital product. Working capital is provided to the women without the requirement for
collateral, with the value of the capital provided increasing incrementally from a ceiling of 1.5 Million
to 3 Million IDR if the client’s performance is satisfactory. The maximum ceiling is 10 Million IDR. The
working capital is repaid in weekly instalments over a 50 week time frame. In order to gain access to
MBK’s product, women must establish a group consisting of five individuals. Four or five groups located
in close proximity to each other gather together to form a Center Meeting (CM), or association, with all
members of the CM attending joint weekly meetings. Although participation in a group is mandatory,



100
            WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




working capital is granted on an individual basis under the joint liability system. Peer group pressure
within each group is applied to ensure that each woman meets her obligation to repay the working
capital in weekly instalments.

As of September 2015, the total number of MBK’s active clients stands at 567,182 individuals. It maintains
307 branch offices located in five provinces across Java and employs a staff of 2,749, of whom 99 percent
are women. As of December 2014, the total value of MBK’s assets amounted to 840.38 Billion IDR, with
its PAR > 30 standing at 0.006 percent. While at present MBK only offers a single product, it is aware
of the importance of developing products to meet the evolving needs of its target market. Thus, it has
plans to develop a product with a higher credit ceiling for individual clients. Similarly, while initially the
timeframe for the repayment of the working capital was fixed at 50 weeks, as of this year, a timeframe
of 80 weeks is also permitted when the value of the working capital provided to a member reaches 10
Million IDR. Given that its clients consist entirely of women, MBK maintains a policy of employing only
women, so that these employees can serve as role models for its clients and build their self-confidence
and sense of empowerment. MBK also believes that on-the-job training is the most effective means
of building the capacities of candidate employees. Thus, the process of recruitment and training relies
heavily on observation and workplace training, rather than on the types of classroom training usually
provided by other financial institutions.



VII.	   Setia Budi Wanita - Women’s Multipurpose Business Cooperative

Setia Budi Wanita (SBW) is a cooperative consisting entirely of women members. SBW’s mission is to
provide micro-financial services both to women entrepreneurs and to women generally as a means
to empower its members to achieve autonomy; to engage in positive, productive activities; and to
encourage members to develop their intellectual capacities.

At present, SBW offers two loans products specifically intended for members who own and operate
their own businesses, these being loans facilitated through the Revolving Fund Management Institution
(Lembaga Pengelola Dana Bergulir, LPDB) with funding from the Ministry for Cooperatives and Small
to Medium Enterprises, and non-joint liability loans using the cooperative’s own capital. Loans under
both schemes require the agreement of the borrower’s group, although the repayment of the loan
is the individual responsibility of the borrower. The ceiling for the loans under these two schemes is
relatively high, at 10 Million IDR for loans under the LPDP and 50 Million IDR for non-joint liability loans.
In addition to the two loan schemes described above, SBW has also developed a loan product known
as SBW Peduli, which provides interest-free loans to a maximum value of 1 Million IDR to women who
experience business failure, with a repayment time frame of six months.

SBW uses a joint liability mechanism to disburse loans. To apply for a loan, the applicant must have
a certificate stating that she has participated in training on the joint liability system. The process of
selecting new members and the approval of loans is subject to the agreement of the group, with the
group jointly liable in the case of a member’s failure to repay their loans. This mechanism has enabled
SBW to achieve a very high repayment rate on its loans.




                                                                                                        101
             WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA: A PATHWAY TO INCREASING SHARED PROSPERITY




In addition to facilitating access to finance, SBW provides training; access to retail outlets at the SBW office;
access to local trade fairs conducted in cooperation with the relevant local government authorities; and
assistance with the marketing of products through a members bulletin. The most significant challenge
faced by SBW involves providing loans of higher value. At present, the support provided by SBW is
considered to be appropriate for early-stage or micro-entrepreneurs, but fails to meet the needs for
larger, longer-term loans by members with expanding businesses. In addition, there is an ongoing need
for the provision of intensive facilitation to enable entrepreneurs to expand their businesses.

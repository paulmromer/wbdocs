   FOREWORD	
   The strength of each country is its economic base. Fish farming can be a key
element of a countryâ€™s economic base and represent a segment of the population
with a unique culture. Development of fish farming in Armenia is largely influ-
enced by the rich experiences and effective management of economic entities en-
gaged in the area, which in turn make the sector both profitable and promising.
    Although the industry is quite developed, the value creation chains, regional
integration, new technology development, strategic planning, and especially export
mechanisms need improvement.
    At the same time, studies show that the sector has significant unused resources:
the rational use of such resources may produce beneficial outcomes.
    With a view to fulfilling the aforementioned intentions, and in light of the pecu-
liarities of the sector, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the
World Bank Group, introduces this brochure in addition of the Fish Export Chain
Mapping review of September, 2015, within the scope of the Armenia Investment
Climate Reform Project jointly implemented with the Ministry of Economy of the
Republic of Armenia (RA).
    Undoubtedly, this new guide can become a useful source of information for fish
industry development and export promotion in Armenia. Moreover, recommenda-
tions from international experts will contribute to an increase in the efficiency of
activities of fish and associated servicing industries, hence creating conditions not
only for further development of the industry and an increase in productivity, but
also for an increase in investments, production and export volumes in this tradi-
tional now sector, which will, in turn, open up new development prospects.

          CONTEMPORARY AQUACULTURE
               TECHNOLOGIES
   1. INTRODUCTION
    Fish farming has been carried out for centuries and is essentially fairly simple. It
becomes a challenge when it is used for commerce. The ability to successfully man-
age the complications of an intensive and cost-efficient fish farm makes the differ-
ence between a healthy enterprise and a struggling one. This brochure highlights
the major complications associated with intensive and cost-efficient fish farming.
   In Armenia, there are a number of pro and cons to its relationship with fish
farming. Armenia has abundant clean water sources. The water has limited sus-
pended solids and little to no dissolved nitrogen. The effect of urbanization is also
very limited, and water availability varies based on geographic location. Labor
costs in Armenia are also low compared to European Union (EU) countries.
   However, Armeniaâ€™s geographical location presents a challenge. Feed, eggs, and
equipment have to be imported, mainly from the U.S. and EU, which adds extra
transportation costs that have significant impact especially on the cost of feed.
  Trout and Siberian sturgeon are among the main species of fish farmed in Ar-
menia.
    There is a lot of information published on standard practices relating to trout
farming (www.thefishsite.com, www.fao.org), while sturgeon farming has not been
intensively researched and there is little published information about it.
    Sturgeon is farmed mainly for its high-priced caviar and, as a secondary prod-
uct, its meat. On the international market, sturgeon meat is a less common product.
    To be a player on the international fish market, a fish farm must be competitive
in three main areas:
ÂÂ Consistent quality,
ÂÂ Sufficient volume,
ÂÂ The right sales price.
    For the last area in particular, farm gate prices are very important. To obtain a
competitive farm gate price, several topics have to be addressed and are discussed
in this brochure, along with common perspectives of fish farming.




                                           2
   2. FARM GATE COSTS/PRICE
   The farm gate price consists of three major components: Fixed costs + Variable
costs + Margin.


   2.1. Fixed costs
   These are the costs that recur each year no matter how much the fish farm pro-
duces, for example indirect personnel costs, investment interest, etc.


   2.2. Variable costs
   These costs depend on the production volume, for example direct personnel
and feed costs.


   2.3 Profit and profit margin
   Profit is the surplusÂ revenue remaining afterÂ total costsÂ (including production
costs, depreciation, interest,Â  taxes, and other expenses) are deducted fromÂ  total
revenue. Profit marginÂ usually refers to the profit as percent of sales revenue.


   2.4. Cost driver
    The main cost driver of every fish farm is the price of feed, calculated per ki-
logram of fish growth. The price of a kilogram of fish growth depends on the feed
price in combination with the feed conversion ratio.
    Feed conversion ratio (FCR) is the ratio between the dry weight of feed fed and
the weight of yield gain, measure of the efficiency of conversion of feed to fish (e.g.
FCR = 2.8 means that 2.8 kg of feed is needed to produce one kilogram of fish live
weight).

 A common misconception is that cost savings can always be achieved
 by purchasing cheaper feed.

   The method of evaluating the cost per kilogram fish is described in section 3.1
and chapter 7.


   2.5. Farm management
   There are three main factors that are critical to sound farm management.




                                                                                                           3
   2.5.1. Growth
   There is only a daily contribution to fish farm revenue if fish grow every day.
This is achieved by maintaining the right standing stock, providing the optimum
feed volume over the course of the day, and careful management.

   2.5.2. Mortality/loss
   When a fish dies or is deformed in any way, it cannot be sold, and the feed
invested in the fish is considered a 100 percent loss.

   2.5.3. Feed conversion
    As feed costs are the cost driver and the feed purchasing cost is fixed, the farm-
er can manage the feed conversion ratio through sound management. Good man-
agement means a ensuring a proper feeding schedule, grading, oxygen availability,
and reducing feed spill.

 The farm gate price is reduced when there is higher production per cubic meter
 of water and lower mortality.

     3. BASICS OF FISH FARMING
     Fish can only grow when there are three elements present:
     ÂÂ Feed
     ÂÂ Oxygen
     ÂÂ Favorable water environment
     The importance of these three elements is discussed in this chapter.


     3.1. Feed
    Fish can be fed in many ways        Figure 1: Fish feed pellets
depending on the aquaculture sys-
tem and its densities. The majority
of large commercial intensive fish
farms use a pellet feed as shown
in figure 1.
    Feed varies depending on the
type of production. For pond
farming, feed is provided in ad-
dition to the natural feed present
in the ponds. The formula for       Source: GCMEC company: www.gcmec.com
this additional feed is more basic
compared to that used in a flow-
through or recirculation farm where 100 percent of growth must come from the
feed supplied.

     3.1.1. Major indicators
    Depending on the application method, several feed suppliers produce feed of
different grades based on the size of the fish and the farming method.
     The following indicators are used to compare the different feeds and suppliers:
ÂÂProtein (starter feed)
ÂÂFat (feed for on-growing)
ÂÂCarbohydrates
ÂÂMinerals
ÂÂVitamins
  These parameters also vary by growth stage of the fish. Typically, the more
mature the fish becomes, the less protein and more fat is required.
    Depending on the species, feed may sink or float. For both trout and stur-
geon, feed is typically formulated as â€œsinkingâ€ feed. To prevent fat build-up in the
sturgeon caviar, feed is typically low in fat and high in protein, with between 45


                                          5
percent to 50 percent protein. Trout feed, on the other hand, has 40 percent to 44
percent protein. Cheaper feeds are typically lower in protein, while the ingredients
with high protein content are higher in price.
    Making a feed pellet is not very complicated; the challenge lies in ensuring that
the feed pellet contains all the vitamins and 23 amino acids in the right ratio. The
quality of the pellet is determined by the characteristics of its ingredients, and the
quality of the ingredients varies per supplier and from batch to batch. For this
reason, for every batch, the fat and protein content should be determined and the
recipe should be adjusted accordingly. Vitamins are added during the process. Ad-
ditives to the recipe are the feed producersâ€™ secrets and, therefore, are not shared.
A feed producer may develop his own recipe based on research and development.
    Thus production of high quality fish feed requires a high level of sophistication
of production and research and development. And in practice it would be hardly
possible to have high quality feed production in a country; where local producers
of fish feed do not have the equipment to determine the protein and fat content
and R&D capacities.

   3.1.2. Indicators of poor feed
    The amino acids in the pellet are required to produce the proteins in the fish.
As there are 10 amino acids that cannot be made by the fish, they are introduced
via the feed. An incorrectly balanced ratio of ingredients limits growth and causes
deformities in the fish, and/or causes stress that can result in illnesses. Ultimately,
such deformities and/or stress can be fatal or produce unsellable fish. Figure 2 pro-
vides some examples of deformities.

Figure 2: Examples of fish deformities

Sources: (a) http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=79810532610;
(b), (c) www.forcechange.com

   Fish that suffer from major deformities will not reach market size or will re-
quire more time to achieve market weight. When fish cannot survive, this is count-
ed as a 100 percent loss, which means that all the feed invested to help the fish
reach market weight is 100 percent lost as well.
    Mortality has a major influence on the farm gate price. With good feed quality,
the fish farmer can reduce deformities and mortality.

   3.1.3. Supplier evaluation
   There are many fish feed suppliers. As fish feed is the main cost driver of the
operation, it is essential to choose the feed supplier wisely.

 Typically, the supplier is selected based on the fish feed price per kilogram; how-
 ever, this is only one relevant indicator. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) is also
 important.


   The feed conversion ratio is provided by feed suppliers as an indicator, but can
vary by fish farm. The best way to evaluate feed is by performing a test at the fish
farm. This test procedure is described in chapter 7.

   3.1.4. Example of calculations
    Below is an example of a calculation based on figures collected during the feed-
ing test procedure as described in chapter 7.

   Evidently, even though the price of the feed used in tank 1 is higher, it results in
a better farm gate cost/price due to a favorable feed conversion ratio.


 However, it is important to keep in mind that the best way to ensure a reliable
 evaluation is to test the feed at the farmerâ€™s own fish farm.



   3.1.5. Consideration about feed production domestically
   Feed is the main cost driver of every fish farm. For this reason, it is important to
consider cost reductions to lower the farm gate price or to increase margins. Pro-
ducing a feed pellet is in itself not very complicated as basic recipes and production
equipment are available, and it is feasible to produce locally made feed with the
correct protein and fat percentages. However, the challenge is to produce feed that
contains all necessary vitamins and building blocks and that also offers a favorable
feed conversion ratio. Feed producers like Skretting, Coppens, and Biomar, for
example, keep their detailed feed recipes private as developing the recipe requires
considerable knowledge, equipment, and investment. The main question is what
can a fish farmer do?
    There are two options: buy relatively expensive feed (imported) with a favor-
able feed conversion ratio or use cheaper, locally produced feed and accept the
lower feed conversion ratio. As it can be seen from the table 3.1, despite the higher
price of higher quality feed (â‚¬1.80 vs â‚¬1.60), the feed cost for producing one ki-
logram of fish is lower (â‚¬2.16/kg fish vs â‚¬2.24/kg fish). Therefore, it is essential to
conduct trials and determine the cost of the production of 1 kilogram fish in order
to carry out a sound evaluation of feed. The procedure for doing so is described
in chapter 7.



                                                                                                          8

   3.2. Oxygen
    To digest feed, fish need oxygen. Trout, for instance, consume approximately
300 to 500 grams of O2 per kilogram of feed. This means that for every kilogram
of feed provided, fish need 300 to 500 grams of oxygen.
    The quantity of oxygen available for consumption is important for the growth
of the fish. Oxygen is dissolved in water and exists naturally in single-loop systems
via the inflow of water.


 There is a difference between the oxygen level and the oxygen available.




   3.2.1. Dissolved oxygen available
   The available oxygen is the oxygen level in the water minus the minimum re-
quired level of oxygen multiplied by the transport volume of oxygen.

    Feed gift is the amount of feed provided to the fish over one day period. Feed
percentage is the quantity of feed given to one fish on a daily basis, expressed as
percent body weight per day. See more details about feed gift and feed percentage
in the section 5.
    There are two methods of dissolving oxygen in water: aeration and oxygen-
ation.


   3.2.2. Aeration
    Aeration forces air into the water where both oxygen and nitrogen dissolve in
the water column. When air is inserted into the water column, the farmer has to be
careful to monitor nitrogen levels to avoid over-saturation as nitrogen levels above
103 percent have a toxic effect on the fish.



                                                                                                       9

   3.2.3. Oxygenation
   During the oxygenation process, pure oxygen is introduced into water, typically
under pressure.
    Depending on the water temperature and atmospheric conditions, a maximum
of 6.7 to 14 milligrams of O2 per liter can be dissolved.

Figure 4: Relationship between dissolved        Figure 5: Relationship between
oxygen and water temperature                    dissolved oxygen and pressure




   When the pressure on the water column is increased by one bar, the maximum
saturation level doubles. Figure 5 shows the relation between temperature and the
maximum dissolved oxygen and pressure.
    In a recirculation system, fish consume the oxygen from the water. As the water
is reused repeatedly when no oxygen is added, the oxygen level will drop to zero.


                                           10
    The oxygenation step adds pure oxygen to the water from a liquid oxygen
storage facility or from an oxygen generator.

   3.2.4. Oxygen storage
    Liquid oxygen is bought from a vendor and comes         Figure 6: Liquid oxygen
chilled at -183Â°C, via trucks, to refill the fish farmâ€™s    storage facility
storage facility.
   The oxygen storage facility consists of three major
components:
ÂÂ Storage tank(s)
ÂÂ Evaporator
ÂÂ Pressure regulation valve
    It is important, when making arrangements for ox-
ygen supply, choosing liquid oxygen to give due consid-
eration to the logistics of liquid oxygen supply. If, for
instance, the road is not accessible in the winter for a
truck, carrying oxygen, then a solution will have to be     Source: Authorâ€™s
found. This can be the installation of an oxygen gener-     database
ator at the fish farm or the enhancements of the road.

   3.2.5. Oxygen generator
    The oxygen generator extracts oxygen         Figure 7: Oxygen generator
gas from the air. It consists of four main
components: a compressor, an air dryer, the
generator, and storage tanks. The oxygen
generator typically produces oxygen with a
purity of 90 percent to 94 percent at 5 bars.
The disadvantage of the oxygenator is the
use of electricity, which implies both addi-
tional operational costs and dependence on
the availability of electricity. To avoid hav-
ing issues during an electrical power failure,   Source: http://www.oxymat.com/
a backup generator should be installed.
    One known oxygen generator manufacturer is Oxymat, which makes genera-
tors in different capacities. For example, a 1.7 m3/hour 93 percent oxygen gener-
ator costs approximately â‚¬15.000 excluiding transportation costs from Denmark.
    Figure 7 shows the compressor, dryer, and purification and storage tanks, mak-
ing up the complete set.
   Oxygen gas must be dissolved in the water column. This is achieved using
pressurized oxygen via pressure regulation valves that feed into an oxygen reactor


                                         11
(figure 8) or an MHO (Medium Head Oxygen Generator) (figure 9), which dis-
solves the oxygen in the water.
    The reactor works with a pump to increase the water pressure, whereas the
MHO uses the static pressure of the water column to dissolve the oxygen. Due
to the enhanced pressure of the water, oxygen levels up to 24 mg/l are achievable.
Figure 8: Oxygen reactor                                                                                     Figure 9: MHO generator

   3.2.6. Concentration and transport
    Oxygen concentration in the wa-                                                                      Figure 10: Oxygen meter
ter column is typically measured with
an oxygen meter. One such oxygen
meter is the OxyGuard Handy Po-
laris, which has a digital screen that
displays the water temperature, oxy-
gen concentration, and percentage of
saturation. The cost of purchasing a
Polaris is estimated at â‚¬800. The me-
ters can be ordered from a number of                                                                     Source: Catvis company: www.catvis.nl
sources, but www.catvis.nl is a well-
known supplier.
    Fish consume oxygen from the water. It is important that in addition to moni-

higher, the feed that can be provided is much lower compared to example 1, which
has a higher flow and lower concentration.

   3.3. Water environment
    As with air, water is not made up of just pure water. Many chemicals are dis-
solved in water and most are not harmful in certain concentrations or combina-
tions. For fish farming, the most relevant elements of the water environment are
discussed below.

   3.3.1. Ammonium
   Fish consume feed and produce ammonium. The majority of the ammonium
produced is flushed out with a flow-through system and ends up in the ecosystem
where it will be absorbed by nature if concentrations are not too high.
    For fish farming, it is important to double check ammonium concentrations
in the raceway/tanks as the production of ammonium is directly connected to the
feed gift. For every kilogram of feed, fish produce 35 grams of ammonium, and the
ammonium concentration in the tanks/raceways should not exceed 2 mg/l. This is
calculated based on the feed gift and the water flow.

   In case the ammonium concentration increases, measurements have to be taken
by reducing feed gift or by installing a biological filter.

   3.3.2. Carbon dioxide
    Fish produce carbon dioxide (CO2), in addition to ammonium, which dissolves
in the water. Carbon dioxide is easily removed from the water by aeration in a pro-
cess called stripping. When working with aeration or a natural influx of oxygen,
stripping can be done at the inlet by splashing the water into the tanks/raceway.
When working with oxygenation, this splashing should be avoided at the entry of
tanks as the oxygen can also be stripped from the water. To avoid this, stripping
should be done before introducing oxygen to the water.

   3.3.3. Solids
   Solids can accumulate in tanks/raceways, especially in flow-through systems.
These solids can consist of sand, which is generally not harmful, but may also in-
clude organic material. This organic material can decompose and use oxygen while
producing chemicals in the water. Organic settled solids should always be removed
from tank/raceways and gutters.

   3.3.4. Suspended solids
    Suspended solids float in the water. Typically, suspended solids are organic and
can decompose and use oxygen from the water, adding chemicals, especially am-
monium, to the water. However, the decomposing suspended solids impede the
functioning of the gills of the fish. The effect on the fish of suspended solids can
be best compared to humans breathing smoke in a fire. For these reasons, when
circulating the water, suspended solids should be removed, which can be achieved
through sedimentation on angled plates or by leading the water through a cloth.

   3.3.5. Example of ammonium calculations
    The main purpose of these calculations is to determine that there is not too
much ammonium build-up in the raceway. The main contributing factor for this is
the retention time, which is the time required to refresh the tank/raceway.

   4. PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT
   4.1. Hatchery
    At the beginning of the growth cycle, fish are very efficient at the conversion of
feed into standing stock (known as the feed conversion ratio, FCR) and growing
very quickly (the specific growth rate, SGR), presented as a percentage body weight
per day.
    From the standpoint of cost efficiency, optimal use of this phase is a key. As the
feed conversion ratio is so favorable, the cost per kilogram of fish production is
relatively low, whereas the feed price is very high.
    The system for hatching and growing fingerlings is relatively small, and small-
ness makes it easier to manage. The key for success is to create an optimum water
environment (temperature) for hatching and growing the fingerlings, where the
fish can be fed to the maximum level. For trout, within four months of hatching,
fingerlings of 35 grams can be produced. In the hatchery system, several batches of
35 grams of trout can be produced during the year and inserted into the on-grow-
ing system.
    Depending on the temperature of the water coming from the source, the water
may need to be heated in order to hatch the eggs. Figure 12 below shows the num-
ber of days required to hatch eggs for various species of trout at different water
temperatures.

   4.1.1. Eggs
   The hatchery starts with fertilized eggs, which can be purchased or harvested
out of fish farmersâ€™ own brood stock.
   Fertilized eggs can be purchased from specialized companies like â€œTroutexâ€ or
â€œTroutlodgeâ€ for trout or â€œSturgeon churilovâ€ for sturgeon.

   4.1.2. Hatchery equipment
    A hatchery typically consists of three major     Figure 13
systems:
ÂÂ Incubation system
ÂÂ Fry system
ÂÂ Fingerling system

Incubation system
    Three types of incubators are typically used
in the industry for hatching eggs:
ÂÂ California tray incubator
ÂÂ Vertical tray incubator
ÂÂ Upwelling incubator                               Source: www.thefishsite.com

Source: www.aquaculture-com.net              Source: www.marisource.com

    Experience has shown that all three Figure 16: Upwelling incubator
incubation systems work well and are
used. The difference between the sys-
tems lies in the use of water, the required
footprint, and the handling procedure. In
general, the use of water is the key selec-
tion criterion.
   The California tray incubator and up-
welling incubator use approximately 3-6 Source: Authorâ€™s database
l/min per 10,000 eggs, resulting in a rate


                                        20
of 60-120 l/min for 200,000 eggs (3.6-7.2 m3/hour). The vertical tray incubator
uses approximately 0.9-1.2 l/min per 10,000 eggs, or 18-24 l/min for 200,000 eggs
(1-1.4 m3/hour).
    Use of water is therefore a valid selection criterion because egg hatching and
fry growth are directly related to the water temperature, as shown in table 4.2.
Depending on the water source temperature, the water may need to be heated.
Therefore, the energy cost for heating is directly related to the volume of water to
be heated.

Table 4.2 Trout: Water temperature and days to hatch




    To avoid any risk of contamination from the water source, the water is pumped
through a sand-filter and UV-unit before entering the incubators. The most fre-
quently recommended incubation system is the vertical tray incubator. Of the three
commonly used incubation systems, this incubator has the lowest water consump-
tion and the lowest heating cost.

   Fry system
   The fry system generally takes the form of swimming gutters, California tray
incubators without inlays, or small raceways. In this system, the hatched eggs are
weaned (to become accustomed to dry feed) and grown up to a weight of 0.5
grams. In a swimming gutter, 50,000 fry can be weaned with a water flow of 2.5
m3/hour and 50 percent recirculation.
   The heated water from the incubators can be used as an input for the fry system
unless chemical treatments are conducted or when eggs are taken from external
sources. With the reuse of water, no energy is lost. Swim-up fry then learn to feed
and can be transferred into the fry system when they reach approximately 0.5
grams.




                                        21
   Fingerling system
    The fingerling system has the largest footprint of the hatchery systems. Fry
weighing 0.5 grams are grown until the fingerling stage, 15 centimeters and 35
grams, before being inserted into the on-growing system. Fingerling systems con-
sist of small raceways of circular tanks, and the water from the fry system can
be reused as make-up water in the other systems unless chemical treatments are
conducted. For this reason, fingerling systems are very suitable for recirculation as
they are small systems in which rapid growth can be achieved.

   Investment required for hatchery
   The investment depends on three factors:
ÂÂ Already available hardware at the fish farm, for example, reuse of swimming
    gutters or vertical tray incubators
ÂÂ Water source temperature and availability
ÂÂ Method of construction: are turnkey systems being purchased from vendors
    abroad or will they be built, using the right experts, in Armenia under its own
    regime?
    In the absence of a detailed calculation, the following estimates can be provided
for a 100 metric ton trout hatchery system:
ÂÂ Buying a 100 percent turnkey system will cost approximately â‚¬300,000
ÂÂ Reusing available hardware and building a system locally is estimated by ex-
   perts to cost approximately â‚¬100,000.

   4.2. Purchase eggs or harvest from own brood stock
    Eggs can be harvested and fertilized from the farmâ€™s own brood stock. From
the standpoint of cost, using brood stock would appear to be best since the pur-
chase cost would be eliminated. However, this is not the case as the growth char-
acteristics of purchased eggs are completely different due to genetic selection and
the occurrence of all female, triploid eggs. The growth and resistance to illness
of purchased eggs is much greater, which results in lower mortality and higher
growth rates, leading to higher production levels per cubic meter of water. Another
advantage of purchased eggs is that they are available over a longer period during
the year as the hatchery can carry out several runs to produce fingerlings. It is im-
portant for fish farmers to be aware that purchased triploid eggs are sterile, which
means that they cannot be used to create brood stock.


   4.3. Grow out
   Water quality is determined by the system used and water source. The water
source is a known factor with existing fish farms and is not expected to present
quality issues. However, water volume may or may not become an issue.

                                        22
    The farm system has a big influence on the FCR. In essence, two systems can
be identified:
ÂÂ Single-pass systems in which water is used only once (cage, pond, and flow-
   through systems)
ÂÂ Multi-pass systems in which water is reused and repeatedly recirculated (Recir-
   culation Aquaculture systems (RAS))

   4.3.1. Single-pass systems
    Single-pass systems are typically flow through, cage, and pond systems, as illus-
trated in figures 17, 18, and 19.

Figure 17: Pond                   Figure 18: Cage           Figure 19: Flow through




Source: Authorâ€™s database    Source: Authorâ€™s database     Source: Authorâ€™s database

    Typically, water in a flow-through or pond system is extracted from a natural
stream. As a result, the system depends on the water quality and quantity of the
natural stream, resulting in sufficient oxygen levels and flow and a lack of pollu-
tion, whether natural or from civilization.

   4.3.2. Multi-pass system
    A typical multi-pass system is     Figure 20: Recirculation aquaculture system
the Recirculation Aquaculture Sys-
tem (RAS), as shown in figure 20,
21 in which the water at the end
of the system is fully or partially
pumped back to the start of the
system.
    During recirculation, a decision
must be made regarding whether or
not the water should be conditioned.
Conditioning can take the form
of removal of solids, re-oxygen-
ation, and/or removal of dissolved     Source: HESY Aquaculture: www.hesy.com
pollution.

                                        23
   4.3.3. Cage farming
    Cages require the least investment and are widely used in the industry. There
are many success stories in addition to major failures associated with cage farming.
   The main advantage of cage farming is the low investment cost, whereas the
biggest disadvantages are the following:
ÂÂ Logistical handling of the farm is more difficult with respect to feeding and
    harvesting;
ÂÂ Financial results depend significantly on management experience and monitor-
    ing of the fish;
ÂÂ There is limited control of the water environment; and
ÂÂ There is the challenge of pollution of the water environment.
    The last two disadvantages have led to massive failures as complete lakes are
polluted in ways that hinder fish farming, with highs of up to 100 percent mortal-
ity owing to the inflow of poor quality water. There are also challenges posed by
low oxygen levels resulting from chemical pollution due to urbanization or chem-
ical pollution by nature triggered by fish farming itself.

   4.3.4. Full Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS)
   To ensure the most controlled and stable water environment, an RAS is used.
A RAS is typically implemented indoors with limited added waterâ€”as low as 2 l/
second for a fish farm producing 100 metric tons annually.
    Owing to continual water recirculation, pollution is filtered out with biological
and mechanical filters, and as a result of the constant and full control of water
temperature, fish can grow at the optimum water temperature and can be fed up
to maximum levels. In addition, because of the constant water temperature, fish
grow as quickly in the winter as in the summer. From the standpoint of sales, this
situation allows for consistent quality and delivery volume.
    When opting for a recirculation sys-         Figure 21: Recirculation aquaculture
tem, it is important to realize that there are   system, schematic
many companies that claim to be able to
build a system. The components of a recir-
culation system are available in the indus-
try from different suppliers. However, the
design of a recirculation system is critical
and, unfortunately, not all builders have
sufficient knowledge in the field of design.
Standard advice is to opt for system build-
ers who have extensive knowledge and a
proven record of accomplishment in this
area. AKVA group (www.akvagroup.com)             Source: Author

   4.3.4.1. Filter elements
   In general, three types of filters can be identified:
ÂÂ A sieve for removal of the solids, feces, and remaining feed;
ÂÂ A trickling filter for transformation of ammonium to nitrates and removal of
   CO2;
ÂÂ A submerged filter for transformation of nitrates to nitrites and nitrogen gas
   and for the collection of fine solid particles.
   A moving bed is also becoming more and more common, but functions as a
combination of a trickling filter and submerged filter.

   Sieve
    For the sieve step, a drum or disc filter is typically used. Water from the tanks
flows into the drum/disc and flows outward to a cloth. Cloths are available in
several meshes (40-60-100 Âµm). The mesh of the cloth determines the size of the
particles passing through and, therefore, the color of the water. As trout are sen-
sitive to suspended particles in water, a fine mesh is used whereas for other fish, a
grove mesh is used.
    The water level in the drum/disc is approximately 40 percent of the diameter.
The drum/disc rotates so that the particles trapped in the cloth inside of the drum/
disc rise above the water. With a high-pressure water nozzle, water is sprayed from
the outside in so that the cloth is continually cleaned. The outside-in water flow,

                                          25
with the particles, is collected in a gutter, which is drained.
   A sieve is seen as a mechanical filter as no biological processes are involved.

   Trickling filter
     A trickling filter is a combination of a biological and a mechanical filter. Water
is sprayed over the top over a â€œbionetâ€ (see figure 25). The trickling filter strips
CO2 from the water through a mechanical process, and a ventilator pulls fresh air
from the bottom through the filter to the top. In this way, CO2 is removed from the
filter.

   When installing a new trickling filter, it is necessary to start the filter through
a biological process. Bacteria (nitrobacteria and nitrospiria) grow on the bionet,
transforming ammonium to nitrates under aerobic conditions. Bacteria consume
oxygen for this process and over time, the bacterial mass will grow. The hydraulic
load on the trickling filter is also very important. If it is too low, the mass will grow
and the filter will eventually be blocked; if it is too high, the filtration effect will
decrease. Therefore, the design of the filter is very important.

     Submerged filter
     Bionet is also used as filtration media, but is typically submerged in a barrel
approximately 4 meters deep. The main process is biological: slow water flow
moves from the bottom to the top through the bionet. The bacteria (Micrococcus)
transform the nitrates into nitrate gas under anaerobic conditions, which leaves the
filter at the top of the barrel. One side effect is that because of the slow water
movement, small particles in the water column will settle and collect in the bionet.
For this reason, every two weeks, the filters must be cleaned and flushed. Mainte-
nance is a relatively easy process. At the bottom of the barrel, pressurized air is
blown in to clean the bionet and at the same time, the water is drained. Two or
more barrels are typically used, and all barrels are never cleaned at the same timeâ€”
only 50 percent are cleaned in one week and the other 50 percent in the following
week. Cleaning temporarily decreases the effect of the bacteria; therefore, only
cleaning 50 percent at a time limits this impact.

     4.3.4.2. Electricity usage
    The design of a full recirculation system is essential and depends on several
factors. The main design factors are the fish production level required and the well
water quality.
     The figures provided below are based on the following:
ÂÂ A production level of 100 metric tons of trout annually
ÂÂ A 100 meter ground well that requires de-ironing
ÂÂ Full recirculation
ÂÂ Production of 600,000 fingerlings year round
   Trout is used for this calculation as it is a sensitive fish, with stringent require-
ments for its water environment. Catfish, on the other hand, would require up to
30 percent of the estimates below.


                                          27
   Hatchery
    For a 600,000 piece hatchery where eggs are hatched up to the fingerling stage
of 35 grams, electrical power of 6 kW is required. This power is used for the circu-
lation of the water over the tanks and filters.

   On-growing
    To achieve 100 metric tons of production annually, around 1,000 m3/hour is
pumped, which results in a retention time of 30 minutes. Selection of the pumps is
based on flow, height difference, and pipe and appendix resistance. In general, the
low-cost pumps are less efficient and use more electricity; therefore, it is recom-
mended that the purchase decision be based on the initial investment cost and the
operational cost. When selecting the pump, an important characteristic to consider
is the electricity use by the pump. With trout, for example, 16 kW pump power is
required.

   Other considerations
    In a full recirculation system, there are other components not related to water
circulation that are relevant. For example, additional energy costs are estimated at
4 kW for drum filter spray pumps, a blower for back-washing, a wastewater treat-
ment unit, UV and/or ozone, a ground water pump, and a ground water treatment
unit.

   Summary
   For the hatchery, 6 kW is required, which results in power consumption of
53,000 kWh per year (where 1kwh=â‚¬0.10).1 With 600,000 pieces, the electrical
operational cost per fingerling is less than â‚¬0.01.
   With on-growing, 16 kW is required, resulting in power consumption of
140,000 kWh per year. To produce 100,000 kg per year, the electrical operational
cost per kilogram of fish = â‚¬0.21/kg fish (113 dram/kg fish).
   For all other electrical components, 4 kW is required, resulting in power con-
sumption of 35,000 kWh per year, or â‚¬5,256 per year in total.




1	 1 kWh = â‚¬0.10 rate was used for simplicity of calculations. This rate is very close
   to the electricity tariffs applied in Armenia. As of June 2016, the following elec-
   tricity tariffs were applied in Armenia for 1 kwh: daily tariff was 49 Armenian
   Dram (AMD), and night tariff was 39 AMD (source: Public Services Regulation
   Commission - http://www.psrc.am/am/sectors/electric/tariffs): Assuming the night
   is 1/23a of the day, the average tariff would be 49 ËŸ 2/3 + 39 ËŸ 1/3 = 45.66 AMD/

    4.4. Examples of financial calculations
    The operational cost of a full recirculation system is not cheap compared to
a flow-through system as there are costs for electricity, oxygen, maintenance, and
chemicals that do not exist to the same degree in a flow-through system.
   The main advantages of a flow-through system are the low labor cost and the
very efficient feed conversion ratio. In Armenia, the cost of feed per kilogram is
high and the feed cost is the primary cost driver in every fish farm.
     Table 4.3 provides an example of the calculation of a full recirculation system
for 100 metric tons of trout production annually. The cost price is â‚¬2.52 per kilo-
gram of trout, and trout is available all year round with consistently high quality.
It is also worth noting that the fat percentage of the trout does not lower in winter.

    4.5. Considerations for recirculation aquaculture system
    Every aquaculture system has advantages and disadvantages, but there are spe-
cific benefits of a full RAS for fish farmers, such as the following:
ÂÂ The ability to meet potential future governmental regulations regarding pollu-
   tion and water usage
ÂÂ The flexibility of the location of the fish farm, even (sub) urbanized areas due
   to the limited need for water inflow

                                         29
ÂÂ The lower significance of the summer or winter season
   ÂÂ Fish could also be delivered in the winter
   ÂÂ The quality of the fish would remain constant year round
   ÂÂ There would be more rapid and efficient growth of fish
ÂÂ A more efficient operation

   Government regulations
    In time, government environmental regulations can force Armenian farmers to
move toward more sustainable production methods. A transition of the existing
facilities to partially recirculated farms, as happened in Denmark, could be an op-
tion. This would involve the use of liquid oxygen and the installation of bio filters
and pumping and aeration equipment, resulting in an enormous reduction in water
consumption and waste output, while dramatically increasing production.
     The reason behind the increasing popularity of the recirculation system is that
it is a simple and reliable way of controlling water quality parameters to the exact
needs of the species cultured. This sophisticated, if simple, technology originated
from the development of closed-circuit eel farming systems in Holland and Den-
mark. Today, the system is commonly used for the production of fry and finger-
lings, and an increasing number of farms are using the principles for the produc-
tion of portion-sized fish.
    In recent years, recirculation technology has been used to rear practically all
kinds of new species, especially in the first biological stages up to at least the fry or
fingerling stage. The main advantages of recirculation are:
ÂÂ Easy regulation and control of temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH levels to
    meet the exact requirements of the species cultured and to meet the require-
    ments of different growth stages, that is, to induce spawning, wean fish larvae,
    or simply grow fish to market size;
ÂÂ The possibility of eliminating invasive fish diseases from the surroundings (bi-
    osecurity) and maintaining low levels of internal bacteriological pressure; and
ÂÂ The ability to minimize the effluent of organic compounds, nitrogen, and phos-
    phorus to the external environment.
    Owing to these clear advantages of recirculation, the worldwide development
of Recirculation Aquaculture Systems (RAS) for salmonids has gained considerably
in experience and expertise over the past decade. The availability of this expertise
and technology, combined with research on the performance of trout in RAS, pro-
vides substantial scientific and practical data to indicate the potential productivity.

   Location of the fish farm
    Where limited water inflow is required, a ground well with good quality wa-
ter and limited flow of 50l/min per 100 metric tons is more than sufficient. For a
full-cycle RAS, production per cubic meter is very good at 178 kg/m3/year, from

                                          30
the egg stage up to 250 grams.
    RAS are generally indoor systems. For full RAS production, an indoor facility
of 1200 m2 is required from the egg stage until market size. The facility is typical-
ly connected to the electrical and gas grid and is insulated. An environment with
heavy surrounding vibration is not recommended.

   Absence of summer or winter season
   When the RAS is implemented indoors and the water quality remains stable
year round, there is year-round growth. Typically, in winter, when there are low
external temperatures, fish are not fed. With an RAS, feeding is done every day so
there are no limitations on the harvest.

   Other considerations
   In Armenia, an RAS offers the most potential in the following areas:
1.	 Increased fingerling production
2.	 An increase in total annual production
3.	 The market need for fresh fish in winter
    However, the biggest disadvantage of the RAS is the high investment cost of an
on-growing system.

   4.6. Water availability/usage in Armenia
    In Armenia, water from natural sources has little to no pollution, and although
the available water volume differs considerably depending on the farm, it does still
exist. Yet, in a single-pass system, which is the standard at the moment, the water
is used only once, resulting in a high degree of waste of this most precious compo-
nent of the fish farming system.
    Water management is, therefore, a critical subject for future consideration by
fish farms in Armenia and should be evaluated from the standpoints of both du-
rability and marketing. The fish market is an international market and the bulk of
suppliers are selected by price, an area in which Armenia still has a long way to go
in order to be competitive. However, Armenia does possess water quality that is
unmatched by other producer countries. For this reason, it is advisable to consider
targeting the niche market of customers for whom sustainability is an important
element of selection as these customers tend to be less price oriented.

   4.7. Multi-pass systems outdoor
    For further development of aquaculture in Armenia, it is important to enhance
existing single pass, flow-through systems via the use of recirculation techniques.
In the existing in Armenia concrete structures of flow through systems, water and
oxygen availability is the limiting factor for increasing the fish production. With
the use of recirculation technology the water is pumped back from the outlet of the

                                        31
fish farm to inlet, making the    Figure 28: Enhanced water management system
transport of oxygen possible.
In addition to the enhanced
transport of oxygen, pure
oxygen is supplied at the in-
takes of every raceway. When
circulating water, extra atten-
tion has to be given to water
quality. The circulated water
has to go over a (trickling)
filter where the dissolved ni-    Source: Author
trogenâ€™s and Carbon dioxides
are removed.

   Multi-pass system and outdoor temperature
   Usually, a flow-through system is located in an outside environment where the
external temperature affects the water temperature and, thus, the feed gift.
    The work of the trickling filter (in terms of removing dissolved nitrogen) is
also affected by the water temperature. The higher the water temperature the more
active the bacteria are in the trickling filter in removing the dissolved nitrogen.
    So the higher the water temperature, the higher the feed gift, the higher the
nitrogen production, but the more effective the bacteria are in the trickling filter in
removing the dissolved nitrogen.
    In winter time, when the temperatures and, thus, the feed gift are low (feed gift
may go down up to zero), it is recommended to stop the recirculation because there
is no need for extra oxygen. This allows also saving electricity.
     The trickling filter consists of blocks with bacteria on them. It is recommended
to place a few blocks indoor at a temperature >10OC, and every 2-3 days manually
add Ammonia on the blocks. This would allow the bacteria stay alive during win-
ter, which ensures a smooth startup in early spring.
  A shelter is recommended for the oxygen equipment as for the recirculation
pumps.

   5. FARM MANAGEMENT
   5.1. Feed conversion
    In the on-growing unit, fish grow to market size. During this phase, feed is the
main cost driver; therefore, the efficient conversion of feed to fish body weight is
essential.
    This conversion is called the feed conversion ratio (FCR) and is calculated as
follows:
                                                        í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡í µí²‡ í µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆ
                        í µí±­í µí±­í µí±­í µí±­í µí±­í µí±­ =
                                         í µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒí µí²ƒ í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜í µí²˜ í µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆí µí²ˆ


    Both â€œfeed givenâ€ and â€œbody weight growthâ€ are based on a specific time frame
and are calculated between grading periods and at harvesting. For this reason, it is
essential to record data on mortality, grading results, and feeding.
    The FCR is influenced by the water quality and stability, the feed regime, grad-
ing, and, above all, by the quality of the feed.
    Thus, from a management perspective, following a solid feed regime, grading,
and recording the results of grading are key. Selection of the feed supplier and
calculation of the financials and cost of producing 1 kilogram of fish are also im-
portant.

   5.1.1. Standing stock
   To determine the maximum feed gift of the fish per pond, it is necessary to
know the exact weight of the standing stock. By calculating the precise feed gift on
a daily basis, the farmer can prevent giving too much or too little feed.
   The standing stock must be maintained at the correct level, both in terms of
weight and weight distribution, in order to harvest the fish after the growth period.
From this perspective, the standing stock can be viewed as inventory.
    One common mistake made is to harvest too much of the standing stock in one
year, leaving an inadequate amount of standing stock available for sale. Another
mistake is made at the input side, whereby there are no eggs available from the
farmâ€™s own harvest or there is a high mortality rate of the younger fish and the
distribution of weight classes is distorted.

   Mortality
    Spawning of eggs is a delicate, but well-known process. The egg quality and
treatment of the eggs during and after hatching, as well as management of the
weaning and production processes, are the main factors influencing the final sur-
vival rate of the animals.
   The average experience with Rainbow trout hatchery demonstrates 24 percent

                                                               33
total losses, mainly during hatching and early rearing. For sturgeon, this varies be-
tween 50 percent and 80 percent. During the hatchery phase, mortality is mortality
rate comes at a low cost because little feed is given to the fish.
   Mortality during on-growing is relatively expensive as fish feed, which is the
main cost driver, is supplied to fish. For example, for every kilogram of mortality,
â‚¬1.80 of the feed cost is lost. Therefore, mortality in the on-growing phase should
not exceed 10 percent.
   In summary, the farm gate price is reduced by limiting direct feed loss.

   5.1.2. Grading
    With respect to fish growth, there is a natural spread between slow and fast
growers. This is caused by genetics, sex, illness period, and (non-) aggressive be-
havior. To provide the fish with the right type of fish feed matching the growth
cycle and to match the pellet size with the size of the mouth it is important to grade
the fish. By doing this the Feed conversion ratio will be positively influenced, what
reduces the farm gate price.

   Frequency of grading
   Younger fish should be graded more frequently than larger fish. The best in-
dication is to look at the weight class distribution in the tanks, and a practical
way of checking this is visually or by removing some small fish from the tank and
grading them.
   One approach to grading is to sort the original fish stock into two groups based
on whether they fall below or above the average. If the original fish stock is very
uneven in size, three new groups should be formed instead of two.
    Restocking the tanks after grading is typically done based on the density sched-
ule shown in table 5.1, bearing in mind that oxygen is applied.
   Densities commonly found in intensive Rainbow trout systems are provided in
cubic meters where the fish are distributed over the water column.

   Sturgeon is one type of fish that stays at the bottom of the tank and for this
reason; densities are provided in square meters. There is limited research available
on stocking densities.

   These are optimum densities for production purposes, with the application of
oxygen.

Grading equipment
    Depending on the size of fish, different grading tools are available. Up to the
fingerling stage, the grading box used is a manual grader. Fish are placed gently in
the box, and the box is lightly shaken so that the smaller fish pass through grading

    For the larger sizes of fish, the sorting table is very useful for farms up to a vol-
ume of 100 metric tons annually. In this case, grading is best done by a minimum
of three persons.
    For bigger volumes, semi-automated grading machines can be used, but require
a considerable investment that will have to be earned back on labor costs, which
will not be easy for Armenia.
    When using buckets or tubs during the grading process, it is crucial to monitor
oxygen levels. Mortality during grading is not uncommon, and low oxygen con-
tributes significantly to this.

    Application of oxygen directly into buckets and tubs is advised, and fish han-
dling and scoping should be done quickly, efficiently, and with care. When done
properly, mortality is close to zero, stress levels are lower, and fish return more
quickly to their original feed schedule. These measures must be followed to keep
farm gate prices low.
   When grading fish it is important to keep a record of the grading tank, the
number and size of the fish, and the tank into which the fish are placed. For the
receiving tank, it is important to know the number of fish and the average weight.
This average weight has to be measured precisely, not estimated, as the number
and average weight determine the standing stock, which is the basis from which to
determine the feed gift. This, in turn, determines growth and efficiency.
   The grading records from the grading tank are used to calculate the specific
growth rate (SGR), which is a key parameter of growth performance.

   The procedure to determine average weight during grading is as follows:
1.	 Fill a bucket with 30 percent water
2.	 Place it on a scale and set the scale to zero
3.	 Depending on the size of the bucket and the size of the fish, fill the bucket up
    to 60 percent
4.	 Determine the weight of the (added) fish
5.	 Count the number of fish in the bucket
6.	 Divide the weight by this number to determine the average number
7.	 Repeat this procedure 8 to 15 times for every weight class during grading
8.	 Calculate the final average weight of every grading class of fish

   5.2. Production volume
   5.2.1. Feed gift
   Depending on the standing stock in a tank, calculations of feed gift can be done
on a daily basis.
   Grading indicates how many fish are in a tank and the average weight and
body weight of the fish.

   5.3. Monitoring
    Monitoring is essential to evaluate the performance of the fish farm. The data
recorded can be used to determine the performance of the fish farm by calculating
the feed conversion ratio (FCR).
   The recorded data is also used to troubleshoot issues. With the parameters re-
corded, the baseline state of the operation can be established so that issues such as
reduced growth and increased mortality, among others, can be determined.
    Some parameters are recorded by tank and others are more applicable for the
total farm.
   Total farm parameters include the following:
ÂÂ Water temperature
ÂÂ Water flow
ÂÂ Oxygen level at intake

   6. SUSTAINABILITY
    In some markets, especially northern European markets, sustainability is in-
creasingly becoming a question of selection and price. Animal welfare, use of med-
ication, water usage, and environmental pollution are subjects that are topical in
the northern European context, and consumers are willing to pay a higher price
for sustainably produced products. From this standpoint, a multi-pass or recircu-
lation system would be well suited to water management and efforts to prevent
environmental pollution.


   6.1. Marketing value
   Armenia has a very good water supply, and it is important, as a marketing
value, to emphasize the use of this water during farming and the care the farmers
take of the water. Single-loop systems lacking filtration after use are not optimal;
multi-pass systems that include filtration and reuse are important.


   6.2. Certification
   Aquaculture fish farms are certified by specialized organization called such as
the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)2. Certification is done based on the
production process at the environmental level, for example, managing pollution
and water usage, and at the social level, for example, working conditions, safety,
and payments.
    For trout there is a standard for certification, set by the ASC3, and there are
certified farms only in Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Italy. For sturgeon, there
is no standard certification available and there will not before 2019. The cost of
certification depends very much on the state of development of the farm, but is on
the order of â‚¬5,000 to â‚¬15,000. Armenian fish farmers fall on the higher end of
this range as there is limited certification implemented at this stage.




2	 The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) was founded in 2010 by WWF (World
   Wide Fund for Nature) and IDH (Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative). It is an inde-
   pendent non-profit organization with global influence. ASC aims to be the worldâ€™s
   leading certification and labelling program for responsibly farmed seafood. The
   ASCâ€™s primary role is to manage the global standards for aquaculture, which were
   developed by WWF. http://www.asc-aqua.org/

7. FISH FARM PRACTICAL CALCULATIONS AND
   DETAILS
     7.1. Fish farm â€“ scenario 1
     No oxygen applied, no recirculation, maximum feeding
     Assumptions
ÂÂ   Water volume 500 m3
ÂÂ   Density = 60 kg/m3 (for calculation purposes only)*
ÂÂ   Feed percentage = 1.48%
ÂÂ   Minimum oxygen level = 6 mg/l
ÂÂ   Oxygen level water flow in = 9 mg/l
ÂÂ   Water flow into farm 100 l/sec = 360 m3/hour
ÂÂ   Feeding period = 8 months
ÂÂ   FCR = 1.2
     This means:

    The ammonium concentration is above the maximum of 2 mg/l that is the limit
for trout farming.
    Adding oxygen and recirculating the water solves the issue of oxygen avail-
ability. In this way, the fish can be fed to ensure maximum growth. Through re-
circulation, the ammonium is kept in the system, which creates a new limiting
factorâ€”ammonium concentration.
   This issue can be resolved rather easily by adding a bio filter just before the
oxygenation step. The design of the bio filter depends on the water temperature,
ambient temperature, pump selection and field elevations in the fish farm, and lay-
out of the farm, and it is critical to hire a company with experience for the design
and construction of the bio filter.

      Conclusion

    The overall conclusion for scenarios 1 and 2 is that with the same fish farm,
    tanks/raceways, and flow of water, production goes from 8.7 metric tons to 90
    metric tons, simply with the addition of a pump, an oxygenator, and a bio filter.
    The operational cost increases the requirements in terms of working capital, but
    the cost price of a kilogram of trout decreases from â‚¬5.21 to â‚¬2.58 per kilogram
    of fish.



      7.4. Evaluation of fish feed
    Too often, the fish feed producer is selected based on feed price per kilogram.
This is only one part of the equation as fish growth is as important as the feed price.
In the end, the feed investment required to produce 1 kg of fish is very important.
   The best way to make a decision is to do parallel testing. This means that in
two or more separate tanks fish from the same batch are fed and evaluated at the
same time.
      An example of steps to be taken for such parallel testing is given below:
ÂÂ Grade one batch of fish.
ÂÂ From the same weight category, split the fish in two equal parts and divide them
   over two or more tanks of the same sizeâ€”same batch, same standing stock, and
   same density.
ÂÂ Feed the fish up to the level of saturation of the fish, which is when the fish are
   still eager to eat, but let less then when feeding began. Feeding up to the satu-
   ration point can make a difference in the feed supply between the two batches.
ÂÂ Record the amount of feed supplied and mortality (numbers and weight) per
   tank.


                                           45
ÂÂ Maintain feeding up to next             Figure 32: Fish growth and FCR
   grading moment.
ÂÂ Grade the fish per tank and de-
   termine per grade/category the
   numbers of fish per weight cat-
   egory.
ÂÂ For each tank calculate the fol-
   lowing:
   ÂÂ Growth in kilograms
   ÂÂ Feed given
   ÂÂ Feed conversion ratio (FCR)
   ÂÂ Feed cost per kilogram of fish
                                           Source: Author
   After calculating the cost price
per kilogram of fish, a feed supplier can be selected. The evaluation is done based
on the maximum growth tables of the pellet feed producers. Depending on a fish
farmerâ€™s ambition, the feed can be based on maximum growth or on an optimal
feed conversion ratio (FCR).
   The graph above depicts this relationship. In practice, the difference in feeding
between maximum growth and optimal FCR is not significant.


   7.5. Determine water flow
   There are many kinds of specialist measurement equipment that can measure
water flow precisely, but which are sometimes not available at a fish farm through-
out the year. The method described below has proven to be effective.
   Requirements:
ÂÂ Floating object (piece of wood)
ÂÂ Stopwatch
ÂÂ Measuring tape
   This method works with a constructed inlet channel with fixed dimensions as
shown in the image below.

   Determine flow velocity
    When placing a floating object into the water, the time required to travel a cer-
tain distance is measured. Determine the measuring distance: the longer the time
measurement, the more reliable it is. Place the object upstream before the start of
the measuring point so it can build speed. Start the stopwatch at the moment the
object passes the starting point and stop it when it passes the end.
  The less the floating object touches the wall, the more accurate the measure-
ment will be.

   1. INTRODUCTION
    Armeniaâ€™s principal competitive advantages in aquaculture are its unique loca-
tion in the high mountains, climate, and clean water resources, which are critical
for creating a reputation for clean antibiotic free products of high quality. To be
competitive in new markets, Armenia will need to address other critical factors,
including reducing the costs of production, producing specific product forms de-
manded by the market at a competitive price, meeting international standards for
safety and quality, developing a buyers network, and creating a trusted brand.
   This guide provides essential information to guide Armenian aquaculture pro-
ducers to enter and compete in new export markets for Armenian fish production.
The information is focused on markets where demand exists for specific forms of
trout and sturgeon:
ÂÂ Fresh and frozen Rainbow trout fillets to China, European Union (EU), United
   States (U.S.)
ÂÂ Fresh golden trout to China
ÂÂ Processed sturgeon steaks and loins to Asia
ÂÂ Potential new markets for sturgeon caviar in Asia.
   The guide provides the steps Armenian aquaculture producers can take to de-
velop a product that can compete and be profitable in these markets:

   2. PRODUCTION COST
    Table 2.1 below presents the breakeven point by cost per kilogram for fresh
and frozen Rainbow trout for China, the United States, and Armenia. Production
cost includes all inputsâ€”seed, feed, processing, packaging, and transportâ€”neces-
sary to get a product to a foreign market. It is apparent from the chart below that
Armenia has a cost of production disadvantage against fresh product in China and
USA, and frozen product in China. This does not take into account, however, that
China currently produces only limited amounts of trout for the live fish market
in the large population areas and that their production of large Rainbow trout
for sushi grade fillets is limited to the high mountain plateaus of Qinghai and are
costly to transport.
   In the United States, the water resources for Rainbow trout are no longer
available. The majority of U.S. production goes fresh into the market, and market
shortfall is met with large volumes of frozen fillets imported from South America.
Therefore, it is possible that Armenia will be able to compete in the large sushi
grade markets of China and in the frozen market of the United States.

* Note: The air transportation cost from Armenia indicated in the table is the price
of transporting fresh fish in passenger airplanes. The transportation cost for hiring a
cargo airplane would be significantly higher.
    Given its geographic location, transportation costs represent a strategic cost disad-
vantage for Armenian product, due to the need to use refrigerated trucks to transport
frozen product via Georgia for export in refrigerated containers, and for air transport

                                          50
from Yerevan for fresh product. Since alternative, cheaper transport options are not
available at this time, Armenian producers must focus on other strategies to increase
cost competitiveness, namely:

 Increase production efficiencies with increased yield and fillet size.

    Production yield increases when fish gain more weight per unit of feed provid-
ed. This ratio is called the feed conversion ratio, or FCR. The higher the quality of
feed, the more growth will be achieved per unit. The cost disadvantage for Armenia
is the added costs of importing feedâ€”customs duties, taxes, and, custom clearance
procedures. According to IFCâ€™s review of the aquaculture supply chain, customs
valuation procedures increase the price of feed by at least 10 percent to 15 percent.
The best way to reduce costs is to produce extruded feed locally with as many lo-
cally produced ingredients as possible, while improving production efficiencies at
the farm level and reforming the customs regime at the government level.
   Extruded feed has a higher FCR and remains suspended in the water column
long enough to be eaten by the fish before sinking. The following steps are neces-
sary for the development of a high quality local fish feed product:
ÂÂ Conduct an inventory of viable local feed ingredients, such as wheat, barley,
   and by-products from beer production.
ÂÂ Test a variety of â€œfeed formulasâ€ using local ingredients to assess their feed
   conversion ratios, compared to the high-quality imported pellet feeds now be-
   ing used.
ÂÂ Determine the costâ€“benefit of extrusion equipment to produce floating and
   slow sinking feed (including costs of import). Extruded feed is essential to the
   efficiency of net cage production because slow sinking and floating feed reduce
   feed residue. It can also be useful in limiting raceway residue and requires less
   filtration in recirculating systems designed for water conservation in raceway
   systems. Currently, a high rate of water flows through the raceways and is not
   recirculated, raising concerns about excess water usage and lack of proper wa-
   ter conservation.
ÂÂ Determine whether a newly constructed feed mill with extrusion equipment
   can produce high-quality feed at a lower cost than the cost of imported feed.
ÂÂ Assess cost competitiveness of feed produced with extrusion equipment. Con-
   duct pond trials comparing Armenian produced feed with imported feed to
   determine whether local feed improves the FCR and maintains or improves
   survival rates.
ÂÂ Determine whether larger fish yielding larger fillets can be produced with im-
   proved feed and production efficiencies.
   The technical aspects of new production methodologies and improving pro-
duction efficiencies are covered in a separate guide; however, they are mentioned
here because high production cost limits access to and competitiveness in export
markets.

3. PRODUCT FORM AND TARGETING
  NEW MARKETS
    Target markets determine product form. Product form is the central factor to
consider when targeting markets for Armenian product. To be competitive, Ar-
menian producers must be able to grow fish to market sizes and fillet and process
them to client specifications for different product forms. Consequently, the ability
to market different product forms is determined by the size and quality of fish that
can be produced, which in turn are determined by growth rates, FCR, and harvest
sizes.
   Most international markets are characterized by established preferences for
product forms, each defined by standards and client specifications that producers
must meet. Working back from the market, therefore, Armenian producers can
determine their capability to meet the standards for specific product forms and
remain competitive with other sellers in the market. The primary factors are size,
quality, and color:
ÂÂ Size: length, weight, fillet thickness, belly flap thickness, and cook yield
ÂÂ Quality: fillet moisture, fillet fat, and cooked fillet firmness
    All of these variables directly affect the price that can be captured for the final
product. Consequently, the growth curve of the fish is of high importance because
it determines harvesting end points where size and quality are optimized.

point for production planning and harvest end point to achieve larger sizes while
maintaining quality and cost effectiveness. The most common size for farm-raised

Rainbow trout is one pound or less for a pan-sized fillet. Larger fillets for Rain-
bow trout are less common, but carry a premium in the market. In the study cit-
ed, researchers evaluated the â€œgrowth performance and fillet quality attributes of
all-female Rainbow trout reared using freshwater recirculating systems operated at
a mean water temperature of 13Â°C, under constant lighting, and with around-the-
clock feeding.â€ The study found that:

  feeding to 22 months, but increased
  substantially from 23-25 months.

    Rainbow Trout. The largest U.S. producer and distributor of trout products
is Clear Spring Foods. Examples of Rainbow trout products being marketed by
Clear Spring Foods are shown below, including white fillets and value-added crust-
ed products that require more sophisticated processing.
     Clear Springs Foods (www.clearsprings.com) is seeking new production sourc-
es and currently have a joint venture in Argentina. The contact at Clear Springs
Foods, is Don E. Riffle, Executive VP of Global Supply Chain Development, don.
riffle@clearsprings.com. There is also sales potential with companies in the United
States that specialize in smoked fish; Rainbow trout is a popular smoked fish and
most of the smoked seafood companies are looking for new supplies of quality
fish. An example of a medium-sized company is Ducktrap River of Maine, www.
ducktrap.com, contact Jason.thibodeau@marineharvest.com.
   Sturgeon: Sturgeon is only marketed as whole fish to the Russian market or
produced and sold live in the Chinese market. All sizes of whole fish are sold to
Russia, and the common market size for live fish in China is a 500 to 750 gram

fish. Sturgeon is rarely seen in the European or U.S. market, but may have a sales
opportunity in processed form as loins or steaks. This market would have to be
explored at a Seafood Exposition with potential importers in the United States and
Europe.
    Production Volume: It is important for the producer to plan production to
consistently produce required quantities depending on the product form, volume,
and shipping method. Fresh product is shipped by air container. The standard
minimum size shipment for fresh product is the LD3 air cargo container fitting
approximately 1,000 kg in Styrofoam boxes, with water absorption pads placed in
the insulated cooler and exterior cardboard box, which are in turn placed in the air
container. Frozen product is packed in bulk plastic bags or in inner branded boxes,
which are then placed in master cases (15 to 20 kg), generally packed according to
buyersâ€™ specifications. These master cases are then placed in refrigerated 20 metric
ton containers (reefers) for maritime transport.

    4. MARKET PRICE
    Plan production for market competition. Market price can be determined by
pricing services such as Urner Barry in the US, (see link below), or checking com-
petitive online offers, such as through Alibaba (alibaba@service.alibaba.com). It
is helpful to see what products Asian processors and re-processors are offering on
the international market.
    Direct Sales: To illustrate how production factors play out in the market, be-
low is an example of a typical offer from a Peruvian producer of Rainbow trout
to a U.S. importer:
  Product: Premium Quality Fillets, Frozen, C Trim, IQF, PBO (Produced by
Owner), master carton 10 kg
    Fillet Size: 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11 oz.(1 oz = 28.3 gr)
    Price: US$8.47/Kg CFR Main USA port
   Indirect Sales: The following illustrates pricing by a U.S. importer selling to the
U.S. wholesale market:
    Country of Origin Colombia, Quote March, 2016:

    3/5 Â  Â  Â  Â  US$5.60/lb (US$12.32/kg)
    We vacuum pack for an additional US$0.15/lb (US$0.675kg)
    To compete with the Peruvian producer with the same product sizes, Armenian
producers would need to lower their production costs and increase efficiencies in
feed and production to influence the growth curve, size, and quality of their prod-
uct. To produce larger sizes that can be processed into larger fresh and frozen fillets,
existing systems in Armenia must be adapted to enhance the growth curve of the
fish, for example, by producing in raceways and finishing in large lake net cages.

   5. TARGET MARKET
    Alternative markets for Armenian aquatic products are likely to be those where
additional supply is needed because of water resource constraints in markets where
Armenia can cover the higher cost of air and maritime transportation. This will be
primarily the U.S. market for frozen product, followed by the China market for
fresh sushi grade large trout fillets, and other Asian markets, such as Malaysia, Sin-
gapore, and Hong Kong. Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong markets have the
level of disposable income that that could afford higher valued Armenia products,
especially sturgeon caviar.
    The following contacts are considered reliable and well-positioned companies
in Asia for Armenian producers:
    Singapore: Rong Yao Group, (PTE Ltd), Singapore http://www.rongyao.com.
sg/, contact Mr. Edmund Choo, Director of New Business Development, edmund-
chookl@gmail.com, edmundchoo@rongyao.com.sg. This group has multiple food
divisions, â€œFresh & Naturalâ€, â€œRong Yao Fisheriesâ€, â€œMeidi-Yaâ€, and distributed
to Food Service in Singapore and Hong Kong, and would be an excellent client
for sturgeon caviar, and possibly new product development of sturgeon loins and
steaks.

     European Union (EU). Armenia currently is in the process of getting EU cer-
tification for its aquaculture production, which is necessary in order to ship to
Europe. This is currently being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture of the
Armenian government, and is expected in 2016/2017. As in the Chinese market,
the original opening has to have input from the Armenian government. In addition,
the HACCP certifications and SSOP guidelines have to be in place for the process-
ing facilities placing the fish for export.
  In Europe, the principal salmonid species consumed is salmon produced in
Norway. Therefore, the smaller trout fillets are considered a lesser value species to

                                        57
the large salmon fillets. As illustrated by the chart below, consumption of sea-cap-
tured ground fish, small pelagic (sardine, Mackerel), tuna and the aquaculture bi-
valves surpass consumption of the salmon species.

    China: The following are some Chinese government agencies, for which facil-
itation by the government of Armenia is required to allow access to the Chinese
fish market:
   a.	 General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
       (AQSIQ). The government of Armenia, thought the Armenian Embassy in
       Beijing, must negotiate a Fisheries Protocol to establish the terms of trade
       between the two countries. http://english.aqsiq.gov.cn/
   b.	 Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). Once the Fisher-
       ies Protocol is in place, Armenian companies can register with CNCA, an
       independent agency that confirms compliance with the negotiated Fisheries
       Protocol and with sanitary and processing regulations (HACCP), to obtain
       a Certificate of Conformity. http://www.ccc-certificate.org/en/renzheng-
       jigou/guojiarenjianwei-cn
   c.	 Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Administration (QIC). Armenian
       companies must obtain an Inspection and Quarantine Certificate for all
       imported food products. http://en.ciqcid.com/

    Japan: The Japanese market is dominated by large trading companies such as
Mitsubishi Marine Products (http://www.mitsubishicorp.com/us/en/bg/ps/mp.ht-
ml) and Marubeni, (https://www.marubeni.com/business/life_industry/foods/).
They have specific product preferences and are best approached through estab-
lished contacts or off shore subsidiaries that may be interested in new sources of
product. Once a Japanese company has established a reliable source of high-value
product, with reliable delivery, they very seldom change suppliers. Price is not the
most important factor as it is in other markets. High quality and reliability of
supply are more highly valued. Contacts have to be made in person and time
spent at the Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, Japan, the worldâ€™s largest fish market. The
Japanese International Seafood and Technology Exposition (https://www.jetro.
go.jp/j-messe/tradefair_en/The18th_49214) also provides insight into the market,
however the marketing process is long and time consuming and entry into the
market is slow.

   Third-Party Quality and Sustainability Certifications
    Commercial buyers in the target markets often require specific quality and sus-
tainability certifications:

   8. BRANDING AND MARKETING
    Armenian producers must create a unique identity based on product origin and
a reputation for quality and safety in markets where major buyers do not presently
recognize Armenia as a producer of caviar and high-quality fish. Some of the char-
acteristics on which the Armenian aquaculture sector can build a brand include its
unique location, climate, and clean water resources.
     Most people in the United States and Asia do not know where Armenia is lo-
cated, or its geography or history. Armenia needs its own â€œcountry brand,â€ such
as â€œBoston Lobster,â€ a generic name for Homrus Americanus recognized in China
even when it comes from both the United States and Canada. It is characterized by
its two large claws, bright red color when boiled, and rich taste. The highest value
lobster with the best quality is Clearwaterâ€™s product from Canada. This company
was able to change the generic name â€œBoston Lobsterâ€ when it applied for and
received a patent to shrink wrap the claw with the Clearwater brand indicating
Canadian origin. This branding allows the company to receive a premium for its
lobsters.
    Armeniaâ€™s brand can be built on its high mountain location, fresh water sourc-
es, and unique culture and history, with a distinctive name and visual trademark
that is both recognized and that evokes Armenia, such as Mt. Ararat. Just creating
an attractive trademark, however, will create no value unless it represents quality
production. This is generally done by a market leader that distinguishes its pro-
duction from all other producers in the market by name and visual trademark.

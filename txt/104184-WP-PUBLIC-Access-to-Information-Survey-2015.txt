                                                    2015

During the period of July 21st, 2015 through September 15th, 2015, the World Bank (“Bank?) conducted
its fifth annual Access to Information Survey (“2015 AI Survey?). The Bank directed the 2015 AI Survey
to all members of the public who had electronically submitted an access to information (“AI?) request to
the Bank during the period of July 21st, 2015 through September 15th, 2015.

The 2015 AI Survey sought to obtain public feedback that could help the institution assess the public’s
satisfaction with the Bank’s AI systems and processes, and identify opportunities to improve. Out of 394
requesters, 149 (37.8%) responded to the survey.

Similar to the prior surveys, the 2015 AI Survey focused on three specific areas: (i) the adequacy of the
Bank’s information systems; (ii) the quality of the Bank’s service in support of the public’s requests for
information; and (iii) the ability of the Bank to meet the requesters’ information needs. As highlighted
below, the survey results show that the public’s overall satisfaction levels in 2015 were relatively higher
than its corresponding values in 2014.

In 2015, 79% of the survey responses (76% in 2014) rated the adequacy of the Bank’s information
systems in the satisfactory range. With respect to the Bank’s quality of service, 72% of the survey
responses in 2015 (57% in 2014) gave the Bank a rating in the satisfactory range. Lastly, with respect to
the Bank’s ability to meet the requesters’ information needs, 79% of the survey responses in 2015 (71%
in 2014) rated the Bank in the satisfactory range.

Alike the past two AI Surveys, in the “quality of service? category, the 2015 AI Survey gave particular
focus to those survey respondents who had their requests denied by the Bank. The chart below provides a
summary of the survey respondents’ satisfaction levels in the three areas.

The 2015 Survey also requested survey respondents to provide comments on their satisfaction. The
comments can be categorized under each topic as follows:

    1. Adequacy of the World Bank’s information systems:

            i.     accessibility of information in information systems;
            ii.    speed of response;
            iii.   sufficiency of information available on website;
            iv.    ease of searching and navigating through information categories in website;
            v.     availability of older/historical material;
            vi.    availability of requested information;
            vii.   Accessibility and usability of the AI request form.

    2. The World Bank’s quality of service in support of the public’s requests for information:

            i.     general satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the answer provided by the Bank;
            ii.    competency and professionalism of Bank staff;
            iii.   speed of response;
            iv.    availability and accessibility of requested information; and
            v.     information available in multiple languages.

    3. The World Bank’s ability to meet the requesters’ information needs:

            i.     general satisfaction/dissatisfaction;
            ii.    availability of information on Bank’s website / Archives files;
            iii.   response time / responsiveness;
            iv.    consistency between information requested and received;
            v.     ability to search and navigate information categories in the Bank’s website;
            vi.    direct communication with Bank staff members; and
            vii.   information available in multiple languages.

Additionally, survey respondents who had their requests denied but chose not to file an appeal were asked
the reason why they did not appeal. For those who had their denial upheld by the Access to Information
Committee, the 2015 AI Survey also sought to ascertain why some requesters chose not to file a second
level appeal.

The survey respondents were also asked to provide information about their demographics, the topics
related to their information requests, and how they have used the information obtained from the Bank.

 following six options: Satisfied, Somewhat Satisfied, Somewhat Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Don’t Know and Not

an appeal to the AIC, and their views are responsive to the question, those appeals may not have all been filed
within the period for the 2015 AI Survey. This should be taken into account when considering the overall results.

 On the AI Surveys from 2011 to 2013, the questions and data were aggregated into two unevenly distributed categories: a) Total
– Satisfied: comprising Very Satisfied, Satisfied, and Somewhat Satisfied ratings (3 scale points) b) Total – Dissatisfied:
comprising Dissatisfied and Very Dissatisfied ratings (2 scale points). To increase accuracy, starting on 2014 the questions and
data were aggregated into two evenly distributed categories: a) Total – Satisfied: comprising Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied (2
scale points) b) Total – Dissatisfied: comprising Somewhat Dissatisfied and Dissatisfied (2 scale points) The change in scale may
impact the overall satisfaction results compared to previous results.

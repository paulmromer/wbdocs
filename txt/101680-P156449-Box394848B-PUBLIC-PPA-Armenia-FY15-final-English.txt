1.1.    This report examines Armenia’s experience in reducing poverty and raising the welfare of
the least well-off in the country in the years since 2009. What households spend on consumption is an
indicator of their welfare. As the economy recovered from crisis, the least well-off enjoyed some growth
in consumption spending, but not as much as in the years up to 2009. Moreover, growth has become less
pro-poor in relative terms because the less well-off enjoyed lower growth in consumption than the better-
off. As a result, although consumption did translate into a reduction in poverty, inequality is now higher
than before 2009. In 2013, 32 percent of Armenia’s population lived below the national poverty line – a
poverty rate higher than in pre-crisis years but down from the high of 35.8 percent in 2010. In fact,
between 2012 and 2013, poverty reduction seems to have stalled. This report looks at the micro and
macro aspects of Armenia’s poverty reduction experience to (a) describe the key features of post-crisis
poverty, inequality, and consumption growth; (b) examine the drivers of poverty reduction in this period;
and (c) explore reasons why future growth might not be as pro-poor as in the past.

1.2.     In Armenia growth of the economy slowly resumed after the recession of 2009 but it has not
yet reached the levels seen before the crisis (Figure 1). Up to 2009 Armenia’s real GDP had been
growing at an average rate of 11.8 percent. The economic crisis broke this pattern, and in 2009 GDP went
down by 14.1 percent. After a fiscal stimulus helped jump-start economic growth, real GDP growth rose
to 7.2 percent in 2012 before slowing to 3.5 percent in 2013 and 3.4 percent in 2014. The trend was
similar for growth in per capita GDP, which averaged 4.3 percent for 2010–13. Growth in this period was
characterized by shrinking construction output and positive growth in services and agriculture. Growth in
services was driven mainly by trade, information and communication, finance, insurance, food service,
and recreation. Agricultural growth touched 8 percent in 2013, and although adverse weather hit the
sector hard that year growth was stimulated by state assistance programs, such as free seed and subsidies
to farmers for fuel and fertilizer (ADB 2014). The small contribution from industrial growth (excluding
construction) was due to mining, quarrying, and the production of pharmaceuticals, food, and beverages.
The government’s new export-oriented industrial development strategy is expected to push up the
contribution of industry to GDP. In 2014 growth was dragged down by construction, mining, and energy,
but it was also affected by the economic contraction in Russia, lower remittances and foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows, and reduced export earnings. These factors are expected to keep growth low in
the next few years as well.

1.3.   In the last 10 years, the structure of GDP shifted away from industry toward services
(Figure 2). In Soviet days, Armenia’s economy was highly industrialized, and industry has been

                                                                5
dominant in recent years as well. In 2000 the share of agricultural value-added in GDP was 26 percent
and by 2005 it was down to 20 percent; in 2013 agricultural value-added was 22 percent. Meanwhile, the
share of industry (mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, water, and gas) grew substantially
over the decade, rising from 39 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2006. Since the crisis, the share of
industry has declined and the share of services in GDP has gone up notably. In 2013, services accounted
for 47 percent of GDP, industry for 31 percent, and agriculture for 22 percent. These structural shifts are
visible in the changing sources of growth; depending on how employment patterns respond to these shifts,
they may have implications for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

1.4.     Personal remittances as a share of GDP have risen since the crisis (Figure 3). Measured as a
share of GDP, such flows to Armenia are among the highest in the world. In 2013, remittances were 21
percent of GDP, up from a low of 16 percent just before the crisis hit the economy. Lagged Russian GDP
has the largest impact on remittances flows to Armenia because so many of the remitters work in Russia
(IMF 2012). Remittances are important for the Armenian economy because they drive private
consumption and thus raise aggregate demand. Some researchers argue that large remittances inflows can
also adversely affect the labor market, on both the demand side, by encouraging growth of non-tradable
rather than export-oriented sectors, and the supply side, by discouraging work. According to the Russian
Central Bank (RCB), in the last quarter of 2014 remittances to Armenia (in U.S. dollars) fell by 31
percent because of Russia’s economic downturn and the depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar
(World Bank 2015).

1.5.    The resumption of growth after the deep recession in 2009 is credited to fiscal stimulus; as
the economy recovered, fiscal policy then switched from stimulus to consolidation while protecting
and extending pro-poor spending. Armenia increased social spending in response to the crisis; in
particular pensions and transfers for targeted social assistance (the Family Benefit Program, FBP) went
up. Pensions consist of contributory old-age pensions (linked to years of service and the largest category
in terms of number of pensioners), pensions for disability, and privileged and survivor pensions (Table 1).
Between 2008 and 2013 the basic monthly pension doubled in nominal terms from AMD 6,800 to AMD
13,000—an increase in pension income that has important implications for poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. When Armenia’s spending and tax policies were analyzed using 2011 data (applying the

                                                              6
Commitment to Equity methodology of Lustig et al. (2013); see World Bank (2014a), it was found that
Armenia’s fiscal activities led to significant redistribution as measured by a reduction in the Gini
coefficient. However, the effect is mostly driven by contributory pensions, which are not targeted but
have the largest budget of all social expenditures. The analysis also calculated the extent to which fiscal
spending and revenues reduced poverty. The main finding is that even though transfers are reasonably
well-targeted, taxes, especially indirect taxes, fall on poorer households and offset the poverty-reducing
effects of public spending. In fact in Armenia, fiscal activities cause a significant amount of downward as
well as upward movement among the poor or near-poor—much more so than in Latin American countries
where similar analyses have been completed.

1.7.     This Poverty Assessment examines the recent trends in poverty reduction and shared
prosperity and complements the analysis of poverty and social indicators conducted by the National
Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia (NSSRA) each year. The 2014 Social Snapshot and
Poverty in Armenia (NSSRA 2014), an annual assessment published by the NSSRA, analyzes trends in
consumption poverty and other social and economic indicators with 2008 as the reference year. The SSPA
report analyzes in detail consumption poverty indicators and their trends and the profile of poverty in

                                                                7
terms of vulnerable groups, such as rural households and children. The 2014 SSPA also reported how
Armenia performed on a pilot multi-dimensional poverty index developed and first analyzed by the World
Bank (2014b). Using household data from the Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), this report
seeks to add to the analysis in the SSPA and extend the analysis in the FY14 Poverty Assessment report
by reviewing the nature of post-crisis poverty reduction and exploring reasons why growth has not been
as pro-poor as in the past (sections 2 and 3). The analysis identifies three factors that shaped the pattern of
poverty reduction and the pro-poor nature of growth in 2010–13: the structure of the domestic labor
market, remittances from migrant workers abroad, and social transfers, especially pension income. The
report concludes with discussion of what the findings imply for future poverty reduction (section 4).


                                                           2. Recent Developments
Growth in Household Consumption

2.1.    The resumption of aggregate growth after the crisis translated into growth of household
consumption spending, with consumption growing faster for the better-off than the less well-off,
unlike pre-crisis consumption growth (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). Between 2004 and 2007, when
growth was averaging 13 percent, poverty was halved, from 55 percent to 26 percent, average
consumption grew at 6.9 percent, and the entire distribution experiencing a growth in consumption
(Figure 4A). The bottom 20 experienced slightly lower consumption growth rates at about 5.5 percent per
year but in general growth seems to have been pro-poor. Between 2010 and 2013, the growth of
consumption spending averaged 4.07 percent, not far off average per capita GDP growth of about 4.3
percent. However, the incidence of growth was uneven across the welfare distribution (Figure 4B).
Between 2010 and 2013 although everyone enjoyed some growth in consumption, but for the better-off it
was above the average.

2.2.    The World Bank has recently adopted an indicator to directly capture the distribution of
growth; the shared prosperity indicator is defined as the growth in average consumption of the
bottom 40 percent of the distribution. Since Armenia’s poverty rate is about 30 percent, the bottom 40
mostly consists of the poor. Figure 5 shows Armenia’s performance on the shared prosperity indicator,
which is calculated using consumption spending harmonized for international comparisons. The patterns


                                                                               8
align with the growth incidence curve in Figure 4. Between 2007 and 2013, average consumption grew
for all Armenians by 1.7 percent a year, but by just 1.14 percent for the bottom 40 percent. Before the
crisis, the bottom 40 percent had enjoyed annual growth in mean consumption of 4.29 percent, above the
national average of 3.50 percent. The 2009 contraction of the economy hit the bottom 40 percent hard:
their consumption was reduced by 7.46 percent a year—a contraction worse than that of the economy as a
whole. Between 2010 and 2013, mean consumption of the bottom 40 percent grew at 2.11 percent,
slightly below the 3 percent growth enjoyed by the population as a whole, and in 2012 and 2013 growth
in mean consumption of the bottom 40 was essentially zero, even as average growth in consumption was
2.15 percent. It appears from the shared prosperity indicator that in the post-crisis recovery, the least well-
off Armenians are not benefiting as much as others.

2.3.    The comparison with countries in Europe and Central Asia (Figure 6) puts Armenia’s
shared prosperity performance in perspective: households in Armenia had almost the lowest
consumption growth for the bottom 40. Figure 6 compares Armenia’s performance on shared
prosperity between 2008 and 2013 with that of select countries in Europe and Central Asia. Even though
the time period differs slightly across countries, the numbers suggest that in Armenia, unlike other
countries in the region, neither the bottom 40 nor the total distribution saw any major increases in their
consumption.

Inequality

2.4.    Since the crisis inequality has worsened. Unequal distribution of consumption in a population
can deter the transmission of growth to poverty reduction. The Gini coefficient, the most commonly
reported measure of inequality, ranges from 0 (complete equality) to 100 (complete inequality), although
for consumption spending it is typically in the range of 30 to 50. In Armenia, the Gini coefficient for
consumption spending went up from 24.2 in 2008 to 26.9 in 2012 and 27 in 2013, indicating that
inequality had widened since the crisis, which was consistent with the growth pattern. Despite this
increase in inequality, the Gini coefficient for consumption is lower than was typical internationally.1
Income tends to be more unequally distributed than consumption and this is the case in Armenia as well:
in 2013 the Gini for income was 37.2, up from 33.9 in 2008.

Poverty Reduction in International Perspective

2.5.     Although Armenia’s performance on poverty reduction is noteworthy, other countries in
the region have done even better (Figure 7). To facilitate cross-country comparison of poverty, the
World Bank computes harmonized consumption aggregates using the latest available household survey
data.2 These measures are based on a methodology that differs from the national poverty calculation
methodology. Poverty is calculated by comparing these harmonized aggregates against regional poverty
lines of US$1.25, US$2.50, and US$5 per person per day (adjusted using 2005 purchasing power parity).
Comparisons over time show that poverty in Armenia fell steeply between 2001 and 2008; poverty at
US$2.50 per person per day fell from 67 percent in 2001 to 26 percent in 2008, though it increased after
the crisis. Cross-country comparisons show that in 2013, 30 percent of Armenia’s population lived on less
than US$ 2.50 per person per day, a poverty rate lower than in Georgia and Kyrgyz Republic but higher
than in Kosovo and Moldova.




1
  One reason for the low estimated Gini for consumption spending may be that better off-households chose not to
participate in the survey. As part of the fiscal incidence analysis undertaken for World Bank’s 2014 Armenia Public
Expenditure Review (2014a), an exercise was undertaken to simulate the Gini (and poverty rates) if “selection -out?
by richer households were taken into account. The simulation found that the Gini measure increases significantly
when top incomes are included.
2
  The differences between the national and ECA-harmonized poverty rates lie in differences in the consumption
aggregates used and application of adult equivalence in the national measure compared to per capita in the ECA-
harmonized measure.

2.6.     Armenia’s comparative performance in reducing poverty has deteriorated. In a cumulative
distribution of poverty changes for different countries, poverty reduction at US$2.50 per person per day in
Armenia was in the past the best in the world: its performance in reducing poverty was better than
roughly 98 percent of all poverty changes observed. Recently, its performance in reducing poverty has
fallen to the 73rd percentile internationally. Although pre-crisis Armenia managed to reduce poverty
significantly, from 2009 on the share of households living on less than US$2.50 was relatively constant
(Figure 8). Between 2001 and 2008, the poverty headcount measured at the regional poverty line of
US$2.50 dropped from 67.1 percent in 2001 to 26.0 percent in 2008; since 2009, poverty in Armenia has
remained above 30 percent. Poverty projections for 2015 and 2016 suggest that due to sluggish economic
recovery and increasing uncertainty, poverty is likely to stay close to 30 percent.

Poverty Reduction from the National Perspective

2.7.     As growth resumed after the 2009 recession, the share of those living below the national
poverty line declined but poverty is still far from the low pre-crisis rates (Figure 9). Between 2004
and 2008, Armenia had halved poverty, but after the crisis, in 2013, 32 percent of the population lived
below the national poverty line, defined in terms of consumption expenditure of AMD 39,193 per adult
equivalent per month. In 2010 the incidence of poverty peaked at 35.8 percent. As the economy recovered
after 2009, poverty at first increased in both level and depth and has declined only moderately in recent
years. In 2010, the poverty gap –measuring how far poor people are from the poverty line - was also high
at 8.1 percent of the poverty line. The squared poverty gap, which measures the severity of poverty
among the poor, declined from a high of 2.5 percent in 2010 to 1.7 percent in 2013. Extreme poverty,
those living below the food poverty line of AMD 22,993 per adult equivalent per month, was 2.7 percent
in 2013, down from a high of 3.7 percent in 2011. Though the level, depth, and severity of poverty have
declined in 2010, it is worrying that from 2012 to 2013 there were almost no gains in poverty reduction or
its depth and severity.

2.8.    As the pace of poverty reduction has slowed post-crisis, analysis of economic mobility shows
some people moving into and out of poverty between 2010 and 2013 (Table 2). Using synthetic panel
methodology (Dang and Lanjouw 2013) to explore movements in and out of poverty over the period, it
appears that about 41.5 percent of households changed poverty status between 2010 and 2013: 16.5
percent were non-poor in 2010 but poor in 2013 and 25 percent of the poor in 2010 moved out of poverty
by 2013. About 10 percent of the population remained persistently poor over the four-year period. A pilot
multidimensional poverty index developed for Armenia (and analyzed in World Bank 2014b and NSSRA
2014) captures the complexity of poverty and also sheds light on subgroups in the population that are
more likely to experience persistent or chronic poverty (Box 1).

and reported in World Bank (2014b) and NSSRA
(2014) measures deprivations in terms of
education, health, employment, housing, and
extreme poverty. The MPI is a composite index
that shows the number of people who are suffering
deprivations in more than one-third of the
indicators. A comparison of poverty using the MPI
and consumption poverty (see Battiston, Diego et                                     24.37
al. (2013)) can be informative in understanding

A second group of households is multi-dimensionally poor but lives above the upper national poverty line (8.89
percent in 2013). The deprivations make them more vulnerable to falling into poverty if their household
experiences a shock. A third group of households does not experience multiple deprivations but still lives below
the upper national poverty line (24.37 percent). Unlike the first and second groups, these households have
adequate education, health, and housing, but often work in low-productivity jobs.

2.9.    Urban areas outside the capital city and four of the regions have poverty rates that exceed
the national average (Figures 10 and 11). Economic activity tends to be concentrated in the capital,
Yerevan, which in 2010 accounted for more than half of national GDP and about one-third of the
population (Eiweida and Kostanyan, 2014). Urban areas outside Yerevan experience higher poverty rates
than rural areas or Yerevan (Figure 10). After the recession in 2009, poverty rose in all three areas, but
rose the most in percentage point terms in cities outside Yerevan; these cities also experienced the largest
decline in poverty between 2010 and 2013. In 2013, 39 percent of residents in other urban areas were
poor, compared to 31.7 percent of rural residents and 25.5 percent of those living in Yerevan. Across

economic regions (marzes) poverty declined post-crisis everywhere except Tavush marz (Figure 11). In
2013, regional poverty rates ranged from 21.0 percent in Vayots Dzor (with 1.2 percent of the poor and
1.9 percent of population) to 45.9 percent in Shirak (with 12.1 percent of poor and 8.4 percent of the
population). In Sjunik marz, which is the center of mining, which employs a large share of the residents,
the poverty rate in 2013 was among the lowest in the country at 25 percent. Four regions, Lori, Kotayk,
Gegharkunik, and Shirak, have nearly 46 percent of the poor, though they account for only 36 percent of
the total population. The dominant economic activity (as measured by sectoral share in regional output)
differs across these four regions: agriculture is dominant in Gegharkunik and Shirak and industry
(manufacturing and mining) in Lori and Kotayk. These regional differences in poverty rates likely reflect
a range of factors, such as types of economic activity, connectivity and availability of basic infrastructure,
and topography. However, working at the marz level it is difficult to identify underlying patterns at play
and sub-marz variations would be important to analyze. The poverty map currently being prepared will
facilitate a better understanding on these regional patterns of poverty.

2.10. To better study the spatial correlates of poverty, and to inform geographic targeting of
development projects to communities within Armenia’s 11 economic regions, the World Bank and
the NSSRA are drafting a new poverty map. Several government initiatives currently use a
vulnerability index calculated at the lowest administrative level (communities) to target interventions (for
example, micro investments financed by the Armenia Social Investment Fund). Poverty mapping can also
be used for geographic targeting because it helps in estimating consumption poverty at administrative
units below the marz level. Because the ILCS sampling design does not allow for accurately measuring
consumption poverty at the community level, poverty mapping combines information from households in
the ILCS survey and from the population census to estimate poverty at the sub-marz level. The last
poverty map for Armenia was created in 2007 using household survey data from 2004 and the population
census of 2001 (World Bank 2007). The map now being prepared uses the results of the 2011, 2012, and
2013 ILCSs and will link to the 2011 census.

2.11. The pace of poverty reduction has slowed, and the profile of poverty has not changed much.
As in past years, in 2013the poor were more likely to (1) live in urban areas outside the capital; (2) have
larger households with more children; (3) have less education; and (4) live in households headed by
women; and (5) they are less likely to be employed and more likely to be out of the labor force or
unemployed. For example, in 2013 29 percent of the poor lived in households headed by women,
compared to only 24 percent of the non-poor. Average household size (number of members living in the
household) among the poor is 5.21, compared to 4.23 for the non-poor. Educational attainment among
those 15 and older is generally high, with most Armenians having secondary (basic or special) education,
but the share with tertiary education varies by poverty status: 14 percent of the poor compared to 26
percent of the non-poor. The average number of children is also higher in poor households. Regression
results (Table 3) confirm that even after controlling for the socioeconomic characteristics of households,
those headed by women are significantly more likely to be poor; and the higher the number of employed
family members, the lower the probability that the household falls below the poverty line. As expected,
households headed by an individual with tertiary education are significantly less likely to be poor. The
poverty profile changed in some respects between 2010 and 2013. One difference is that households with
heads that have had special secondary education (technical and vocational education and training) were
less likely to be poor in 2010 but not in 2013.

2.12. The structure of household income differs in poor and non-poor households (Figure 12).
Between 2010 and 2013, the sources of income did not change for either type. Large aggregate remittance
inflows are visible in the 10 percent share of remittances in the average income of the non-poor (Figure
12). For the poor, the share of remittances in income is a much lower 5 percent. This poor –non-poor
pattern reflects both the poverty-reducing impact of remittances and the skill level of emigrants from poor
and non-poor households. Pensions, which went up starting in 2009, account for a large share of income
for both poor and non-poor households. Labor earnings (wage or self-employment) are the largest source
of income for both the poor and the non-poor. The fact that for the poor labor earnings still account for
nearly half of all income suggests that they are mainly employed in sectors (such as agriculture and
certain services) that do not pay enough to help people escape poverty. The report discusses next how
these macro-micro patterns likely came together to reduce poverty in a less pro-poor growth environment.

3.1.     Decomposing the 3.8 percentage point reduction in national poverty into growth and
distributional components confirms that although consumption growth contributed substantially to
poverty reduction, it was counterbalanced by a change in the distribution of consumption spending
(Figure 13). Growth favored the better-off. Although between 2010 and 2013, consumption growth by
itself would have brought poverty down considerably (a simulated 20 percentage point reduction), a
change in consumption distribution favoring the better-off counterbalanced the growth effect, dampening
the net reduction in poverty to only 3.8 percentage points.

into (a) the change in poverty due to an increase in mean consumption expenditure for a given distribution; b) the change in
poverty due to a change in the distribution of consumption expenditure for a given level of mean expenditure.



3.2.    What was driving poverty reduction between 2010 and 2013? A decomposition analysis that
links household consumption expenditures to their sources shows that labor income (employment and
earnings), pensions, agricultural incomes, and remittances were the main drivers of poverty reduction
between 2010 and 2013 (Figure 14).3 Post-crisis, domestic labor market conditions helped bring poverty
down. Growth in the share of adult household members who were employed and in their earnings
(including self-employment income) was the leading source of poverty reduction. Growth in remittances
from Armenians who emigrated, most to Russia, also helped to reduce poverty. Among non-earned
sources of income, higher pensions were also important. Changes in other sources of non-earned income,
such as unemployment benefits and social assistance transfers (targeted and non-targeted), did not do
much to reduce poverty reduction in this period. Demographic change between 2010 and 2013 led to a
small increase in the share of household members of non-working ages, which did not contribute to
poverty reduction.

Note: Based on the micro decomposition of poverty change, negative numbers indicate that the factor helped to reduce poverty,
positive numbers that the factor had the opposite effect. The effect of the consumption-to-income ratio is not shown; this ratio
can be considered to represent household savings as well as measurement error; in the micro decomposition for the figure, when
all other sources of income were kept constant, the ratio had the effect of raising poverty.


3.3.     To understand why growth post-recovery favored the better-off, drivers of growth in
consumption spending across the distribution were compared; pension income and remittances
stand out for their effect on consumption by the better-off (Figure 15). Figure 4.B shows that the
better-off (top 60 percent of the distribution) experienced higher growth in consumption than did the less-
well-off (bottom 40). Figure 15 shows that the drivers of consumption growth differ across the
distribution. For consumption growth, growth in the share of household members employed mattered
more for the bottom 40 than the top 60. Labor earnings and agricultural income had a similar effect.
Growth in remittances (mainly from Russia) and growth in pension income (driven by the government’s
decision to raise basic pensions) mattered more for consumption growth for the top 60 percent. For the
poorest 40 percent, consumption grew because both earnings and the share of household members
employed grew. For this less-well-off group, interestingly, income from the FBP, which is poverty-
targeted social assistance, declined post-crisis; this likely reflects a reduction in the scope of the program
between 2010 and 2013. Thus, differential consumption growth and erosion of pro-poor growth (in a
relative sense) seem to be rooted in growth in pension income and remittances and a reduction in poverty-
targeted social assistance.

3.4.    Bringing the macro context and the micro analysis together is the next step in
understanding poverty reduction in Armenia. Outcomes in the domestic labor market, remittances
from workers abroad, and social transfers (mainly pensions) have been identified as important factors
underpinning poverty reduction performance after the 2009 crisis and the extent to which growth was or
was not pro-poor or not.

The Domestic Labor Market

3.5.    The labor market showed some improvements between 2010 and 2013 (Table 4). The labor
force participation rate went up from 61.0 to 63.4 percent, mainly because more women (up from 52 to 56
percent) and urban residents (56 to 58 percent) were participating. Employment rates also rose for all
workers (from 49.6 percent to 53.2 percent), and the unemployment rate fell from 19 to 16.2 percent. In
2013 urban unemployment was still high at 23.4 percent, but the female unemployment rate at 18 percent
was higher than the men’s 14.4 percent. It is not clear what drove the increase in women’s labor force
participation and employment. It may be that growth in the services sector is pulling women into the labor
market.

3.6.    Despite overall low employment and high unemployment, wages have gone up in Armenia.
The employment rate suggests that the economy underutilizes its labor resources, yet despite the slack in
the labor market, in some sectors real wages have been growing (see below), underpinned by an increase
in the minimum wage. Rising wages are reflected in the role of earnings in reducing poverty (Figure 14).
The minimum wage increased from AMD 30,000 per month (US$62; AMD 22,912 in real 2005 AMD) to
AMD 45,000 per month (US$93; AMD 29,424 in real 2005 AMD). Correspondingly, the average
nominal gross wage rose from AMD 102,652 (US$212; AMD 78,401 in real 2005 AMD) to AMD
146,524 (US$303.78; AMD 95,809 in 2005 AMD). These work out to an annual increase in real terms
between 2010 and 2013 of 8 percent for the minimum wage and 6 percent for the average gross wage.

3.7.    The sectoral composition of employment is well aligned with the rise of the services sector as
the main contributor to GDP, and the non-poor have a higher presence in services, which enables
them to benefit from the new sectoral growth structure (Figure 16). Among the employed in 2013,
services (46.8 percent) accounted for the largest share, followed by agriculture (36.1 percent), and then
industry (17 percent). Services also account for the largest share of employment for the non-poor, so that
they benefit from this dominant source of GDP growth. The share of the poor in agriculture employment
has declined as jobs in services have grown. The poor have a higher share of industry employment than
do the non-poor. The recent adoption of an export-oriented government development strategy for industry
could affect its share of employment. Agriculture, which is benefitting from public investment but
contributes only 20 percent to GDP, is no longer the largest employer of the poor but still employs 40
percent of the poor and 36 percent of the non-poor.

3.8.    The composition of non-agricultural employment differs between the poor and the non-poor
(Figure 17A and 17B). In 2013 manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and education/health/social
services each accounted for 10 percent of total employment. As expected, the poor have little or no
presence in sectors associated with high skills, such as financial intermediation and public administration
(6 percent in 2013). Construction continues to employ a notable share of the poor (7 percent) despite the

reduction in its output in recent years. For the non-poor, public administration, education/health/social
services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade each account for about 10 percent of employment
share. There were also interesting changes between 2010 and 2013, when among the poor the share of
employment in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and education/health services increased.
Among the non-poor the share of public administration and manufacturing increased over this period.
Consistent with the steep decline in construction output, the share of construction sector employment
declined for both poor and non-poor.

3.9.     Between 2010 and 2013, real hourly wages grew in most sectors (Figure 18).4 The number of
workers employed in agriculture declined by 2.7 percent a year between 2010 and 2013, and the shedding
of workers appears to be pushing up hourly wages (2013 was also a good year of agriculture output).
Meanwhile, employment in construction also plunged, by 8 percent a year, while wages grew by 1
percent a year. In 2007, at the peak of construction- driven growth, the sector employed 91,000 workers;
by 2013 the number was down to 66,000. For industry (mainly manufacturing) and trade and tourism, real
wages tracked growth in employment. For manufacturing, this pattern could reflect the 2012 government
decision to emphasize certain export- oriented industries. The transport and communication and financial
services sectors experienced some growth in employment and real wages. For this analysis public
administration and education/ health/social services are bundled together; this is the only group that
experienced a reduction in the growth of real wages. The residual sector consisting of arts and
entertainment, private households, and a few other sectors saw dramatic growth in employment but a
reduction in real wages.

3.10. Despite the positive trends in the domestic labor market, some concerns are emerging. The
share in total paid employment in non-agriculture sectors has remained unchanged; almost all the rise in
the share of non-agricultural employment comes from the increase in those who are self-employed from
5.5 to 7 percent of all employment (65,000 in 2010; 77,900 in 2013). For urban job seekers who face an
unemployment rate of 23 percent (almost 1 in 4), in 2013 the average job search had lasted 21 months
(NSSRA 2014) on average—23.7 months for women and 16 for men. Long job searches and more
workers self-employed suggest problems of skills mismatches and low net job creation. The latter is
certainly a factor. The NSSRA Statistical Yearbook reported that in 2013, employers planned to hire
1,514 workers by year-end, and there were 38 applications for every vacancy advertised. About 63
percent of the unemployed have work experience; most had been laid off due to job reduction and
company liquidation or bankruptcy or termination of temporary work. Skills mismatches look likely
given that 22 percent of the job seekers with prior work experience had tertiary education and another 26
percent had specialized secondary education.

Remittances from Workers Abroad

3.11. Poverty reduction and the incidence of growth in Armenia are also shaped by international
labor markets through remittances. Between 2010 and 2013, nearly 8 percent of Armenian households
had working-age members who had migrated to areas within or outside the country (NSSRA 2014). Sixty
percent of male and 25 percent of female migrants had moved in search of work. Russia is the destination
of choice for almost 90 percent of those who leave to seek jobs and many are employed in construction.
While most migrants, like most other Armenians, have secondary education, a notable share of migrants,
about 30 percent of those employed in industry or retail trade, have tertiary education (Figure 19).
Remittances go to 10 percent of poor Armenian households and 16 percent of non-poor households (see
Figure 12). Some of the differential in the coverage of remittances is driven by the skills of the migrants
who remit as well as the poverty-reducing effect of remittances. The current high inflows of remittances,
while good for aggregate demand and for families, may also be influencing the labor market in two ways
that are detrimental to the prospects of inclusive growth based on high employment: (1) remittances could
discourage those of working-age from seeking employment, and (2) exchange rate appreciation due to
remittance inflows can make exports less profitable, pushing jobs into non-tradable sectors. Karapetyan

and Harutyunyan (2013) found evidence for such patterns in Armenia that merit further examination for
their implications for future poverty reduction.

Pensions and Social Transfers

3.12. In Armenia pensions and other social assistance are important social protection programs
that are also significant sources of income for households. Although well-targeted, the FBP is a small
social assistance program. FBP transfers account for nearly 10 percent of the income of poor households,
and 60 percent of the benefit reaches the poor. Nevertheless, FBP transfers did not help reduce poverty
between 2010 and 2013. Pensions are universal and individuals become eligible to receive them in case of
income loss. The most common pension types are old age and disability pensions. Currently, the
pensionable age is 63 for both women and men and the share of pension age-workers is about 12 percent
of the population (67 percent of the population is of working age). Pensions account for 27 percent of the
income for poor households and 20 percent for non-poor households. The coverage of pensions is also
high across the consumption distribution (Figure 20). Almost 90 percent of the bottom quintile lives in a
household that receives pensions, although coverage declines to 33 percent for the richest quintile. The
old age pension may be either social or contributory (linked to years of service); the share of those
receiving a contributory pension is likely higher among the better-off. Pension income is an important
driver of not only poverty reduction but also the income growth of the top 60. As Table 1 shows, the
government significantly raised the pension amounts in the years after the crisis, and the poverty-reducing
effects are clear. However, it is important to note that pension-income growth has favored the better-off
who receive contributory pensions.

                                           4. Conclusion
4.1.    Limited poverty reduction and less shared prosperity since the crisis raise questions about
why growth has become less pro-poor. This note attempted to understand what may have been driving
the pace of poverty reduction and shared prosperity (growth in the consumption of the bottom 40) in
2010–13. Clearly, low growth limits how much poverty can be reduced and the predicted any worsening
of the macro conditions will not be helpful. In the current circumstances, the government’s decision to
raise pensions and minimum wages is paying off in reduced poverty. Growing remittances, largely from
Russia, also helped bring poverty down. But pensions and remittances also appear to be benefitting the
better-off more than the bottom 40, making growth relatively less pro-poor. More analysis is needed to
understand how and why remittances and pensions affect the less-well-off. In particular, there are
concerns, and some evidence for Armenia, that remittances flows could discourage work, something that
deserves further study.

4.2.     There are also some positive structural changes in the economy that matter for sustainable
future poverty reduction. The structure of GDP has moved away from construction-driven growth to
growth led by services, though with some resurgence in manufacturing in response to the government’s
export-oriented development strategy. Though agriculture only contributes a small share of GDP, its
growth has been favorable in recent years. Employment patterns have shifted away from agriculture
toward services and manufacturing, with services dominant in employment. These shifts exacerbate some
of the challenges because the less-well-off, who have less education, will not be able to fully tap into the
poverty reduction potential of services-led growth. Moreover, decomposition of the drivers of poverty
reduction and consumption growth shows clearly the importance of employment—but the Armenian labor
market has seen only limited growth in the employment rate. This suggests that if notable poverty
reduction and gains in shared prosperity are to be achieved, policies must continue to tackle fundamental
issues of how to enhance the skills of the less well-off and stimulate job creation in high-productivity
sectors, like manufacturing.

4.3.     Compounding long-standing structural issues in its labor market, Armenia is confronted by
a number of short-term challenges. Rising energy tariffs, the impact of the Eurasian Customs Union,
and the spillovers from a slowing Russian economy could all minimize the possibility for reducing
poverty and enhancing shared prosperity. Indeed, as the economy slowed in 2013, poverty reduction had
already stalled: there was zero change in poverty rates between 2012 and 2013. Looking ahead, the
expected lower economic growth, combined with higher prices due to currency devaluation, rising energy
prices, and a projected decline in remittances of up to 30 percent, will all negatively affect income and
consumption growth among the poor and vulnerable. The impact could well lead to increases in poverty
in 2015 and 2016.

Abstract
The youth unemployment rate is exceptionally high in the developing world. Because quality of education is arguably
one of the most important determinants of youth‚Äôs labor force participation, governments worldwide have responded
by creating job training and placement services programs. Despite the rapid expansion of skill-enhancement
employment programs across the world and the long history of training program evaluations, debates about the causal
impact of training based labor market policies on employment outcomes still persist.

Using a quasi-experimental approach, this report presents the short-run effects of skills training and employment
placement services in Nepal. Launched in 2009, the intervention provided skills training and employment placement
services for over 40,000 Nepalese youth over a three-year period, including a specialized adolescent girls‚Äô initiative
that reached 4,410 women aged 16 to 24. We find, after three years of the program, the EF intervention positively
improved employment outcomes. EF training program participation generated an increase in non-farm employment
of 15 to 16 percentage points for an overall gain of about 50 percent. The program also generated an average monthly
earnings gain by about 72 percent. We find significantly larger employment impacts for women than for men, but
younger women aged 16 to 24 experienced the same improvements as older females. These employment estimates are
comparable, though somewhat higher, than other recent experimental interventions in developing countries.

I.       Introduction

Youth unemployment and underemployment across much of the developing world is extremely
high. Two facts highlight the importance of youth‚Äôs labor in the world economy: 17 percent of the
world‚Äôs population are youth (ages 16-24) and youth make up 40 percent of the world‚Äôs
unemployed. In developing countries, where labor frequently encompasses informal self-
employment and small-scale agriculture, youth also struggle with high underemployment (they are
not able to work as much as they would like to) and low productivity. Up to two-thirds (60%) of
the young population is underutilized in some developing economies, meaning that they are
unemployed, in irregular employment ‚Äì most likely in the informal sector, or neither in the labor
force nor in education or training (ILO, 2013). Youth unemployment and underemployment not
only slow down economic growth but also negatively impact crime rates (Fella and Gallipoli,
2007), depression rates (Frese and Mohr, 1987), substance abuse rates (Linn, Sandifer and Stein,
1985), and rates of social exclusion (Goldsmith, Veum and Darity, 1997).

Nepal is similarly affected by youth unemployment and underemployment. With a per capita
income of US$700, Nepal is South Asia‚Äôs second poorest country (ahead of only Afghanistan).
Helped by remittances, the proportion of the population falling below the national poverty line has
declined in recent years from 31 percent in 2003-04 to 25 percent in 2011 (Central Bureau of
Statistics 2011). One underlying factor of poverty in Nepal is the lack of employment
opportunities, and a reliance on self-employment in the agriculture sector, which accounts for 61
percent of the total labor force (Nepal Living Standard Survey 2011). The unemployment rate for
those aged 15-29 is 19.2 percent, compared to just 2.7 percent for people older than 15 (ILO 2014).
Faced with these prospects, young Nepalese are compelled to consider migrating overseas in
search of better opportunities.

Governments worldwide have responded by creating job training and placement services
programs. In 2013, European Union (EU) launched an eight billion euro initiative aiming to
provide every young European with a job, apprenticeship, or training within four months of
becoming unemployed.3 In Latin America, job training programs (referred to collectively as the
‚ÄúJovenes‚Äù programs) have been implemented since the early 2000s. To date, more than 700 youth
employment programs from around 100 countries have been implemented and more than 80
percent of these programs offer some sort of skills training.4

Despite the rapid expansion of skill-enhancement employment programs across the world and the
long history of training programs‚Äô evaluations5, debates about the causal impact of training based
labor market policies on employment outcomes still persist. Based on US and European evidence,
Card et al. (2009) review impacts of various training programs. Their analysis suggests that
classroom and on-the-job training programs are not particularly effective in the short run, but have
larger positive impacts after two years. They also find that youth programs, on average, tend to
yield less positive impacts than untargeted programs. The evidence regarding impacts by gender
is mixed. Kluve (2006) reviewed a number of employment program evaluations in Europe and
found that the programs tended to have larger impacts for women than men. However, Card (2009),
found that programs tended to work equally well for men and women.

In general, program evaluations from developing countries show larger impacts than programs
conducted in other regions. Based on 289 youth employment interventions in 84 countries,
Betcherman et al. (2007) show higher impact in developing countries than in developed ones.6
Most of the rigorous evidence on training programs in developing countries is from Latin America,
where positive impacts are particularly pronounced (Gonzalez-Velosa et al., 2012; Attanasio et
al., 2008).7 Attanasio et al. (2008) evaluate the Jovenes en Acci√≥n job training program in
Colombia. Jovenes en Acci√≥n provided three months of classroom training followed by a three
month unpaid internship at a company. Attanasio et al. (2008) detect positive employment effects
for women (4 to 7 percentage points), no employment effects for men and positive earnings effects
for both men (8 percent) and women (18 percent). The study argues that the increase in earnings
is due to increased employment in formal sector jobs upon training completion.8

In Nepal, a wide variety of public and private technical education and vocational training (TEVT)
programs are available to youth. Youth unemployment is frequently cited as a driver of the ten-
year conflict from which Nepal emerged in 2006 (Macours 2011, ILO 2014), and since then
international donors have invested heavily in the TEVT sector. Additionally, a combination of age,
low educational attainment, and norms around marriage and childbirth confers multiple additional
disadvantages to young women in the labor market. Their labor force participation rate is 43.0
percent compared to 51.7 percent for young men (ILO 2014). Concerns about the social exclusion
of women, ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, and other historically disadvantaged groups have
also spurred advocacy and investment in training opportunities for these groups. The sector

5 See Heckman (1999) and many others, including randomized controlled trials, like the Job Training Partnership Act in the US.
6
  Betcherman et al. (2007) also found that only one-quarter of the 289 studies reviewed included an experimental or quasi-
experimental design. Among this particular subset of studies, 40 percent showed zero or negative impact on employment and
earnings outcomes. Betcherman et al. (2007) concludes that observational studies were almost 50 percent more likely to exhibit
positive impacts than programs with experimental or quasi-experimental designs.
7 Only Card et al. (2007) detects no statistically significant effect. Card et al. (2007) evaluate a job training program in the

Dominican Republic which included classroom training and a private sector internship. The impact evaluation shows no effect on
employment and a marginally significant earnings effect of about 10%.
8 Two previous evaluations of Jovenes-type programs in Argentina and Peru similarly found larger impacts for women than for

men, with employment impacts for women of 9 to 12 percentage points in Argentina (Aedo et. al. 2004) and 6 to 15 percentage
points in Peru (√ëopo et. al. 2007).


                                                               2
remains fragmented, however, with many public, private, and non-governmental training providers
of varying quality and weak links to the job market. Among development partners, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank are particularly active in this area, with the ADB‚Äôs US$25
million Skills for Employment project and the World Bank‚Äôs US$30 million Enhanced Vocational
Education and Training Project. To the best of our knowledge, no rigorous evidence yet exists on
the impacts of these programs on the labor market outcomes of participants.

Using a quasi-experimental approach, this report presents the short-term effects of skills training
and employment placement services in Nepal. Founded in 2008, the Employment Fund (EF) is
operated by Helvetas, a Swiss NGO, in partnership with the Government of Nepal. It is currently
one of the largest youth training initiatives in the country, serving almost 15,000 youth annually.
In partnership with the Employment Fund‚Äôs donors,9 the Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative
(AGEI) was launched in 2009 to expand the program‚Äôs reach to an additional 4,410 Nepali women
aged 16-24 over a three-year period.

Unique characteristics of this impact evaluation include:
   ÔÇ∑ A large study sample (4677 individuals in the pooled 2010-2012 cohorts examined in this
      report)
   ÔÇ∑ Particular focus on the outcomes of women aged 16-24 as well as the outcomes of a broader
      category of youth (men and women aged 16-35)
   ÔÇ∑ Socio-economic survey data of participants and a control group of non-participants as well
      as administrative follow-up data of program participants
   ÔÇ∑ Exhaustive tracking of program participants over time that produced high response rates.
   ÔÇ∑ Examination of a large set of outcome domains, including employment and earnings,
      empowerment and self-confidence, risky behaviors, and impacts on the household.

We find, approximately two years into the program, the EF program positively improved
employment outcomes. EF training program participation generated an increase in non-farm
employment of 15 to 16 percentage points for an overall gain of 46 percent. The program also
generated an average monthly earnings gain of 921 NRs monthly (ÔÇª12 USD). Given that the
average monthly income at baseline was 1272 NRs (ÔÇª 17 USD), the EF program impact generated
an economically meaningful income gain of about 72 percent for the combined 2010-2012
cohorts.).We find that the program‚Äôs impacts on employment were larger for women than for men,
though the impacts on other economic outcomes were similar for both sexes. We also detect no
difference in impacts when comparing older (24-35) and younger women (age 16-24), indicating
that the program is equally effective for the younger women targeted under the AGEI.

This report‚Äôs employment estimates are comparable, though somewhat higher, than other recent
experimental interventions in developing countries. Estimates of employment impacts in job
training programs in Latin America by Attanasio et al. (2008) and Alzua et al. (2013) show
respectively gains of 14 percentage points and 10 percentage points. In terms of earnings, this
evaluation finds substantially higher impacts than the increase in earnings of 18 percent found by
Attanasio et al. (2008).

The report is organized as follows: In Section II, we describe the global Adolescent Girls Initiative
and the Employment Fund program in Nepal. Section III describes the design of the AGEI impact
evaluation, Section IV describes our empirical approach, and Section V discusses the potential
threats to the study‚Äôs validity. Section VI presents results and Section VII concludes.


II.    Skills Training for Young Women
a. Programs worldwide

This impact evaluation was launched under the aegis of the World Bank‚Äôs Adolescent Girls
Initiative (AGI) launched in 2009 with the aim of facilitating the transition to productive
employment for young females. Comprised of eight pilot projects ‚Äì in Afghanistan, Haiti, Jordan,
Laos, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda and South Sudan‚Äì the initiative‚Äôs launch was motivated by two
factors: (1) the particular challenges faced by young women in developing countries during the
school-to-work transition, including high burden of domestic work, competing pressures to bear
and raise children, negative social norms regarding occupational choice and mobility, gender
discrimination, and (2) the potential benefits -- to household members, and to current and future
children -- of empowering young women.

AGI interventions offered skills training and various ancillary services tailored to local context,
such as childcare, mentoring, job placement assistance, and links to microcredit, in order to
facilitate young women‚Äôs transition to productive employment. Five of the eight pilots included
an experimental component and two of the impact evaluations have reported results. Using a
randomized evaluation, the AGI project in Jordan provided short-term soft-skills training and six-
month employment vouchers to recent female graduates of technical universities. Although the
vouchers assisted young women to obtain short-terms internships, the evaluation detected no effect
on the recipients‚Äô employment or earnings after the end of the voucher period (Groh, 2010). In
contrast, the AGI pilot in Liberia found strong positive impacts on employment and earnings.
Using a randomized ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù design, individuals were randomly assigned to receive training in
two sequential batches. In addition to positive impacts on participants‚Äô self-confidence, savings,
and household food security, the program had sizable impacts on employment (47 percent) and
weekly earnings (80 percent) for women aged 16-27 (Adoho 2014).




                                                 4
Two other skills training programs for young women have also been rigorously evaluated. In India,
a training program in stitching and tailoring offered to young women in poor slum communities
of New Delhi had a unique feature, introduced to increase commitment and encourage regular
attendance (Maitra & Mani, 2014). Maitra & Mani (2014) found that the program increased the
likelihood of casual or permanent wage employment by more than 5 percentage points, self-
employment by almost 4 percentage points, and any employment by 6 percentage points. The
program increased hours worked in the post-training period by around 2.5 hours. Finally, a related
project implemented by the international NGO BRAC in Uganda implemented village-level girls‚Äô
clubs to provide life skills, reproductive health, and livelihood skills to young women aged 14 to
20. A randomized impact evaluation found substantial increases in employment (72 percent) and
improved empowerment and reproductive health outcomes (Bandiera 2012).


b. The Employment Fund and the Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI)
   in Nepal

Started in 2008, the Employment Fund (EF), now one of the largest skills training programs in the
country, provides vocational training and placement services under a unique governance structure.
Since 2011, the Employment Fund has operated under an agreement between the Government of
Nepal and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). A Steering Committee,
chaired by the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Education, governs the Employment Fund. In
addition to providing training and placement services, the Employment Fund engages in support
activities, capacity-building, and cooperative activities with the Government‚Äôs Council for
Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT).

Each year, the Employment Fund authorizes training programs under a competitive bidding system
with various training providers. First, the Employment Fund issues a call for proposals to Training
and Employment (T&E) providers seeking to provide skills training and employment services. The
range of T&E provider types is enormous: from formal technical education and vocational training
(TEVT) institutions, public and private providers, to skilled artisans offering apprenticeships. The
second step, after the call for proposals, is for each T&E provider to complete a Rapid Market
Assessment (RMA) outlining viable and potential employment opportunities.10 The third step in
the process is for the EF to evaluate submitted proposals according to preset criteria; the EF weighs
the capacity and experience of each T&E provider, the market demand for the proposed trades
being offered, and the proposed costs. Finally, the EF issues a contract to selected providers: the
contract specifies the number of training courses (hereafter called ‚Äúevents‚Äù) to be conducted and
the number of individuals to be trained and employed in each event. The T&E providers are then
free to recruit and select their own trainees for each of their training events, according to guidelines
established by EF.

10   The RMA process is facilitated via EF-supported capacity building workshops.


                                                                5
Table 1 provides the total number of T&E providers, number of training events, and number of
trainees. Table 1 shows an increase of total number of program beneficiaries between 2010 and
2012. Training courses in technical skills vary across a wide range of trades (e.g., incense stick
rolling, carpentry, tailoring, welding and masonry). All females receive 40 hours of life skills
training (beginning in 2011) and a sub-set of EF trainees receive a short course in basic business
skills. In addition, each trainee is encouraged to complete a skills certification test offered by the
National Skills Testing Board (NSTB).11

Upon completion of the classroom-based training, the EF places emphasis on job placement
services. EF verifies trainees‚Äô employment status three months and six months after the completion
of the training.12 Upon verification, T&E providers receive an outcome-based payment from the
EF that is higher for trainees who are employed. The outcome-based payment system creates
strong incentives for the T&E providers to provide placement assistance and provides graduates
with an opportunity to put their new skills to work immediately after the training. The EF
emphasizes the placement of trainees into ‚Äúgainful‚Äù employment in which they earn a minimum
of 3,000 NRs (ÔÇª40 USD) per month.13

In 2010, the EF partnered with DFID and the World Bank‚Äôs Adolescent Girls Initiative to improve
the EF‚Äôs reach and impact for young women aged 16 to 24. Training under this Adolescent Girls
Employment Initiative (AGEI) proceeded in the same way as it did for other EF trainees, except
that certain events had been flagged in advance as likely to attract female trainees. This was done
in order to ensure that the EF reached adequate numbers of young women.14 For the purpose of
this evaluation, we designate all female participants aged 16 to 24 in EF-sponsored training courses
as ‚ÄúAGEI‚Äù.

The Employment Fund struggled in 2010 to recruit young women to training events and in 2011
launched an enhanced communication and outreach strategy to recruit more female trainees.15 In
addition to the T&E advertisement, the EF sponsored radio and newspaper ads specifically geared
towards young women. Many of these ads specifically encouraged women to sign up for non-




11 In some cases, the Employment Fund has even cooperated with the NSTB to develop skills standards for tests in trades where
no test existed.
12 The employment status of a sample of graduates is verified by EF field monitors three to six months after the completion of the

training event.
13 The definition of ‚Äúgainful‚Äù employment was increased in 2012 to 4,600 NRs (ÔÇª60 USD). Throughout this report, we use the

prevailing exchange rate during 2010 and 2011 of 75 NRS to 1 USD.
14 The T&E providers running these training events are not given hard quotas for how many AGEI trainees to reach, but any

female trainees aged 16 to 24 that they do train are designated as ‚ÄúAGEI‚Äù trainees for accounti ng and monitoring purposes.
Employment Fund records indicate that 4410 young women were reached over the three year initiative, as shown in Table 1,
exceeding the target of 4375.
15 They reached only a bit more than half of their annual target of 1500.




                                                                6
traditional trades for women, such as mobile phone repair, electronics, or construction.16 The
Employment Fund also partnered with women‚Äôs and community-based organizations to attract
applications from women and marginalized groups ‚Äì if a referred applicant gained entry to an EF-
sponsored training event, the partner organization was paid a small finder‚Äôs fee equivalent to about
1.25 US dollar per person.

The Employment Fund uses a differential pricing mechanism that awards a higher incentive to
service providers who agree to train (and place) more disadvantaged groups, according to
established vulnerability criteria.17 The highest incentive is awarded for training and placing the
most disadvantaged (highly vulnerable women including AGEI trainees, widows, ex-combatants,
disabled women, etc.), and incentives are gradually lowered for less prioritized groups. Training
providers that are able to cater to these higher priority target groups are therefore eligible to receive
a higher outcome price, but they also face a higher risk of failing to achieve the outcome (gainful
employment). The combination of a results-based system with a progressive incentive scheme
ensures that training providers with the capacity to work with vulnerable groups will likely opt to
do so.

III.      Impact Evaluation Design
This evaluation estimates the impact of the EF training program by comparing the outcomes of
participants, who comprise the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù group, to a control group of individuals who applied,
but were not selected for, an EF-sponsored training course. Isolating the causal effects of the EF
training program on employment and other outcomes is complicated by the fact that some T&E
providers have at least some degree of choice over who they choose to train or training participants
could seek EF training for reasons we cannot fully measure.18 In other words, comparing post-
program participation outcomes of EF program participants versus non-participants may confound
training program influences on outcomes with those of hard-to-measure individual-level, family-
level or T&E-level attributes that affect both training program participation and the outcome of
interest.

This estimation problem would be greatly reduced if we could compare the outcomes of
individuals from truly comparable backgrounds except for their EF training program status. The
primary concern in being able to detect the causal effects of the training program is that the two
sets of individuals (i.e., ones receiving training and ones who do not) may have had different

16Anecdotal  evidence also suggests that the introduction of life skills training, covering topics such as communication, leadership,
and reproductive health, was particularly popular among young women and may have contributed to the growing numbers of
AGEI trainees.

18 Systematic differences in unobservable characteristics that cannot be measured quantitatively, such as motivation, confidence,

and natural ability, will lead to biased estimates of program impact.


                                                                 7
characteristics to begin with and it may be those characteristics rather than the EF training program
that explain the difference in outcomes between the two groups.19 The unobserved differences in
characteristics are particularly concerning.

T&E providers can select which beneficiaries enter their training programs, and this selection
process drives the difference between trainees and non-trainees. Each T&E provider advertises,
collects applications, shortlists and interviews applicants, and selects participants for each of
training events following Trainee Selection guidelines established by EF. These guidelines
stipulate a two week minimum period of advertisement, the eligibility criteria for training events,
and the procedures for shortlisting and interviewing. There are three eligibility criteria for all EF-
sponsored training programs: age (from 16 to 35), education (below SLC,20 or less than 10 years
of formal education), and self-reported economic status.21 Only applicants who meet all three
criteria are eligible to be shortlisted. T&E providers are advised to shortlist at least 50 percent more
candidates than the number of spaces in the training event. The guidelines also outline a uniform
process for interviewing shortlisted candidates, including a detailed scoring rubric, instructions for
ranking the shortlisted candidates by score, and selecting the top-scoring candidates for
participation.22 Figure 1 in Annex 2 shows a sample ranking form used by T&E providers. This
scoring and ranking procedure forms the basis of our sampling strategy for this evaluation and is
described in detail in the next section.

We use quasi-experimental methods to solve the above evaluation concerns. Our general
evaluation strategy is to observe an individual before and after an EF training program and to
compute a simple difference in outcome for that individual over time. The average difference over
time of the individuals enrolled in the training program (i.e., the treatment group) is then compared
to the average difference over time of the individuals who are not enrolled (i.e., the comparison
group). Conceptually, this so-called difference-in-differences method (Campbell, 1969; Meyer,
1995), cancels out the effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to a specific individual and
that do not change over time. 23 Therefore the difference in outcomes across the two groups can


19 We perform a number of statistical tests (presented in section V) to examine the similarities and differences between the two
groups in our evaluation sample.
20 The School Leaving Certificate (SLC) is obtained after successfully passing examinations after the 10 th grade. To be eligible,

EF applicants must have not taken, or not passed, their SLC exams. This criterion has been loosened for some trades starting in
2012. In practice, because the educational status reported on the application is not verified, this criterion was not perfectly
adhered to.
21An applicant is considered ‚Äúeconomically poor‚Äù if they rep ort a non-farm per capita household income of less than 3000 Nepali

rupees (NRs) per month or, in the case of farming families, less than 6 months of food sufficiency. Since these self-reports are
not verified, and applicants know in advance that they must be ‚Äúpoor‚Äù in order to be eligible for the program, it is unclear how
well this criterion is adhered to.
22 In addition, and as mentioned earlier, the guidelines also set out a progressive payment structure to incentivize T&E providers

to select trainees from particular socially disadvantage groups. The guidelines also allow for T&E providers to select up to 2
‚Äúalternates‚Äù per event, in case a selected trainee declines to join the program.
23 The difference-in-differences method helps resolve the problem of selection to the extent that many characteristics of units or

individuals can reasonably be assumed to be constant over time (or time-invariant). Think, for example, of observed
characteristics, such as a person‚Äôs year of birth, a region‚Äôs location close to the ocean, a town‚Äôs level of economic development,
or a father‚Äôs level of education. Most of these types of variables, although plausibly related to outcomes, will probably not change


                                                                 8
(under certain conditions, discussed in Section Va) be attributed solely to the treatment status, i.e.
whether the individuals received training or not. To further purge bias in our estimates arising from
observable differences between trainees and non-trainees, we employ a combination of this
difference-in-difference estimation with propensity score matching and propensity score
weighting techniques. We describe the specific estimation and matching methods in the next
section.

IV.       Methodology and Data
a. Sample Description and Sampling Technique

Our primary source of data comes from a survey covering three consecutive cohorts of EF trainees
(from 2010 to 2012), with two rounds of data collection for each cohort. 24 Figure 1 depicts the
impact evaluation timeline.

We sample at the training event and the applicant level. The main sampling frame for data used
in this study consisted of all EF training courses sponsored in a given year. The number of training
events comprising the sample frame ranges from 598 (in 2010) to 711 (in 2012). Table 1 reports
the number of events and participants by year.

Sampling into this study included a combination of stratified, random and convenience sampling.
First, we selected a subset of training events occurring between the months of January through
April. 25,26,27 Second, from the universe of training events offered during these four months, we
randomly selected up to 15 districts. Third, from that list of training events occurring in these
districts, we randomly selected 20 percent of the training events. Finally, a survey team visited
each sampled training event on the day when applicant selection took place. Each event‚Äôs ranking
sheet listed the shortlisted applicants from the top-scorer to the bottom and indicated the threshold,
or minimum score needed to gain admission to the course. From this ranking sheet, the survey
team selected applicants whose scores were within 20 percent of the threshold for admission to
training events. The sampled applicants above the threshold comprise this study‚Äôs treatment group,
while those below the threshold make up the control group. Immediately following the sampling
of applicants, a baseline survey was conducted on the treatment and control groups, before the
results of the selection process were announced.

over the course of an evaluation. Using the same reasoning, we might conclude that many unobserved characteristics of
individuals are also more or less constant over time.
24 For the 2010 cohort, a second follow-up was conducted on half of the cohort. Future analysis will examine the longer-term

outcomes for this group.
25 Because of the AGEI focus of this study, we prioritize AGEI training events (identified by the T&E as we described earlier).

Because the selection into the study population was based on an individuals‚Äô proximity to the threshold score, it was not pos sible
to stratify on AGEI status. However, events that were likely to include more AGEI candidates were purposely oversampled in
2011 and 2012 so as to increase the number of AGEI candidates in the study population.
26 Eighty percent of EF training events occurred during these four months.
27 In 2010, because a complete event listing was not available in advance, the events were chosen by convenience, based on

scheduling and accessibility.


                                                                 9
Table 2 shows the resultant sample of events for the three cohorts. The 2010 event sample
comprised 64 events across 30 districts. The 2011 sample comprised 182 events, of which 113
events were dropped from the baseline survey, either because the survey team could not reach the
event on the day of applicant selection or because the event was not ‚Äúoversubscribed‚Äù.28 The
remaining 69 events in 34 districts were included in the 2011 baseline sample. The sampling
process was much improved in 2012, with 85 out of 112 sampled events successfully included in
the final evaluation sample.

This non-random (in 2010) and partially-random (in 2011 and 2012) sampling of training events
and applicants introduces bias in two potentially important ways. First, the training events in our
study may not be representative of all EF-sponsored trainings. In all three cohorts, training events
that enter our sample are more likely to be based in district centers, are more likely to be more
sought after (and hence oversubscribed), and are more likely be run by high-capacity T&E
providers.29,30 Second, selected trainees could differ in characteristics, other than being offered
training, from non-trainees, since T&E providers purposely interview and select the applicants
they think will perform best. We mitigate this bias by selecting our study participants within a
narrow range of each event‚Äôs threshold score, which we hypothesize will limit the differences
between the treatment and control groups. We examine this hypothesis further in section V.

The sampling procedures described above resulted in a study population of 4677 over all three
cohorts. For the pooled sample (i.e., 2010 through 2012 cohorts), the study population is about 64
percent female and on average 24.5 years old. Fifty-eight percent are married while 51 percent
have at least one child. Approximately 59 percent of the sample has engaged in any income-
generating activity in the month prior to the survey, a figure which may seem high, but includes
those who are working without pay on their own household farms. When we restrict to non-farm
income-generating activities, the employment rate falls to 27 percent. At baseline, the average
earnings of the pooled sample were 1272 NRs per month (equivalent to about 17 USD). This figure
may seem low, since it represents the average earnings over the entire study population of 4677
individuals, including those with zero earnings. Only 17 percent of the 2010-2012 pooled sample
earned more than 3000 NRs per month, a level deemed to represent ‚Äúgainful‚Äù employment.
Interestingly, about 15 percent of the sample was already engaged in the same trade for which


28 The survey team was instructed to drop the event from the sample if there were not at least 3 rejected candidates that fell within
20% of the threshold score. In other words, if there were not at least 3 people who could be sampled for the control group, the
event was dropped from the sample.
29 The survey team deployed a fixed number of staff to each district center, with a schedule of all events in that district. Events

conducted by high-capacity T&E providers and in popular trades were more likely to keep to their scheduled start date. Because
the T&E providers were not required to wait more than 5 days between the interviews and the start of training, and the
unpredictability of the interview dates, it was impossible for the survey team to reach all of the events with enough time to
conduct the baseline survey.
30 If these characteristics also determine the quality of the training, this non-random sampling of events may bias our estimates

upward and overstate the true impact of the program. One mitigating factor is that in every cohort our sample includes a high
fraction of the T&E providers contracted by EF.


                                                                 10
training they applied (denoted as ‚Äútrade-specific IGA‚Äù), indicating that a significant minority of
applicants were looking to upgrade their existing skills. Though they are not older than the men in
the sample, women are more likely to be married and have a child, and have lower employment
and earnings at baseline. 31

As discussed in Section II, the EF provides financial incentives for T&E providers to recruit and
train people from Dalit and Janajati ethnic groups. For Janajatis, the T&E providers appear to
respond to these incentives, as 44 percent of the applicants are Janajatis, and they are statistically
more likely to be in the treatment group than control.32 The T&E providers appear to have less
success with attracting Dalit applicants: only 8 percent of the applicants are Dalits (a bit less than
the population average), and they are equally divided between the treatment and control groups.



b. Estimating the EF Training Program Effects

To estimate causal effects of the EF training program on various outcomes, first we employ a
‚Äúdifference in difference‚Äù (DID) technique. We will refer to this as the OLS specification in the
remainder of this report. The main equation we estimate is:

                       Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªº + Ì†µÌªø (Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±• Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñ ) + Ì†µÌªΩ1 Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°   (1)

This regression relates a given outcome to EF program training status. Yijt is the outcome of interest
for individual i from training event j at time t. Treati is an indicator which is equal to 1 for the
treatment group and 0 for control. Postt is an indicator equal to 1 for follow-up observations and 0
for baseline. Its coefficient captures aggregate factors that would cause changes in Yijt even in the
absence of a training program. The term Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñ represents an individual fixed effect. This individual
fixed effect is critical to our identification strategy, as it controls for differences in time-invariant
observable and unobservable characteristics at baseline, as described in section III. The final term,
Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±° , is an idiosyncratic error term that is clustered by training event, in order to account for the
likely correlation of outcomes among applicants to the same training course.

The coefficient of interest, Ì†µÌªø , defines the impact of the program comparing the change in Yij of
treatment group individuals with control group individuals over time. If outcomes of individuals
assigned to EF training are similar to individuals not trained (that is, if the training has no impact),
then we should find Ì†µÌªø = 0. If individuals trained by EF have better labor market outcomes than
non-participants, we should find Ì†µÌªø > 0.


31
   More details about the characteristics of the study population are found in a separate baseline report, available upon request
from the authors.
32 For reference, the 2001 census indicated that Janajatis made up 37% and Dalits made up 13% of the total Nepali population.




                                                                   11
To further purge remaining differences between observable characteristics among trainees and
non-trainees that could influence the difference in impacts between the two groups, we augment
the ‚Äúdifference-in-difference‚Äù technique with propensity score matching and weighting
approaches. Both methods rely on first estimating each individual‚Äôs likelihood of being offered
training (i.e., propensity score), based on individual baseline characteristics, such as age,
education, and family background.

We implement the propensity score method by first employing the following probit model:

                          Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó = Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ó + Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó                  (2)



In this equation, Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó is equal to 0 (for non-trained individuals) or 1 (for trained individuals) for
individual i in event j, and Xi is a vector of individual and household level explanatory variables,
all measured at baseline. The error term, clustered by event, is given by Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó . To predict likelihood
of being trained, we use age, sex, education, ethnicity, employment status, marital and parental
status, analytical ability (as measured by the commonly used Raven‚Äôs progressive matrices and
one financial literacy question), and an entrepreneurial orientation score based on a set of 11
questions. At the household level, we include household size, education level of the household
head, and the quintile of the household‚Äôs wealth based on an index of ten household assets. At the
district level, the model controls for the district in which each event is held, the T&E provider, and
the trade of the training (e.g., hospitality), all represented by the vector Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ó . The predicted value of
Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó is the estimated propensity score, or likelihood of being in the treatment group.

After estimating this propensity score, we derive the estimated treatment effect using two methods.
The first method is ‚Äúinverse propensity score weighting‚Äù, in which individuals are weighted
according to the inverse of their estimated propensity to participate in the program. The weighted
observations are then used in a DID regression, as given by equation (1). We will refer to this as
the IPSW specification from here on. We implement IPSW following Hirano et al (2003). This
particular weighting method, as opposed to matching approaches, has the nice property of
including all the data (unless weights are set to 0) and does not depend on random sampling, thus
providing for replicability. We use a weighted least squares regression model, with weights of 1/œÄÀÜ
for the treatment group and 1/(1- œÄ ÀÜ) for the control group, where œÄ ÀÜ is the estimated propensity
score from (2). Standard errors are clustered by training event.

The second method is ‚Äúpropensity score matching‚Äù, in which individuals in the treatment group
are matched to individuals in the control group who have similar propensity scores. We use a
nearest-neighbor matching algorithm, in which each individual in the treatment group is compared
to a fixed number of control observations (in our case, four) with the closest propensity scores. We
will refer to this as the NN specification in the remainder of this report. Following Smith and Todd


                                                            12
(2005), we estimate the difference-in-difference matching estimator for the training program effect
Ì†µÌªø as follows:

                                  1
                          ÃÇ
                          Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±Ä = Ì†µÌ±Å ‚àëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±á[(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°0 ) ‚àí ‚àëÌ†µÌ±ó‚ààÌ†µÌ∞∂ Ì†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°0 )]     (4)
                                    Ì†µÌ±á


Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±á is the number of treatment observations, the subscript Ì†µÌ±°1 denotes follow-up observations and Ì†µÌ±°0
denotes baseline observations; Ì†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ñ is a matrix of weights. Weights for nearest-neighbor matching
are computed by:

                                                                 1
                                    Ì†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°0 ) = Ì†µÌ±• ‚àëÌ†µÌ±•
                                                                       Ì†µÌ±ó=1 (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±°0 )    (5)
                                                                      Ì†µÌ±ó‚ààÌ†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±•
Ax is a set of Ì†µÌ±• observations with the lowest values of |Ì†µÌºã       ÃÇÌ†µÌ±ó |. As in the two previous models
                                                            ÃÇ Ì†µÌ±ñ ‚àí Ì†µÌºã
outlined in this section, the dependent variable is the first difference of a given outcome between
the baseline observation and the follow-up observation. The statistical software package we use
for this specification does not allow for clustering of standard errors.33


c. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)

Estimates of the EF program‚Äôs effects correspond to two different questions. The first is the effect
of the intervention on the average outcomes of those assigned to one of the EF training events,
regardless of whether they used the training services. In the experimental literature, this is known
as the intention to treat (ITT) effect. Angeluci and Orazio (2006) discuss the quasi-experimental
counterpart, which is the method we apply in this study.34

If one is interested in the effectiveness of a program among the entire class of youth who are
eligible for it, then the ITT estimates are the appropriate results to examine. Note that this ITT
estimate is not biased by the fact that only some individuals choose to participate the EF program
because we derive the ITT by comparing the average outcomes of everyone assigned to one of the
EF training groups, whether they use the program or not, with the average outcomes of everyone
assigned to the control group (i.e., the non-trainees).

If instead one is interested in the effects among individuals who have actually completed the
program, then one should consult the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) results, which
are based on actual program participation, rather than program assignment.

We present both intent-to-treat (ITT) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) estimates
of the impact of the Employment Fund‚Äôs training program. In our view, the ITT estimates are more

33   We implement the psmatch2 package in Stata (Leuven 2003).
34   We retain the use of this term to be consistent with the same concept in the experimental design literature.


                                                                      13
relevant from the policymaker‚Äôs perspective.35 If one were to invest in scaling up the EF‚Äôs training
programs to more Nepali youth using the same eligibility criteria, the ITT estimates indicate the
level of impact one could expect to achieve on those target youth. The ITT estimates account for
the foreseeable uptake and dropout rates that one would expect if the program were expanded. The
ATT estimates are relevant from a program implementer‚Äôs point of view, as they indicate how well
the program worked for the participants who completed the course. They compare everyone who
completed the training to everyone who did not, regardless of why they did not complete the
training (e.g., they were not offered a space, they were not eligible, or they dropped out or declined
to join).36 Because neither the direction nor the extent of bias can be determined precisely, and to
address both the policy and programmatic perspectives, this report presents ITT results in Section
VI and ATT estimates in Annex 3.


d. Heterogeneous Effects

In seeking to examine the effects of the Employment Fund‚Äôs training program, it is important to
keep in mind that different people within the intervention may respond differently to the same
policy intervention‚Äîa possibility that researchers refer to as ‚Äútreatment heterogeneity.‚Äù We might
be concerned that people with particular social or demographic characteristics may fare differently
than the average program participant.

Because treatment heterogeneity has important policy implications, we estimate heterogeneous
treatment effects by estimating the impact both for the full sample of participants as well as for
several sub-populations. For example, we may want to know how well the program works for the
average participant or how well the program works specifically for women, young women, and
different ethnic groups that are especially targeted by the EF. Different effects for various
demographic groups can assist us in informing the policy debate regarding whether specialized
investments are paying off or whether further strategies might be needed to ensure that various
groups participate and benefit equally from the program. The AGEI sub-group (i.e., young women
aged 16-24), in particular, merits special attention because of the Employment Fund‚Äôs outreach
activities towards this particular age group.

To test whether the impacts of the EF training program vary by certain pre-defined sub-groups, we
employ a triple difference specification:


35 Conceptually, the ITT estimates are equal to or lower than the ATT estimates, since they include all the people to whom the
program was targeted but chose not to participate, or who did not complete the program in the treatment group. ATT estimates
may overestimate true program impact, since they represent the impact among a self-selected group of people who chose to take
part and complete the program. It may be that those who are more motivated and capable are more likely to remain in the
program, and the less capable drop out; on the other hand, it may be that the more capable decide that they don‚Äôt really need what
the program provides.
36 Data on training program completion were obtained from the Employment Fund‚Äôs administrative records, and cross -checked

with self-reported training program participation collected at follow-up.


                                                               14

Groupi represents the subgroup characteristic. The parameter of interest œà , indicates the
differential impact of the EF training on that subgroup (relative to everyone else), while (œà + Œ≤1)
indicates the overall impact on the treated individuals in that subgroup. The remaining terms are
as defined in (1).

V.        Internal Validity

Although we have sought to maximize the scientific quality of this impact evaluation, it remains
possible that we have missed some important program impacts. Alternative explanations, other
than assignment to a training program, could account for differences in outcomes between
individuals offered training and individuals who are not trained. These explanations are the so-
called threats to the internal validity. In this section, we address and dismiss such potential
explanations.

a. Time-varying trends and differences at baseline

We start by addressing concerns about pre-existing differences and time-varying trends that could
account for observed training effects when comparing trainees and non-trainees.37 Towards that
objective, we present ‚Äúbalancing tests‚Äù which capture the degree of similarity between the two
types of participants. Table 4 presents baseline participant characteristics (i.e., balancing tests) for
a set of 38 demographic indicators.38 These tests are based on ‚ÄúITT‚Äù comparisons of the treatment
group (i.e., individuals whose scores qualify them for admission to an EF training event) and the
control group. The baseline balance tests for the pooled sample (2010-2012) indicate that
significant differences exist between treatment and control groups for baseline observable
characteristics and pre-treatment outcome variables.39 Relative to rejected candidates, treated
individuals are more likely to be Janajati and are less likely to have finished SLC (10th grade),
characteristics which reflect the eligibility criteria and the EF‚Äùs differential pricing scheme for
vulnerable groups. Further, the likelihood of treated individuals being engaged in non-farm and
trade specific employment before take up of training was higher, as well as their working hours
and ability to earn more than 3000 NRs a month. These differences are consistent with T&E
providers‚Äô incentives to select candidates they think will perform best. Finally, individuals in the
treatment group are also less likely to have control over savings and money of their own at baseline.
To address these differences (and potential differences in unobservable characteristics) we applied

37 Characteristics of these two groups need not be the same for a difference-in-difference identification strategy to yield causal
effects; however, similar characteristics facilitate the empirical estimation.
38 Using a statistical tool called a student‚Äôs T test, we examine whether the difference in means between the two groups is

statistically significant.
39
   The balance tests in Table 4 use standard errors that are clustered by training event.



                                                                            15
a difference-in-difference approach in our analysis. However, growth in outcome variables and the
may not follow a common trend, particularly when starting off at very different initial levels.
Although it does not resolve the parallel trend assumption, we additionally applied propensity
score weighting and matching techniques to achieve a higher degree of baseline comparability
across groups.40


b. Survey response rates and attrition

One potential problem with any study such as ours is sample attrition. Approximately one year
after each baseline survey, we conducted a follow-up survey.41,42 The response rates were quite
high for both follow-up surveys (see Table 5). Overall, the survey firm was able to track and
successfully interview 88 percent of the baseline survey respondents, yielding a final sample for
analysis of 4,101 individuals.43 High response rates such as these limit the degree to which any
differences between respondents and non-respondents can affect our estimates.

Particularly worrisome is the possibility of so-called ‚Äúdifferential attrition‚Äù, a situation in which
we re-interview trainees and non-trainees at statistically different rates. Even with low attrition
rates for a panel survey, differential attrition may influence the scientific validity of results.
Suppose, hypothetically, that very motivated individuals in the control group (i.e., non-trainees)
are more likely than trainees to migrate to a district where they find employment. As a result of
this migration, these individuals will not show up in our analyses and this scenario could
compromise the scientific validity of this study‚Äôs estimates.

In Table 20, we explore this possibility and show no evidence to support it. Table 20 shows a series
of regressions on the correlates of survey attrition. We regress the panel status of respondents on
their treatment status, depending on how the treatment indicator is defined. This specification
provides information on whether treatment or control individuals are more likely to be lost to
follow-up. Next, we add a series of covariates, such as gender, age, marital status, parental status,
ethnicity, and employment, a set of district and T&E provider-specific control dummy variables.
The results indicate that attrition is not correlated with treatment status, and hence differential
attrition between treatment and control groups is not an issue in this evaluation.


40
   We have redone the baseline balance tests after matching, and the results indicate that though the similarity of treatment and
control groups has improved, significant differences remain. The post-matching balance tests are available upon request.
41 Because the EF-sponsored training courses vary in length from 1 to 3 months, the follow-up survey examines outcomes 9 to 11

months after the end of the training.
42 The EF itself conducts follow-up with a sample of participants up to 6 months after the training to verify employment and

earnings. Hence, the impact evaluation follow up survey occurs 3-5 months after the treatment group‚Äôs last contact with the
program.
43 The reasons given for loss to follow-up for the 2010 and 2011 cohorts include: inability to track the household (11%), no one

in the household during multiple visits (15%), refusal (8%), respondent migrated for work within Nepal or abroad (8%),
respondent migrated after marriage (10%), or other (40%).


                                                               16
c. Uptake of EF-sponsored training courses

Another threat to our study is imperfect compliance, which occurs when those offered treatment
choose not to participate, or when people from the control group gain access to the program. These
deviations from treatment assignment may bias our estimates of program impact, because the
factors that determine one‚Äôs actual participation, such as motivation and tenacity, cannot be
observed and are likely correlated with the outcomes of interest.

Using administrative data from EF, we examine the rate of program take-up by the treatment and
control groups for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 cohorts in Table 6.44 The table shows a high degree of
uptake (65 to 74 percent) among the treatment group, but also a high rate of participation among
the control group.45 Between 26 percent and 36 percent of the individuals in the control group
participated in the EF training course that they applied for, even though their scores did not qualify
them for admission. 46,47

In the presence of imperfect compliance, standard impact evaluation methods produce intent-to-
treat (ITT) estimates, as described in section IV. However, the relatively high degree of
noncompliance in our study leads to a likely downward bias in our ITT estimates, which compare
a treatment group in which not everyone received treatment to a control group in which some
people did receive treatment, hence diluting the impact of the program. We present an alternative
set of ATT estimates in Annex 3 in which we compare those who actually complete training to
those who do not, irrespective of treatment assignment.48 In our view, the ITT results serve as a
lower bound for the estimated program impact while the ATT results serve as an upper bound.

VI.       Short-Run Results of the EF Program

This section describes the impact of the Employment Fund‚Äôs training programs for the combined
2010, 2011 and 2012 samples. We measure outcomes approximately one year after the start of



44 An individual is recorded in the EF monitoring database as a trainee only when the T&E provider submits the person‚Äôs name at
the end of the training. Since the EF only reimburses T&E providers at the conclusion of the training, they do not record nor do
we have any way to track how many people enrolled, but did not complete, the training in 2010 to 2012.
45 The monitoring records indicate that the control group individuals who received training did so in the original training course

that they applied for. There is no evidence that they applied for and participated in a different EF training course sponsored by a
different T&E provider, nor that they participated in EF training courses in a different year.
46 In practice, while we cannot be sure what happened in each case, the T&E providers probably dipped into the pool of lower-

scoring applicants in an attempt to fill up the training slots as people dropped out.
47 The stable unit treatment value assumption (i.e., SUTVA) based on Rubin (1980) assumes that (1) the treatment status of any

unit does not affect the potential outcomes of the other units (i.e., non-interference) and (2) the treatments for all units are
comparable (i.e., no variation in treatment). Note that take-up of training among control group units is not a violation of the
SUTVA, as take-up among non-beneficiaries was not directly a result of the take-up of training among the individuals selected
for training.
48 The ATT estimates suffer from an additional source of bias, since it is likely the ‚Äúbest‚Äù members of the control group who

gained access to the program and are reassigned to treatment in the ATT analysis, and the least motivated among those assigned
to treatment who fail to participate and are reassigned to control. See the discussion in Annex 3.


                                                                17
training.49 We start with a description of our analysis on likelihood of being in the treatment group.
We proceed with the short-term impacts of the EF program on the full sample and on various
demographic and socio-economic sub-groups.

a. First-stage Estimation of Propensity Scores

At the heart of the propensity score matching method is pairing trainees with non-trainees who are
similar in terms of their observable characteristics. This pairing between a trainee and comparable
non-trainees is done via a propensity score, as described in section IV.

Results from the propensity score estimation (shown in Table 7) exhibit only three variables
correlated with an individual being offered training (i.e., treatment status).50 This finding reflects
the high degree of similarity among short-listed candidates. The only characteristics correlated
with an individual being assigned to a training program are being Muslim, the likelihood of having
children, and the number of children one has. No other variables are correlated with training
assignment, meaning that within the pool of shortlisted candidates, there are few observable
differences between those selected for training and those who are not.

Based on the estimated propensity score, we match each treated individual (i.e., a person assigned
to a training program) to a group of control observations (i.e., individuals who are non-trainees),
as described in section IV.


b. Impacts on Employment and Earnings for the Full Sample

In this section we present impacts of the EF program as estimated with the three identification
strategies described in Section IV. Table 8 shows the ITT results on employment and earnings for
the pooled 2010, 2011 and 2012 cohorts. We find (results in the first row of Table 8) strong
evidence of consistent impact on the employment rate across all specifications.51 All three models
indicate a positive and significant effect, despite the high employment rate (i.e., 61 percent) at
baseline. Restricting the employment to non-farm activities, we also find a significant increase:
the rate of participation in non-farm income-generating activities increases by 15 to 16 percentage
points (from a base of 29.6 percent). Translating the results in percentage change terms, we find
that the program increased non-farm employments by 50 to 54 percent. These impacts are not only
statistically significant but also economically meaningful.




49 Because the EF-sponsored training courses vary in length from 1 to 3 months, the follow-up survey examines outcomes 9 to 11
months after the end of the training.
50 We report the ITT results, for both all three cohorts. For the ITT first-stage probit, treatment is defined as having a score that

qualifies the respondent for admission to the EF training course to which s/he applied.
51 We measure employment by whether the respondent reported any income-generating activities in the past month or not.




                                                                 18
We also examine the trade-specific income generating activity (IGA) rate ‚Äì the percent of
individuals who find employment in the same trade as the training that they applied for ‚Äì and we
find impacts ranging from 18 to 19 percentage points. The trade-specific IGA impacts are larger
than the non-farm employment impacts, suggesting that members of the control group, even when
able to find employment, were less able than the treatment group to find employment in the trade
in which they sought training.

Our results are considerably lower than estimates obtained by a simple before-and-after
comparison within the group of trainees. For the 2010 cohort, for example, the treatment group
had a non-farm employment rate of 30 percent at baseline and 55 percent at midline. A simple
difference in employment rates would have suggested that the program increased employment rate
by 25 percentage points (or 83 percent), substantially larger than our quasi-experimental estimate
of 16 percentage points (or 50 percent).

The EF program also leads to persistent improvements in the underemployment rate (i.e., cases in
which people are working fewer hours than they wish). Table 8 shows that EF-sponsored training
courses increased hours worked in IGAs for the pooled cohorts by 19-21 hours per month (i.e., 28-
30 percent). All three model specifications exhibit a statistically significant and positive impact.

We detect strong program impacts on monthly earnings. We measure earnings as an individual‚Äôs
total earnings in the past month, including income from all IGAs, but not including unearned
income.52 We observe a statistically significant (at the 1 percent level) increase in monthly earnings
for the treatment group by 850 to 921 NRs (‚âà 12 USD), from a baseline average of 1272 NRs (‚âà
17 USD).53 In percentage terms, this earnings increase translates to a 72 percent for the pooled
sample.

With alternative measurements of earnings, we detect even larger program impacts. To account
for the highly skewed nature of earnings distributions, we examine the impact on logged earnings
and we find impacts of over 100 percent. A third way to examine the impact on earnings is to
consider the proportion of participants who earned a ‚Äúdecent living.‚Äù The Employment Fund
considers 3000 NRs per month (‚âà 40 USD) as ‚Äúgainful employment‚Äù and considers this amount
as ‚Äúbeing productively employed.‚Äù At baseline, only about 20 percent of the sample was ‚Äúgainfully
employed‚Äù. The EF training program increased the ‚Äúgainful employment‚Äù rate increases by 13 to
14 percentage points, a result statistically significant across all three models. The surveys of the
2011 and 2012 cohorts provide data on self-employment and work outside of home, conditional
on having non-farm employment. We find an increase in self-employment (significant at the 5
percent level) and no increase in the proportion of people working outside the home.


52If an individual did not work in the past month, his/her earnings are recorded as zero.
53This average is based on the entire study cohort, including those with zero earnings at baseline. The average earnings among
those with non-zero earnings were 2928 NRs, translating to a percentage increase in earnings of 30%.


                                                              19
c. Non-Employment Impacts for the Full Sample

The last four rows of Table 8 present the estimated impacts on savings and borrowing behavior.
We find no systematic impacts of the EF training program on loans. The program had a significant
and positive impact on individual total savings ‚Äì a year into the program, savings increased by 901
to 1171 NRs (‚âà 12 to 15 USD).

Table 9 presents program impacts on a range of empowerment outcomes. Because empowerment
is a multi-dimensional concept, we examine various aspects of empowerment ‚Äì from psychological
empowerment,54 entrepreneurial self-confidence,55 and financial literacy56 to control over
resources.57 The results show a number of significant impacts of the EF training program. Relative
to the control group, EF training participants report having more money of their own, more control
over household spending, and more access to mentors who can advise them on work-related
matters. These measures indicate strong gains in economic empowerment. We also see strong
gains on psychological empowerment, including significant increases in self-confidence both in
life and with regard to entrepreneurial activities. The gains are on the order of 0.1 to 0.15 standard
deviations. We also find marginal impacts, equal to about 0.13 of a standard deviation, on the self-
regulation ability of trainees, which reflects the respondent‚Äôs self-reported ability to control
impulses, delay gratification, stick to difficult or detail-oriented tasks, and exert control over what
happens in their life, all of which are predictors of labor market success. . Taken together, these
positive impacts on six out of 10 empowerment indicators demonstrate how a skills training
program and subsequent employment can benefit youth in a number of realms.

The final set of outcomes examined relate to reproductive health and household-level outcomes.58
Table 10 shows that the EF program had no average effects on desired fertility. The program had


54 Psychological constructs related to self-confidence and self-regulation were measured using a series of questions to which the
respondent indicates their level of agreement (using variations of a Likert scale), which were then aggregated into a single score.
The self-regulation scale included questions on goal-setting and self-control. Preliminary reliability testing yielded a Cronbach‚Äôs
alpha of 0.77 for the self-regulation scale.
55 The entrepreneurial score is based on the respondent‚Äôs self- confidence to perform a series to tasks related to running a

business or searching for a job. The specific tasks asked were: Find information about job opportunities in your community,
Apply and interview for a job, Run your own business, Work in a team with 3-4 other people to accomplish a task, Identify
income generating activities to start up a new business, Obtain credit from a bank, microfinance institution, CBO or NGO,
Manage financial accounts, and Collect the money someone owes you. Respondents rated their ability to do these tasks on a scale
of 1 to 5, and their responses were summed to form a single numerical score.
56 Financial literacy is defined as responding correctly to at least one out of th ree questions indicating the respondent‚Äôs familiarity

with interest rates and ability to perform a mathematical computation (about one-third of respondents got the question right at
baseline)
57 Control over monetary resources is asked in a variety of ways in different sections of the survey questionnaire, including a

direct question on whether the respondent has any money of his own that he alone can decide how to use, whether he/she can
decide how to spend any earnings from employment or whether he/she needs permission, and whether he/she controls her own
savings, and the extent to which he/she participates in decisions regarding common household expenditures such as food and
medicine.
58 The rationale for studying the effects of a job training program on reproductive health outcomes comes from the strong links

between employment and fertility decisions, particularly for female youth. When first entering the labor market, many youth are
making concurrent decisions about whether to pursue paid work outside the home, whether and when to start a family, and how


                                                                  20
no impacts on pregnancy. The EF training had no detectable impact on HIV knowledge, on
household food insecurity,59 or on protein consumption.60

Understanding the full-array of potential advantages and disadvantages of job training entails
considering the EF program impacts on trainees‚Äô out-migration. Nepal‚Äôs youth labor force out-
migration rates hover around 20 per cent every year, with as many as 350,000 Nepalese leaving
the country to look for employment opportunities elsewhere, including mainly in Persian Gulf
countries and Malaysia. On the one hand, out-migration may improve outcomes for the migrants‚Äô
family through remittances. On the other hand, investing in skills development for youth only to
have those youth depart the country may cause concern for policymakers. This evaluation finds no
evidence that the EF program increased out-migration, at least in the short run. Not only do we not
find any increase on the receipt or amounts of remittances received by households of trainees (as
shown in the last two rows of Table 10), but the fact that we were able to successfully re-interview
89 percent of the baseline survey respondents approximately a year after program enrollment
indicates that almost all of them remained in the country.

d. Trade-wise Program Impacts on the Full Sample

The Employment Fund sponsors about 600 training courses annually -- from short four-week
courses on incense-stick rolling to three-month technical courses. The breadth of course offerings
attracts individuals of varied training and career needs.61 Our evaluation sample includes a bit more
than 10 percent of the courses on offer each year (shown in Tables 1 and 2). Panel 1 of Table 11
shows the breakdown of courses by trade.

We grouped training courses into seven categories.62 The most common categories of training in
our sample are Electrical/Electronics/Computer (e.g., electric wiring, computer hardware
technician, and mobile phone repair), Construction/Mechanical/Automobile (e.g., arc welding,
brick molding, furniture making, motor bike service), and Tailoring/Garment/Textile (e.g.,
galaicha weaving, garment fabrication, hand embroidery, tailoring and dressmaking). Because we
sample approximately the same number of applicants per event, the breakdown of applicants by
trade (Panel 2 of Table 11) is very similar to the event-wise breakdown.

Table 12 shows that the impacts of the skills training program differed markedly by type of trade
for the pool 2010-2012 samples. Training in electronics, beautician, and tailoring consistently


to balance the two. Previous impact evaluations have shown that empowerment in one realm (such as employment) can affect
decisions in other areas of life.
59 Measured using 4 questions adapted from the standard FANTA scale, with a higher score representing more insecurity.
60 Measured as whether the household consumes meat, fish, or eggs 5 or more times per week.
61 The Employment Fund mandates that all graduates sit for a skills certification test overseen by the National Skills Testing

Board (NSTB) for any trade in which such a test exists. Most of the EF training courses offer ‚ÄúLevel 1‚Äù certification; in a f ew
trades the EF‚Äôs training providers also offer more advanced, or ‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù courses.
62 NSTB categories dictated groupings.




                                                                21
show strong ITT impacts on employment‚Äîgraduates of these training programs are more likely
to have employment in general and are also more likely to be working in the trade in which they
were trained. Beautician training shows large impacts on both employment and earnings.

We detect no significant impacts on employment or earnings outcomes for the remaining four
trades. Results for food and hospitality (e.g., cooking and wait service) show no significant ITT
impacts; results for construction show no significant impacts except for a marginal impact on
trade-specific employment and on earning more than 3000 NRs per month.63 For the remaining
three trades (i.e., poultry technician, handicrafts and farming), we detect some ITT impacts but
they are not consistent across models.

Overall, the results in Tables 12 reveal substantial heterogeneity in employment outcomes across
the various types of training. The positive and significant impacts discussed in Section VIb are
driven almost entirely by three categories of trades: electronics, beautician training, and tailoring
trades show positive and significant impacts on employment and earnings across both cohorts. We
find no impacts for the food/hospitality and farming training. Construction-related trainings
showed positive and significant impacts, but the effects are not consistent across outcomes.64

e. Gender- and Age- disaggregated Impacts

An important objective of this report is to examine program impacts for men and women, and in
particular for the ‚ÄúAGEI‚Äù population (i.e., young women aged 16 to 24). To that end, Tables 14-
19 disaggregates the results to compare outcomes for men versus women, and for younger women
(the ‚ÄúAGEI‚Äù population) versus older women.65

Table 14 shows the differences in program impacts by gender. The employment impacts are
significantly larger for women than for men, indicating that the EF program is more effective at
increasing both overall employment and non-farm employment for female participants than for
male. The results for other economic outcomes, such as hours worked, earnings, and type of
employment, are similar for both sexes.

Several factors could account for the differential in employment impacts between men and women.
First, when asked, T&E providers suggested that female students attend classes more and are more
diligent than male students. We lack data on the attendance or completion rates of EF trainees;

63 Construction is a unique case in which some labor demand comes from the Middle East and other foreign countries; the fact
that the construction trainings do not increase employment and earnings, regardless of location of employment, may help to
explain why no impacts on remittances were observed in Table 15.
64 The difference in impacts may be driven by the types of training falling under this category (the 2010 sample includes more

brick-molding courses while 2011 includes more furniture making), the characteristics of the trainees (brick-molding is female-
dominated), or may reflect differences in the demand for construction labor in those two years. With the exception of poultry
training, all of the training categories were offered in several districts throughout the country, so it is unlikely that local market
differences are driving the observed differences in results.
65 For simplicity, we present only the Inverse Propensity Score (IPSW) regression model results.




                                                                  22
however, the rate of non-compliance with treatment assignment is equal for men and women,
suggesting that this mechanism is unlikely to exert much influence on outcomes. Second, the
Employment Fund introduced life skills training for women in 2011 in all of its training courses.66
Because all women received life-skills training, we cannot disentangle the influence of this factor,
from other program elements, on outcomes. A third explanation is simply that men start with a
higher level of non-farm employment (47 percent compared to 20 percent for women at baseline)
and hence it may be easier to make large gains on the extensive margin for women. A fourth
possible explanation relates to the difference between the types of trades that men and women
apply for. Although the Employment Fund specifically tries to encourage female participation in
non-traditionally female trades, most of the training courses tend to be heavily gender-segregated.
For example, men tend to dominate electronics and construction courses, while the tailoring and
beautician trainings are comprised almost exclusively of females. As shown earlier, the tailoring
and beautician trainings exhibit the largest employment impacts.67

The results in Table 15 indicate that the impacts on the employment outcomes for the AGEI sample
(women aged 15 to 24) resemble the ones for older women (aged 25 to 35). We detect almost no
statistically significant differences between younger and older women, meaning that the EF
program appears to work equally well for the young women trained under the AGEI. The only
difference we find between these two groups is that, conditional on employment, young women
saw larger gains on obtaining work outside the home than older women.

Table 16 shows the differential impacts by gender on empowerment outcomes. Some of the
average impacts shown in Table 9 are shown to be stronger for men or for women. For men, we
detect a significantly larger impact on control over household spending, though the difference is
only significant at the 10% level. For women, we detect a significantly larger impact on having a
mentor, as well as a marginally larger gains in control over earnings and mobility relative to men.
In Table 17, there are no significant differences in empowerment impacts between younger and
older women.

The final set of results, in Table 18, examines the impacts on reproductive health and family-level
outcomes by gender. While the full sample results in Table 10 showed no impact on desired
fertility, disaggregating by gender reveals that the program had significant, though countervailing,
impacts on men and women. For men, the EF program increased the desired number of children
while for women the desired number of children went down. Despite this change in fertility
preferences, we do not detect significant impacts on pregnancy or actual fertility. Table 18 also

66 The forty-hour curriculum covered topics such as negotiation skills, workers‚Äô rights, sexual and reproductive health, and
dealing with discrimination. Female students overwhelmingly responded positively to the life skills training, often claiming that it
was one of their favorite parts of the course. The skills learned and the positive experience in this life skills training may
contribute to the increased employment impact for women, which is line with the advice from experts in vocational training from
around the world, who increasingly advocate for the inclusion of life skills in technical training programs
67 It is entirely possible, in addition to the gender-related explanation, that occupations for which one obtains skills in the tailoring

and beautician courses are more profitable (relative to other occupations) in the Nepali labor market.


                                                                   23
shows a marginally larger impact on protein consumption for men relative to women. We detect
no statistically significant difference between the effects for family and reproductive health
outcomes (Table 19) for younger women in the AGEI sample compared to older women.

VII. Summary and Implications

In this section, we summarize the impacts of the Employment Fund‚Äôs training program. The EF
program aims to increase employment among Nepal‚Äôs disadvantaged youth through skills training
and job placement support. It is one of the largest providers of Technical Education and Vocational
Training (TEVT) in Nepal, and it works with local non-governmental training providers to offer
courses of up to three months in a variety of trades, followed by six months of employment
placement support.

To understand the effects of the EF program, we compared the experience of EF program trainees
with the experience of comparable non-trainees, approximately one year after the program. Our
sample included both male and female trainees, with a particular focus on the AGEI population
(i.e., females aged 16-24).

Approximately one year after each baseline survey, we conducted a follow-up survey. The
response rates were quite high for both follow-up surveys. Overall, the survey firm was able to
track and successfully interview 89 percent of the baseline survey respondents. We detect a high
degree of training uptake (65 to 74 percent) among the group offered training, but also a high
degree of participation among the control group. Between 26 percent and 36 percent of the
individuals in the control group participated in the EF training course that they applied for, even
though their scores did not qualify them for admission.

Using a combination of difference-in-difference and propensity score matching methods, we find
positive and statistically significant effects on labor market outcomes for EF trainees on the
following outcomes:
           ÔÇ∑ employment rates (any or non-farm);
           ÔÇ∑ finding employment related to the skill they learned;
           ÔÇ∑ hours worked
           ÔÇ∑ earnings; and
           ÔÇ∑ the proportion of people earnings more than 3000 NRs per month

Individuals selected for EF training programs experience an increase in non-farm employment of
15 to 16 percentage points for an overall gain of 50 percent. We detect an increase in average
monthly earnings of approximately 72 percent. The gains for individuals who actually complete
the training (not just those who are selected for training) are even larger, as discussed in Annex 3.




                                                 24
We also find strong impacts of EF training programs on economic and psychological
empowerment. Trainees had more control over economic resources and stronger self-assessed self-
confidence. In contrast to the findings on employment and empowerment outcomes, we find
limited evidence of impacts on reproductive health or household level outcomes.

Alongside the sizable general impacts on employment outcomes, we find that training courses in
electronics, beautician services, and tailoring underpin most of the EF program‚Äôs impacts. These
three categories of training are much more effective in consistently increasing employment and
earnings than construction, poultry rearing, handicrafts, and food preparation and hospitality.

We also find larger impacts on employment for women than for men. Women selected for training
in 2010 to 2012 experience overall and non-farm employment gains of 13 and 19 percentage points
respectively, while the corresponding impacts for men are 2 and 10 percent. However, we find no
significant differences by gender on other economic indicators such as earnings, hours worked,
trade-specific employment, or savings and loans.

The impacts for young women aged 16 to 24 are not significantly different from those for older
women aged 25 to 35. This finding highlights the suitability of TEVT programs for younger
women, although it may require specialized outreach strategies to recruit them. The larger impacts
for women overall are consistent with the findings of rigorous evaluations of several training
programs in Latin America, though uncovering the reasons for these differences requires further
research.

The EF training program impacts are among the largest for training programs that have been
evaluated around the world. We posit two factors as possible explanations of these large impacts.
First, the EF had time to become established and to develop systems prior to the launch of the
impact evaluation in 2010. Most impact evaluations are conducted during the pilot stage of project
implementation, and consequently they do not always measure program impacts at their best. In
this evaluation, the program was already operating at scale, and the service delivery processes
already road-tested, which surely contribute to the large impacts. Second, the EF program is
designed around employment outcomes. For instance, training providers must complete market
assessments as part of their proposals to ensure future employability in the trades in which they
propose to train individuals. Training providers are rewarded with outcome-based payments that
are higher if they can demonstrate that their graduates have found work, a policy which fosters an
incentive to not just train young people, but to find jobs for them. The fact that many training
providers return year after year to work with the EF despite this unusual contracting arrangement
speaks to the feasibility of this approach.

These unique program features, along with the results shown in this evaluation, provide valuable
guidance and evidence for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers interested in improving
employment opportunities for young people in Nepal and around the world.

Notes: Standard errors (reported in brackets) clustered by training course. "Treat (ITT)"
equals 1 if individual qualified for a training course and 0 otherwise. Other independent
variables (not shown): district and T&E provider fixed effects, training-type categories,
quintiles of household wealth. All variables measured at baseline. Although baseline data
were collected on 4,677 individuals, incomplete data on ethnicity reduces the number of
observations to 4,449. *,**, and *** denote significance at the 10% level, 5% level, and

Annex 3. Analysis of Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT)
Impacts

This Annex analyzes the impact of the Employment Fund program on people who actually participated in
EF-sponsored trainings. These results are called ‚ÄúAverage Treatment Effects on the Treated‚Äù and differ
conceptually from the ITT impacts reported in the main paper. The difference lies in the definition of
treatment: for ITT estimates, the treatment group includes anyone whose score was above the threshold
for the training course they applied for, that is, their score qualified them for admission to training. For
ATT estimates, the treatment group includes anyone who actually participated in that training course,
regardless of their score. People who were offered training but declined to participate are counted as
‚Äútreatment‚Äù under ITT, and ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù under ATT. People whose score did not qualify them for training,
but who nonetheless participated (perhaps because they were an alternate) count as ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù under ITT,
but ‚Äútreatment‚Äù under ATT. Simply put, ITT analysis reports the effects for those selected into the program
whereas ATT analysis reports the effects for those who actually participated in the program.

As described in Section Vc, both the ITT and ATT estimates likely suffer from some degree of bias. As
expected, the ATT impacts are generally larger than the ITT impacts: since the ATT comparison only
includes people who actually participated in EF training courses in the treatment group, it is not diluted
by the inclusion of people who were chosen for, but did not take the training. The drawback of the ATT
comparison is that there is no way to account for the unobservable characteristics (such as motivation
or ability) that led some people to decline the offer of participation or some control group members
from gaining access. Because the ATT estimates always exceed the ITT estimates in our analysis, we will
frame the impacts as a range, with the ITT estimate serving as a lower bound and the ATT estimate
serving as the upper bound. To that end, we will replicate the previous (ITT) estimates of the program
impact (reported in Tables 7-10, and 12-19 in the main paper) using the ATT definition of treatment and
control groups. The consequent results are described in the remainder of this Annex.


As with the ITT definition of treatment and control group, we find significant differences between groups
at baseline in the ATT comparison. The baseline balance tests reported in Table A3.1 show that the
treatment group consists of a higher share of Janajati and Muslim but lower share of Dalit individuals.
Moreover, the treatment group is less educated in terms of completion of 10th grade (SLC) and desires a
lower number of children at baseline on average. Further, a higher share of treatment group individuals
reported that they had savings at the time of the interview and that they had been engaged in an income
generating activity in the past month.

First-Stage (Table A3.2): The results are broadly similar to those of the ITT analysis in Table 7. Being Muslim
and having a child is positively correlated with treatment, while the average number of children an
individual has is negatively correlated with treatment. Unlike in the ITT analysis, for the ATT comparison
we also find that being engaged in an income generating activity at baseline is positively correlated with
program participation. Although the correlation is only significant at the 10 percent level, this finding
possibly confirms our earlier assumption that the results from the ATT analysis might be slightly upwardly
biased. Individuals who start off with a higher motivation for seeking employment, may also have been
more successful in self-selecting into the program even though they had initially not been selected for

                                                                                                             50
training. Therefore, it is important to emphasize again that the ATT results should be interpreted with
care and can only serve as a higher bound of the program‚Äôs impact.

Full Sample Results (Tables A3.3 to A3.5): For economic outcomes in Table A3.3, the ATT results are in
most cases higher than the ITT estimates. Both, the ATT and the ITT results for the first outcome
(employment) are uniformly positive and significant. Yet, the impact estimated in the ATT specification
is 9 to 13 percentage points increase in labor market participation, while the estimates of the ITT
comparison indicate ‚Äúonly‚Äù an increase of 7 to 9 percentage points. The impact on non-farm
employment ranges from 20 to 21 percentage points, compared to 15 to 16 percentage points for the
ITT results. And the trade-specific employment rate, or the likelihood of obtaining employment in the
same trade of one‚Äôs training, ranges from 23 to 24 percentage points, compared to 18 to 19 percentage
points for the ITT estimates. Turning to the impact on earnings, the ATT results are again uniformly
higher than the ITT results for average earnings, logged earnings, and the proportion of people earning
greater than 3000 NRs per month, indicating ‚Äúgainful‚Äù employment. Although differences in earnings
across groups are higher in the ATT analysis, total savings are lower and logged savings even turn
insignificant compared to the ITT specification. A possible explanation for this finding may be the higher
rise in self-employment in the ATT based analysis (9 to 10 percentage points, compared to 6 percentage
points in the ITT based analysis). In the process of becoming self-employed, it is likely that individuals
might have used parts of their savings as initial investment for their small-scale businesses.

The ATT estimates for the empowerment outcomes (Table A3.4), are generally consistent with the ITT
estimates in the main paper. EF training participants report having more control over household
spending, more access to mentors who can advise them on work-related matters, and more money of
their own. Except for the latter indicator, all estimates are slightly higher in the ATT compared to the ITT
analysis. The same is true for the estimated impacts on self-regulation ability and entrepreneurial self-
confidence. Additionally, we find significant evidence for improvements in control over earnings and
mobility in the ATT specification. Only for the estimates on the psychological measures of self-
confidence we do not find consistent results across specifications. While the ITT analysis showed strong
and significant impacts in this regard, the ATT estimates are much lower and clearly insignificant. This
indicates that self-confidence rose with being selected into the program, but was apparently not
affected by actual participation.

Table A3.5 on reproductive health and family outcomes shows no evidence that the EF training program
has any impact on desired fertility, pregnancies, actual number of children, contraceptive use, HIV
knowledge, and protein consumption. Unlike the (very weak) evidence from ITT results from Table 10, the
ATT results do not show any significant reduction in food insecurity among EF training participants relative
to non-participants. Compared to the ITT results, the ATT table in turn shows some weak evidence of a
decline in arguments with one‚Äôs partner in the matching specification. These results are not precise
enough or consistent across specifications, though, and therefore should not be interpreted as an overall
significant impact of the program. We further find a slight upward shift (3 percentage points) in the share
of households that experienced an increase in received remittances. Yet, the result is only statistically
significant on the 5 to 10 percent level and its economic importance is limited.

Analysis by Trade (Table A3.6): The trade-wise impacts in Table A3.6 are generally consistent with the ITT
impacts from Table 12, with some notable differences. The construction training delivers large ATT

                                                                                                          51
impacts on employment and earnings, but no according significant ITT impacts, implying that those who
do not take up the training may be able to find employment, but they do not earn as much as those who
actually complete the training and are assisted by their training providers to find employment
opportunities. 68 We observe a similar phenomenon for food/hospitality related training, indicating that
those who completed the training did better than those who dropped out. While ITT effects in all four
employment measures are negative (yet insignificant) or zero, ATT effects on monthly earnings and trade
specific employment are large. Also, training in Handicrafts shows an additional significant ATT impact on
earning more than 3000 NRs per month, while the ITT estimate is not significant.
In contrast, poultry training shows negative ATT impacts on monthly earnings and earning more than 3000
NRs (the latter not being significant) in comparison to the non-significant but strongly positive ITT effects.
In addition the ATT estimate on trade specific employment decreases compared to the ITT analysis. This
unusual pattern of impacts may indicate that the people who drop out of this training are actually better
off than the people who complete it (although the small number of trainees in this training category make
any generalizations unreliable). Since these courses tend to attract rural and less educated trainees, it is
plausible that the most able among them seek out better opportunities even after gaining admission to
the course.

Gender-disaggregated impacts (Table A3.7, to A3.12): The ATT results on employment outcomes in Table
A3.7 show significant impacts for men and women. While in the ITT results on employment we only find
significant impacts for women, the ATT estimates show positive impacts for both gender. Although the
estimate for women is still higher compared to men, the difference between men and women, in contrast
to the ITT results in Table 14 is now statistically insignificant. The impact on non-farm employment,
however, is higher for women (as it is in the ITT results). Further, we find significant impacts for men and
women on trade specific employment, monthly earnings of more than 3000 NRs, and savings (only
women), where the impacts are in each case significantly higher for female than for male participants. On
the contrary, our results show an impact on taking loans for male participants only.
Table A3.8 overall confirms the results of the ITT analysis in Table 15, which showed that employment
impacts of the program do generally not differ by a women‚Äôs age. Only one significant age related
difference in impacts on employment outcomes was observed in the ITT analysis, namely take-up of
employment outside of the home (positive and significant impact for young women but not for the old).
This result, however, is not confirmed in the ATT analysis. Instead, the ATT estimates weakly suggest that
the program has affected the ability to earn more than 3000 NRs monthly for both age groups, but even
more for older women.

Table A3.9 presents gender-disaggregated ATT results on empowerment. We see a positive and significant
improvement in control over earnings and a gain in mobility only for women, which is similar to the
pattern of ITT results. Although, we again find an impact on control over household spending for men
only, the difference between men and women is not significant in the ATT analysis. Yet, trained men
slightly loose on their financial literacy.

  Breaking the analysis down to separate cohorts (results not shown) reveals a big difference in these estimates between the
2010 and 2011 cohorts in construction- related trainings, where there was no significant ATT impact in 2010 but very positive
and significant effects in 2011. These differences may be driven by the types of training falling under this category (the 2010
sample includes more brick-molding courses while 2011 includes more furniture making), the characteristics of the trainees
(brick-molding is female-dominated), or may reflect differences in the demand for construction labor between those two years.
                                                                                                                             52
Overall, there are no significant differences in the program‚Äôs impact on empowerment outcomes
comparing young and old women (Table A3.10). The exception being, that we see a large positive and
significant effect for trained older women on self-confidence levels, an effect that does not apply to the
younger AGEI sample.

Finally, Table A3.11 examines the gender-disaggregated ATT impacts of the EF training program on
reproductive health and family-level outcomes. Consistent with the full sample ATT results in Table A3.5,
we see no significant impact on pregnancy. Moreover, the results that trained men show a higher protein
intake and desire more children, while trained women desire less children (as seen in the ITT results in
Table 18) are not confirmed in the ATT analysis. However, the ATT estimates suggest a similar pattern for
the actual number of children. While the number of children of trained men increased by 3 percentage
points it fell by 4 percentage points for female participants.
Consistent with the analysis of ITT impacts across age, we do not find any significant difference in impacts
on reproductive health or household level outcomes between young and old women in the ATT estimates.

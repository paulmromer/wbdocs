    1. Introduction and country context

According to World Bank Development Indicators, Lebanon is an upper middle income country with an
estimated population of 4.5 million people and GDP per capita of 17,462 USD in 2014 (based on 2011
PPPs). The country is well known for its high level of human development and open economy. Yet, social
and economic performance of the country has been moderate during the last 40 years because of numerous
domestic and international political and religious shocks including wars with Israel, major political
assassinations, waves of terrorism activities, and spillovers from regional conflicts‚Äîthe latest being the
Syrian conflict. Understanding how changes in the country ‚Äì both positive and adverse factors -- have
affected the population requires a timely and accurate statistical foundation.

Lebanon is a sectarian-based consensual democracy, where population demographics are a particularly
sensitive and political issue. The timely collection of social, economic and demographic statistics is a
difficult task in any environment, but it is all the more challenging in Lebanon where demography is directly
linked to governance. In part due to these challenges, the last official census in Lebanon was conducted in
1932, and the latest update of the population estimate was made in 1964, drawing on civil status registers
within the Ministry of the Interior (European Union, 2009). The Ministry of Social Affairs, supported by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and in partnership with the Central Administration of
Statistics (CAS), undertook the first multipurpose household survey (living conditions and household
budget survey). This socio-economic survey was conducted during February 2004 to April 2005 on about
13,000 households distributed nationwide. The sample covered the whole de facto population, except the
Palestinian population living in the refugee camps. This data was used to construct a lower, extreme poverty
line as well as an upper poverty line, both of which were used to produce measures of absolute poverty.
CAS received technical support from World Bank staff on the construction of welfare aggregate, and
technical support from UNDP on the estimation of household-specific poverty lines.

UNDP (2008) provides a full description of the methodology and the profile of poverty in Lebanon as
portrayed by the 2004-05 data. Eight percent of the Lebanese population were estimated to be in extreme
poverty (i.e. living below the extreme poverty line), essentially not able to meet their most basic food and
nonfood needs in 2004/2005. An estimated 28.5 percent of the population were poor as defined by the upper
poverty line. Striking differences in consumption per capita and headcount poverty rates were identified
across regions with the North Lebanon, South and Bekka being the poorest.

The second household budget survey (HBS) was implemented by CAS in 2011 with technical assistance
from the World Bank. In addition to meeting the core statistical needs of the government to understand the
overall wellbeing of the population, the data was also needed to create a baseline for evaluating the impact
of the National Poverty Targeting program, to update the proxy means test used for this program, and more
generally to develop a social protection and human development strategy. The survey was conducted during
the period of September 2011 to November 2012. The sample design for the 2011 HBS was different from
the 2004 HBS in that it was stratified across nine regions (compared to 15 strata in 2004) and was originally
planned to include 4805 households. Due to differences in the sample design, different methodologies to
construct welfare aggregate and poverty line, as well as specific data issues, poverty estimates presented in
this report are not comparable to estimates obtained based on 2004-05 data.


                                                                                                                       4
Several issues were encountered during data collection that negatively affected the quality of obtained data.
The survey was originally planned to be completed in 12 weeks, but lasted over a year, thereby introducing
concerns about seasonality into the regional profiles of wellbeing. Further, while the intended sample size
was 4805 households, the effective sample size was 2746 households due to a non-response rate of 43
percent. This rate is high by international standards (Mistiaen and Ravallion 2003, United Nations 2005)
and has the potential to introduce significant bias in point estimates if the households that did not respond
to the survey were systematically different from those who did participate.

The response rate varied significantly across administrative regions (mohafaza) from very low in Beirut
and Mount Lebanon (38 and 36 percent respectively) to high in South Lebanon and Nabatieh (76 percent).
Conventional wisdom, and findings from analysis carried out by CAS and the World Bank, suggest that the
likelihood that a household would not participate in the survey was increasing in income. The result of this
systematic tendency is that poorer households were more likely to participate and were essentially ‚Äúover
represented‚Äù in the data. CAS and World Bank staff worked together to produce adjustment factors to the
sampling weights to mitigate the potential non-response bias.

The purpose of this technical note is to describe how the welfare aggregate and poverty line were
constructed in Lebanon using HBS 2011.1 It is a part of broader collaboration between CAS and the World
Bank to improve data quality and poverty monitoring capabilities in the country. Different approaches have
been tested to correct non-response and to measure poverty. The note consists of eight sections. Section 2
briefly discusses main methodological issues in poverty measurement. Section 3 explains construction of
different components of welfare aggregate. Section 4 documents construction of poverty lines.
Triangulation of obtained poverty estimates, sensitivity analysis are conducted in section 5. This section
also contains supplementary poverty numbers based on consumption per adult equivalent. Finally, section
6 concludes and discusses areas for further consideration in poverty measurement.

    2. Methodological issues in poverty measurement

Measuring poverty requires two broad steps. The first step is to define an indicator to measure welfare or
living standards. The second step requires setting a poverty line - the minimum welfare level below which
person is considered to be poor.

The most common welfare indicators for poverty measurement are consumption or income per capita
derived from survey data. The choice between them is often made based on socio-economic conditions of
a country chosen for the analysis. Income is usually used to measure welfare in rich countries, while
consumption is often the preferred measure of welfare in low and middle-income countries. Consumption
includes both goods and services, whether purchased, home-produced or received as gifts. It thereby
provides a direct measure of realized welfare (ie. it measures what was actually consumed), while income
is sometimes viewed as providing a measure of potential welfare (ie. it provides a measure of what someone
could potentially consume). Often times though, the choice of whether to consider income or consumption
as the preferred indicator of welfare is linked more to how reliably each can be measured. Income tends to
be very hard to measure in countries where agriculture and self-employment are important employment

 A separate technical note has been prepared to discuss a strategy for unit non-response correction (CAS and World
Bank, 2015). The current note is a technical report with a sole purpose to explain the poverty methodology and should
not be viewed as a poverty assessment paper.

                                                                                                                   5
options. Moreover, in rural areas, income is subject to substantial seasonal volatility and consumption is
more likely to be representative of general level of welfare (Haughton and Khandker 2014).

The main guiding principle for welfare aggregate is to make it comprehensive enough to capture important
dimensions of wellbeing, while being attentive to concerns about measurement error. The key question to
ask is whether included component improves ability to correctly sort individuals in terms of their wellbeing,
or if the additional information simply adds noise to the measure. Food consumption, for example, includes
own production, transfers and eating outside home. Nonfood consumption usually excludes lumpy
infrequent expenditures (e.g. funerals, weddings), investment and items which are hard to estimate
accurately (public goods). Durables require a particular treatment because they are bought at a particular
point in time, but consumed during a period of several years. Consumption should include only the annual
use value of a durable rather than purchase value. The same principle should apply in measuring the value
of housing services (Deaton and Zaidi 2002, Haughton and Khandker 2014).

There is no consensus in literature on whether health expenditures should be included. One argument to
exclude health expenditure is because they often imply a regrettable necessity and do not contribute to
welfare. An even more fundamental issue is the inability to distinguish between health expenditures aimed
at improving welfare and health expenditure as regrettable necessity. The decision is sometimes made based
on elasticity of health expenditure with respect to total expenditure. Essentially if one observes individuals
with high values of consumption (not including health expenditures) also having high expenditures on
health, then it is assumed that on average health expenditures are reflecting preventative health
expenditures. So, a higher elasticity implies stronger case for inclusion.

After construction of the welfare aggregate, there is a need to make additional adjustments to allow for
poverty comparisons across individuals. One of the most important adjustments is spatial and inter-temporal
deflation to account for temporal and spatial difference in prices faced by households. The second important
adjustment is related to the adjustment of welfare aggregate for household composition. This can be done
by simply dividing household consumption by total household size or by taking into account household-
economies of scale and adult-equivalence scale adjustments.

Having constructed and adjusted welfare aggregate, the next step is construction of poverty line.
Households whose consumption expenditure or income fall below this line are considered poor. The
standard approach in setting a poverty line, followed in Lebanon, is the ‚Äúcost-of-basic-needs approach
(CBN). This approach consists of several steps. The first step is to identify a minimal nutrition requirement
for healthy living, usually defined in terms of minimal caloric requirements. This nutritional threshold is
typically estimated to ensure that it is consistent with local tastes and consumption patterns. For obvious
reasons, selecting one requirement for all individuals is an approximation given that food needs are
heterogeneous across the population, but the advantage of having a single requirement is transparency,
simplicity and ease of communication. The second step is to estimate costs of meeting this food energy
requirement, using a diet that reflects the habits of households near the poverty line. This will give a food

component of poverty line. The third step is to add a non-food component to food poverty line which can
be done in various ways (Ravallion 1998).2

    3. Welfare aggregate and its components

This section describes the construction and adjustment of welfare aggregate in Lebanon based on 2011
HBS.
       3.1 Data issues

The survey was conducted during the period of September 2011 to November 2012. The sample design
differed from the previous HBS and was stratified across nine areas (Beirut Governorate, Beirut suburbs,
remaining Mount Lebanon, Akkar and Minieh-Danniyeh districts, remaining North Lebanon districts,
Baalbeck and Hermel, remaining Bekaa, South Governorate, Nabatiyeh Governorate) and was originally
planned to include 4805 households.3 Three survey forms have been used to collect the data: an individual,
seven-day diary of purchases filled in by adults older than 15 for themselves and children, an other-
expenditure form, based on three month or yearly recall period and a form to capture household
characteristics and living conditions.

Several important data issues should be kept in mind while interpreting results shown in this note. The most
important problem is associated with substantial and systematic unit non-response (ie. targeted households
that did not participate in the survey). As a result of the unit non-response, only 57 percent of the intended
sample was collected. No information was collected on non-respondents, complicating any ex-post
correction. In order to correct for non-response, rescaling of sample weights was done at PSU level
assuming non-response uniform at this level. Impact of rescaling and empirical verification are discussed
in a separate technical note (CAS and World Bank, 2015). Overall, impact of using rescaled weights over
raw weights is substantial (figure 1). Using rescaled weights increase consumption per capita by 10 percent.

  Obtained poverty line is often called upper poverty line, while in many countries lower poverty line constructed as
well. For lower poverty line, the reference population for nonfood share is from subsample of households whose
total expenditures per capita are close to food poverty line.
3
  Nine strata are aggregated into six administrative regions called mohafaza. All regionally disaggregated results in
this paper are shown for these six administrative regions.

                                                                                                                    7

 Note: Due to small sample size, regionally disaggregated statistics presented in this note should be treated with
 caution.

Due to security reasons, the survey lasted over a year instead of being completed during the intended 12
weeks. Lack of temporal stratification of the fieldwork led to data collection occurring in several regions
primarily in the fall when households have substantial food purchases preparing for winter. This essentially
introduces concerns about seasonality bias in any sub-national estimates. In particular in Mount Lebanon
and North Lebanon, more than 50 percent of survey was conducted in autumn (figure 2). This led to
distortions in food purchases as shown in figure 3. For example, purchases of olive oil were much higher
than what was observed, for example, in Beirut. Having high food consumption in poor North Lebanon
created a problem for construction of nonfood poverty as will be discussed and seen further in the text.

The last important issue is related to item non-response in the individual diary. About 27 percent of
individuals older than 15 did not fill the diary completely (CAS distinguishes between individuals with zero
purchases and those who did not fill the diary). In 8 percent of households nobody filled the individual
diary. To address the item-level non-response, some missing purchases have been filled in with imputed
values.

       3.2 Food items

Household food consumption is constructed from information provided by the individual diary which was
designed to be filled in by all adults older than 15 years of age. Each adult is supposed to report daily
purchases he or she made during seven days. One household member filled the diary for children below 15
years age. The diaries and forms include food and nonfood expenditures for personal use. The food diary
includes measures of all food items consumed from purchases in cash, transfers and home produced
products as estimated by the respondent. An important data quality issue is that slightly less than one third
of adults did not completely fill in the diaries. To address this issue, when sub-aggregates of food and
nonfood items are missing, imputed values have been assigned to them. As a first step, individual-level
purchasing information has been aggregated to six COICOP groups: food, non-alcoholic beverages and
tobacco, furnishings and household equipment, transport, restaurants and hotels, and miscellaneous goods
and services. Exact COICOP groups taken from the diary are shown in the annex.4

Several imputation methods were considered to impute missing purchases for six COICOP groups at
individual level, but two estimators were the most methodologically appropriate for the data. The first
method is based on the Tobit regression model for censored data. The second approach considered is based
on predictive mean matching from multiple imputation technique where the imputed value is the average
of five predictions (StataCorp 2013). Predictors used in the models include: nonfood expenditure per capita,
education, marital status, gender, age group, region, employment status, type of employment, type of
residence, dummy if diary is related to respondent and all family members aged less than 15.

Before imputation, respondents and non-respondents have been compared to check if there are systematic
differences between them. This was done by estimating the probability of responding (with a probit
estimator) based on a set of observable characteristics. The estimates reveal that the probability of filling in
the diary drops with age and household size. In addition, the model indicates that those who filled the diary
are from households with higher nonfood consumption per capita. (This is observed both in the
unconditional bi-variate model and in models controlling for other factors.) If one assumes nonfood
consumption per capita is positively correlated with food consumption per capita, imputed purchases should
be lower than reported values.

Average consumption per capita (nominal, not spatially deflated) by regions, as estimated by both
imputation methods are presented in figure 5, and compared to the value from no imputation (which treats
missing at the level of the six aggregates as zero). As expected, the lowest consumption per capita is
observed if no imputation is done, this is because missing values at the higher level of aggregation are
treated as zeros. Figure 4 compares the cumulative density function for imputed values for non-responders
with responders, for each imputation approach. Figure 4 indicates that the predictive mean approach results

                         is in tension with the inference from the nonfood comparisons that non-responders have lower nonfood
                         consumption levels. In contrast, the Tobit model predicts lower purchases as expected. In part due to this
                         finding, and also due to the result in figure 5 that the Tobit-based imputations are more modest that then
                         predictive mean method, the Tobit-based imputations have been used in the welfare aggregate.

expenditures, utilities for primary and secondary dwelling, housing services and information about rent are
estimated from the household characteristics and living condition form. In a few cases there are duplicated
COICOP groups across forms, and these have been removed from the welfare aggregate.

            3.3.1    Rents

Information on actual and reported rents is collected in the household characteristics and living condition
form. From 2,746 sampled households, 430 rented apartments. Most of the remaining households (n=2259
households) owned dwellings and reported estimated rent answering the question ‚Äúhow much do you
estimate the monthly rent of the house/apartment you occupy‚Äù. Of these households, 57 had missing values
to this question.

Figure 6 presents the number of households that reported actual rent paid by regions and this reveals that
sample sizes are very small in some regions. For example, in Nabatieh there are only six observations on
reported rent. An implication of this is that trying to impute rental values of homeowners based on hedonic
rent models will likely fail to reflect important regional variation in the cost of shelter. A second issue with
reported actual rent is that rent control exists for some of the older dwellings, and this attribute is not
observable (ie. the data do not allow for distinguishing rents with rent control from those without). The
inclusion of rent-controlled dwellings in the hedonic rent model will contaminate the imputation for the
‚Äúuse-value‚Äù of the dwelling.

Table 1 reports a series of hedonic regression models where actual rent and estimated rent are regressed on
a series of housing characteristics. Each of these models could potentially be used to predict the use-value
of shelter, and all have potential concerns. For example, some important explanatory variables such as
dwelling area are not significant in the regression explaining actual rent. While there are measurement
concerns with all approaches, the concerns about sample size and rent control were the basis for deciding
to use estimated rents for the models used to predict rent based on a series of housing attributes (Table 1,
column 2). To ensure that all households are treated similarly, the predicted rental value from the model is
used for all households. Figure 7 shows, as one expects, that inclusion of predicted rent in the consumption
aggregate increases the regional dispersion of nominal consumption.

            3.3.2    Durables

Durable goods are typically important investments households make and often are useful indicators of the
wealth of the households. When it is possible to estimate a use-value of these goods, it can be a potentially
useful element of total consumption for distinguishing between the rich and poor. But, this estimation
requires a significant amount of data and the HBS survey collects very limited information on stocks of
durables. In particular, information on current value, age or condition of the goods is not available, and the
exclusion of this data prevents the estimation of an annualized flow of consumption from durables. One
exception to this is the case of transportation. For cars, motorcycles, buses and pick-ups owned by the
household, the survey collects information on the current value, age and brand of the vehicle. Given the
importance of cars and other private transportation in Lebanon, the decision was made to estimate annual
use-value of these vehicles as the annual rate of depreciation. Using this information, the regression below
was run with the current value of transport as a function of age of the vehicle, controlling for the brand for
each type of vehicle. From this regression, we derive the annual rate of depreciation and use this as the
estimated rental value of the vehicle.

  Log (current value of transport) = F (brand, age, brand*age)                                          (1)

Many households use cars for business purposes by providing taxi services and report percent of gasoline
spent on these activities. This percent is deducted from annual consumption flow obtained from the
regression (1). Final average annual depreciation (consumption flow) is shown in table 2. On average
households are estimated to consume about USD551 from their transport annually, based on an estimated
depreciation rate of nine percent.

             3.3.3   Education and health

As noted in section two, health expenditures can either reflect preventative care, in which case the person‚Äôs
wellbeing is improving, or can reflect a bad health outcome, in which case the person‚Äôs wellbeing is
deteriorating. To a lesser extent, education expenditures can also be viewed as either being consumption or
investment (where increased economic wellbeing is realized later in life). There are no clear rules on
whether education and health expenditures should be included or excluded from welfare aggregate and the
decision is mostly based on country context. Following Deaton and Zaidi (2012), the elasticity of education
and health expenditures to total expenditure per capita have been estimated. As often observed in other
countries, elasticity of education expenditures is higher than elasticity of health expenditures: 1.22 versus
0.8 accordingly. Taking this into account and the fact that health insurance will be included in the welfare
aggregate, the decision was to drop other health expenditures, but to include education expenditures. The
results of the sensitivity test of dropping health expenditures will be shown further in the text in figure 19.

       3.4 Adjustments to welfare aggregate

             3.4.1   Spatial adjustment

Prices typically vary across regions of a country, and between cities, towns and rural areas. To account for
this, spatial price deflators are often used to adjust the welfare aggregate. In many surveys, including the
Lebanon HBS, estimates of prices are only available for food items. For this reason, the welfare aggregate
(ie. per capita consumption) is adjusted for spatial price differences with an index based on food prices.
The food spatial deflator is constructed from unit values of food products (excluding alcohol and tobacco)
and is based on Paasche price index. Paasche index is calculated using the formula below
                                                     Ì†µÌ∞æ
                                                                Ì†µÌ±É‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ò
                                             Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É = ‚àë Ì†µÌ±§‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ò ‚àó
                                                                Ì†µÌ±É0Ì†µÌ±ò
                                                    Ì†µÌ±ò=1

where, Ì†µÌ±§‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ò is the share of household h's budget devoted to good k. P0 is reference price vector. Ph is a vector
of prices household face. For the spatial deflator, median regional and country level prices are used for each
household.

Unit food prices are calculated by dividing expenditures by purchased quantities. Several important steps
have to be made before the construction of spatial deflator. The most important step is to ensure that prices


                                                                                                                  14
for each product are reported in the same unit. Only 28 percent of all products from food diary have one
unit measure (figure 8). For an absolute majority of products two, three or even four units are reported. For
example, prices for eggs can be reported in pieces, kilograms and boxes. Assuming that food items reported
in one unit are on average the same quality as when reported in a different unit, it is straightforward to
convert all prices to a common unit for each item. In addition to converting all prices to consistent units for
each item, there is a need to clean the data for some products which are very rare and not observed
throughout the country. Steps below explain the whole process in detail.

For each product a ‚Äúmain‚Äù unit is created. Observations in other units are dropped. Unit is considered as a
‚Äúmain‚Äù if it accounts for 70 or more percent of observations for this particular product. For example, bread
is measured in kilograms or grams in most of the cases, water in liters and so forth. Given that prices in
liters and kilograms can be used interchangeably, the ‚Äúmain‚Äù unit is also created if sum of observations in
kilograms and liters is higher or equal to 70 percent.

Prior to estimating the price index, observations are dropped for the following reasons: 1.) if reported units
is different from the designated ‚Äúmain‚Äù unit; 2.) there are fewer than three observations of the product in a
region; 3.) the product is observed in less than three regions from six available. After cleaning the data, the
number of products declined from 258 to 136. However, the impact on the number of observations and
overall expenditures was not substantial. Only 20 percent of all observations and 13 percent of total
expenditures were lost.

Having cleaned the price data, mean prices at household level are created. Outliers are replaced by boundary
values equal to mean plus/minus two standard deviations. Weighted median prices at regional and country
level are calculated for each household and product. Household level deflators are constructed for each
product by dividing regional prices over country averages. Within each household, the weighted average
deflator is constructed using the expenditure share of different product as the weight. Afterwards, average
deflators for each of six region are calculated. A simple illustration of this procedure is shown in table 3.

The resulting food spatial deflator is shown in figure 10. The highest food prices are observed in Mount
Lebanon and Beirut. Lower than country average prices are observed in North Lebanon, Bekaa and South.

Ideally, the nonfood part of welfare aggregate should be adjusted by nonfood deflator. However, unit prices
for nonfood products are not available in the survey, while ancillary data on non-food prices does not
generate plausible numbers.5 One of the ways to overcome this challenge is to use rent prices as a proxy of
nonfood prices for spatial deflation. Given that actual rent values seem to be affected by rent control, we
have used reported rents of owners to estimate a hedonic model regression and to predict average rent for
six regions for a typical apartment. The most common apartment has five rooms with dwelling area of
apartment of 140 square meters in building of 25-49 years old with public sewage, tile floor and protected

 Another way of calculating spatial deflator is to use external source of information on prices. The authors tried using
a database with prices for 257 food and nonfood products collected by CAS, but ultimately decided that this approach
would not solve the issue given that only few nonfood products in housing section were available.

                                                                                                                      16

deflator. The results from this analysis are shown in table 4.

Rents in Beirut are the highest being 51 percent above the country average. Mount Lebanon is on the second
place with rents being 24 percent higher than the country average. In other regions, rent prices are lower
than the average for Lebanon. Given large share of nonfood consumption in Lebanon, the impact of nonfood
deflator is substantial. For example, if we apply food deflator to food consumption and rent deflator to
nonfood consumption, the estimated poverty rate in Beirut would be higher than in Nabatieh, which is
considered to be a non-credible finding. Largely for this reason, the decision was made to apply food
deflator to all components of welfare aggregate. After applying food deflator to welfare aggregate,
consumption is adjusted for intra-regional variation in prices (figure 11). Expectedly, nominal welfare
aggregates for Beirut and Mount Lebanon are higher than spatially deflated ones because of high prices in
these regions.

               3.4.2    Inter-temporal adjustment

Welfare aggregate should be adjusted for inter-temporal price variation because data collection period was
spread over one year. There is monthly information on prices for 12 COICOP groups in 6 regions. May
2012 was selected as a base and a new price indexes were constructed for 12 COICOP groups to deflate
nominal aggregate over the entire sample.

               3.4.3    Adjustment to household size

Consumption is measured at the level of the household, while poverty is most typically considered to be an
individual-level attribute. This means that the value of total household consumption needs to be allocated
to the members of each household in order to measure poverty. One common way of allocating household
consumption to the individual is to simply divide by household size; which is to say, to evenly allocate
household consumption to each member. This measure of consumption per capita is used in Tunisia and
Jordan. An alternative approach is to transform the household into adult equivalents, in terms of
consumption needs. This approach is used in several countries as well, including many countries in the
European Union.6 The choice between the two options depends on the demography of the country and
perceptions about the equivalence scales to convert household expenditures into money metric of individual
welfare.

In terms of adult equivalents, a household with two adults and two children is typically assumed to have
consumption needs that are less than four adult equivalents. A household with four working-age adults is
typically assumed to be equal to four adult equivalents. In practice, even when households consist of adults
and children, household size is often used in part because it is simple and easy to communicate.
Nevertheless, it is a strong assumption. It does not take into account the fact that kids may consume less

 The United States implicitly uses a mix of adult-equivalence and economies-of-scale adjustment factors by
defining different basic needs for different family types.

food than adults as well as any economies of scale in consumption within a household. Economy of scale
is related to existence of goods and services with a ‚Äúpublic good‚Äù aspect to them such as television, housing
and durable goods (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002). Because people can share these goods, simply dividing by
household size will understate welfare of large households compared to small households.

In case of Lebanon, the previous practice was to adjust for adult equivalents and economies of scale through
using household specific poverty lines. Using this approach, the food poverty line is constructed using the
caloric requirements of individuals and is specific to each household depending on its demographics. In
contrast, the current methodology described in this report uses a single poverty line for everyone. Given the
lack of agreed upon equivalence scales for Lebanon and for the sake of transparency, simplicity and ease
of communication, the official poverty estimates are based on per capita consumption.7 In addition to the
official poverty estimates based on consumption per capita, this report presents supplementary poverty
estimates based on using two different options to equivalence scale. Results of this analysis are provided in
section 5.2 on supplemental poverty analysis.

      4. Construction of poverty line

This section is devoted to construction of poverty line as a threshold for assessing whether an individual
can attain a minimum required level of wellbeing.

          4.1           Food poverty line

The first step in construction of food poverty line is to calculate average costs per one calorie. This cost per
calorie is then multiplied by an estimated minimum number of calories to give the food poverty line. In
order to estimate cost per calorie, food consumption (purchases) from the individual diary need to be
converted into calories. Given that kilocalories information for each product is provided for 100
grams/milliliters, all products in the diary should be in the same measurement units, namely grams or
milliliters. Average rescaling factors were calculated for transformation using the following formula

Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ∞πÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó = Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñ /Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ó , where

RF is rescaling factor, i indicates either grams or milliliters and j indicates such units as boxes, bunches,
pieces. For illustrative purposes assume that the average price per one gram of egg is 6.67 LBP, while one
egg costs 250 LBP. Rescaling factor is equal to 0.027=6.7/250. Knowing this rescaling factor we can
transform pieces intro grams. For instance, eight eggs are estimated to weigh 300 grams = 8/ 0.027.

After rescaling weights of each product into grams/milliliters, we assign calories and calculate total amount
of calories consumed per day per capita for each household. For each household we also know the
expenditure. This allows us to estimate the cost per calorie. Calorie intake and costs of one calorie are
shown in table 5. For comparison, the same indicators are shown for 2004 as well. As expected, price per
calorie is higher for wealthier households and they also consume more calories on average. For quality
control purpose, average per capita quantities purchased for main products have been calculated. All
numbers look plausible except oil and vegetable oils which can be associated with issues of seasonality and

Given the observable variation in the cost per calorie by income group, the final step is to select a reference
group upon which the cost per calorie is based. Given the desire to have this price reflect an average price

 CR is a calories requirement to meet basic need, pi prices, qi quantities, Ci calories of individual i in
reference group. CR is set to 2400 calories which is around CR chosen for poverty estimation in 2004
(UNDP 2008). After plugging all necessary information into the formula, annual food poverty line for 2011
HBS is 1480.5 thousand LBP. It is 75 percent higher than the average food poverty line constructed using
2004 data.

       4.2      Non-food component of poverty line

One of the common ways to estimate the non-food allowance is to increase food poverty line by the average
nonfood share of households whose total expenditures are close to food poverty line. But, because of a
relatively high average nonfood share, nobody in Lebanon had consumption per capita lower than food
poverty line in 2011. Another common ways to estimate the non-food allowance is to increase food poverty
line by the average nonfood share of households whose food expenditures are close to food poverty line.
But, now in this case, the nonfood share for the subsample of household around food poverty line was
around 74 percent, which is higher than the overall average of 71 percent. Almost by definition, if the
nonfood allowance is greater than the average nonfood expenditure, then the resulting poverty rate will be
very high. The motivation for both approaches in selecting a nonfood allowance is to find an amount that
allows one to buy basic nonfood needs. In the two initial approaches considered, one resulted in a nonfood
allowance that was so small, essentially no one was poor and the other sub-sample produced a nonfood
allowance that is sizeable more than what most people spend on nonfood goods. Neither outcome is
satisfactory.

To resolve this issue, the nonfood allowance is estimated from the same reference population as used for
construction of food poverty line ‚Äì 20-50th percentile. Using this subsample of households (N=786)
generates average nonfood share of 69 percent which makes much more sense being lower than the average


                                                                                                       21
for the whole population. Now, with the food poverty line estimated and the nonfood allowance
estimated, the cost-of-basic-needs poverty line is defined simply as:

                                                                   Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±¶ Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±í

Plugging in the estimated values for each results in the estimated poverty line of 4729 ‚âà 1480.5/ (1-
0.687). In other words, a person who is consuming less than LBP 4,729 annually is identified as poor, and
anyone above this amount is not poor.

Poverty rates

Overall, poverty in Lebanon is estimated at 27 percent. Table 7 shows the estimates for country level
poverty rate, poverty gap and squared poverty gap.8

The regional poverty rates resulting from this poverty line are shown below (figure 12). Due to very small
sample size, regional numbers should be treated with caution. Poverty is the lowest in Beirut, followed by
Mount Lebanon and Nabatieh. The poorest regions are North Lebanon and Bekaa.9

    5. Supplemental information

       5.1       Robustness tests of poverty rates based on consumption per capita

Prior to these estimates based on the 2011 HBS data, poverty had only been available at one other point in
time since 2000. In an environment with major political and economic shocks, it is particularly important
to have timely and accurate poverty estimates. The primary constraint to providing timely updates of the
poverty profile and estimates is the limited supply of household survey data. Lebanon lags behind in the
collection of micro data compared to other upper middle income countries (Serajuddin, et al. 2015). A key
constraint to providing accurate poverty estimates for Lebanon is the issue of non-response. The 2011-12
poverty headcount of 27 percent provided in this report is derived from a nationally representative sample
of households, but 43 percent of this representative sample ultimately did not participate in the survey.
Analysis of the data indicates that the non-responders disproportionately came from enumeration areas that
were on average better off, indicating that non-responders were less likely to be poor than responders. The
sampling weights have been adjusted to account for this effect, but the effectiveness of this adjustment is
largely unknown.

Given the data limitations and caveats, it is important to triangulate obtained poverty results using other
information available in the 2011 HBS. In the same way, a poverty line is both a statistical and social
concept. Even in the hypothetical case of data without any flaws or weaknesses, there is no guarantee that
the poverty line estimated from these data will result in a definition of poverty that resonates with the social
and economic norms of the society. The 2011 HBS data provides a unique opportunity to assess whether
the estimated poverty line reflects values of the Lebanese population. There is a question in the survey
asking households how much income they think is needed to have a decent life. This information has been
used to calculate income per capita values across the distribution using consumption per capita quintiles.
One would not necessarily want to base a poverty line for a country on what the wealthiest in the country
deemed to be need to have a decent life, but certainly how some of the poorest in society answer this
question is relevant. The estimated CBN poverty line is compared to the average income households believe
is necessary by consumption quintile. Results are shown in figure 13, which shows that the CBN poverty
line (red dotted line) is actually greater than the average response given by the bottom 20 percent as to the
amount of income needed to live a decent life. For all other quintiles, the reported average income needed
is above the CBN line. In a middle-income country, this figure provides some supporting evidence that the
poverty line does indeed resonate with how the people of Lebanon might define minimum needs for the
poorest people in the society.

Households were also asked to classify themselves into six groups: wealthier, financially well-off, average,
average to poor, poor and very poor. This self-evaluation was used for poor and nonpoor households using
based on objective poverty line and welfare aggregate constructed (figure 14). 38 percent of poor population
rank themselves as poor or very poor compared to 13 percent among non-poor. Another interesting question
was how long households can survive if they lost all sources of income. Here we also see clear correlation
between objective poverty measure based on monetary poverty line and this subjective question (figure 15).
Thus, the poorest population from the bottom quintile would survive for half of the month, while the richest
could survive about two months. This is a piece of supporting evidence that the consumption aggregate has
sorted the poor from the nonpoor in a credible way.

Possession of certain durables is often used as an important indicator of wealth. Availability of cars and
computers across consumption per capita quintiles is shown in figures 16 and 17. Clearly, the poorest
population are less likely to possess computers and cars compared to wealthier ones. For example, only 24
percent of population in the bottom quintile have computer compared to 70 percent among the top quintile.
The fairly steep gradient in ownership of car and computers across quintiles corresponds well with
expectations ‚Äì as households become better-off they are more likely to own cars and computers. This is
simply supporting evidence then that the construction of the consumption aggregate appears to be sorting
households in the way one expects.

Finally, sources of income across the distribution using consumption per capita were checked (table 8).
Remittances from abroad play a more important role for the richest, which is consistent with the theory and
empirical findings from other studies showing that the costs of international migration preclude the poorest
from migration. In contrast, transfers from NGO and government aid play a more important role for the
most vulnerable from the poorest quintile. Finally, also aligning with expectations, only rich households
have income from financial assets.

in poverty line and reference group were tested as well. Results are shown below. The choice between
different reference groups for defining food and total poverty line affects poverty rates, but qualitatively
regional results stay the same and the impact is not substantial. Figure 18 shows poverty rates for default
reference group from the 20-50th percentile and alternative group from 20-35th percentile. Choosing poorer
reference group lowers poverty line and as a result poverty drops, but only slightly.

 Including health increases welfare aggregate substantially and lowers poverty from 27 to 17 percent (figure
19). In contrast, including durables has only a tiny impact (figure 20). Welfare aggregate increases, but
without significant impact on poverty. Finally, sensitivity of poverty to changes in poverty lines was tested
(five percent change in poverty line). Poverty rates are sensitive to the choice of poverty line given that
many households are located around it. In particular, changing the poverty line by five percent changes
poverty by around 12 percent (figures 21 and 22).

       5.2 Supplementary poverty rates based on consumption per adult equivalent10

For transparency and simplicity reasons, official poverty estimates presented in this report are based on
consumption per capita. While many countries use per capita consumption, this is by no means true for all
countries. In some cases, basic needs are assumed to vary depending on whether the individual is an adult,
a child, or an elderly person. These adjustments typically convert all individuals into their adult equivalent
size. So, a child might be assumed to have needs that are half that of an adult. In other cases, poverty
estimates may embed assumptions about household units being able to reap the benefits of economies of
scale. The basic idea here is that two people may be able to live more cheaply if they live together rather
than if they live separately. If most consumption in the household is private or not shareable (if one person
consumes it, the other person cannot), then the scope for economies of scale is limited. If on the other hand,
there is significant level of consumption of items that are nearly public goods at the household-level (if one
person consumes it, the other person can also consume it), then there is likely to be scope for economies of
scale. One implication of both adjustments is that poverty may potentially be overestimated for large
households (and understated for small households) using consumption per capita welfare aggregate because
they tend to have higher family size and proportionately more children.

As a very rough approximation, most food consumption is private, while consumption of nonfood items
such as shelter, light, access to clean water, has some important within-household public good dimensions.
In the case of Lebanon, the age structure of the population is relatively old, and so the adjustment for adult
equivalence may have relatively small effects. In contrast, the nonfood share in Lebanon is relatively high,
and the measurement of poverty might be quite sensitive to adjusting for economies of scale.

Household specific poverty lines, used to measure poverty for 2004-05 data, adjust for adult equivalents
and economies of scale. For 2011 data, the decision was made to use a simpler and more transparent

approach by constructing a single poverty line and adjusting the welfare aggregate. Also because there is
no established equivalence scale for Lebanon, the adjustment of the household-level welfare aggregate was
done in per capita terms. Nevertheless, for illustrative purposes, supplementary poverty estimates have been
produced using two different equivalence scales. The general formula to adjust for adult equivalents and
economies of scale is shown below.

Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞∏ = (Ì†µÌ∞¥ + Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ∞æ)Ì†µÌºÉ , where

A is the number of adults in the household, and K is the number of children. The parameter Ì†µÌªº is the cost of
a child relative to that of an adult, and lies somewhere between 0 and 1. The other parameter Ì†µÌºÉ also lies
between 0 and 1 and controls the extent of economies of scale. If both Ì†µÌªº and Ì†µÌºÉ are equal to one, the number
of adult equivalents is simply household size (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002).

In this report, the first equivalence scale assumes that consumption needs of children (0-15 age) is one half
that of the consumption needs of adults (above 15 age) or in other words Ì†µÌªº is equal to 0.5. The first
specification also assumes that there is no economy of scale, so Ì†µÌºÉ is equal to one. The second specification
considered for illustrative purposes, maintains Œ± equal to 0.5, while introducing economy of scale measured
by Œ∏ equal to 0.92.11

Using adult-equivalent scales defined above requires introducing changes in the construction of food
poverty line. The food poverty line is anchored to 2400 calories as the estimated nutritional requirement an
average person in Lebanon needs for good health including kids and elderly. The caloric anchor corresponds
to the caloric requirements used in the previous poverty report based on the 2004 HBS data. But, this
estimated caloric requirement is based on taking the population-weighted average of estimated caloric needs
for adults and children. When the welfare aggregate is converted into adult equivalents, the caloric
requirement similarly must be based on the average caloric requirements of adults only. This report uses
daily calories requirement by age and sex used to calculate poverty lines for 2004 HBS published in UNDP
(2008). The simple average calories intake for adult population between 16-60 ages is 2800 calories which
is higher compared to 2400 calories needed for an average person. This new anchor for caloric requirement
was used to recalculate food poverty line.

Average values of consumption per adult equivalent using two proposed scales along with supplementary
poverty estimates are shown in figures 23 and 24. As can be seen in figure 23, shifting welfare aggregate
from per capita to adult equivalent scale makes substantial difference in terms of the level of welfare
aggregate. Consumption per capita is always lower than consumption per adult equivalent regardless of the
scale used. This is an expected result given that the size of household is much smaller when expressed in
adult equivalents, and this leads to higher welfare aggregate. The impact of using the adult-equivalent scale
is more pronounced in regions with larger household size, namely North Lebanon and Bekaa.




11
   There are no established equivalence scales for Middle East and North Africa countries and many use per capita
welfare aggregates to measure poverty, while other embed equivalence scale by using household specific poverty
lines. West Bank and Gaza is among the few to explicitly adjust to economy of scale and household composition.
The following formula is used AE = (A + 0.46 C)^0.89.


                                                                                                                28

The impact of using different adult-equivalence scales on poverty is less straightforward to interpret. When
considering the adjustment for only adult equivalents, there is almost no change in the overall national
poverty rate. This happens because food poverty line is scaled up if adult equivalent scale is used and this
effect is strong enough to counterbalance impact of the higher welfare aggregate. However, the regional
profile does change reflecting demographic differences in terms of the number of children per household
in each of the regions. While there is not much change when adjusting for adult equivalence (at least in the
example considered in this analysis), there are significant changes when examining the sensitivity of the
poverty estimates for the assumption of economies of scale. This is in large part due to the issue that when
accounting for economies of scale, there is no matching adjustment done to the poverty line (as was done
with the adult-equivalence example). For the purposes of illustration, when the economies of scale factor
shifts from 1 to 0.92 (maintaining Ì†µÌªº equal to 0.5), poverty in Lebanon drops from 27 percent to 20 percent.
It is important to note that if the economies of scale factor were set at an even lower value (indicating
greater economies of scale), the estimated poverty rate would drop further. While the current poverty
estimate is based on per capita consumption and assumes no economies of scale in household consumption,
the estimates presented in this section provide useful supplementary detail. As the economy continues to
grow, and the food share shrinks, future poverty estimates for Lebanon may place greater emphasis on the
value in adjusting for economies of scale.

    6. Concluding remarks and further steps

Collecting data in Lebanon is a particularly challenging under-taking, and these challenges force one to be
cautious in presenting and interpreting the poverty estimates. The purpose of this report is to provide a
transparent description of how poverty has been estimated based on the 2011 HBS, including the
assumptions made and the relative sensitivity of the estimate to these assumptions. Several important
caveats should be kept in mind while using and interpreting information shown in this report. Firstly,
poverty numbers presented in this report cannot be compared with poverty estimates for other years because
of differences in data, instruments, methodology for constructing the aggregate, methodology for estimating
the poverty line, fieldwork implementation, and to some extent, sample design. Secondly, all regional
estimates in this report should be viewed with caution given concerns about significant levels of
nonresponse and relatively small sample sizes within regions.

Poverty measurement is an evolving concept and needs to ensure that it captures the changing realities of
life of the poor. This is particularly relevant for the context of Lebanon with its exposure to external and
internal shocks. There are three potential areas to consider for potential re-examination in future estimates
of poverty based on the next round of HBS data collection in Lebanon. The first important issue is to
establish improved methods for reducing the high rate of unit and item non-response in future household
budget surveys. As indicated in the report, unit non-response was very high both in 2004 and 2011 rounds
of the data, and there is ample evidence that the nonresponse was not random. There is some preliminary
evidence that this may be partially related to the survey burden due to using time-intensive survey
instruments such as individual diaries. Piloting different instruments to collect consumption data as well as
information about non-respondents is an important step to consider. The second area for improvement can
be related to changing survey design to mitigate effects of seasonality revealed in 2011 data. One potential
solution to this issue is to either reduce the time frame for field work, or ensure that fieldwork is temporally
stratified. Finally, further exploration of economies of scale and adult equivalence in the measurement of
individual wellbeing is a third area for consideration.

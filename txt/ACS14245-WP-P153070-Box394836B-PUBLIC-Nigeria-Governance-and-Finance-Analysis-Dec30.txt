Executive summary

1.       Nigeria has established a clear long-term vision for sustained social and economic progress and
has laid out the blueprint for transformation in its Vision 20:2020 development plan. The objective of
this vision is clearly defined: Vision 20:2020 seeks to propel Nigeria into the top 20 largest economies
in the world by 20201, guaranteeing a high standard of living and quality of life to its people. Five years
removed from its target, Nigeria has made significant inroads towards achieving its goal. Over the last
decade, the country has achieved key milestones on its path to economic development. It has
experienced sustained economic growth, with an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate
of 6 percent over the last decade, outperforming the SSA average growth rate over the same period,
and has done so by focusing on diversifying its economy. Since the 2014 rebasing exercise, it is also
Africa’s largest economy, surpassing South Africa, with a nominal GDP of USD 521.8 billion in 2013.

2.       Nigeria’s path to economic development demonstrates strong potential for further growth but
the country faces important social and economic challenges, including the impact of the protracted
slump in oil prices on fiscal revenues, and ongoing instability in the northern regions due to occasional
flares of violence and ramped up extremist activity. In light of the challenges ahead, addressing the
current gaps and lacunae in the basic education sector is a key step in harnessing the country’s full
potential, ensuring prosperity for all and meeting its Vision 20:2020 goals.

3.       Recognizing that such an ambitious development plan cannot materialize without adequate
investment in human development, the government has made basic education one of the main pillars
underpinning its long-term development plan. As such Nigeria has implemented several key reforms
in the education sector- most notably the introduction of universal basic education (UBE Act 2004),
which requires that state and local Governments provide free, compulsory and universal basic
education, covering grades 1-9, for every school-age Nigerian child. In order to achieve their national
goals and also fulfill their commitment to the Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) in education, the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) was created to
specifically carry out the mandate of UBE in Nigeria. To that end, 2 percent of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund has been dedicated to funding the UBE program under the direction of UBEC. So far
the program has successfully implemented key reforms such as automatic teachers’ salary payment,
which has been very effective in reducing payment delays and potential leakages. In addition, it has
championed the introduction of School Based Management Committees (SBMCs), which play a key
role in bringing the community into the effective management of the education sector.

4.       Despite the country’s clear commitment and significant progress in some areas, Nigeria’s basic
education sector still faces many hurdles including stagnating trends in enrollment rates, low learning
outcomes, and persistent inequalities in access. For instance, the out-of-school rate for children aged
6-14 increased from 24 to 30 percent between 2010 and 2013, with a high incidence rate in the northern
states (95% in 2013), mainly affecting children from the poorest quintiles and rural areas. In addition,
there still are significant gaps in quality indicators. For example, the primary and junior secondary

completion rates, and grade 6 exam pass rates2 show large variations across zones while the literacy
rates in grades 4 and 6 are generally low across states. As stated above, the fragile economic outlook of
the country raises particular concerns for future funding and investment prospects in the education
sector. In order to address these concerns, it is vital that Nigeria address the gaps in the provision of its
basic education as a national priority—with significant reforms to its governance and finance structure.
In particular, this Economic and Sector Work (ESW) examines the two main basic education challenges
facing Nigeria today: (i) issues of equity in access, and (ii) quality of education—by investigating
bottlenecks linked to governance and financing of the basic education sector.

5.       A summary of the main findings and policy recommendations stemming from the analysis
carried out in this report is provided below, and is grouped into the two broad areas of equity and
quality of education. Given the entwined and complex nature of the bottlenecks facing the education
sector in Nigeria, the findings and recommendations each reflect and encompass governance and
finance aspects. For example, underfunding of the basic education sector deprives the federal and state
institutions and frontline service providers (schools and teachers) of the resources they need to deliver
educational services, and governance challenges hamper the effectiveness of the public expenditure
that is mobilized. Basic education in Nigeria calls for both substantially higher resource mobilization
and more effective use of mobilized resources. Without increased resource mobilization, governance
reforms would only have limited impact on access, equity and quality of education. But without
resolving governance challenges, increased resource mobilization may not help improve basic
education outcomes either.



Key findings and policy recommendations

Equity in access to basic education

1. Strengthen the legal and institutional environment in education policy implementation.

Since the 2004 UBE reforms, there are three main institutions engaged in the delivery of basic
education in Nigeria: (i) State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) - a parastatal entity
accountable to the State Ministry of Education and subject to the decisions of the state government; (ii)
Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) – UBEC, which is financed through a direct Federal
government block grant of 2 percent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and therefore accountable to
the Federal Government, is mandated to pursue the universal basic education agenda while operating
within the constitutional bounds of States. UBEC executes UBE policies and programs through
coordination with SUBEBs and Local Government Education Authority (LGEAs) within each state and
its mandate extends solely to public basic education levels (grades 1-9); and (iii) Federal Ministry of
Education (FMOE) which is tasked with policy formulation, and setting of guidelines for quality
assurance across all levels of education including basic education. The challenge stems in large part
from the disconnect between the responsibilities legally conferred to the agencies and the institutional
authority to enforce these responsibilities, as well as weak accountability channels between them,
undermining access and equity to basic education services. As such the current legal and institutional

                                                                                                           x
framework tends to weaken the policy implementation environment, undermining sector
effectiveness. Below are a few examples of limitations in the legal framework that result from the
implementation of the universal basic education (UBE) law.

   a. Free and compulsory UBE services. According to the UBE legal framework, anyone collecting
      fees from students at the basic education level, or parents who do not send children to school,
      are liable to be fined, but UBEC tends to have limited legal grounds to enforce this policy. In
      addition, since UBEC does not have funding to adequately compensate schools for the loss in
      revenue from the implementation of the fee-free policy, schools may turn to alternative forms
      of fee collection, e.g. through Parent Teacher Association (PTA) contributions, effectively
      undermining the purpose of the law.
   b. Disarticulation of junior secondary schools (JSS) from senior secondary schools (SSS) schools.
      As part of the UBE initiative, the 2004 UBE Act called for the disarticulation of JSS from SSS to
      allow greater focus and better management of the sector, and therefore ensure increased access
      to basic education. However, UBEC faced important challenges in providing sufficient human,
      physical and financial resources to effectively carry out the disarticulation process. This led to
      an uneven implementation across states. As such, in 2010, it was observed that many states
      were yet to fully comply with the disarticulation directive. Only a few states had fully
      disarticulated, many states had partially disarticulated and a few states had even started
      rearticulating. The disarticulation process has introduced a seemingly unsurmountable
      challenge to the management of schools by scattering already scarce human and infrastructure
      resources and assets. This has also created a non-uniform school management system since
      UBEC tends to be limited in its legal ability to engage in SSS management although UBEC may
      be funding the articulated schools where both JSS and SSS fall under the same management.
   c. Equal distribution of the UBEC intervention fund and alteration of UBE fund rules without
      clear supporting evidence. The current legal framework surrounding UBEC operations at state
      level also renders it subject to rules that are not aligned with its objectives. For example, the
      vast majority of the UBEC intervention fund (matching grants) are equally distributed to all
      states, which clearly undermines UBEC’s ability to specifically address equity and access issues
      in lagging states. Similarly, the matching grant requirement of 70 percent was altered to an
      arbitrary 50 percent with no clear evidence whether this new level is more efficient in
      achieving UBE goals.
   d. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) mandate of UBEC for the basic education sector is
      constrained by the limited ability, within the legal framework, to make defaulters accountable
      at the state level. One of the key contributing factors to the limited enforcement capabilities is
      the weak data collection tool, as well as the inconsistent and unreliable M&E. For example,
      UBE law mandates UBEC to carry out M&E for grades 1-9 but UBEC tends to rely on states to
      carry out data collection on their behalf, which often use weak data collection tools which
      produce inconsistent and unreliable data. Furthermore, as per their mandate, UBEC only
      captures public sector schools and therefore does not account for the 24 percent of basic
      education students enrolled in non-public institutions, thereby rendering the M&E findings
      from UBEC incomplete at best. FMOE, on the other hand, is mandated with quality assurance
      for both public and non-public institutions. However, there is limited coordination with UBEC,
      and as a result, M&E findings from UBEC risk being inconsistent and not well aligned with the


                                                                                                      xi
        broader observations from FMOE. This undermines the policy relevance of M&E findings from
        UBEC which only provides recommendations on partial findings for basic education sector.

Recommendations

    a. Establish a performance agreement between executive agencies (UBEC and SUBEB) to ensure
       accountability channels are clear, operational and that policy actions are legally enforceable in
       order to meet objectives. For that purpose, a performance agreement would be helpful to frame
       the relationship between the ministry of education/UBEC at federal level and the state
       ministries of education/SUBEBs at state level.
    b. Develop a national framework ensuring UBE policy compliance in the basic education sector
       by leveraging the roles and responsibilities of UBEC at the federal level, SUBEB and LGEA at
       the State and linking the local government area (LGA) where necessary.
    c. Clearly define the role of LGAs in basic education services delivery value chain in light of
       UBEC’s mandate ––it is important for LGAs to be an integral part of the school management
       and M&E process for effective implementation of accountability framework at school level and
       to empower community’s ownership of the local schools to foster greater demand for
       accountability and transparency in policy implementation.
    d. Establish national framework and polices to effectively address inequality by reframing the
       current UBEC role from one centered on equal distribution to one centered on targeted and
       problem driven actions.


2. Create incentive mechanisms in basic education policies and ensure alignment of resources with
   sector priorities

Given the limitations of the legal framework and accountability channels, the effectiveness of policy
implementation in the basic education sector depends on the sector’s ability to establish appropriate
incentive mechanisms to nudge key players in the right direction in terms of the adoption and
enforcement of policies. At the federal level for instance, there are no built-in incentives that encourage
states to adhere to UBE policies, such as financial incentives tied to the rate of disarticulation in each
state, or non-financial benefits such as national recognition for good performance, which could
incentivize states to coordinate and implement the disarticulation faster. Furthermore, as mentioned
earlier, UBEC funds tend to be allocated equally to all states regardless of their actual needs, and
without aligning funding to basic education goals, despite this being the chief mandate of the
commission. As such, due to constraints limiting the ability to direct resources where they are the most
needed, UBEC is constrained to adopt a uniform and rigid intervention formula rather than working
towards achieving the stated goals. In addition to the lack of an incentive mechanism built into the
policy design, the sector also seems to be affected by misalignment of resources with its sector priorities.
For example, although Early Childhood Development (ECD) is a key focus of the UBE program,
targeting reduction in inequality, the UBE program covers only one year of ECD. Also, even though
the out of school issue has been highlighted as one of the main challenges for the sector affecting
predominantly the northern zones, those areas have not received additional funding to address the
issue. As such there is limited scope for addressing sector issues through targeted public spending,
rather public resources are allocated based on external considerations. As a result, the federal

                                                                                                         xii
intervention which would have improved equity of basic education services is jeopardized. This is a
clear limitation of the UBEC intervention which has not been able to capitalize on and exploit the
common areas where states are willing to share the burden of the country, and with a system that is
limited in its efforts to address the national problems such as high out-of-school rate. At the local or
school level, there are also very few incentive mechanisms in place to foster teacher commitment and
performance in class. For example there are insufficient policies recognizing teachers’ performance, as
measured by students’ performance on standardized exams, or even rewards (pecuniary or non-
pecuniary) tied to good teaching practices. Also, there are inadequate incentives to encourage
deployment in rural or remote areas such as hardship allowances, or to increase female teachers which
could help address the lack of qualified and female teachers in those areas.

Recommendations

Once the legal and policy implementation environment has been strengthened, the following would
help enforce policymaking more efficiently:

    a. Establish incentives encouraging policy compliance and reward early adoption of policy with
       adequate budget allocation. While an adequate policy environment is a pre-requisite, incentive
       packages will help motivate actors and allow them to develop innovative and effective program
       implementation strategies, which could be later expanded to other states following a best
       practice model.
    b. Employ results-based and policy-driven intervention framework focusing on states with the
       greatest needs. The priority areas should be identified on the national level to create national
       consensus on the issues facing Nigeria as whole, garnering greater support from non-lagging
       states regarding funding allocation decisions. Developing this consensus at the national level
       engages states by making them direct stakeholders in the national level issues and ensures
       greater support for target-based funding.
    c. In order to enhance their effectiveness, streamline basic education policies that trigger vertical
       and horizontal imbalance in service delivery. Inequality in Nigeria does not only exist between
       states but also within states, a national framework is needed to enhance accountability at state
       and national level for common, shared goals regarding Nigeria’s national education
       development.
    d. Empower school principals/head teachers to identify good practices at school level and
       motivate teachers and communities for better service delivery outcomes including tackling out-
       of-school and inequality issues on one hand, and making high-level decision makers
       accountable on the other hand.
    e. Establish clear goals and targets focusing on policy priorities.

3. Ensure adequate education budget with focus on lagging states and communities

The basic education sector in Nigeria is characterized by an inadequate provision of school inputs,
including teachers, good classrooms conditions, learning materials, and other school level facilities,
although there are large variations in need across states. The current budget allocation to overcome
such challenges is inadequate. As such, despite the government’s commitment to the education sector,
total spending on all levels of education represented only 12.5 percent of total spending in 2013, against


                                                                                                       xiii
20 percent Global Partnership for Education (GPE) recommended levels. In terms of share of GDP,
spending stagnated at around 1.7 percent of GDP, based on the best estimate of available data, compared
to the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 4.6 percent in 2012. The allocation to the basic education level
(grades 1-9) only represents 44 percent of all total spending in education from all sources, which is also
below the GPE best practice recommendation of 50 percent for primary education. The impact of such
low spending is particularly important for states that have low internally generated revenues and which
also tend to be characterized by high out-of-school rates, contributing to high inequality in access
across states.

Recommendations

    a. Increase spending on education, while targeting the challenge areas. As it currently stands,
       public investment in education in Nigeria is at 12.5 percent of total public spending and 1.7
       percent of GDP, far below the levels recommended to effectuate any real change to the sector.
    b. Introduce explicit mechanisms to ensure more effective coordination of resource mobilization
       between the three tiers of government. This would allow the country to reach its goals faster
       and more efficiently.
    c. Use unit cost as an instrument in the preparation of policies, and associated budgets, aimed at
       accommodating out-of-school children into the education system.
    d. Decentralization, under the right conditions, can help foster political accountability, but does
       not remedy the inequality across states. There should be a built-in commitment to equity in
       the financing formula adopted for resource allocation. It is important for the federal
       government to retain a strong redistributive role, facilitating the transfer of resources from
       federal to poorer states and LGAs.

4. Earmark budget for basic education reducing potential inefficient use of funds in the sector

The current basic education finance structure does not lend itself to the optimal use of education funds.
The basic education staff salaries are directly withheld at source from the LGA allocation as per the
constitutional mandate holding LGAs responsible for financing of personnel costs, which does in fact
enable salaries to be paid on time. However, the amount withheld is estimated based on the staff
currently on-boarded in the system and does not allow for planning of staff actually required. This
means that for areas where children are out of-school and where, therefore, the current number of
teachers does not reflect the actual need, the salary withholdings are below the optimal amount needed.
In addition, it automatically overrides the essence of budget planning and the execution process of the
sub-sector. This practice also discourages the LGA, which does not participate in teacher management,
from promoting education services in their local council areas since greater participation in schools
entails larger teacher needs and therefore represents an increase in the amount withheld for staff salary
at source. As such, resources allocated to the education sector through the withholding process may
adversely affect the sector’s wellbeing, especially in terms of planning, since it does not account for
potential input requirements needed to overcome the current sector issues. Given that salaries account
for about 85 percent of the basic education sector budget, the mismanagement of personnel cost has
substantial implications for the resources available to the sector, and is a consequence of the lack of an
earmarked budget.



                                                                                                       xiv
Recommendations

    a. The basic education sector budget should be earmarked. As it currently stands, staff salary is
       withheld at source based on number of staff in the system, which is a first step, but having a
       full-fledged earmarked budget is necessary for proper planning and evaluation of the sector.

5. Adopt governance and financing strategies to address poverty, social, cultural and other barriers
   to achieving education goals

The challenges facing the basic education sector are multifaceted. In order to truly effect change and
address the challenges in education, it is important for the government to fully understand the market
failures and institutional constraints that are contributing to the sub-optimal education consumption
by households. For example, if girls are not attending school due to cultural preferences and norms,
simply addressing the governance and financing bottlenecks, as those identified earlier, may not help
in addressing this inequality issue, and a more holistic approach is therefore needed. In Nigeria, there
are important poverty, social and cultural barriers that can explain, in part, some of the education sector
trends. For example, the out-of-school incidence which impacts about 13.2 million basic school-age
children is largely a phenomenon in the northern states (95% of all out-of-school children are located
in the north), and there is evidence that it particularly affects children from poor households, girls, and
children from rural areas. Furthermore, the analysis shows that more than half of the out-of-school
children in Nigeria do not attend school because either their parents, or themselves, do not think it is
important to have an education. The analysis also shows that this belief is most common among parents
with low levels of education, those working in agricultural sector, and living in rural areas. Lower
participation among girls is also tied to parental preference regarding girl education, their distrust of
conventional schooling, lack of adequate school infrastructure (such as availability of toilets for girls)
and perhaps the reluctance to send girls to school where teachers are mostly male.

Recommendations

    a. Institute pro-poor education policy intervention programs focusing on marginalized
       communities.
    b. Ensure schools are equipped to provide gender-friendly learning environment.
    c. Government should consider the expansion of alternative learning programs to provide second
       chance education for parents and youth, giving them the opportunity to overcome educational
       gaps.
    d. Strengthen SBMC and other types of community-level grassroots mobilization to generate
       awareness for education, including developing sensitization campaigns for communities to
       overcome social and cultural barriers such as those existing against girls’ education.
    e. Regularly prepare community-oriented programs through SBMC to increase parent
       participation in school events and child activities at school.

6. Establish a strategic non-public school management system

Non-public (private and religious) networks are important alternate service providers in the education
sector in Nigeria, but there is currently limited enforcement of the accountability structure within this
network as well as a need for a clearer management strategy by the public sector to harness the potential

                                                                                                        xv
benefits. Under the premise that the public sector would have addressed the sector issues outlined
above prior, it would be useful to consider extending a revised public sector management framework
to the non-public sector.

Private schools, which account for 20 percent of enrollment, are particularly important service
providers in southern states, especially within the ECD level. They also tend to be associated with lower
unit costs and are more cost-effective than public schools. On the other hand, religious schools, which
represent about 4 percent of enrollment, are particularly important education service providers in the
northern states. In addition, the analysis shows that the private school are important providers for
wealthier households while poorer households tend to use public schools more. Despite being key
players in education provision, the UBE Act and UBEC do not tend to have a clear strategy vis-à-vis
the non-public institutions to either (i) exploit the relative cost-effectiveness of private schools to
expand access, especially in areas that do not currently have public schools, (ii) ensure accountability
structures are in place to foster provision of quality education, and (iii) create a strategy to improve
overall access through higher provision of private schools in the north, freeing up public resources to
help accommodate children from poorer households.

Recommendations

    a. Enhance public-private partnerships (PPP) within a coherent policy and regulatory
       framework. Given their apparent cost-effectiveness, and their ability to increase access to
       schooling, there are clear benefits from extending private participation in the northern states
       where the out-of-school issue is critical. This can be done, for example, by providing grants to
       private schools to enroll children from poor households.
    b. There should be an enforceable accountability structure, regulating the quality and standards
       of education provision such as regular monitoring and evaluation to avoid the issue of sub-par,
       predatory provision of services.
    c. In order to effectively engage the private sector while ensuring quality of education provision,
       private and religious schools could gain from adopting the governance framework for public
       schools.

7. Strengthen M&E system and practices to ensure consistency of information and enforceability of
   policies

The current M&E system within the basic education sector has a limited operational enforcement
mechanism, which directly hinders its effectiveness, and is also characterized by overlapping and
duplicated efforts across agencies. At the federal level, UBEC is vested with the responsibility to
monitor federal inputs in the implementation of basic education and report to the President on the
progress on the implementation of UBE programs, as well as monitor the education sector personnel.
At the state level, SUBEB is also vested in monitoring and evaluating of personnel and of UBE programs,
while the LGEA does the same at the local level. In addition, the SBMCs carry out monitoring activities
at the school level. However, implementation of the findings from each M&E strata faces several
challenges including: (i) bridging the mandate and the legal right of the institution as established under
constitution. For example, UBEC has the executive right to implement UBEC intervention fund with
clear M&E responsibilities to ensure the programs’ effectiveness but they have limited legal right to

                                                                                                       xvi
enforce the policy action at the state level; (ii) the tools for M&E are weak across the board and
information gathered for M&E are often unreliable and can be highly politicized- for example, due to
the weakness of NEMIS, the statistical data produced by states are often inconsistent and therefore
unreliable; (iii) the parallel M&E activities create confusion between the findings of UBEC and those
by the federal ministry of education which is inclusive of all levels of education including private
schools. In addition, UBEC also depends on the states’ submission of data for those articulated under
basic education management and supervised by SUBEB; and (iv) political constraints of some states is
an important factor hindering the implementation of the recommendations based on M&E findings. As
the result, M&E efforts under the current data collection tools and practices are not adequate to inform
and guide policymakers into the right decisions to address the inequality and access issues in the
country.

Recommendations

    a. Strengthen the NEMIS capacity by providing adequate technical and financial resources to
       produce reliable and consistent data for policy making.
    b. The role of local governments in the M&E system needs to be clarified and strengthened.
       Empowerment of LGAs is key in communities where grassroots campaigning for access
       expansion is essential.
    c. SBMCs can be further operationalized to strengthen school management and performance
       oversight and with greater and more effective social accountability.
    d. Reduce duplication of M&E efforts in basic education management, especially with respect to
       supervisory roles across UBEC, SUBEB and LGEAs.


8. Establish response measures to direct and indirect impacts of armed conflicts on the education
   sector

In addition to the other social factors discussed earlier that hinder education sector performance, the
ongoing conflicts, which are located largely in the northern states, are important drivers of inequity in
access. Conflicts disrupt the service delivery chain in education in two important ways: (i) through the
physical destruction of school infrastructure, and (ii) through the incessant threat of violence which
keeps children and teachers away from schools for security reasons. The breakdown of out-of-school
children indicates that it is largely made up of children who have never been to school (92% at the
national level), and is especially high in the conflict states such as Yobe. Given that the internal
conflicts intensified after 2010, it is likely that the security concerns are a significant contributor to the
finding that most of the 6-14 years old have never been to school. This has important repercussions on
the youth’s lifetime earnings and impact on poverty.

Conflicts also have indirect repercussions for neighboring states as well. For example, Bauchi has seen
an influx of families from nearby conflict states seeking a more secure and stable environment. This
has led to an increase in enrollment from children of the displaced households and represents a
significant burden on recurrent spending for Bauchi. It has also created challenges in planning and
budgeting for the sector given the uncertainty over the permanency of the new entrants in the system.



                                                                                                          xvii
Recommendations

    a. Ongoing conflicts are one of the drivers of inequity in access to basic education, affecting
       mainly the northern states with some spillover to nearby states. Prolonged instability could
       create longer term consequences for education outcomes in affected areas. Therefore, there is
       a clear rationale for federal government intervention with special technical support and
       additional funding to address such problems that are direct effects from the conflict.



Quality of basic education learning outcome

1. Establish a clear and systematic HRM system

The availability of teachers, and quality of teachers in particular, are important determinants of
children’s learning outcomes. In Nigeria, teachers’ low competence level and poor classroom
performance at the basic education level are hindering children’s learning outcome. This is a direct
consequence of a weak human resource management (HRM) system which has faced challenges in
developing competent and motivated teachers. The following are key challenges of HRM at the basic
education level: (i) weak or inadequate teachers’ incentive scheme- teachers motivation is a key factor
in child learning, and the lack of incentives in teachers’ composition package is an issue among Nigerian
teachers, especially, and there are gaps in sector plans for how to incentivize teachers in the future; (ii)
weak accountability system which creates challenges in holding teachers responsible for their
performance. For example, although there exists an accountability structure to foster teacher quality
improvement, the practice has been to transfer teachers who have been subject to any sort of
disciplinary action to remote or rural schools which likely has an adverse effect on the recipient
schools. In addition, teacher unions appear to influence political outcomes and tend to resist any policy
seeking to increase teachers’ accountability or that seek to enhance teacher standards such competence
test for promotion or performance evaluations; (iii) lack of adequate and consistent teacher training
and professional development system. The parallel HRM structure which is split between SUBEB
(acting on behalf of UBEC) and the state government, is one of the key contributors to the conflict
regarding teachers’ professional development efforts, mainly due to weak coordination and inadequate
criteria to define the process. For example, teacher pre-service development or training is offered by
both UBEC (through SUBEB) and by State government, but the criteria established by both is
inconsistent and discourages some by adversely affecting teachers moral and teaching aptitude; (iv)
weak and inconsistent teacher monitoring and evaluation system exposing the sector to academic fraud
and mismanagement of the sector. In particular, the NEMIS data quality is weak, in turn undermining
the ability of policymakers to have clear information for example on teaching and non-teaching
education staff credentials; and (v) inadequacy of clear guidelines and criteria for teacher recruitment,
deployment, promotion, remuneration and performance as well as lack of a clear evaluation system.
For example, there is no defined teacher allocation formula to help determine teaching needs either
based on indicators such as Student Teacher Ratio (STR), class size or facilities at school level. This also
leads other inefficiencies such as a high ratio of administrative staff, high STR, low remuneration,
stagnated salary scale, and inefficient utilization of scare resources in some areas.




                                                                                                       xviii
Recommendations

    a. HRM system should create mechanism to account for teachers’ accountability vis-à-vis
       students’ learning achievements. Accordingly, policy tools to enhance professional
       accountability should be carefully designed, calibrated and implemented with the aim of
       providing an effective teacher in every classroom.
    b. Establish clear minimum criteria guidelines for teachers’ promotion, and recruitment, and
       incentivization mechanisms, including in-service training, and merit based rewards.
    c. School report cards should be used as instruments for all stakeholders to engage with the
       performance of schools and may also help as an input for policy discussion during education
       planning and budgeting stages.
    d. The HRM strategy should also focus on improving teachers’ deployment in remote, rural and
       difficult locations, and in particular the deployment of female teachers.
    e. Nigeria currently harbors very large numbers of education sector staff engaged in M&E and
       administrative activities, and most of these staff are involved in duplicative efforts.
       Streamlining these efforts could allow for a redeployment of staff into more efficient roles
       within the system
    f. SBMCs can be further operationalized to strengthen school management and performance
       oversight.
    g. In-service teacher training programs should be targeted, based on the school-level needs and
       lacunae of the teaching staff. An increase in public education spending earmarked to teachers
       training is needed, including expanding the existing teachers training centers/colleges and in-
       service training at local or LGA centers to improve learning outcomes.

2. Strengthen accountability mechanisms and data collection environment to reduce likelihood of
   academic fraud practices

Academic fraud is one of the key challenges to the quality of education in Nigeria. Although the issues
of academic fraud practices tend to be associated with private school providers, public schools are also
both perpetuators of academic fraud as well as victims of the private school’s actions. The key driver of
this issue is mainly the lack of quality assurance standards in public schools which limit the ability of
the sector to come up with quality assurance standards for private schools. As a result, many private
schools operate without formal registration or with limited enforcement mechanisms enabling children
to flow through the school system without acquiring the necessary literacy and numeracy skills.
Similarly, some private schools have been found to engage in provision of fake or lower standard
certificates, contributing to the production of low skills workforce and low learning outcomes. The fact
that the NEMIS is general speaking weak and captures very limited information even from the
registered private schools, the effect could be much worse in the future and the severity of the problem
may last longer and/or expand as private school providers increase in number.

Recommendations

    a. The education sector in Nigeria needs to establish a proper national academic accreditation
       system and information verification center as well as a strong and consistent M&E system for
       verification of the certificate issuing process to avoid the practice of academic fraud.
    b. The NEMIS needs to be adequately funded and rolled out; it needs to build on an adequate
       integration of state and local level MIS capacity. A stronger NEMIS would enable more reliable
       data and therefore stronger empirically-based policy making.
    c. To strengthening capacities for evidence-based decision-making, data quality need to be
       drastically improved, planned surveys need to be funded, performance indicators need to be
       captured along the entire value chain to help identify delivery bottlenecks, institutionalized
       third party monitoring needs to be operationalized and information should be made publicly
       available.

3. Ensure school environment and infrastructure are conducive to learning

School inputs and factors such as appropriate class size, STR, and availability of other school facilities
are unevenly accessible across states. In particular, states with better resources are able to maintain a
relatively better school environment, conducive to learning while states with limited resources and
lagging learning outcomes face significant challenges in providing and maintaining an adequate school
environment. For example, overcrowded classrooms, high STRs, bad classroom condition, limited toilet
and water facilities are widely observed in most of the northern part of the country, which also tend
to have low learning outcomes. This low access to critical school inputs is in large part due to the lack
of financing for operating costs. In fact, similar to personnel salary, budgeted allocation to operating
costs are not earmarked and mostly depend on UBEC intervention funds which in turn depend on the
state’s ability to raise the matching grant component as well as its ability to execute the other funds
efficiently. This clearly undermines the ability to have a systematic planning of school input and other
school level learning provisions.

Recommendations

    a. The availability of adequate school inputs and learning environments is key for learning
       outcomes, and as such, it is crucial that appropriate funds (operating costs and capital
       expenditure) be earmarked in order to make the learning environment conducive to
       educational achievement.

4. Introduce a standardized and streamlined learning assessment system

A standardized learning assessment system is key to ensure a consistent and reliable evaluation of
learning outcomes. Limited information, based on studies in a few select states, shows that learning
outcomes are extremely low in basic education but such limited information is not adequate to develop
a national framework for quality improvement. Available national exams (NECO) are not compulsory
and it is impossible to fully capture the learning level of basic education children. For example, grade
6 test for entrance to junior secondary school is optional and only students who are interested to join
Unity College participate in the testing. Overall, although pieces of available information indicate that
the learning level of Nigerian children is generally low, Nigeria is missing reliable and consistent

                                                                                                       xx
learning outcome assessment tools for both within country comparison as well as for international
comparison. This is especially critical as Nigeria is expected to be one of the top 20 countries in terms
of income by 2030.

Recommendations

    a. For better M&E of learning outcomes, Nigeria should establish a standardized evaluation
       system such as a compulsory national test at the end of each level of education.


Matrix for policy recommendations


The detailed policy recommendations were presented above under each section and the matrix below
summarizes these recommendations, highlighting sequencing of actions (steps) for effective
implementation of the recommendations seeking to improve both equity and quality. However, it
should be noted that the first step is not exclusively a precondition to the next step, but is rather an
indication that the preceding step is critical for the subsequent step to be more effective and efficient
in addressing the issues. The matrix also aligns policy action to the responsible tier of government.
Although policy decisions are not taking place at the school level, in order to strengthen actions on the
ground, some recommendations also refer to school level action such as action by SBMC or
communities. When policy action is critical from one tier of government but requires policy action
from the other tiers, double tick ( ) is used to indicate the weight. The matrix also suggests a timeline
for the policy action where some recommendations require immediate action but may require longer
to effectively complete. In this matrix, we assumed activities indicated as “short term” are ones that can
be implemented in the next 1-2 years; medium term is 3-5 years; and long term more than 5 years. The
matrix presents recommendations for equity and quality separately following the analysis in the main
text but it should be also noted that equity related policy recommendation is a necessary condition for
improved quality outcomes.

I. Introduction

Context

1.       Nigeria has achieved remarkable milestones in its development over the last decade. The
country has enjoyed sustained economic growth, averaging 6 percent GDP growth since 2004, and has
outperformed the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regional average growth rate of 4 percent for much of that
period. After the recent GDP rebasing exercise, Nigeria was officially recognized as Africa’s largest
economy3, accounting for 32 percent of SSA gross domestic product in 2013. Despite its demonstrated
economic prowess, Nigeria faces many challenges including falling oil prices which threaten its fiscal
sustainability, persistent and high poverty rates, as well as ongoing conflicts mainly in the northern
region, which claimed over eleven thousand lives4 in 2014. In light of the challenges ahead, and given
its cross-cutting nature, the education sector is more than ever a key priority area for Nigeria. In
particular, the education sector has an especially important role in (i) ensuring a diversified and
resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations in international oil markets, (ii) reducing the
poverty incidence through returns to education in the labor market and (iii) fostering development in
fragile zones, which is commonly found to be an effective strategy in pre-empting and curtailing
conflicts5.

2.       Ten years ago, the Nigerian government set up a legal, financing and institutional framework
to ensure the achievement of its policy objectives of providing universal basic education. Although this
framework has been reasonably successful in fostering policy coordination and alignment across the
three tiers of the government: federal, state and local, its effectiveness has been hampered by significant
governance challenges such as weak managerial and professional accountability mechanisms,
inadequate financial and human resource mobilization, and a lack of monitoring of results.

3.      However, despite the sector’s importance and the country’s commitment to achieving the
MDGs as well as implementing universal basic education, Nigeria’s education performance has not
shown significant improvement between 2008 and 2013. As a result, Nigeria will not achieve its MDG
goals by the 2015 deadline, given that the primary completion rate and gender parity index, 74 and 90
percent respectively in 2013, remain under target. Furthermore, the country has not been successful in
its implementation of universal basic education since access to education still remains a crucial problem
in Nigeria, with about 30 percent of children aged 6-14 years old out of school.




3 Nigeria conducted a rebasing exercise in 2014, updating the base year from 1990 to 2010. Since then, Nigeria
has surpassed South Africa as the largest African economy, although it remains lower than the latter on a per
capita basis given that its population is about 3.5 times that of South Africa.
4 98 percent of all fatalities in the country in that year were located in the northern states, 52 percent of all

fatalities were from Borno state.

                                                                                                               1
Scope of study and terminology

4.      The main objective of this Economic and Sector Work (ESW) is to support the government
reform agenda in the education sector by providing analytical input in the areas of governance, and
finance to enable the sector to address its key issues. This ESW is the third part of an analytical
programmatic project on the education sector in Nigeria that encompasses three policy notes. The first
policy note focused on access, equity and quality issues in basic and secondary education while the
second policy note focused on assessing the linkages between technical, vocational and tertiary
education and the labor market. These two notes conducted a comprehensive assessment of the current
situation, identified the key bottlenecks in the education sector including low access, low completion,
low quality, low skills or capacity, high out-of-school rate, high inequality, and high dependency on
low productive sectors. This third part of the ESW series focuses on the areas of governance,
accountability and finance at the basic education level. In particular, it provides (i) an in-depth
diagnostic assessment of the policy environment, governance system and accountability framework of
the education sector influencing the service delivery and educational outcomes, and (ii) an in-depth
analysis of how the education sector is financed focusing on effectiveness, efficiency, equity,
affordability and sustainability analyses at the three tiers of government.

5.       The report focuses on two of the most salient education challenges highlighted in the first
policy note; equity and quality of basic education, and investigates the root causes of these two key
challenges utilizing a problem driven approach within the governance, and finance framework.
Although the findings from the two policy notes identified numerous challenges across all levels of
education, equity and quality of basic education are highlighted as the sources of the most substantial
inadequacies and gaps in the education sector in Nigeria. In particular, disparities of access across states
as well as based on socio-economic status within states are large. They also appear to some extent within
the rural-urban and gender divide. There are also millions of school-age children who remain out-of-
school, most of them in the northern regions. Learning outcomes indicators also show that children’s
learning levels are low, raising concerns over the knowledge and skills acquisition of the current cohort
of students and the potential limitations this poses on transferability of their skills upon joining the
workforce. Furthermore, the recent Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) report based on 4 sample states
highlighted the low competences and skills of teachers, undermining the learning outcomes of
children. The core analysis of this ESW builds on the findings of the first policy note and SDI findings,
but also utilizes additional information available from the recent household surveys, which are
presented in the annex.

6.      The country and sector governance framework and challenges affect the effectiveness and
quality of public expenditure management and practices, and the delivery of basic education services.
The report provides a holistic approach to the analysis by considering all facets influencing service
delivery. Governance is defined as 1) institutional effectiveness (both with regard to processes and
development outcomes), 2) accountability (political, managerial, professional and social) and; 3)
integrity (in policy implementation and frontline service delivery). On accountability, it applies to the
Nigerian federal system the analytical framework developed by Lewis (2009)6 which links governance

6 This include appropriate standards, incentives, information, and accountability, which induce high performance
from public providers whereas: (i) Standards are transparent and publicly known criteria or benchmarks used to
assess and inform education policy, provision, and performance; (ii) Incentives are any financial or non-financial

                                                                                                                2
to improved education outcomes through the empowerment of citizens to voice their opinions,
influence policies, deepen the monitoring of service delivery, and the enhancement of the
accountability of power holders and frontline service providers. The study also explores interactions
between the governance framework and public financial management and their impact on the delivery
of equitable and quality basic education services across different geographical zones and states. For this
analysis, given the narrowly defined and in-depth focus of issues in basic education, the concepts of
equity and quality are defined as follows: (a), equity— is the availability of basic education services
opportunity for all Nigerian children as measured by preprimary, primary and junior secondary
enrollment rates, as well as the proportion of out-of-school children within basic education school
cohorts, and (b), quality—is the performance of children in schooling in basic education levels in terms
of learning assessment results, on-time completion of appropriate basic education levels and literacy
and numeracies skills. Based on these narrow definitions of equity and quality, the analysis aims to
answer the follow key questions:

    a. What are the most critical governance and public financial management bottlenecks hindering
       progress in the two worst-performing basic education outcome indicators in Nigeria?
    b. To what extent do the governance and public financial management bottlenecks affect the
       identified critical basic education outcome indicators, how does this responsibility vary across
       the three tiers of Government in Nigeria and to what extent are they interlinked?
    c. To what extent is the quality of teachers responsible for the poor quality of basic education in
       Nigeria, or the system of assessing child performance?
    d. What other critical factors are responsible for the poor indicators? For example, to what extent
       are demand side factors (e.g. culture, cost of schooling, etc.) or supply side factors (e.g.
       availability of school inputs) responsible for high levels of out-of-school children?


Data and limitations

7.      The quantitative data analysis relied on a mix of survey data and administrative data from
multiple sources. One of the greatest challenges in carrying out an empirical analysis on Nigeria is the
lack of availability, consistency and reliability of administrative data in general and in particular in
education. The lack of a strong and effective data collection process in the country is a direct and
important weakness of the system, which has direct repercussions on the validity and accuracy of
policymaking. The availability of surveys, such as the GHS, bridged some of the gaps, but it is clear that
the data collection capacity of the system has to be prioritized and strengthened in order to allow
reliable and empirically substantiated policy decisions-making, as well as enable monitoring and
evaluation of targets. The main data sources for the analysis include: (i) 2010/11 and 2012/13 Nigeria
Panel surveys, (ii) 2010/11 Nigeria General Household Surveys, (iii) 2008 and 2014 Demographic and


factors that motivate a specific type of behavior or action, and can be positive or negative, i.e. encourage a certain
behavior or deter it, (iii) Information in the form of clear definitions of outputs and outcomes combined with
accurate data on performance and results collected at regular intervals enables sanctions to be imposed when
specified standards are not met, and (iv) Accountability refers to the act of holding public officials/service
providers answerable for processes and outcomes and imposing sanctions if specified outputs and outcomes are
not delivered.

Qualitative data collection methodology

8.      In order to perform a combined analysis, as outlined above, which examines the issues from
both the governance and public expenditure perspectives, we captured both quantitative and
qualitative data on the education sector. The qualitative data collection process was carried out in three
phases:

          (i) Phase 1: a first round of field visits was organized in Edo and Kogi states to gather some
          initial data and better understand the idiosyncratic issues facing various states. Following these
          brief visits, a workshop was organized in October 2014 with education sector stakeholders from
          15 different states—comprising of the Honorable Permanent Secretary, the Director and a
          designated technical focal point for each state. The workshop also included representatives
          from the Federal Ministry of Education (FMOE), the Universal Basic Education Commission
          (UBEC) as well as representatives from DFID to provide additional perspectives to the
          discussion. During this workshop, a short qualitative survey was administered to the
          participants. The survey was designed and structured in such a way as to capture the main
          education issues, from both the finance and the governance sides, faced by each of the states
          represented in the workshop. The discussions that ensued were based on the information
          provided. In addition to the qualitative survey, technical officers from each of the 15 states
          provided both budget and education data, that were used as auxiliary, supporting information.
          (ii) Phase 2: informed by the findings from the first workshop, the team carried out a second
          round of field visits, including institutional qualitative surveys on key education bottlenecks
          identified across 4 of the 6 selected states- Edo, Kano, Kogi, and Lagos and similar information
          was captured in a PETS7 study in Anambra and Bauchi – totaling one state from each of the six
          geopolitical zones of Nigeria. The visits and surveys were designed using a bottom-up approach,
          starting at the school-level with headmaster/principal interviews, followed by a survey of the
          SBMC representatives. Once the issues were better understood at the school-level, follow-up
          interviews were organized with the Education Secretary at the Local Government Education
          Authority (LGEA), with the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and finally with
          the commissioner at the State Ministry of Education (SMOE) respectively. The same
          questionnaires were administered to each stakeholder in each state in order to capture the
          variation in governance, accountability and finance bottlenecks experienced across states.
          (iii) Phase 3: following the field visits, a two-day workshop was organized in Abuja with State
          representatives from SMOE and SUBEB, from the six focus states, as well as Federal
          representatives from UBEC and FMOE, private sector representatives, civil society
          organizations as well as DFID. The discussion was divided into four sessions, (i) the institutional

                                                                                                           4
       framework of basic education, (ii) equity in access to education, (iii) quality of education, and
       (iv) the issue of out-of-school children. One of the main objectives of the workshop was to
       understand how to extrapolate observations from the state visits to the national level. As such,
       the exchange between the participants was limited, as much as possible, to the issues as they
       relate to Nigeria as a whole.


Outline of the report

9.       Sections 2 and 3 provide a brief overview of the country context in terms of its macro-economy,
political economy and education sector in Nigeria. Section 4 provides the legal, institutional and
accountability framework pertaining to the basic education governance system. Section 5 provides an
overview of the education sector finance, and the political economy of resources allocation. It also
describes, more specifically, the basic education finance framework and estimates spending in basic
education, which underpins the analysis of the key education sector challenges. Section 6 focuses on
the two key education challenges, equity and quality of education, and provides a problem-driven
approach to analyze the issues in the context of governance, accountability and finance. The main
conclusions and policy recommendations are provided at the end of each sub-section of the analysis.
The annexes provide detailed empirical analysis to support findings as well as methodological notes.

II. Country context

Demographic and macroeconomic context

10.     Nigeria is the most populous country in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and has one of
the largest youth populations in the world, indicating strong potential demographic dividends which
could be an important poverty reduction tool for the country. With approximately 178.5 million people
(2014 estimate8), Nigeria surpasses by a very large margin both Ethiopia (94 million) and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (65.7 million) as the most populous Sub-Saharan African nation, and is
projected to keep growing at about 2.8 percent annually. The population is also notably characterized
by a large youth cohort, with 44 percent of the population under the age of 15 (Figure 1). About 30
percent of the population is of school-age (6-17 years old), with about 24 percent of the population 6-
14 years old. In addition, about half of the population is female (49.1%) and the fertility rate is about
5.5 births per woman, higher than the SSA average (5.0 births per woman in 2013)9.

    Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision, DVD Edition.


11.     The country is organized as a federal constitutional republic, made up of 36 states along with
the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, and is split into 6 geopolitical zones across the north-south
divide: North Central, North East, North West, South East, South South and South West. The country
also comprises 774 local government areas (LGA). The country is ethnically, linguistically and
religiously diverse, with about 374 ethnic groups, the three largest being the Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo.
The population is 50 percent Christian and 49 percent Muslim. While most people live in rural areas

                                                                                                           6
(approx. 63%), especially in the northern states, the larger share of residents in the South East and
South West are urban dwellers.

12.      Nigeria is a resource-rich country and is the 13th largest oil supplier10 in the world producing
2.6 percent of the world's supply—although all states do not benefit equally from the abundant
resources. The majority of oil and gas activity is in the Niger-Delta zone, located in the south of Nigeria,
with the largest oil production being in the states of Akwa-Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Bayelsa and Cross River.
The revenues from oil production are distributed across all levels of government—federal, state and
local. The sharing formula, which is determined by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal
Commission (RMAFC) and approved by the National Assembly, has been a contentious point between
oil-producing and non-oil producing states. For every dollar of oil revenue, 13 cents are allocated to
the eight oil-producing states (referred to as derivation), while 44 cents goes to the federal government
and 43 cents are shared among the state and the local and FCT governments.11 The Federal Account
Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares the amount for the state governments based on the following
criteria: equally for all states (40 percent), population (30 percent), landmass and terrain (10 percent),
social development factor (10 percent), and internal revenue generation effort (10 percent). States with
low population, a small landmass, a low social development factor (such as a good rate of primary school
enrollment) and low internal revenue generation effort receive lower transfers. This means that some
states and LGAs with lower capacity for revenue generation face budget constraints. It should be noted
that the crude oil sector has faced particularly difficult circumstances in recent years: (i) persistently
lower oil prices, (ii) oil production losses (several pipelines were temporarily shut down in 2013 due to
oil theft), (iii) continuous security instability, especially in the North (from 2010 to 2014 there were
more than 4,400 cases of violence against civilians, battles, riots or protests and a total of 23,174 fatalities
in the country12), and (vi) low political consensus for key reforms.

13.     With a revised GDP of close to US$500 billion in 2013, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and
the 24th largest in the world and its growth potential is strong. Since the return of democratic rule in
1999, the country has undergone major reforms supporting the rebuilding of institutions and the
development of a more robust economy. Following the GDP rebasing13 in 2014, revised 2013 GDP
figures indicated that Nigeria was the 24th largest economy in the world, ahead of countries like
Belgium and Taiwan. The growth rate (after rebasing) oscillated between 4.3 and 5.4 percent between
2011 and 2013 and is expected to have increased to 6.1 percent in 2014 (Table 1). It has consistently
outperformed the SSA average (3.8-4.2%) over the same period, 2011 to 2013.

14.      Fiscal consolidation is progressing mainly through strong efforts for budget control at the
federal level. The medium term outlook reveals that federal spending as a share of GDP is expected to
decline although state and local government spending is still on the rise (Table 1). However, it is
interesting to highlight here that more revenue is generated at the state and local administration tiers
of the government (more than 65 percent of all public revenues), although these tiers are associated
with relatively high expenditure. In terms of share of GDP, the consolidation efforts showed a
significant cut in spending at the federal level (from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.4 percent in 2013,

projected to decline to 5 percent in 2016). However, at state and local tiers, the cut is marginal and the
share of expenditure in terms of GDP is projected to remain relatively unchanged. It should also be
noted that the low share of government spending in GDP is mainly due to GDP rebasing that nearly
doubled the GDP figures, leading the revised spending share to be half the pre-rebasing levels.

15.     In spite of strong economic performance, poverty is still pervasive in Nigeria, especially in rural
areas and is more prevalent in northern states. At the national level, the poverty headcount ratio
improved only marginally from 35.2 to 33.1 percent between 2010/11 and 2012/2013 (Figure 2) and
remained about 3.5 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas during that period. Southern states
tend to have a much lower poverty incidence, between 16 and 28.8 percent, compared with 31.1 to
50.2 percent in the north. Southern states were also more successful at reducing poverty between
2010/2011 and 2012/2013, with the South West zone leading with a reduction of 5.2 percentage points
while poverty rates in North East actually increased from 47.1 to 50.2 percent over the same period.
However, the poverty gap (not shown) which measures how far the poor are to the poverty line, and
the poverty severity measure, which evaluates the severity of the gap by assigning a larger weight to
the poor who are very far from the poverty line, both indicate that while poverty incidence decreased
nationally, the poor are getting poorer and their poverty is becoming more severe, driven mainly by

Governance context

16.      The “federal character” of Nigeria is a strong determinant of policy making (design and
implementation) and while effectiveness requires strong intergovernmental coordination, this is often
undermined by competing claims for sovereignty. Nigerian federalism is essentially “distributive”14,
aiming at an equitable political representation and distribution of resources across the 36 Nigerian
states, which themselves have multiplied from the original three regions at independence, to protect
the interests of minorities and avoid the hegemony of any particular ethnic group. The distributive
nature of fiscal federalism in Nigeria translates into highly politically sensitive and rigid allocation
formulas of fiscal revenue, which cannot be easily adjusted for enhanced development effectiveness or
to mitigate regional disparities. Since the Biafra war, the main ethno-regional political elite groups have
tried to preserve the unity of the country by sharing positions of power and distributing territory and
fiscal resources. This arrangement differs from power sharing in other African countries in that it
extends to territory and revenue allocation and results from a deliberate decision15. Despite its strong
rationale and resilience16 as a significant feature of the governance framework in Nigeria, this


14 Suberu, 2001
15 Power-sharing was adopted to moderate the adversarial elite b ehavior that marred Nigeria’s first democratic
experiment and plunged the country into civil war.” (Orji, 2008)
16 It is argued that behind the symptoms of political instability and antagonism, there is a strong vector of

continuity and even consensus in Nigerian politics and governance: “despite regime and constitutional changes,
most elements of power-sharing in Nigeria were preserved and passed on from one regime or constitutional order

                                                                                                                    9
arrangement is regularly debated in the political arena and the balance of power between the three
tiers of the Nigerian government is not yet stabilized, as reflected in the 2014 National Conference
report.17

17.     In education, the specifics of Nigeria’s “federal character” are reflected in the inevitable
intricacies of the constitutionally-mandated shared responsibility of the three tiers of government—
federal, state and local—and the need for horizontal and vertical policy alignment and coordination,
while allowing for flexibility in implementation to accommodate very diverse contexts and
expectations (including from various religious communities). The interdependence between the two
upper tiers of government plays a critical role in Nigeria in policy design and implementation. For
instance, free, universal and compulsory primary education was first introduced at the regional level
prior to independence, before being promoted as a national program18. Also, state governments tend to
emulate initiatives taken by neighboring ones, and some level of benchmarking of state level indicators
and peer-learning has been institutionalized, including by the Governors’ Forum under its peer review
mechanism19.

18.     Nigeria’s federalism, and the disparities engendered within such a system, are also reflected in
the wide range of development outcomes across the states as well as across local government areas.
Although the southern part of the country fares better on most development indicators than its
northern part, the performance of state governments varies widely, with northern states performing
comparatively better in certain critical dimensions. As highlighted in the previous policy note,
although net school attendance in primary education remains significantly lower in the north on
average, it increased significantly between 1999 and 2010 (jumping by 30 points in Jigawa and Kaduna)
while deteriorating in the south20. In Nigeria, intra-regional variations are often as wide as interregional
ones and obfuscate in many instances the north-south divide. This reflects the critical importance of
policy making at state level on development outputs and outcomes.

19.    Despite significant governance reforms at federal and state level since 1999, Nigeria’s
governance dimensions such as transparency, accountability, corruption, investment climate or
personal safety remain weak21. Citizens’ trust in public officials is at low ebb: according to
Afrobarometer, at the end of 2014 more than half of them believe that elected officials are corrupt and
although two-thirds of the population prefer democracy to any other forms of government, the exact
same proportion is dissatisfied about it including for lack of perceived progress on corruption.




to another (…) it is oversimplifying to perceive Nigeria as a regime marked by discontinuity because of some
instances of political and institutional breakdowns.” (Orji, 2008)
17 The National Conference is an assembly of delegates from various background and political affiliation convened

by the President of Nigeria to debate national issues. This conference called for a re-articulation of the 1999
constitutional responsibility of education sector management as stated above.

20.     Corruption affects service delivery across board, including diverting government revenue22 and
expenditure through tax evasion, as well as leakages on current and capital expenditure. Petty
corruption directly impedes access to education by the poor. According to a recent survey by
ActionAid, nearly half of the respondents claim that they have to pay a bribe to secure admission to
school for their children23. This defies the policy objective of granting every child free and compulsory
basic education. Other forms of corruption affect the quality of education as well as access and equity
such as the diversion or misuse of public funds, examination malpractice, etc. It is reported that “once
they have graduated, students face pressures to pay teachers and administrators to sign “clearance”
forms, without which schools will not release official results, thereby suspending any future
educational options. It has also been observed that some “teachers choose to be entrepreneurial in
schools. Some accept bribes to help students cheat on exams. Other abuses of power come in the form
of using student labor to create goods that teachers then sell, or forcing students to attend and pay for
additional tutoring24.

21.     Political patronage also seems to negatively impact the implementation of basic education at
the local level. This is reflected in the inexplicably high proportion of non-teaching staff in public pre-
primary, primary and junior secondary schools in certain states. Whereas the national average hovers
around 11 percent of total education staff, this proportion climbs as high as 70 percent in certain states,
according to the National personnel audit of UBEC 2010.

22.      Violence and insecurity also severely impact education outcomes in afflicted areas25 and the
on-going insurgency in the North-East reflects the political sensitivity if not volatility of education. In
the North-East, insurgents, identified by the generic moniker of Boko Haram, which in vernacular
language approximately translates into “western education is prohibited”, have specifically targeted
public schools for girls (including by abducting close to 300 schoolgirls from a public secondary school
in Chibok in Borno state in April 2014), entailing huge population displacement26, destruction of school
facilities (over 300 schools have been destroyed or damaged in the past few years) and school closure
and dissuading attendance of girls hence further increasing the gender gap.

23.      Education is generally politicized and Nigeria is no exception to the rule. Education ranks high
on the Nigerian political agenda. On the eve of the national election in April-May 2015, Nigerian
citizens considered it the main issue they expected elected officials to focus on. Education outcomes,
such as those captured by the MDGs, are tracked at federal and state level and heatedly debated in the
political arena. As in many other countries, teachers are a critical, some claim “formidable”,



22 Nigeria is one of the developing countries the worst affected by illicit financial outflows: according to a recent
African Union report, this amounted to 217 bn USD between 1970 and 2008, i.e. 30% of total funds smuggled out
of Africa and Global Financial Integrity estimates such outflows to 160 bn USD between 2003 and 2012 including
8 bn USD in 2012, i.e. about 40% of the African total (and the 9th rank across developing countries)

stakeholder27: teachers’ unionization is mandatory in Nigeria, which has a strong tradition of trade
unionism, and the Teachers’ Union is closely and formally associated with policy decision making.
They sometimes resist reforms effectively but can also be instrumental in the implementation of
reforms.

24.     Informal social and power structures and actors, such as traditional leaders, are formally
consulted and associated to policy making along with established civil society organizations. This is
reflected in particular in the membership of SBMC, Local Government Education Authorities (LGEA),
and ad hoc executive agencies at state and federal level, namely the State Universal Basic Education
Boards and Universal Basic Education Commission, established across the country by the Universal
Basic Education Act of 2004. The role and weight of these informal power structures vary widely across
the country depending on the specifics of local society organization. But this is an important feature of
local governance across Nigeria and beyond, since formal and informal power sharing mechanisms at
state and federal levels result in the public’s representation in public institutions and participation in
decision-making process across the three tiers of the Nigerian government.




27International experience proves that teachers’ unions can be actively supportive of education reforms (Grindle,
2004) and that “the relationship between teacher union membership and student achievement could go either
positive or negative, and is thus an empirical question” (DFID, 2014).

                                                                                                              12
III. Education sector context

25.     Nigeria’s commitment to universal primary education dates back to the 1950’s, and in recent
years the country has expanded its focus to the basic education level (which extends to the three years
of junior secondary education). While still under the British rule, the government of the Western Zone
was the first zone28 to successfully introduce free primary education in 1955, followed by the Eastern
Zone in 1957. The Northern government was the only zone to not implement any such program given
that the zone had a strong network of Islamiyah schools already and did not feel the need to adopt the
same policy as the Western and Eastern zones. In 1976, the country’s first national level program,
Universal Primary Education (UPE), was launched. The country continued its efforts to make
education accessible with the introduction of a Nomadic Education program in 1989, ensuring access
for the nomadic population. In 1999, the president launched the Universal Basic Education (UBE)
program, an improved version of the UPE program already in place, ensuring universal education for
primary school as well as for the three years of junior secondary education. The introduction of this
policy in 1999 culminated with the adoption of the UBE Act in 2004 that effectively operationalized
the policy through the introduction of the UBEC to manage the implementation of the UBE vision.

26.      Together, the UBE Act and the National Policy on Education form the main regulatory
framework for the education sector in Nigeria. The National Policy on Education was first introduced
in 1977 with subsequent revisions in 1981, 1998, 2004 and 2006. The National Policy on Education is
a key document for the education sector, outlining the intent, objectives and priorities of the education
sector, ensuring a unified approach within the decentralized framework that characterizes Nigeria. The
National Policy on Education includes guidance and recommendations on the structure of all levels of
education (in line with the prescriptions under the UBE Act), on teacher qualification and
management, teaching practices such as encouraging the use of national languages as a teaching
medium, and even the contents of the curriculum.

27.      A key objective of the current National Policy on Education the attainment of universal basic
education by 2015 in line with the MDGs for education. The Federal Constitution of 1999 stipulates
that the government should provide free education for all citizens as soon as possible and, as mentioned
earlier, education is a key component of the Vision 20:2020. Subsequently, both federal and state
governments are seeking greater overall control and funding of basic education in order to ensure the
attainment of UBE goals and objectives.




28Nigeria in the 1950’s was divided into three zones: the Northern Zone, Western Zone and Eastern Zone and
the Macpherson Constitution of 1951 granted each region organizational authority to each region regarding
education matters (UNESCO, 2015- Education for All review)

                                                                                                       13
Universal basic education policy

28.     The Nigeria’s UBE policy seeks to provide free compulsory basic education to all citizens29 and
declares government priority for basic education. The policy provides wide-ranging measures,
including federal government funding to “ensure that Government at all levels in Nigeria provides free,
compulsory and universal basic education for every child of school-age”. In terms of scope, the policy
focuses on improving both formal and non-formal schooling in primary and junior secondary schools,
promote functional education such as adult literacy education and education for school-age children of
nomads and migrant fishermen. The main goal of the program is “to eradicate illiteracy, ignorance, and
poverty as well as stimulate and accelerate national development, political consciousness, and national
integration” (see Box 1 for detail).
 Box 1: Universal Basic Education
 The federal government’s intervention shall provide assistance to the states and local governments in Nigeria
 for the purposes of uniform and quality basic education.
 Every government in Nigeria shall provide free, compulsory and universal basic education for every child of
 primary and junior secondary school-age.
 Every parent shall ensure that his/her child or ward attends and completes
          a) Primary school education and
          b) Junior secondary school education
 The stakeholders in education in each local government area shall ensure that every parent or person who
 has the care and custody of a child performs the duty imposed on him/her under the Universal Basic
 Education Act, 2004
 Transition from primary to junior secondary school (JSS) should be automatic, as basic education terminates
 at the junior secondary school level; thus, entrance examinations may no longer be necessary. Emphasis will
 be placed on effective continuous assessment while final examination and certification will now be done at
 the end of the nine-year basic education program.
 The secondary school system should be restructured so as to ensure that the JSS component is disarticulated
 from the senior school system (SSS) as stipulated in the National Policy on Education (NPE)

29.     The Government’s strategy to achieve the UBE objectives is as far-reaching as the policy
objectives, requiring both strong capacity and an effective accountability framework to achieve results.
In particular, the strategy includes a range of measures, such as (i) institutional reforms to improve
delivery capacity; (ii) strategic planning and collaboration among all three levels of governments -
federal state and local; (iii) strategic funding; (iv), teacher professional development to promote
effective teaching and (v) active community participation in the delivery of basic education. These
intentions are reflected in the legal and institutional framework for the provision of basic education in
Nigeria.




29The policy is distinctive in its approach and focus, underscoring the historical experiences of universal
education, in terms of its challenges and demonstrated significance in improving quality, access and equity in
education.

                                                                                                             14
Administration of education system

30.     The federal, state and local governments of Nigeria share concurrent responsibilities in the
regulation and administration of the education sector. However, basic and secondary education
remains mostly under the management of the state and local governments while the federal
government is responsible for the administration of federally-owned universities. The federal
government also manages 104 Federal Unity Colleges that were set up to serve as model schools for
state secondary schools. Under the provision of the 2004 UBE Act, operational responsibility for all
aspects of basic education provision has been given to the state universal basic education boards.
Responsibility for senior secondary education remains under the purview of state ministries of
education (SMOEs).

31.     In addition to public schools, the private sector and religious schools are also important players
in the provision of education in Nigeria. Private schools which have increased substantially over the
years, are mostly an urban phenomenon, especially in pre-school provision. In some areas, such as
Lagos, private school provision at the basic education level has been associated with higher quality
education, however some states have also faced issues with unregulated private schools which do not
meet the standards set by the FMOE and which have raised concerns about the impact on the quality
of education.

32.     Religious schools, predominantly Islamic, which date back to pre-colonial days, are particularly
important in the provision of education in the northern states. There are many types of Islamic schools
in Nigeria and they are typically categorized into three groups: Qur’anic, Islamiyya and
Tsangaya/Almajiri Schools. Qur’anic schools in general focus on religious education with no secular
education programs and tend to be informal in nature. Almajiri schools are similar to Qur’anic schools
in that they tend to be informal and are often nomadic. Non-integrated Islamiyya schools are more
conventional than Qur’anic or Almajiri schools but still limit their curriculum to religious education
whereas integrated Islamiyya schools adhere to national guidelines in terms of curriculum, teaching
core subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies as well as the traditional religious
education.



Structure of the education system

33.     The formal education system in Nigeria uses a common basic structure across the country. The
Nigerian education system follows the 1-6-3-3-4 structure, starting with one year of pre-primary30 at
age five, followed by six years of primary education, which usually targets children aged 6 to 11 years
old. The first three levels are considered as basic education in Nigeria (See Annex A, Figure A 1).

34.    The organization and content of basic education has been adapted to enable all students to
achieve a sound education foundation. Basic education in Nigeria uses the automatic promotion policy


30Pre-school usually corresponds to 3 years of schooling for children aged 3-5. However, the Federal Ministry of
Education (FMOE) announced in 2011the addition of one-year of pre-primary education as part of the official
system to better prepare children for school (National Bank of Nigeria Annual Report, 2011).

                                                                                                             15
within each cycle of education to help students complete the basic education level. At the end of the
primary school cycle, students obtain a primary school leaving certificate which is awarded on the basis
of continuous assessment and which is a pre-requisite for entry into junior secondary school31. The
curriculum content of basic education ranges between 10 and 16 subjects, and focuses on core
compulsory subjects, which include English, Mathematics, Basic Science, and one major Nigerian
language. The curriculum has been adapted to help Nigeria achieve its Education For All (EFA) or MDG
in education and ensure students are equipped with the necessary basic knowledge and skills. At the
JSS level, students have two options: (i) pre-vocational stream and (ii) academic stream, and students
in both streams are required to follow the common core subjects, although there may be some
differences in the elective courses chosen. The end of the three years of the JSS cycle is marked by the
Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE)32 and successful students are awarded the Junior
Secondary School Certificate (JSSC) which is needed to progress to senior secondary school.

35.     Advancing to senior secondary or technical school depends on the successful completion of
basic education. Upon completion of JSS, students are streamed into senior secondary schools, technical
schools or training centers. The successful students in senior secondary cycle awarded the Senior School
Certificate (SSC) issued by the West African Examination Council (WAEC) if the student sits for the
WAEC exam and/or the National Examination Council (NECO) for the students taking the NECO
exam. In many cases, Nigerian students sit for both WAEC and NECO exams. The SSC is a pre-requisite
for admission to higher education. In addition to the SSC, students must pass the Universities
Matriculation Examination (UME), which is conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation
Board (JAMB) and must score at least 50 percent to be admitted to University33. For those students who
choose to attend technical colleges in lieu of SSS, they obtain a National Technical/Business Certificate
instead of the SSC upon completion and may choose to further their studies in their field to obtain an
Advanced National Technical/Business Certificate.

36.      Even though the Federal Government has limited operational authority over basic education,
it established a 2011-2015 national sector strategy intended to help the country achieve its education
goals. There are six main focal areas to the sector strategy: (i) strengthening the institutional
management of education, (ii) improving access and equity, (iii) improving standards and quality
assurance, (iv) providing teacher education and development, (v) enabling technical and vocational
education and training, and (vi) finding ways to increase funding, partnerships and resource
mobilization.



31 Those students who wish to attend Federal Government Unity Colleges have to, in addition, sit for the National
Common Entrance Examination, which is administered by the National Examinations Council (NECO) at the
end of grade 6.
32 While each state of the federation and the FCT conduct the BECE for their candidates, NECO conducts the

BECE for Federal Unity Colleges, Armed Forces Secondary Schools and other Federal establishments operating
Secondary schools. Private Secondary schools also take part in the NECO BECE provided they are permitted by
their State Ministry of Education. Twenty-five subjects are administered at the BECE level. A candidate is
expected to sit for a minimum of thirteen subjects and a maximum of fifteen. A candidate is deemed to have
passed the BECE if he/she has passed in six subjects including English and Mathematics (source: NECO)
33 Unless the student has gone through the WAEC O and A level examinations, in which case they can be admitted

without going through the UME.

                                                                                                              16
IV. The governance of basic education in Nigeria

Legal and institutional framework

37.      The existing legal framework for basic education provides only some of the necessary legal
provisions for effective policy implementation, has had only limited success and has secured
insufficient resource allocation. At the level of educational institutions the established ad hoc
framework has failed to strengthen accountability for results and ensure consistent and robust policy
implementation; at the national level policy alignment and coordination across the states remains
essentially formalities rather than substantive, and the local tier of the government is effectively
sidelined from policy implementation.



Legal framework

38.       Although the objective of universal, free and compulsory education is enshrined in the
Nigerian Constitution, in practice its provisions assign responsibility across the three tiers of the
government without effectively empowering local governments or allowing them to take up those
responsibilities. The 1999 Constitution mandates the government to ensure “equal and adequate
educational opportunities at all levels”, “strive to eradicate illiteracy; and to this end […] as and when
practical provide (a) free, compulsory and universal primary education; (b) free university education;
and (c) free adult literacy programmes.” It states that secondary education falls under the concurrent
jurisdiction of the federal and state governments, and that primary, adult and vocational education falls
under the concurrent responsibility of state and local governments. It also ensures that part of the
government revenue collected at the federal level is effectively transferred to state and local
governments. However, the Universal Basic Education Act of 2004, based on the 1999 constitutional
mandate, essentially set up the institutional framework of basic education at federal, state and local
levels by creating ad-hoc executive agencies, UBEC at federal level, SUBEB at state level and LGEA at
local level, but it has not been able to ensure their accountability and performance .34 This model has
been replicated consistently across the states and this legal framework has ensured a consistent
institutional framework for basic education across the country and a fair level of intergovernmental
coordination, but with limited accountability of the state governments to the federal government. As
early as 2007, the National Council of Education recommended a review of the UBE Act and the matter
is still pending in the political agenda. Several of its provisions are considered for revision, including
the extension of its scope to senior secondary education. Box 2 summarizes key provision of the UBE
Act.

Box 2: The key provisions of the UBE Act 2004

34While mandating "every government", i.e. each of the three tiers of government to "provide free, compulsory
and universal education to every child", it only grants the federal government the subsidiary role of “assistance
to the States and local Governments in Nigeria for the purposes of uniform and qualitative (sic) basic education
throughout” the country.

                                                                                                              17
The UBE Act of 2004 makes basic education compulsory and free for all school-age children, delineated the
roles of the three tiers of government and establishes executive agencies in charge of policy implementation
at each level, federal, state and local and earmarks a minimum level of public resources to basic education.

     1.   The services provided in public primary and junior secondary schools shall be free of charge. A
          person who receives or obtains any fee contrary to the provisions of the Act commits an offence and
          is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding N10,000.00 or imprisonment for a term of three
          months or both.
     2.   Every Government in Nigeria (i.e. each tier of the Nigerian government, federal, state and local) shall
          provide free, compulsory and universal basic education for every child of primary and junior
          secondary school-age. The federal Government shall provide assistance to the States and Local
          Governments in Nigeria for the purpose of uniform and qualitative (sic) basic education throughout
          Nigeria.
     3.   The implementation of Universal Basic Education shall be financed from Federal government block
          grant of no less than 2 percent of its Consolidated Revenue Fund; funds or contributions in form of
          Federal guaranteed credits and; local and international donor grants.
     4.   A Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) is established at federal level to formulate the policy
          guidelines for the successful operation of the universal basic education program in the Federation;
          receive block grant from the Federal Government which it allocates to the States and Local
          Governments and other relevant agencies implementing the Universal Basic Education in accordance
          with an approved formula; prescribe the minimum standards for basic education, etc.
     5.   Transition from Primary to Junior Secondary School (JSS) should be automatic (which entails the
          phasing out of examination at the end of primary).
     6.   Junior secondary schools should be separated (“disarticulated”) from Senior Secondary Schools.

In each state, a State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) is established, its structure and functions being
determined by state level legislation. In each Local Government area, a Local Government Education
Authority (LGEA) is established.

The UBE Act also mandates every parent to ensure that his/her child or ward attends and completes primary
and junior secondary education and punishes those who do not enroll or who withdraw their child/ward from
school with imprisonment on second conviction.



39.     Nigeria went through several policy reforms to improve service delivery outcomes in basic
education with limited and inconsistent implementation. For example, the Child Rights Act was
enacted in 2003 at the federal level to prohibit early marriage and promote enrollment of girls and it
was replicated by two thirds of Nigerian states (although few from northern states), but the UBE Act
of 2004 does not have any specific legal requirements for gender parity35. In addition, the UBEC does
not capture the provision of the private sector although the latter plays a significant role, particularly
in the southern states. Hence, the legal framework of basic education has not been aligned to ensure
effective policy implementation in various regards that warrant its revision as already recommended
by stakeholders, including the National Council on Education. It is devoid of any actionable
requirement on access, equity and quality of basic education and fails to provide the legal foundation

35The inadequacy of the policy and legal framework for gender parity in education reflects in the observation
that “most gender-based education initiatives on which information is publicly available fall under the purview
of donor-funded programs” (EDOREN, 2015).

                                                                                                                    18
for critical policy objectives summarized in the National Policy on Education of 2012 such as: (i) the
promotion of private investment in education: the National policy on Education "welcomes the
establishment [of private schools] provided the set minimum standards are met"; (ii) the integration of
religious education: "the integration of formal basic education curriculum into Qur'anic and Islamiya
schools"; (iii) the mitigation of regional disparity in access: "equitable access to educational
opportunities for all Nigerian in all parts of the country"; (iv) physical access to school facilities given
a policy objective that primary and junior secondary schools be "planned as neighborhood schools"; (v)
an adequate supply of teachers with a policy objective of a maximum teacher/student ratio of 1 for 35
in primary schools; (vi) quality of education with a state policy objective to "ensure the acquisition of
the appropriate levels of literacy, numeracy, communicative and life skills"; (vii) the "appropriate
devolution of educational functions and responsibilities to states [...] and local governments"; (ix) the
institutionalization of the participation of communities "in the administration and management of their
schools," through School Based SBMC; and (x) teachers’ qualification and professional development.



Institutional framework

40.      The institutional framework of basic education has been designed to achieve a number of
critical objectives for effective policy implementation but its effectiveness has proved limited in critical
dimensions, including accountability for results. Its objectives are to: 1) institutionalize the separation
of policy making vested with line ministries from policy implementation vested with executive
agencies; 2) structure horizontal and vertical intergovernmental coordination and policy
harmonization and; 3) ensure the representation and participation of stakeholders in policy
implementation across the three tiers of Nigerian government. But it has failed to: 1) ensure the
accountability and oversight of established executive agencies (UBEC and SUBEBs); 2) tally the
functions of established executive agencies with the whole array of stated policy objectives including
the oversight of private schools; and 3) effectively involve local governments with policy
implementation.



At federal level

41.     At the federal level, two institutions play the most critical role: the National Council on
Education, the body that coordinates policy making among the different tiers of government, and
UBEC, an executive agency of the federal government for policy implementation. This institutional
framework reflects the subsidiary/supportive role of the federal government in basic education and
ensures intergovernmental coordination (within Nigeria) in policy making through participative
decision making. But it does not provide the federal government the institutional capacity to effectively
deliver “assistance to the States and Local governments in Nigeria for the purposes of uniform and
qualitative basic education throughout Nigeria” as per its legal mandate under the UBE Act.




                                                                                                         19
The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC)

42.     Since UBEC board members are appointed for four years by the President upon
recommendation from the Minister of Education, and represent various stakeholders (the federal
ministry of Education, the teachers’ union, PTA, women groups), its accountability to the federal
ministry of Education is inevitably problematic, if only because the funds it is managing are earmarked
and routed outside of the budget of the Ministry of Education. In effect, although the UBEC chairman
seems essentially accountable to the President and the government as a whole (the federal executive
council), the agency seems hardly accountable at all if only for the lack of any performance assessment
and management framework, including reporting on results (i.e. on the outputs of the transformation
fund which is its main lever). The separation between policy making and policy implementation results
in inevitable challenges in the relationship between the principal (the ministry of education) and its
agent and calls for an institutional mechanism to frame their relationship, such as a performance
agreement, and the clarification of UBEC’s mandate to address existing conflicts of jurisdiction with
the ministry or gaps in their respective jurisdiction.36



The National Council on Education (NCE)

43.      In policy making the National Council on Education, was established to ensure horizontal and
vertical policy harmonization country-wide. The NCE gathers more than 1200 stakeholders including
the Federal Minister of Education and all state level Commissioners of Education under the
chairmanship of the Federal Minister of Education. It is supported by a Joint Consultative Committee
on Education (JCCE) at the administrative level which prepares the Council’s deliberations. It plays an
important role for the effectiveness of the basic education policy across the country as a collegial
decision making body. Its decisions are taken by consensus (after an elaborate and multi-layered
screening process) and its executive secretariat monitors compliance by state governments through the
NEMIS. The NCE decides on the national curriculum and has been instrumental in the
institutionalization across the states of SBMC. However, although the secretariat of the NCE monitors
the enforcement of its decisions across the states, its effectiveness in ensuring consistency in policy
implementation across the states is limited. This is a function that should be developed further since
the collegial decisions of the NCE, as an intergovernmental organization, are probably more acceptable
to state governments than those of the federal government or federal institutions, which can be
resented as intrusive into state government jurisdiction (see Annex A Figure A 10 for sample
recommendations and decisions of the NCE).



At state level

44.    The separation of the line ministry in charge of policy making and an executive agency in
charge of policy implementation at federal level, has been replicated across the states, entailing the


36Interview, Director Planning, Statistics and Research, Federal Ministry of Education, May 2015 “A case study
of principal–agent dilemma: the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC)”

                                                                                                           20
same set of challenges. In every state, the state legislature has established a State Universal Basic
Education Board (SUBEB) and determined its structure and functions in accordance with the national
legal framework37. Since SUBEB board members are appointed by the Governor, even though their
appointment is to be confirmed by the state legislature, the relationship between SUBEB and the State
Ministry of Education is also often problematic. In some states, the issue has been addressed by
appointing the same official as commissioner for education and chairman of SUBEB. But in most cases,
the SUBEB chairman is essentially accountable to the Governor and sidelines or overshadows the State
Commissioner of Education.38 This is a typical case of the agent superseding its principal.



At local level

45.      Within the states, basic education is deconcentrated (i.e. devolved to local administrative units
and staff) but not effectively decentralized (i.e. devolved to local governments). At the local
government level, the governance framework of basic education rests in principle on participatory
school-level management and school supervision by the state government through local administrative
units (LGEAs). But local governments are not part of the institutional framework under the stipulations
of the law and School-Based Management Committees (SBMCs) are not yet fully operational.



The deliberate marginalization of local governments

46.     Local governments do not play a more effective role in funding and managing primary
education than they do in any other policy area and the constitutional debate remains open about the
virtue of the principle of subsidiarity in primary education. Under the Constitution, local governments
are vested with the joint responsibility of primary education but the UBE Act transferred the role to
the States though the establishment of SUBEB and LGEA as stated above.



The devolution of school supervision to administrative units: the LGEA

47.     In Local Government Areas, basic education is in effect managed by Local Government
Education Authorities (LGEA), in which Local Government representatives are not statutorily invited
to participate and which are formally exclusively accountable to SUBEB and the state government
(LGEA secretaries being appointed by the governor). LGEAs are deconcentrated (not decentralized)

37 For example, although the procedure is similar in other states, in Edo state, for example, the law vests SUBEB
with the following responsibilities: the supervision of school management; basic education budget and
implementation planning; the “recruitment, appointment, promotion and discipline of teaching and non-
teaching staff” as well as their training, posting and deployment; the “assessment and funding of salaries and
allowances of teaching and non-teaching staff based on the existing salaries structure in the state”; disbursement
of funds to primary and junior secondary schools “in accordance with the guidelines approved by the ministry of
Education”; ensuring the equitable distribution of funds across schools by monitoring underlying school l evel
data; and financial auditing.
38 Interview with the Kogi state commissioner of Education, October 2014.



                                                                                                               21
administrative units that replicate the participatory membership of SUBEB. LGEAs are neither
accountable to the local government council nor to the state ministry of Education (they only liaise
with its field office). But although this administrative structure entails significant costs since LGEAs
employ close to 82 000 staff across the country (UBEC, 2012), it does not ensure effective oversight of
public schools and leaves unattended private ones. For example, Annex A, Figure A 11 presents the
institutional framework and its functionalities in the state of Katsina, which is very complex and
designed to provide effective oversight.



School management

48.     Despite inflated state bureaucracies in the administration of basic education, school
management oversight seems to focus more on compliance with procedures and fiduciary controls and
processes rather than on performance and learning outcomes. Officially, public schools are managed
by school principals for junior secondary and head teachers for primary, in collaboration with the
SBMCs and under the close supervision of LGEAs at local level, and at state level: SUBEB and the field
offices of the state ministry of Education. The disarticulation39 of junior secondary schools from
secondary schools mandated by the UBE Act has introduced a seemingly unsurmountable challenge to
the management of schools by scattering already scarce human and infrastructure resources and assets.
This has also created a non-uninform school management system. For example, in 2010, it was observed
that many states were yet to fully comply with the disarticulation directive, only a few states had fully
disarticulated, many states had haphazardly disarticulated and a few states had even decided to start
reintegrating, or rearticulating, junior and senior secondary schools. The NCE itself decided a reversal
of the “disarticulation” policy.40

49.     Although the federal and state governments are promoting the integration of qur’anic schools
into the national education system, their efforts do not seem commensurate to the need. Around 9
million students are enrolled in Qur’anic and Islamic schools - 5 million in the North-West, 3 million
in the North-East and over 1 million in the North-Central region (Annex A, Figure A 12). According
to the 2013 survey, about 45 percent of Islamic schools are following the National Basic Education
curriculum and half of them follow the curriculum established by the National board for Arabic and
Islamic education. Under the National Almajiri Education program launched in 2009 to cater to Muslim
nomadic children and mostly funded under the intervention fund managed by UBEC, Qur’anic and
Islamic schools are provided with infrastructure facilities as well as instructional material. School
management and supervision of schools funded under the program fall under the responsibility of the
State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) which employs school staff. The curriculum is aligned

39 “One of the strategies for implementation of Universal Basic Education (UBE) program in Nigeria is the
disarticulation of secondary schools, which entails the carving out of the three junior classes (JSS 1 to 3) in a
secondary school to form a separate and independent school and the remaining senior classes (SS 1 to 3) to form
another separate school. … National Executive Council of All Nigeria Conf erence of Principals of Secondary
Schools (ANCOPSS), held at Abeokuta, Ogun, in 2010, it was confirmed that since 2004 when UBE Act became
operational, many states were yet to fully comply with the disarticulation directive, few states had fully
disarticulated, many states had haphazardly disarticulated, while some states are yet to commence the process”

with the national basic education curriculum. But available funds are limited (to less than 3% of UBEC
intervention fund, i.e. around US$15 million in 2014) and only few schools (around 125) have been
built under the program. According to a recent survey, only few Islamic schools are granted public
funding (2.6%), with the exception of Sokoto (20%). Most of them are funded by school fees, 40 percent
by their proprietors and another 25 percent by religious institutions.41



Human resources management (HRM)

50.     In basic education, staff recruitment and deployment are managed at state level by SUBEBs and
by their local branches; and by LGEAs at local level. Most teachers are career civil servants; few are
contract teachers which tend to be mostly employed and paid by Parents/Teachers Associations at
school level. Recruitment and deployment are planned at state level based in principle on needs
assessments collected at local level from LGEAs.

51.      Despite having established teachers’ minimum qualification criteria in basic education at the
national level, a large proportion of recruited teachers are unqualified, especially in north-western and
north-eastern states42. In 2010, on average, 32 percent of teaching staff in pre-primary education were
unqualified, 40 percent in primary education and 15 percent in junior secondary education (Figure 3).
But these averages conceal wide variations across the states with northern states falling behind by a
wide margin—probably because of a shortage of supply of staff given the north’s comparatively higher
demographic pressure (e.g. higher growth in school enrollment) and demand for teachers. Intra-state
variations in the availability of qualified teachers are significant as well: for example, in Lagos, the
proportion of qualified teachers in primary education varies between 63 and 99 percent across local
areas43. But the concerns regarding the dearth of qualified candidates may be compounded by issues of
political patronage. In 2011, the National Council on Education called for the “phasing out of
unqualified teachers from the school system” but given the lack of clear understanding of underlying
factors for the recruitment of unqualified teachers, solutions are yet to be identified. However,
international experience offers useful guidance since shortages of qualified teachers is a common
occurrence, and some African countries have successfully been able to provide required qualification
and skills through in-service training44 to unqualified teachers as a short term solution. This is a policy
officially followed in Nigeria but it is not possible to assess its effectiveness given the lack of
information.

42 The minimum qualification required nationally, i.e. the National Certificate in Education (NCE), is demanding:
it is obtained after three years of schooling so that becoming a qualified teacher can be deemed to “require a
significant investment of time and money” (Reboot, 2013).

52.      Overall, demographic growth trends highlight the need for massive and rapid recruitment of
teachers. The demographic pressure is such that on average the number of teachers should increase by
nearly 10 percent a year (based on UBEC estimates) to cope with growth in student intake and stabilize
the student/teacher ratio which is fast deteriorating: e.g. between 2003 and 2013. UBEC forecasts of
the need for new teachers based on the observed rate of students’ enrollment as well as on the
student/teacher ratio benchmarks (35 STR in primary and 40 in junior secondary education) and the
retirement rate, reveal an increase in the need for teachers of 25 percent and 100 percent increase
between 2010 and 2015, in primary and junior secondary respectively (Figure 4). It is likely that this
demographic pressure is the main underlying reason for the persistent recruitment of unqualified
teachers, especially in the northern part of the country, but further investigation is needed to confirm
this assumption.

53.      The inadequacy of qualified teachers’ recruitment to cater to universal basic education goals is
reflected in the comparatively high student/qualified teacher ratio. Nigeria ranks among the countries
where the ratio of students per qualified differs the most from the ratio of students per teacher. In
primary education, the average STR among African countries, stood at 36 in 2010, whereas the ratio of
students per qualified teacher hovered at 60 in Nigeria, i.e. 66 percent higher than the average across
African countries, But the national average in Nigeria conceals wide regional variations; the
student/qualified teacher ratio varies from 28 in the northern state of Yobe to 94 in the south-western
state of Oyo (Figure 5). In certain states though, a significant proportion of teachers are significantly
more qualified than the minimum requirement: in Lagos state for instance, close to one-third of
teachers in primary education and over 60 percent of teachers in junior secondary have a masters degree
or a PhD.45

54.   Deployment of teachers in basic education is managed by SUBEB (based on needs assessment
by LGEAs) but this administrative (and supposedly planned) deployment system does not ensure

adequate deployment in rural areas or of female teachers. Teachers are reluctant to be deployed to rural
areas46 and wide disparities in the gender balance of teachers’ recruitment subsist across the states. The
underrepresentation of female teachers in the northern states could be key in explaining the gender
imbalance in girls’ enrollment.47 An equalization mechanism at the federal level does not exist to ensure
adequate student/teacher ratios across the states except for the Federal Teachers’ Scheme introduced in
2006 and under which several thousand qualified teachers have been hired by the federal government
and posted as teaching interns across the states for two years in the expectation that they be recruited
by state governments afterwards. The effectiveness of the scheme remains to be evaluated including by
assessing the proportion of interns hired as tenured teachers by state governments.

55.      Although qualified teachers are scarce, they are also heavily underutilized. According to a
survey on learning achievements conducted in 2011 by UBEC, the teaching load carried by the majority
[sic] (34.9%) of the teachers ranged between 11 and 20 lessons per week [i.e. between 8 and 11 hours].
Close to 25 percent of teachers “carried the lowest teaching load of between 1 and 10 lessons per week.
Although the average length of a lesson ranged from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, it was 40 minutes in
most of the schools. (…) 25.4 percent [of teachers also] indicated that they taught for between 15 and
30 weeks in a year (Figure 6). Increasing teacher utilization along the whole school year could help
mitigate the dearth of qualified teachers.

46 This is probably because teachers see assignment in rural schools as a punishment “as teachers in rural areas
often feel that both their schools and themselves have been forgotten [since] teachers in rural postings have been
known to be left there for far longer that their required five years”(Reboot, 2013).
47 For example, in primary education, the gender parity index varies from 0.1 in the northern state of Jigawa to

11.4 in the southern state of Anambra (with a national average of 0.89) whereas in junior secondary education, it
varies between 0.20 in the northern state of Sokoto to 4.6 in Anambra (with a national average of 0.96) (UBEC,
2012).

                                                                                                               26
Training and professional development

56.     Despite the high percentage of unqualified teachers at the start of their careers, teachers’
professional development options are very limited. Furthermore, newly recruited teachers are
employed and deployed to classrooms without adequate formal orientation. Mentoring by school
principals or senior teachers is not yet institutionalized. In general, Nigerian teachers are characterized
by low skills and low rates of computer literacy, albeit with significant variations across the states.
According to a UBE assessment of 2012, few states have introduced computer literacy programs for
teachers despite the recommendation of the National Council of Education.

57.      In-service training is a relatively common practice, although not evenly distributed, but its
effectiveness is uncertain due to the lack of teachers’ skills assessment. There are a number of training
institutions for teachers such as Colleges of Education (for NCE holders) and University
Faculties/Institutes of Education (for graduate teachers). These institutions have responded to the lack
of qualified applicants by admitting candidates who do not qualify in theory, as it is the case of Colleges
of education that admit non-NCE holders through a pre-NCE program. The National Teachers’
Institute also provides distance learning for the NCE, post-graduate Diplomas in Education, and
advanced diplomas in Guidance and Counseling, School Supervision, and Early Childhood Education.
However, all recent assessments and studies (including Federal Ministry of Education, 2012, UBEC,
2013, and Reboot, 2013) revealed that such efforts are weak and ineffective.

58.     Career advancement for Nigerian teachers does not incentivize professional development.
Teachers’ career advancement is ruled by a civil services servant promotion system, which is essentially
based on seniority (with a standard promotion schedule of three to four years from one level to the
next) with hardly any consideration of performance evaluation based on the individual Annual
Performance Evaluation Report.48 However, many teachers in Nigeria obtain advanced degrees, despite
the lack of incentives to do so, both out of a sense of personal accomplishment and to expand their
opportunities in pursuing other careers. But the major issue affecting teacher professional development
is the mismatch between teaching qualifications and teacher skills and competencies.49 In order to
bridge that gap a few states have introduced a teachers competency assessment framework but the use
of competency tests as a management tool has proved politically challenging and it would require keen
commitment and willingness from leaders.



Teachers’ teaching effectiveness

59.    Working conditions, such as the quality of school facilities and the availability of instructional
materials, inevitably affect teaching performance. Although the regular payment of teachers’ salaries
has been secured in basic education, two major hurdles to the effectiveness of teaching remain
unresolved in basic education: the inadequacy of school facilities and the lack of instructional materials.
The inadequacy of school facilities is reflected in the exceptionally high student/classroom ratio in


48 Annual Performance Evaluation Report is neither part of the teacher’s promotion formula nor does it include
sanctions for low performance or rewards for good performance (Reboot, 2013).

junior secondary education. Classroom overcrowding is such that it should be deemed a major
impediment to teaching effectiveness and a probable cause of teachers’ resentment for their working
conditions. Teachers are also faced with other significant challenges such as the lack of adequate
instructional material. For example, the UBEC 2013 survey shows that about 28 percent of teachers
complain about lack of appropriate textbooks or of other instructional material followed by 16 percent
who decry the inadequacy of classrooms and furniture.

60.     Teachers’ wage and allowance structure (teachers’ salary allowance amounts to 27.5% of their
base salary) is fixed at the federal level and applied by state governments to the extent allowed by their
budget resources. The wage scale allows for significant wage increases along a teacher’s career with
senior teachers earning five times as much as the entry level salary (Figure 7). Although most teachers
express dissatisfaction about their remuneration, they enjoy the security of a tenured job which is a
rare privilege in Nigeria and their salary is on average at par with that of other state employees at
comparable grade.50

Social accountability and mobilization

Social demand for education

61.     There is a remarkably high level of popular demand for education in Nigeria. But the demand
remains in part unmet since only 15 percent of respondents (between 10% and 17% across geo-political
zones) thought that the issue had been adequately addressed by elected officials. According to a recent

50   Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2005, Bruns, 2011.

                                                                                                             28
poll, on the eve of the March 2015 national election, two thirds of respondents mentioned education
as “the most pressing national issue politicians should focus on addressing,” a far higher proportion than
any other issue (Annex A, Figure A 13). Notably, this proportion was significantly higher in Northern
states than in the South. Unmet expectations in this regard may have impacted voting behavior. In any
event, such high level of demand for education is a potent lever for education reforms, which the UBE
Act aims at mobilizing for school improvement.



Institutionalization of social accountability

62.      The institutional framework for basic education makes space for civil society participation at
each tier of government. At the federal level, representatives of the National PTA of Nigeria and of
Women Groups or societies are among the board members of UBEC. At the state level, representatives
of Parents/Teachers Associations and of women groups are statutorily members of each SUBEB, with a
Director of Social Mobilization to promote and oversee the establishment and functioning of SBMCs.
At the local level, a representative of a women’s group and of local PTA as well as traditional rulers or
district heads are statutorily part of LGEAs. At the school level, the representation of local communities
is also institutionalized thanks to the establishment of SBMCs and PTA.

63.      In 2005, the National Council of Education decided that a SBMC should be established in every
primary and secondary school across the country; since then the agenda has been supported by UBEC
and the federal Ministry of Education. In 2011, UBEC issued guidelines to frame the organization, role
and activities of the SBMCs. Subsequently, most states issued policy and guidelines with UBEC and
donor support, including from DFID under the ESSPIN program. As of 2012 the federal ministry of
Education estimated that SBMCs were functional in only 40 percent of primary schools. In 2013, the
National Council of Education pursued its policy thrust by mandating the Federal Ministry of
Education and state governments to “direct Head-Teachers and Principals to constitute functional
School-Based Management Committees (SBMC) in their schools.” Since then, UBEC has provided
guidance and financial and logistical support to ensure the mainstreaming of SBMCs across the country.
It has revised its guidelines for the development of SBMCs to allow for flexible implementation at state
level and provides training to state officials, including SUBEB directors of social mobilization. The
FMOE is also preparing a policy framework on school-based management.

64.     SBMCs are the main institutionalized social accountability mechanism in basic education at
school level. As such they supersede PTA with which they still co-exist and compete to some extent,
especially regarding the mobilization of financial resources from the community. Long before the
establishment of SBMCs, PTAs were created and structured in a National association (National
Association of PTAs, NAPTA), and had the monopoly of the representation of beneficiaries in the
school system along with the role of raising financial resources from school communities. When
established, SBMCs often seem to reflect strong mobilization of parents and communities despite their
limited effectiveness on school management and improvement.

Functions and effectiveness of School Based Management Committees (SBMCs)

65.     Even though SBMCs have arguably generated a significant level of community mobilization,
they only have a limited and incipient leverage on school management and education outcomes so far
and need to be further operationalized. Where they are functioning, SBMCs prove to be an effective
opportunity for enhanced women’s participation as well as for the participation of school children.
They also prove instrumental in raising the awareness of the community and community leaders about
basic education with tangible results. SBMCs are addressing social exclusion and children welfare to
promote student enrollment and attendance. They also exercise social control over teachers’ discipline.
Nevertheless, the recent study by DFID calls for close monitoring by highlighting two concerns: (i) a
risk that SBMCs might become elitist and exclusive institutions, which only represent the voice of the
few, and (ii) for inevitable confrontation with the asymmetry of social capital between local
communities and teachers which is a generic challenge in developing countries for effective social
accountability, especially in rural and poor environments. In order to effectively exercise their
responsibility, SBMCs have yet to be provided with simple monitoring tools to allow them to convey
their feedbacks in a standardized manner so as to allow for statistical aggregation and benchmarking.
Simple templates for monitoring teachers’ and students’ attendance are being elaborated and piloted
under donor support with the expectation that SBMC reporting will be publicly disclosed on the state
government open data portal.51

66.     The institutionalization of SBMCs introduces an inevitable tension with the conventional and
bureaucratic mode of management of public schools and can only be effective if other accountability
mechanisms are also strengthened and effectively mobilized. For instance, effective monitoring of
teachers’ attendance by SBMCs requires that delinquent teachers be sanctioned by the school
management; revenue mobilization within the community cannot substitute for public funding; school
development planning would remain meaningless without adequate funding; and oversight of
education outcomes (such as learning achievements) calls for a robust quality assurance framework
including by LGEAs and school inspectorates. But on the other hand, SBMCs can potentially help
strengthen top-down accountability mechanisms, including fiduciary controls on funds use and supply
and maintenance of school facilities, teacher discipline, etc. Feedback from SBMCs can help state
authorities corroborate administrative data and better plan: investment (build additional classrooms,
rehabilitate existing ones, provide water, electricity or toilet facilities, etc.), personnel deployment
(when the ratio of students per teachers exceeds the norm) and professional development and other
kinds of school improvement (security, waste collection, etc.). International experience, however,
proves that participatory school based management is not a recipe for immediate results but takes years
to deliver on the promise of school improvement and even longer to result in higher learning
achievements (Box 3 shows a comparison of Nigeria SBMCs functions with other international
experiences).52


51 World Bank., 2015(a)
52 Recommendations from a recent DFID study also reinforce close monitoring of SBMCs “ To be successful,
SBMCs would have to overcome two significant political economy challenges for the effectiveness of social
accountability mechanisms: 1) teachers’ accountability to students and parents needs to be supported by strong
upstream accountability as shows the fact that in most African countries only a small proportion of absenteeism
is categorized as non-authorized; 2) decentralization and social accountability mechanisms can remain ineffective

Quality assurance, monitoring and evaluation (M&E)

Quality assurance

67.     Quality assurance in Nigeria exemplifies the lack of functional integration of the institutional
framework of basic education. Sound quality assurance requires coordinated exercises by a broad range
of public institutions, line ministries (through their inspectorate) and executive agencies (UBECs,
SUBEBs and LGEAs). For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) sketched
a map for quality assurance in basic education as part of the Education sector mapping study
conducted in 2013, based on six selected states and a number of key challenges.53 It explored the
following elements of the quality assurance system: monitoring, enforcement and compliance of
quality standards (sector inputs); evaluation of performance of learner and teachers (sector
outcomes); project implementation monitoring (infrastructure projects); and financial audit
processes. To improve the quality assurance efforts and for better coordination in basic education,
UBEC has effectively taken over quality assurance from the Federal Ministry of Education in 2012.
Coordination, however, seemed to be harder as there is little joint data collection efforts between UBEC
and LGEAs at local level or SUBEBs at state level, nor does UBEC appropriately communicate its
findings with the LGEAs and SUBEBs or SBMCs. In addition, the UBEC quality assurance report
focused only on policy making instead of covering a range of critical quality assurance dimensions.



M&E institutional framework

68.      M&E is a shared responsibility of the federal and state governments. Under the UBE Act, UBEC
is vested with the responsibility of monitoring “federal inputs into the implementation of basic
education” and report through the Minister of Education to the President on progress on the
implementation of UBE. It is mandated to carry out “a personal audit of teaching and non -teaching
staff of all basic education institutions in Nigeria” and “establish a basic education data bank and
conduct research on basic education in Nigeria.” At the state level, the same M&E functions are vested
with SUBEB and at local level with LGEAs as well as SBMCs at school level. State ministries of
Education also monitor school and teacher performance through their inspectorate. However although,
the NEMIS is decentralized at state level and assigns to state governments the responsibility of data
collection to inform the national school census, due to lack of funding, capacity and adequate planning,
UBEC has not been able to conduct any national school census since 2010 as it is supposed to do every
three years. The updating of the national school census also seems to be hindered by conflicting views
on its scope and methodology between UBEC and the FMOE which aims at capturing all school
facilities including unregistered ones to better assess the number of out-of-school children.54

69.   Also, the limited tracking survey of the MDGs, led by the Special Assistant to the President for
the MDGs, shows a wide margin of inconsistency with the National Demographic and Health Survey

53 The scope was further refined to focus only on the four subsector service areas of curriculum delivery, teacher
management, quality assurance, and infrastructure and capital investment based on sample surveys from Katsina,
Gobme, Nasarawa, Ekiti, Imo and Cross River (USAID, 2014)

(NDHS). The Nigerian government performance assessment, conducted by the National Planning
Commission, has also been interrupted since 2012 until the validity of data provided by line
departments and parastatals is ascertained, given the level of perceived inaccuracies by the government
itself.55

70.     Although a wealth of information is gathered by public authorities on basic education, M&E
systems in Nigeria suffer from four major shortcomings that prevent them from adequately informing
policy making and dialogue: 1) lack of adequate funding and institutional capacity for a functional
NEMIS; 2) the poor quality of administrative data; 3) collected information does not cover the whole
result/delivery chain and 4) information disclosure remains narrowly limited. This calls for the
collection of better quality data so that adequate evidence can be provided to policy makers.

71.      There is no validated consolidated information on public expenditure allocated to and
effectively spent on basic education in Nigeria, which prevents an informed evaluation of financial
resource mobilization. Information previously provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria is based on a
survey and not on the consolidation of certified budget execution reports (CBN, 2013). Consolidated
budget information would require the harmonization of charts of accounts used across levels of
government, the functional reclassification of budget expenditure and systematic and audited reporting
on budget execution. For lack of such standardized budget information, it is practically impossible to
assess the effectiveness of financial resources allocation in basic education.

72.     On human resources mobilization, UBECs, SUBEBs and LGEAs are legally mandated to
conduct personnel audits of teaching and non-teaching staff in basic education. The last national audit
dates back to 2010 by UBEC. It provides limited information on the workforce: head counts, seniority,
gender and spatial (urban/rural) distribution, teachers’ qualifications (including computer literacy),
distribution between teaching and non-teaching staff at school level (close to 11% of the total
workforce in basic education was non-teaching). The audit covers only public schools, and it does not
collect enough information to adequately assess teachers’ performance, drawing, therefore, only
limited recommendations for Human Resource management. Although it concludes that “the morale
amongst teachers in many schools is low due to the basic conditions of service such as the work
environment, and low salaries, lack of regular promotions, etc.,” it does not provide information on
some of these critical parameters (such as salary and promotion).

73.     The national school census, which is supposed to be conducted under the NEMIS, should
provide additional information (disaggregated at Local Government Area level) including on the
proportion of teachers on long leave of absence (maternity, sick leave, training). But it will still not
collect critical information in a number of areas, including, teachers’ performance such as teachers’
absenteeism or the availability of teaching resources and teachers’ working conditions—issues which
weigh heavily on educational (learning) outcomes, and even though surveys highlight the magnitude
of challenges to be addressed on these dimensions and the need that they be adequately captured for
effective monitoring of the delivery of basic education.56 Only consolidation of information gathered
through school inspection and supervision, including on teachers’ effective attendance, could allow the
NEMIS to effectively capture the whole range of critical input, output and outcome indicators,

students pass after grade 12, i.e. at least four years after moving on from basic education. Systematic
assessment of students’ literacy and numeracy is also missing and donors are piloting third party
(“citizen-led”) assessments of students’ basic learning skills under the Annual Status of Education
Report (ASER) methodology used in other African countries to substitute for the lack of official
information.

75.     Donors conducted a wealth of surveys to assess the effectiveness of their interventions in basic
education (in particular under the ESSPIN program) and introduced third party monitoring of students’
learning skills under the Every Nigerian Child Project. Once the school-level monitoring function of
SBMCs is fully operationalized, it could potentially provide a wealth of at least partly independently
gathered information on a wide array of input and output indicators pertaining to school performance.

V. Overview of education finance and framework of finance in basic education

76.      The education sector in Nigeria is managed concurrently by the three tiers of public
administration: federal, state and local government, as prescribed under the 1999 constitution57. As
such, all levels of government have legislative jurisdiction and corresponding functional responsibilities
with respect to the provision of education, although the division of responsibilities has not always been
clearly laid out. The federal or state governments have sole responsibilities in some areas, although, for
the most part, responsibilities are shared by the three levels of government58. Thus, no single tier of
government has an absolute responsibility for any education sub-sector; rather there are varying
degrees of overlap. Both the federal and the state governments finance and manage their own tertiary
institutions: universities, polytechnics and teacher training colleges. At the secondary level, there are
Federal Government Colleges, spread across the 36 states (about 104 as of 2013). All other public
secondary schools are managed and financed by state governments, through the state ministries of
education.

77.      The management of the primary level of education has gone through several phases over the
years. Given that primary education is a key policy area, the federal government has been directly or
indirectly intervening in the management and financial responsibilities of the sub-sector. There have
been continual changes to the management framework ever since 1993, with the aim of strengthening
basic education provision, but unfortunately the country has been unable to find a suitable system that
satisfies the constitutional mandate and produces the desired outcome of the basic education. In fact,
there is no formal or consistent budget framework for basic education and as such, the formal budget
planning, preparation, allocation and execution process does not apply to the sector. With this in mind,
the main objective of this section is to lay out how basic education is financed in the absence of a formal
budget framework and provide an estimate for the whole sector as well as the basic education sub-
sector. This section also provides the necessary background to understand how the current financing
structure affects equity, efficiency, affordability, and quality –– analyses of each of these issues are
explored in the next chapter. This section attempts to answer the following questions:

        a.   How much does Nigeria spend on education and how does it compare to other countries?
        b.   Who is responsible for the financing of basic education and how has this structure evolved?
        c.   What are the sources of public finance for basic education?
        d.   What are the implications of the UBE Act of 2004 on the LGA’s budget?
        e.   What are the variations in public spending on education by state?




57There have been several constitutions in Nigeria since independence in 1960, including one in 1993 which was
not fully enacted and is therefore not referred to. The 1999 Constitution is still in effect today.
58Orbach, 2003.
Overview of education sector finance in Nigeria

78.       The public education finance system in Nigeria is characterized by an amalgam of concurrent
and autonomous responsibilities shared across the federal, state and local governments, as laid out
under the constitution and the relevant legislative framework. The overlap in the major financial
responsibility between the three tiers of government (federal, state and local) makes it difficult to
estimate the total amount of public expenditure and assess its impact on education sector outcomes.
The lack of information on education expenditure both at the national level and for the individual
states has several other implications. For instance, there is little basis on which to assess issues such as:
(i) whether the financial effort in this sector has been increasing or decreasing in terms of real
expenditures or as a share of public expenditures or even as a share of national income; (ii) the level
and importance of vertical and horizontal imbalances in public spending and how they affect the
education sector, and the levels of efficiency and equity of public expenditures in the sector which
would provide a quantitative basis for arguments in favor of expanding or re-allocating expenditures;
(iii) the future public expenditure requirements, at the national level or by state, based on enrollment
pressures in the system; (iv) unit costs of each level of education across states or of different levels
within states; (v) the household education expenditures at both public and private educational
institutions, and the reliance on these at different levels of education and in different states. Finally, it
is not possible to compare the levels and patterns of education expenditures in Nigeria with those in
other countries. This section attempts to provide answers to some of these questions using a mix of
household surveys and administrative data.

79.      40 percent of the education sector in the Nigeria is funded by private households’ out of pocket
contributions while local government constitutes the second highest share (25 percent). Figure 8
presents the sources of finance by origin. State and local governments enjoy a considerable degree of
political and fiscal autonomy. State governments run separate fiscal and budgetary systems,
independent of the federal funds. Although they receive significant funding from the Federation
Account, state and local governments are not required to inform or seek approval from the federal
government on their budget, fiscal performance, or allocation of resources in line with their spending
priorities. No national framework encompasses budgets at all tiers. No statutory accountability
mechanisms ensure proper coordination of state plans and fiscal arrangements to achieve national goals
in any sector (World Bank 2003). With respect to budget reporting arrangements, each government
carries out its own reporting with no coordination, standards for reporting on plans and performance,
or reporting to the federal government. Overall, in 2013, the total cost of the education sector (all levels
of education) in Nigeria amounted to 2,329.4 billion Naira (14.6 billion USD). The breakdown of the
education sector finance was as follows: federal government (18 percent), state government (13
percent), LGA (25 percent), household out-of-pocket payment (40 percent), UBEC initiative (3
percent), and donors: the remaining 0.4 percent.

80.    Although the burden of management of the education sector has gradually shifted away from
the LGA, the largest part of public sector finance is still supported by the LGA budget. The LGA is
technically responsible for salary payments of basic education teachers and the high spending share of
LGAs is mainly due to the high share of teachers mapped to basic schools; for example in 2012, more
than 85 percent of general education teachers were assigned to basic schools. Moreover about 80
percent of education spending in Nigeria is recurrent (79 percent in 2012 and 80 percent in 2013) and
about 90 of the recurrent spending is channeled to personnel costs.

81.     Total public spending in education increased in absolute terms between 2009 and 2013,
especially at the state and LGA levels, but has stagnated as a share of GDP. Figure 9 shows trends in
spending by the three tiers of government and UBEC (panel a) and total education spending as a
percentage of GDP and as a share of total public spending (panel b). Although trends in education
funding from all sources are increasing in absolute terms, it has not been increasing as share of GDP—
the latter has hovered around 1.7 percent for the past 4 years. In parallel, the share of education
spending as a share of total spending marginally increased from 10.2 percent to 12.5 percent over the
2009-2013 period. This stagnation in terms of share of GDP and total public spending reflects, to a large
degree, the lack of prioritization of human capital development in Nigeria, despite favorable
macroeconomic conditions. This lack of prioritization has contributed to some degree to the
propagation of conflicts, decline in educational performances and growth in inequalities.

82.      International comparison shows that Nigeria’s spending on education as a share of GDP, is
much lower than the SSA average and below the recommended levels. Figure 10 shows the public
education expenditure as a share of GDP and as a share of total public expenditure for 41 SSA countries.
With education spending equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP, Nigeria is the fourth lowest among 41 SSA
countries59, and its spending is lower than the benchmark target set in the GPE’s Education Sector Plan
2010-20, lower than the GPE recommendation of 4.1 percent and lower than the SSA average of 4.6
percent. As indicated earlier, public education expenditures as a share of total expenditures is 12.5
percent, which is also below the comparison countries as well as the SSA average of 17 percent. Again
this figure is much below GPE’s recommended good practice benchmark for developing countries,
which was set at 20 percent of total public spending. Given the lags identified in the education sector
performance earlier in this report, it clearly demonstrates that the budget allocation for the education
sector is insufficient to truly reform the education sector and meet the country’s human capital needs.

Framework of basic education finance

83.     Strategic channeling of public funds to the education sector is a key component in addressing
the sector issues outlined above. As described earlier, the government has passed several legislative
reforms focusing on improving basic education outcomes. For example, since the establishment of the
concurrent and exclusive responsibilities regarding the administration and financing of the education
sector in 1979, basic education has undergone six subsequent policy changes regarding the financial
management of the sub-sector. Figure 11 summarizes, in the form of a timeline, the key decrees and
other laws concerning the funding and management of primary education, including the latest
developments in the disarticulation and re-articulation of the junior secondary system. Most of the
changes before 2004 that is before the UBE Act, tend to apply to primary education, particular primary
teachers’ salaries, while the concept of basic education is discussed in the two most recent changes. The
following are key observations:

               i.         Public basic education financing depends mostly on federal funds although management
                          responsibilities are shared between the state, federal, and LGA tiers of government. The
                          preponderant federal role is clear when one considers that salaries usually account for more
                          than 80 percent of total spending in the sub-sector, and that salary payment is sourced direct
                          through statutory transfers from the federal government to the LGA accounts. The following
                          section provides a detailed analysis and breakdown by state of how federal resources finance
                          basic education.

                                                                                                                        40
     ii. The issue of basic education management is still not resolved. The UBE Act of 2004 calls for the
          disarticulation of junior secondary from senior secondary schools, one of the Act’s key
          mandates and a main reason for the creation of the UBE Commission. This process is creating
          tension and confusion, in part because the UBE law has been ratified in each state with
          modifications, which means that the implementation of the policy is not uniform across the
          states. Some states have chosen to physically combine their primary and junior secondary
          schools by building onto existing primary schools, while others have not. However, although
          no legislation has been passed, the re-articulation process is under way in some states for those
          who already initiated disarticulations. It should be noted that some states did not commerce
          the process at all.60 While the key benefits of the disarticulation were clearly defined from the
          policy prospective, the financial implications of carrying out this process is one of the key
          reasons for the failure of its implementation. In particular, the fact that the UBEC matching
          fund is specifically tied to each education level according to a specific allocation formula (5%
          to ECD, 60% to primary and 30% of junior secondary), has created confusion in the financial
          management of the fund flow to junior secondary education. Unfortunately, as the
          disarticulation and re-articulation process takes place state by state and within states: school by
          school, or LGA by LGA, it is impossible to estimate the number of disarticulated or re-
          articulated states. There are also other obstacles to the re-articulation process in some states.
          For example, Edo has already created a separate ministry for basic education. All this means
          that the re-articulation process is posing a challenge and contributes to the lack of a uniform
          basic education management system in Nigeria.
     iii. The fact that the UBE law has not been fully implemented, and therefore is not effective,
          including in its free education mandate, has placed an unfair onus on parents who are still
          expected to enforce the UBE requirements on their end. Hence, the concept of free and
          compulsory basic education is in fact not a reality.




60 “One of the strategies for implementation of Universal Basic Education (UBE) program in Nigeria is the
disarticulation of secondary schools, which entails the carving out of the three junior classes (JSS 1 to 3) in a
secondary school to form a separate and independent school and the remaining senior classes (SS 1 to 3) to form
another separate school. … National Executive Council of All Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary
Schools (ANCOPSS), held at Abeokuta, Ogun, in 2010, it was confirmed that since 2004 when UBE Act became
operational, many states were yet to fully comply with the disarticulation directive, few states had fully
disarticulated, many states had haphazardly disarticulated, while some states are yet to commence the process”

 *: There was a consensus of the on re-articulation but no law passed to enact it


84.      As described earlier, financing of the education sector in Nigeria is unconventional in many
ways. Figure 12 shows the structure of basic education financing since the enactment of the 2004 UBE
Act. The law preserves the constitutional responsibility of states and local governments in Nigeria to
provide basic education and expands the federal government’s responsibility in ensuring it is free and
compulsory. The proceeds of the Federation Account are shared among the federal, state, and local
governments, in accordance with a revenue-sharing formula and the funding is tracked from the source
to the service delivery point. The current formula for dividing up total revenues to government
allocates 52.68 percent to the federal government, 26.72 percent to state governments, and 20.6 percent
to local governments (Figure 13). The UBE Act was developed based on constitutional mandates, and
clearly demarked the financing sources of primary education between salary and non-salary, although,
as explained earlier, the management of some junior secondary institutions is still under the
responsibility of the states. However, the effectiveness of each policy action is entirely dependent on



                                                                                                                     42
adequate state level implementation. As a result, basic education management in Nigeria (at state level)
is divided into three major categories61:

     i.   Basic education under SUBEB management. In this category, all salaries are withheld at source
          from the LGA’s statutory allocation while non-salary expenditures are paid by the state and
          UBEC as part of the UBEC intervention fund. Under this category SUBEB has the full
          management authority over basic education institutions. Since salary is automatically paid at
          the source (based on the number of teachers SUBEB has identified on the payroll), salary
          budgeting is not part of the LGA budget process. The salaries do appear on the total LGA budget,
          which is based on actual withholding. This is how the UBE Act was envisioned, but, as stated
          above, very few states completed the disarticulation process leaving a much more complex
          structure behind.
     ii. Primary education fully under SUBEB with partial responsibilities in JSS. In this category,
          while the financing arrangement for primary education is similar to the arrangement above,
          the JSS responsibilities may vary where some JSS teachers are under Senior Secondary State
          Management Board (SSSMB) while others are paid by SUBEB. For example, within a secondary
          school with both JSS and SSS, the JSS teachers may be paid in part by SUBEB while the principal
          or other teachers may be under SSSMB administration. Or, as in the case in Kogi, the stand-
          alone JSS (referred to as UBE JSS) are under SUBEB management and therefore teachers are
          remunerated from SUBEB, whereas other non-UBE JSS junior secondary schools are still fully
          under state management and therefore paid by the state.
     iii. Primary education fully under SUBEB, with JSS fully under SSSMB. This category refers to
          states which never went through the disarticulation process (such as Lagos or Edo). In this
          category, primary education salaries are paid by SUBEB on behalf of the LGA and SSSMB pays
          junior secondary school salaries as part of the state secondary school. SUBEB is then fully
          responsible for non-salary payments on behalf of both UBEC and the state for the primary level.
          SUBEB also plays a supervisory role for the portion of UBEC funds that are supposed to go to
          JSS under secondary schools.

7-12. In 2012 they numbered in total 104 schools, located in various states. All of them are boarding schools and
admission is merit-based. United colleges are the only secondary schools exempted from disarticulations.

85.      Education finance depends to a large extent on federal revenues and the ability of the states to
finance education expenditures is directly linked to the availability of federal revenues. Figure 13 shows
a summary of the sources of revenue for the three tiers of government. Internally generated revenues
for LGAs stand at 1.6 percent while allocation from the state government to LGAs only represent about
0.7 percent of their total revenue. This implies that about 95.3 percent of the LGAs’ total revenue comes
from statutory allocations, excluding the grants and revenues from the stabilization fund which
accounts for the remaining 2.3 percent. Given that salaries are automatically deducted from the
statutory transfers at source, this implies that LGAs have, in reality, very little say in education finance,
and their role is more symbolic than anything else, given that there is no financial planning or
budgeting on their part for the basic education level. At the state level, internally generated revenue
(IGR) represents 19 percent of total revenues indicating some potential fiscal space for spending on
education based on IGR. In particular, given that the states are responsible for capital and non-salary
spending, states’ ability to generate more revenue may suggest variations in resource availability across
states for basic education spending. It is also noteworthy that, compared to the pre-UBE Act-period,
where overhead costs of primary education were covered by the LGA, the new arrangement has shifted
the non-salary burden entirely to the state level. However, as the disarticulation process progresses,
and the LGAs take on a greater share of the JSS salaries, this will create an increasing burden on LGAs

                                                                                                              44
resources. The net impact of the tradeoff between the reductions in overhead costs versus the addition
of the JSS salaries varies across LGAs and depends on the extent of the disarticulation as well as the
‘savings’ or the extent of the burden that has shifted to the states. Therefore, as explained above, basic
education as envisaged under the UBE Act heavily relies on federal resources, with limited
responsibility at the state level.

86.     Given that the vast majority of basic education salaries come from the federal allocation, which
in turn heavily depends on oil, factors that affect oil revenue also directly affect basic education finance.
The share of IGR varies greatly by state, and some tend to depend entirely on federal allocation due to
low IGR levels. Figure 14 shows (i) total revenue breakdown by IGR; (ii) revenue other than IGR; (iii)
the share of internally generated revenues out of total revenue; and (iv) the per capita allocation of
non-IGR. The figure shows that share of IGR revenue varies from a low of 1 percent in Benue state (2
% in Borne state) to a high of 41 percent in Lagos. Overall, only four states including Lagos have an
IGR share of revenue more than 15 percent of their total revenue—Rivers (22%), Ogun (21%) and
Kano (20%). Edo ranks a distant fifth with 14 percent. In addition to Lagos and Kano, five of the 9 Niger
Delta states have higher revenue. In general, revenues across states hover around 100 billion Naira,
except for the 6 states where it is substantially higher (Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Delta, Akwa-Ibom and
Bayelsa). However, since Nigeria has developed an allocation formula justified by rights enshrined in
the constitution such as the right of the Niger Delta states to receive 13 percent of oil revenue prior to
allocation; resource availability at the state level clearly depends not only on IGR but also on what is

being allocated from the federal level. In short, given that basic education funding relies heavily on
federal allocation, which in turn varies by states based on the resource allocation formula, the rest of
the analysis focuses on how such a financing structure affects basic education outcomes in terms of the
equity, efficiency, quality and affordability of basic education services delivery.

Basic education sector finance

87.      This section presents an estimate of the financing of the basic education sector in Nigeria. In
order to understand the political economy of finance in basic education and its influence on resource
allocation and mobilization, it is important to first determine how much is being spent on basic
education. Furthermore, given that resource allocation in Nigeria tends to be driven by political
considerations, identification of the financial needs by state would shed some light on the areas that
call for increased intervention or more efficient utilization of the existing resources. The estimate at
the state level would also help to analyze funding adequacy and affordability, given the fiscal
constraints of each state. However, despite being able to estimate the total spending on basic education
from all sources, the overlapping responsibilities arising from the disarticulation and re-articulation
process in basic education, and the concurrent spending by the three tiers of government on capital
spending, makes it difficult to fully capture total spending in basic education.

88.     In addition to the issues posed by the disarticulation and re-articulation process, there are other
discrepancies in the application of the legal framework regulating basic education that make it difficult
to estimate financing from its source. For example, salaries of the teaching and the non-teaching staff

                                                                                                              46
at government primary schools are the responsibility of LGAs as per the 1999 constitution, but this
responsibility was extended to basic education, which covers primary though junior secondary, as per
the UBE Act of 2004. However, in practice, the responsibilities vary by state. Some states split the
financial responsibility of salary payments of junior secondary schools between LGA and the state
government (for example, Kano and Kogi), while in other states, salaries are fully under state
responsibility (for example, Lagos and Edo). In addition to salary payments, LGAs also tend to dedicate
some funds to capital spending, albeit a relatively small contribution, (about 4 percent of LGA
education spending). The relatively small share of LGA contribution to capital spending is also
confirmed in a previous analysis by USAID62.

89.       Furthermore, some junior secondary schools are physically located in the state secondary
premises and, therefore, it is impossible to distinguish between state capital spending on junior
secondary and upper secondary schools separately. It should also be noted that the estimate of basic
education finance in this section is an underestimation due to the fact that some junior secondary levels
are still managed as part of the secondary schools. For example, enrollment in junior secondary consists
of 15 percent of total basic education. Being that non-salary spending for all junior secondary is
captured as part of the matching grant and UBEC interventions, the salary portion of junior secondary
not captured. In addition, since the primary education level accommodates the largest number of
children in basic education, for the purpose of analysis of equity, out-of-school incidence and quality,
this may underestimate the finance estimation but does not invalidate the finding.

90.     The main data sources for the estimation include: (i) CBN, which has Federal, State and LGA
level revenue, expenditure and a summary of key economic sector expenditure breakdown by capital
and recurrent spending including education sector surveyed in 2013, (ii) statutory allocations by state
from the Federation Account Allocation, (iii) household survey for state-level average teacher’s salary
estimates—2010/11 cross-sectional and panel survey for state level and 2012/13 panel survey for zone
and national levels, and (iv) UBEC funds. It is important to note that some funds that are not distributed
to each state (as there is no formula for this specific allocation) are directly executed by UBEC, but
since this share is very small compared to total education budget (about 0.4%), they have been omitted
from the calculations. In particular, these funds are meant for textbooks and UBEC executed special
interventions such as Girl and Boy child education, Madrasah, Almajiri, etc. Given that this is small in
size, we do not expect this to have any significant impact on the final distribution share, and (v) budget
data collected from the six focus states (Lagos, Kano, Edo, Kogi, Bauchi, and Anambra). In addition, we
also used some state budget data that was submitted by states participating in the first workshop held
during the first mission in October 2014, as per our request. There are two main assumptions used in
the estimation, which should be kept in mind in using the data: (i) we assumed states only contribute
to capital spending via the matching grant, and (ii) as stated earlier, given that in some states JSS is
managed and paid by the state government, the estimation includes only those schools under SUBEB
management.


62Nigeria Education Data Survey 2010. States and local governments tend to budget and implement small-scale
rehabilitation efforts. The SMOEs and SUBEBs provide maintenance and rehabilitation funds in their budgets for
JSS’s and primary schools respectively. In addition, the LGAs, as well as schools through their SMCs, mobilize
monetary and in-kind resources to improve facilities and structures, typically with a focus on improving the
safety or welfare of their learners (i.e., such as toilets, latrines or walls).

                                                                                                           47
91.      Overall, basic education receives about 48 percent (673 billion Naira in 2013) of spending from
the three tiers of government while this level accounts for 44 percent of total spending in education
from all sources (public, households and donors). Figure 15 shows the share of funds in basic education
from all sources. While households channel 38 percent of their total education spending to basic
education, the share of household contribution to total basic education spending stands at 34 percent.
Although the basic education sector in Nigeria is officially free, fee payments nonetheless make up
about 43 percent the total household spending at the basic education level. Despite the focus on free
basic education, schools still collect fees as part of the official enrollment requirement through indirect
collection channels. This issue, both in terms of accountability and its implication on access, is discussed
later in the report.

92.      The allocation of the basic education budget between capital and recurrent spending shows
large variations across states. Figure 16 shows total public spending (spending from all three tiers of
government) on basic education by state and the share of recurrent spending63. At the national level,
the share of recurrent spending stands at 84 percent while it ranges from a low of 70 percent in Zamfara
state to a high of 93 percent in Bauchi state. Some of the variation is due to idiosyncratic features within
the states. For example, the reason for the high share of recurrent costs in Bauchi state was captured
during a qualitative data collection workshop. Specifically, the high recurrent share is a result of the
state’s policy of accommodating and enrolling children from displaced populations from surrounding

63 Recurrent spending consists of LGA payment for salaries and other operating costs including UBEC
intervention fund on non-matching grant. The CBN reported to total personnel cost for LGA and personal staff
of LGA state level was estimated from Nigeria panel survey to distribute personnel costs to school personnel and
non-school personnel. In addition, wage rate estimated from the panel survey and GHS to account for earnings
difference between school staffs and non-school staffs. Similar capital sending was estimated based on matching
garnet from UBEC and state contributions as well as LGA contributions stated above which is about only 4% of
the LGA school budget. However, LGA contributions to capital spending is high for states with low spending on
personnel costs

states that have moved to Bauchi with their families seeking a more secure and stable environment.
Because of the transient nature of these students, and because of the limited visibility as to the
permanency of these students in the system, there has been resistance to expanding the capital budget,
even though recurrent spending has been adjusted to accommodate the influx of students.

93.     About a third of total capital spending at the national level comes from UBEC (4.6 percent out
of 13 percent of total education spending on capital investments), while the rest is associated with state
and LGA contributions (8 percent out of 13 percent respectively). This is particularly important in
some states where capital investment by LGAs and state governments’ is higher than the amount
received from UBEC’s matching grant fund. Overall, funds from UBE intervention accounts for about
11 percent of total basic education spending and 3 percent of total spending on education.

94.     As stated earlier, the following section will explore the impact of education finance in Nigeria
against the backdrop of the existing political economy, and will focus on three key aspect of education
performance, (i) equity, (ii) out-of-school incidence, and (iii) quality of education.




                                                                                                               49
VI. Key challenges for the basic education sector

95.     Disparities in access and low education quality are the two most salient education challenges
facing Nigeria. In particular, disparities in access across states are significant, and key learning outcomes
indicators are low. This raises concerns about the knowledge and skills acquisition of the current cohort
of students and the potential limitations this poses on their ability to thrive in the workforce. In
addition, there are millions of school-age children who remain out-of-school, most of them in the
northern zones. Left unaddressed, these issues can be expected to reinforce the zonal disparities that
already exist.

96.     This section investigates the key education sector challenges, and analyzes the issues across the
different social, economic and geographical groups to better understand the severity and particularities
of the challenges. It also assesses whether the current governance mechanism in basic education allows
the country to address the challenges or whether additional reforms will be required to overcome them.
In this section, we adopted a problem-driven approach to assess the implications of the education sector
governance and financing framework on (i) equity in access, with a special focus on out-of-school
children, and (ii) the quality of education at the basic education level. While most of the analysis is
data driven, the findings in each section are supported by qualitative analysis (see
97.    Annex E 1 for a summary of the approach as well as details on the qualitative data collection
instruments and methods employed).



Inequalities in access to basic education services

98.     To investigate the factors affecting equity in basic education, the following four areas are
explored: (i) a diagnosis of the current status of equity in basic education using primary and junior
secondary gross and net enrollment rates, and incidence of out-of-school children by geographical zone
and state, (ii) an analysis of the role of private sector provision in basic education and how it relates to
equity, (iii) an analysis of equity and efficiency of resource utilization (unit cost analysis) and the
affordability of schools, and finally (iv) an analysis of the role of the public sector in protecting equity
given the political economy of service delivery under dual federalism, where power is divided between
the federal and state governments— with a special focus on the UBE intervention. The analysis is
followed by policy recommendations. Given the high incidence of out–of-school children in Nigeria—
an estimated 13.2 million school-age children are not in school, the largest out-of-school population in
SSA—special focus is provided in the analysis on the root causes of the out-of-school incidence. In
particular, this includes (i) a detailed diagnosis of the topology of the out-of-school situation in the
basic education level by geographic zone, area of residence (urban/rural), gender, wealth quintile, (ii)
an in-depth analysis of qualitative and quantitative reasons for children being out-of-school, and (iii)
an estimation of the financial implications of accommodating out-of-school children into the education
system. The analysis is supported by quantitative analysis using several regression models and
qualitative information gathered from case studies from each of the six selected states, one from each
zone: Bauchi, Anambra, Kano, Lagos, Edo and Kogi. This section will answer the following questions:

                                                                                                          50
              What are the characteristics of children in school and those who are out-of-school, and
               how severe is the incidence of being out-of-school?
              Who provides basic education services and what is the role of the private sector?
              Is basic education affordable to the poor?
              What are supply and demand side factors that determine schooling decisions and
               participation?
              Is spending in the basic education sector adequate and equitable across states?
              Does public spending protect equity?
              How much would it cost to provide schooling opportunities to excluded groups?
              Does the political economy of Nigeria allow for the equitable distribution of resources
               within the current governance and accountability framework? Does it make it possible
               to address the out-of-school issue?
              Is Universal Basic Education achieving the intended goals? Why, or why not? What
               should the UBEC consider doing to achieve these goals?


Overview and update of access and equity

99.     While Nigeria faces multidimensional challenges in terms of inequality, the north-south divide
in access to basic education harbors the most pronounced disparity in the country. Figure 17 shows
primary and junior secondary gross enrollment rates (GER) (Annex B, Figure B1 shows a detailed
breakdown of both gross and net enrollment rates by state). The primary GER ranges from a low of 17
percent in Yobe to 133 percent in Bayelsa while the corresponding figures for the NER ranges from 12
percent in Yobe to 88 percent in Anambra. Figure 17 clearly illustrates that in terms of GER, the south
tends to fare much better than the north. It should be noted that although access to junior secondary
is expanding across the country, the gap between net and GER is still very high, reflecting the presence
of overage children particularly at junior secondary level, where, on average, the gap between gross
and NER is 45 percent compared with an average of 24 percentage points at the primary level. The
issue of overage children also varies between the north and south. At the primary level the south is
closing the gap between gross and NER while the gap in the north remains high reaching 45 percentage
points in Benue state. At the junior secondary level, the access rate is extremely low in the north both
in terms of gross and NER while the GER is high in the south. In terms of trends over time, the estimate
for net primary enrollment ratio shows the north has made significant progress although it remains
well below net enrollment rates in the south, where the rate has generally stagnated (Annex B, Figure
B1).

100.    An estimated 13.2 million basic education school-age children (age 6-14 years old) were out-
of-school in Nigeria in 2013—an increase of 3.3 million from the 2010 estimate—and the issue is
predominantly a northern phenomenon. Figure 18 shows trends of out-of-school children by
geographical zone. The result shows that the number of out-of-school children increased in the
northern part of the country mainly in North East and North West between 2010 and 2013. At the
same time the number of out-of-school children dropped significantly in the South South and South
West zones along with sizable drops in the South East and North Central Zones. From the total of 13.2
million out-of-school children, 12.6 million (95 percent), are located in the northern zone- clearly
indicating that the incidence of out-of-school children is predominantly an issue affecting northern
states.

101.     State level trend analysis of the out-of-school issue reveals an increase between 2010 and 2013
in 8 of the 13 North East and North West states and in only one state in the south. Annex B, Figure B2
presents trends for the out-of-school rate for children age 6-14 by state. It should be noted that the
term “out-of-school” is clearly defined as all children of the specified age group who do not attend any
type of schooling institution. In other words, if a child attends an informal private school or non-
integrated religious school, they are considered in school, therefore underlining that the estimate of
the out-of-school incidence is not an overestimation. In many states in the northern part of the country,
including Yobe, Sokoto, Kebbi and Borno, the incidence of out-of-school children stands at more than
50 percent. In Borno the rate is above 60 percent. The effects of conflicts in those parts of the country
on the out-of-school rate is investigated in the modeling section below using the ACLED64 conflict
database, and it is very clear that the conflicts played a role in increasing the incidence of out-of-school
children in some of the northern states. For example, in Yobe, the out-of-school rate was as high as 85
percent in 2013, reflecting the high impact of conflict in the area. Generally all states in the south
maintained an out-of-school rate below 10 percent with some of them very close to zero. Although the
impact of the conflicts is documented, it is also very important to understand the reasons beyond the
armed conflicts that may contribute to this strong north-south disparity among children. This implies
that Nigeria has an opportunity to reinforce north-south cooperation through the sharing of some of
the strategies developed and lessons learnt from the southern experience in order to address the out-
of-school issues in the north. The rest of this section will explore these questions.

102.    A closer look at the topology of out-of-school children reveals that about 9 out of 10 out-of-
school children have never attended school, or had any form of schooling. Annex B, Figure B3 presents
the breakdown of out-of-school children between those who (i) never attended school and (ii) those
who dropped-out, focusing on states where the out-of-school incidence is above 10 percent, which is
nearly exclusively comprises northern states. At the national level in 2013, 92 percent of out-of-school
children had never attended school while only 8 percent dropped out of school. In Yobe, almost all
out-of-school children within the 6-14 age group have never been to school. Given that the internal
conflict intensified after 2010, it was the most likely cause for the majority of primary school-age
children being out of school in Yobe. In addition, given that children tend to start primary school with

64 ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) is the most comprehensive public collection of political
violence data for developing states. This dataset contains information on the specific dates and locations of
political violence, the types of event, the groups involved, fatalities and changes in territorial control. Information
is recorded on the battles, killings, riots, and recruitment activities of rebels, governments, militias, armed groups,

a delay in Nigeria (on average at 9 years old instead of 6 years old), this implies that the intensification
of conflict will no doubt cause further delays among the intended cohort of students, increasing the
likelihood of either never attending school or not completing one’s education. This will have a negative
impact on young people’s lifetime earnings and potentially reinforce this intergenerational poverty
effect as well.

103.    The out-of-school issue is particularly prominent in the North, in rural areas, among girls and
among the poorest in society, hence affecting the most vulnerable social groups. Figure 19 presents
trends in out-of-school rates by areas of residence, gender and wealth quintile. At the national level,
the out-of-school rate increased from 24 percent in 2010 for children age 6-14 to 30 percent in 2013
and remained highest in 2013 among girls (32 percent vs 28 percent for boys), in rural areas (41 percent
vs 11 percent in urban areas), and among the poorest (72 percent for the poorest quintile vs 3 percent
for the richest). The breakdown of the trend by the social groups reveals that, over the 2010—2013
period, the incidence of out-of-school children increased faster among girls, in rural areas and among
the poorest two quintiles. On the other hand, the out-of-school rate among the richest three quintiles
and those in urban areas fell over the same period. Therefore, not only are children from vulnerable
groups more likely exposed to being out-of-school but they have been the drivers of the increase in the
national average out-of-school rate over recent years. Further reasons are explored in more detail in
the report.

Unit cost and affordability of schooling

104.    The problems of unequal access to education are broadly linked to issues along the north-south
divide but, in reality, inequalities and the incidence of out-of-school children vary greatly by state as
well as within states. Children from poor households, rural areas and girls are vulnerable populations
in almost all states of Nigeria- even if the reasons may vary. In some states, high out-of-school rates are
due to economic reasons, in some it is due to cultural reasons while in others it is due to instability
resulting from teachers’ strikes or armed conflicts. As for girls, their lack of participation is at times
linked to their parents’ preference not to send them to get an education, or the lack of adequate school
infrastructure, or even at times to the reluctance of parents to send girls to school where most teachers
are male. In terms of the urban-rural gap, one of the main difficulties identified has been the challenge
of deploying teachers to rural areas, especially female teachers who tend to be mostly tied to urban
areas where their husbands hold employment. This is an additional disadvantage for rural girls, who
are therefore deprived of female role models. Rural areas also have inadequate infrastructure facilities
due to poor funding of school construction and rehabilitation in rural areas. States differ in terms of
resources generating capacity, particularly regarding IGRs, but it has also been difficult for the federal
resource allocation to address the issues in the absence of any needs-based formula.

105.     It should be noted that because of the effects of delayed entry to school in Nigeria, where
children tend to start their education closer to the age of 9 than the official start age of 6 years old, the
age used in the out-of-school analysis is fixed at 10-14 of age given that this is the age group with the
highest chance of school attendance. In fact, among primary school-age children (age 6-11), being ‘too
young’ represents a significant share of the reason for being out-of-school, which could also capture
cross-related factors associated with age. For example, distance to school—if the school is considered
too far, younger children may not be able or allowed to walk to it. In similar fashion, stunted growth

                                                                                                                    55
in early childhood may undermine proper development of the child and affect their readiness for
school. Such issues can be addressed by provision of ECD programs in combination with other child-
development activities including nutrition programs. On the other end, for children over the age of 14
who are out of school, the main problem is not related to the dropout rate; rather it is that most of these
children have never attended school in the first place. Therefore, to better understand the reasons for
being out-of-school for the cohort that would otherwise have the highest likelihood of being in school,
the analysis focuses on the 10-14 age group.

106.    More than half of the out-of-school children in Nigeria are in that situation either because their
parents do not think education is important or because the children themselves are not interested in
pursuing their education. Figure 20 shows the reasons provided for children being out-of-school for a
cross-section of states with high out-of-school rates, by quintile, as well as the national average. In
general, the three main reasons for being out-of-school, in order are (i) parents do not think education
is important or child is not interested, (ii) the cost of schooling is prohibitive, and (iii) the distance to
school is too far. However, there is some degree of heterogeneity across states regarding the main
reasons for children being out-of-school. From the 19 states with out-of-school rates above 10 percent,
only five states list the main reason as either related to the cost of school or distance. In particular, Oyo
(the only state from the southern area in this category), identified distance as the main of reason for
out-of-school while Benue, Abuja, Plateau and Kaduna (all from the north), indicate that cost of
schooling is the main reason for being out-of-school. For the rest of the 14 states, the overwhelming
reason is tied to the notion that either parents or children are not interested in education. This reason
ranges from 39 percent in Nasarawa to 81 percent in Borno. However, it is important to note that this
particular answer could be interpreted from differ angles including the inability of parents to
understand the value of education as it relates to the skills needed for their family’s day-to-day life.
When disaggregated by quintile, across all 19 states, the lack of a premium placed on education by
parents and children is apparent at all levels of wealth- and is the highest in the richest quintile. This
clearly highlights that there are key reasons other than cost considerations driving the high out-of-
school rates, which the modeling section will explore further.

107.     Parent education, their sector of economic activity, area of residence and wealth status are key
determinants of whether parents think education is important or not. The parents’ own education level
is a strong determinant. For example, the probability that parents with no education find education not
important is at 20 percent compared with 5 percent for those parents who have some education,
holding all other factors are constant. Similarly, parents who work in the agrarian sector, are from rural
areas, and are in the poorest quintiles tend to believe, to a larger extent, that education is not important
compared with their relevant counterparts (non-agrarian, urban, and wealthier). This is also consistent
with the out-of-school findings above, which indicate that it mostly affects the northern part of the
country where the poverty rate is high, more than half of adult population have no education
(compared to only about 10 percent in the south) and where most are employed in agrarian activities
and live in rural areas.

108.     Some children in Nigeria start working as early as age 6 but the need to work is not the main
reason why children are not in school. Figure 21 presents the breakdown of activity of official school-
age children and youth aged 6-24. In this section, out-of-school is defined as those not currently in
school without having completed secondary, but the analysis also presents those who have completed
secondary, to fully capture the activities of this age group for comparison purposes. Accordingly, the
activities of the children-youth cohort are grouped into 7 categories: (i), those currently in school,
which includes those who are working and attending school at the same time, (ii), out of-school youth
working with no education (never in school), (iii), out-of-school youth working with some education
(dropouts), (iv), out-of-school youth not working with no education (never in school), (v), out-of-
school youth not working with some education (dropouts), (vi), youth working with secondary
completed, and (vii), youth not working with completed secondary. It should be noted that the chance

of future school attendance for those aged 6-11 not currently in school is high given the frequency of
delayed entry,65 where students may even start school at age 11.

109.    Opportunity cost is not the common reason why children are not in school. For example, only
62 percent of the 17 years old are in school, and of the 38 percent not in school, only 16 percent are
engaged in some economic activity. Of those not in school, 15 percent have never been in school of
which 9 percent are working and 6 percent are not working, 12 percent are dropouts, of which 5
percent are not working and 7 percent are working, and the remaining 11 percent have completed
secondary school of which 7 percent are not working and 4 percent are working. This implies that
children with some education have the same probability of engaging in labor market activities as those
with no education, meaning that the reasons children are out-of-school are likely other than their
desire to join the labor market. In addition, among those who completed high school, there are more
children not working (7 percent) than working (4 percent). As stated above, most of the children with
better education are from the southern part of the country, while those with no schooling are from the
north. For example, for youth aged 15-24, about 30 percent completed secondary in the south compared
with only 13 percent in the north (Annex B, Figure B4).

65According to the UNESCO standard definition, Out-of-school children are broken down into three groups:
delayed entry (those who have potential to enroll in school but have not yet started), never in school (those who
never entered school and are not expected to start school), and dropout (those who attended school at one point
but left the school system and are not expected to re-enter).

                                                                                                                                    58
110.     Unit cost estimation of spending per student shows large variations across states, and public
schools are more expensive than private schools. Figure 22 shows the household unit cost in public and
private schools, and the public unit cost in public schools. At the national level, the average public unit
cost in basic education stands at Naira 21,344 per student, ranging from a low of Naira 17,491 per
student in the North West zone to a high of Naira 35,043 in South South zone (not shown on figure).
There are three key observations from the unit cost analysis: (i) public schools (public and household
costs combined) are more expensive than private schools. Under the assumption that private schools
provide better quality education, higher unit cost in public schools suggests inefficiencies within the
public school system (a detailed analysis of efficiency including a data envelope analysis is presented in
the out-of-school section), (ii) large variations across states reflect unequal distribution of resources and
unequal resource availability per enrolled child. Children from the southern states receive more
allocation from both the public and from households regardless of the type of schools they attend
although it varies from zone to zone, and (iii) as expected, household payments in private schools are
higher than in public schools. As a result, although enrollment in private schools accounts for about 20
percent of total basic education enrollment, the spending share accounts for 42 percent of total
household payment. This is generally expected when private schools provide better quality education,
but in Nigeria the quality of private schooling provision is mixed. For example, the SDI report on the
four states (Anambra, Bauchi, Ekiti, and Niger) showed mixed results of student learning outcomes
(detailed SDI and teacher qualification information is presented in the quality section later in this
report).

111.   Children from the poorest households and from northern states face a significant resource
shortage compared with children from affluent families and from southern states regardless of the type

                                                                                                              59
of school they attend (public, private and religious). Figure 23 presents the estimates of household
education spending per student— average spending of all households regardless of the school type, by
quintile and geographical zone. This shows that available resources per student increases with each
quintile and is very high in the southern states. For example, households from the richest quintile spend
about 8 times more per student than households from the poorest quintile (Naira 36,117 vs. Naira 4,958
per student in 2012). Similarly, households in the South West zone spend 5 times more per child than
households in the North East zone (Naira 24, 350 vs Naira 5,441 per student in 2012). This means that
two children, from two different income quintiles and geographical zones, have different levels of
access to overall resources even though they have equal chances of accessing to public resources. It
should also be noted that resources available per child from the affluent and southern states have
increased at a higher rate than resources available for the poorest children and those in the north. For
example, household spending in the richest quintile increased between 2010 and 2012 by Naira 13,073
(57 percent increase) while the increase is only Naira 1,036 (26 percent increase) for the poorest
quintile.

112.     Household spending on education in the south remains much higher than in the north and the
trends reveal that spending on religious schools increased much faster than on public or private schools
between 2010 and 2012. As mentioned above, Figure 23 shows the trends in household unit costs by
geopolitical zones between 2010 and 201266. The analysis also reveals that religious schools tend to be
more accessible than private schools with overall lower unit costs, at times even lower than public
school unit cost, while on the other hand, private school unit costs are always higher than public school
unit costs for households (Annex B, Figure B5). While unit costs could also reflect living standard
differences between the geographical zones, children from the southern states clearly benefit from
higher per student allocation in all three school types. It is also worth noting that household unit cost
in private and religious schools were almost the same in 2012 (Naira 32,646 in private schools vs. 32,421
in religious), mainly due to increases in North Central and South South zones. Detailed implications on
children’s educational outcomes of spending on education and per child cost is presented later in the
report, while the rest of this section aims to understand the root causes of high unit costs in the southern
states and the role of public provision in protecting equity.

 Trends of unit cost by state are impossible to determine due to lack of state level representation on the 2012/3

113.    Basic education in Nigeria is free as declared by law. However, fee payments constitute more
than half of the total household out-of-pocket education payments. According to the UBE law, fee
collection is illegal, a criminal offense: “—public primary and junior secondary schools are to be free.
These include books, instructional materials, classrooms, furniture and free lunch.” To ensure this, the
law makes it a criminal offense for any person to receive fees from parents in exchange for education
services. “Any principal, headmaster, teachers, or P.T.A officials who obtain fees is guilty of the offense
punishable with Naira 10, 000 fine or three months imprisonment or both” (UBE Act 2004). This clearly
shows that there is a sharp dissonance between the UBE policy and its application, which heavily
undermines the effectiveness of the policy, and which may lead to adverse effects on the decision of
families to send their children to school. For example, in Kano, where the number of out-of-school
children is one of the highest in the country, parents are expected to pay school fees to the SBMC on a
voluntary basis, where the fees collected per student are exactly the same amount (300 Naira per
student per year) as the previously official fee collection prior to its abolition. The implications of the
continued fee collection are explored further in this report.

114.    Trends in household out-of-pocket spending broken-down by payment type show that fees are
the key drivers of household education payments, with a slight decrease between 2010 and 2012 from
57 to 55 percent of the total. Figure 24 presents the trends in household payment by category of
education expenditures in public schools. At the national level, the share of household spending
attributed to fees (fees which should be free under the law, including registration fees, books and PTA
contributions), remained high between 2010 and 2012 at 57 and 55 percent of total household
education payments, respectively. There was very little variation by quintile between 2010 and 2012
with marginal increases for the upper three quintiles, and marginal decreases for the two lower
quintiles over time. This finding has two general implications, (i) education is not, in actuality, free as
declared in the UBE Act, and (ii) more than 50 percent of school payments come from fees—the driver

of per unit spending. However some of the non-fee spending by households is also among key factors
determining learning outcomes. As discussed earlier, the resources available for children from poor
households are low but this figure also shows the disparities in type of education spending. To the
extent that non-fee inputs lead to better student learning and performance, the education outcomes of
poor students would be expected to be worse than those of better off students. The distribution of the
fees also reflects some dynamic of school payments across different wealth quintiles. While registration
fees are the single largest part of all spending across wealth quintiles, fees tied to books are the second
largest household payment at national level (17 percent in 2010 and 15 percent in 2012), which is
directly correlated to learning outcomes. In addition, payment for extracurricular activities (such as
tutoring and after-school programs) is positively correlated with grade 6 test results for the junior
secondary entrance exam as shown in Annex B, Figure B6 in annex. The quality section of this report
investigates the effect of such charges on learning outcomes.

115.    The trends in household spending on education clearly illustrate the particularly strong
commitment to education from the southern states and affluent families. Figure 25 presents trends in
household education spending as a share of total household expenditure by geographical zone and
household wealth quintile. Between 2010 and 2012, at the national level, household spending on
education as share of their total consumption increased by 1.3 percentage points (from 8.7 percent in
2010 to 10 percent in 2012). This is very close to what the public sector spent on education during the
same time as a share of total public spending, as shown earlier. However, the share of household
spending on education as a share of total household spending reveals that households from the lowest
consumption quintile and northern states spend less on education. The wealthiest households and
households from the southern states, which tend to be relatively wealthier, spend relatively more on
education. Between 2010 and 2012, the richest quintile also increased their spending on education
relative to their income at a faster rate than the poorest quintile. In most countries, the share of
education spending of total household spending among poorer households tends to be higher than the
share of spending among the richest households due to the poor households’ low consumption level,
but this is not the case in Nigeria. This leads to the question: why do the poorest families as well as
households in the north tend to spend less on their children’s education? While the answer to this

                                                                                                                          62
question depends on several factors, under the scope of this analysis the following are key factors: (i)
poverty status of states—i.e. headcount poverty rate is negatively correlated with education share of
total household consumption and most of the northern states are associated with high poverty
incidence (Annex B, Figure B7), (ii) returns to education in the northern states are low—mainly driven
by a low level of education of the working age population and high alignment of low skilled agricultural
activities (Annex B, Figure B4). In particular, this implies that there is limited motivation for household
to put their hard earned money into education since they observe no obvious returns, (iii) cultural
barriers which are discussed in detail later in the report.

116.     The state-level analysis of household payment on education as a share of total household
spending reveals that families in the upper consumption quintiles spend more than lower quintiles
within southern states while there is not much difference across quintiles in the northern states. Annex
B, Figure B8 in the Annex shows the education spending as a share of total household consumption for
the poorest and richest quintiles and average at state level.67 In terms of the average share of spending
in the northern states, it ranges from a low of 1.7 percent in Bauchi and Kano, to 7.8 percent in Kogi
and Benue. The corresponding figures in the southern states is a low of 6.5 percent in Edo state to a
high of 15.3 percent in Ondo state. The richest households in the northern states, except in the north
central states, tend to spend more on education than the poorest households while in the southern
states, although overall the spending share is high, many states show that the poorest quintiles spend a
similar share if not more than the highest quintile. Overall, this figure demonstrates that regardless of
wealth status, states in the north, which are generally poor, spend less on education both in absolute
terms and as related to their overall spending.

117.     Spending per capita shows that education spending in Nigeria is not as high as expected,
perhaps because households are too financially constrained to invest in education whereas in other
countries the burden that families accept, even among poorer households, tends to be relatively higher.
Figure 26 shows per student per capita spending on education. In order to understand the implication
of this pattern on the welfare of the poor, it is necessary to translate the per student payment to per
capita payment. This is done by dividing the per student payment by the average per capita

                                                                                                                        63
consumption for household for each quintile level, that is, the household unit cost divided by per capita
consumption at household level. In general, poor households in Africa are larger in size (in Nigeria,
mean household size is 9 in the poorest quintile vs. 6 in the richest quintile). This leads to lower per
capita spending, which, in most countries, tends to increase per student per capita spending. However,
in Nigeria the lower share of per student per capital spending by the poorest household clearly indicates
less spending on education rather than representing a high burden on the poor. On average, at primary
level, households’ per capita spending on education ranges from 5 percent in North Central to 30
percent in South South. Similarly, at the national level, the per capita spending at primary level
increases with each quintile except for the highest quintile, which could be explained by the fact that
the income of the highest quintile is much higher than the marginal education household spending.
The rates are higher for all other quintiles, increasing from the lowest quintile to the fourth quintile
from 12 percent to 22 percent. The trend overtime is almost similar at the junior secondary level, which
follows a similar pattern as the primary level.

118.    The trend in income inequality in Nigeria indicates that the income holding of the poor slightly
diminished between 2010 and 2012. Figure 27 shows the income distribution by quintile for 2010 and
2012. The income holding of the poorest quintile is around half of their population share (10.6 percent
of income holding vs. 20 percent quintile population share: that is, the poorest 20 percent of the
population share in 10.6 percent of the income) and remained unchanged between 2010 and 2012,
suggesting no improvement in equality between the two years. Given that spending per student matters
and that many children from the northern states have already been excluded from participating in the
education system, it is very important for policy makers to institute pro-poor education policies to
break the intergenerational poverty trap. The following section employs a benefit incidence analysis to
examine the public role in protecting equity.

Role of private providers and equity in basic education

119.     Private schools are key players in the provision of education in southern states, and thus
contribute to the access gap between the north and the south. Figure 28 shows enrollment of children
age 6-14 at the basic education level by type of provider, divided into four categories: (i) Federal, which
includes Unity Colleges (federal secondary schools) and some special schools across all states, (ii) state
and LGA which are combined as some basic education level schools are managed both by state and
LGA, (iii) private schools, and (iv) religious schools. Overall in Nigeria, the majority of basic education
schools are under state/LGA management (72 percent), followed by the private sector (20 percent) and
federal schools (5 percent), while religious schools only account for 4 percent. In general, religious
schools tend to be more prevalent in the north while private schools are more common in the south.
In the southern states, private provision of education ranges between 11 to 42 percent, while only 7
northern states registered enrollment rates above 10 percent in the private sector. Only three northern
states (Kano, Bauchi and Benue) registered more than 10 percent of enrollment in private schools while
in the south, only one state, Imo had a high participation rate for the zone with 9 percent enrollment
in private schools.

120.    Uneven provision of private schools in Nigeria contributes to the zonal disparities in terms of
access. Annex B, Figure B9 shows the primary GER and share of private school provision by state. The
figure indicates that states with high private provision are associated with higher access rates. Most
states with primary GER above 95 percent have at least 10 percent of private school enrollment. In
general, provision of private schools has been encouraged since (i) it provides alternatives for affluent
households who may prefer higher quality education offered in some private institutions, and (ii) it
eases the burden on the public sector and allows for greater access for the poor to public schools. While
the growth of the private sector provision is, in general, associated with wealthier households and their
willingness to pay for generally more expensive private services, many countries are encouraging
private or religious providers’ participation in order to help broaden access, offer better services and
provide greater coverage. For example, a recent 2014 report “The Role and Impact of Private Schools
in Developing Countries” released by the United Kingdom's Department for International
Development (DFID), argues for a paradigm shift in favor of low-cost private provision to improve
equity through provision of services in remote places and to reach the poorest families.68 In Nigeria,
the government has not been able to fully harness the potential of private providers in increasing access
to education in a way that focuses on increasing equity and reducing disparities.

121.     Private schools in Nigeria tend to provide services for affluent families while religious schools
and public schools are important providers for the poor. Figure 29 shows education provision of public,
religious and private schools by income quintile (left) and provision of private schools by level of
education(right). Enrollment in the private school system at all levels of education (pre-school to junior
secondary) is dominated by children from wealthier families. Enrollment in the religious schools tends
to be slightly higher among children from poor families. Likewise, enrollment in public schools tends
to accommodate children from poorer families at the basic education level. Poor families tend to be
associated with larger family sizes, increasing the share of children from the poorer families using
public services. In particular, as shown in Figure 28 above, most of the children from the northern
states use public services.

122.    In the states where school access rates are high, poor families use public resources the most.
Annex B, Figure B 10 in annex shows the relationship between the gross primary enrollment rate and
share of the poorest quintile enrolled in public schools. It shows that in those states with high
enrollment rates, poor families rely on public school provision the most. As shown earlier, high access
rates among the southern states are in part facilitated by the provision of private schools for affluent
families, creating more opportunity for the poor to use public services. However, this is not the case in
the north where access is very limited. This implies that encouraging private providers in the north
would allow children from wealthier quintiles there to attend private schools, freeing up public
resources that could be channeled towards poorer families and improve overall access. Provision of
private schools in such a fragmented manner, however, undermines the efficient planning of education
finance, leading to various large discrepancies in public spending across states. The following section
shares some of the implications of this variation, including unit cost variation by state, rationale for
private provision, and public role in protecting equity.




                                                                                                                                67
123.    In light of the key role that non-public service delivery providers play in the education sector,
the government lacks a clear strategy and guidelines for partnership. The lack of clear policy guidelines
and lack of enforcement of rules and regulations regarding how private schools should operate in
Nigeria is a clear source of misconduct and failure for some private schools, even encouraging practices
such as academic fraud. Such schools tend to use cheap and unqualified teachers, exploiting the failures
and instability in the public school system and even appealing to cultural sensibilities within the
Nigerian population. These issues have been well recognized by policymakers; for example, the FMOE
(2012) stated “the poor monitoring of private schools across the country poses the risk of abuse by
profiteering private providers. It is therefore important to revisit the policy on private education
provision and review the nature of state collaboration with these non-state providers to strengthen and
streamline education provision across the country,” but little action has been taken. In states where
provision by private schools is high, the legal framework governing the sector is not conducive to
attracting participation though formal channels (formal registration). For example, in Lagos state,
regulatory requirements are so high that many private schools may prefer to avoid registering all
together.69 However, for the religious schools several actions have been underway under the UBEC
intervention fund. For example, federal and state governments are committed to maintain efforts to
integrate Qur’anic schools through the UBEC Integrated Qur’anic Teaching and Education (IQTE)
program as well as efforts to establish integrated Islamiyya schools where an integrated curriculum
with a combination of secular and religious subjects is taught.70

124.    The institutional framework set up by the UBE Act has also failed to provide for adequate
supervision of private schools. Moreover, private schools are relatively very efficient in terms of costs
but, as mentioned earlier, the UBEC policy intervention does not have a clear vision for mobilizing the
private sector to foster alternative provision of service delivery in education. Given that private schools
play a major role in increasing access to education, especially in the south, and given the value added
they bring to service delivery in education, the UBEC intervention fund should ensure this channel of
service delivery is also exploited. Annex B, Figure B11 in annex B shows that the out-of-school rate is
inversely related to the share of private school enrollment. This implies that without the presence of
private school provision in the south, the burden on the government and the outcome in terms of
efficiency would perhaps be closer to the current situation in the north. But the key difference is that
the poverty status of the north is much worse than that of the south and, therefore, households from
the north may not be able to afford the private school fees. It is also clear that while private school
attendees clearly perform better on exams, there is very limited guidance for the private sector
providers. Given their relative autonomy, government does not tend to reflect on the role of the private
sector in the states during resource allocation decisions. The fact that the UBEC policy intervention
fund shares resources equally among all states regardless of the need level is clear evidence of the lack
of sound and effective management of the role of private schools in the wider education system. In
addition, given that private schools are cheaper to operate than public schools, government could use


69 In Lagos states for example, prospective proprietors must have a minimum of 5 classrooms, including special
rooms such as library, sickbay, and administrative office computer room. A minimum of eight (8) toilets for
students and at least two (2) toilets for teachers must be made available, as well as adequate instructional materials
and furniture for both teachers and students, laboratories for physics, chemistry, intro-tech, biology, and a fine
arts studio (Härmä, 2013).

this advantage to promote a scaling up of access in the northern part of the country as an alternative to
federal intervention. The issue will be further developed as part of the policy recommendations below.


Constraints on the federal government in protecting equity71

125.    At the national level, public spending in basic education is poverty neutral but given that
decisions are made at the state level, equity in access to public resources varies by state. Figure 30 shows
the distribution of public spending across quintiles by state. A detailed description of the benefits
incidence analysis (BIA) methodology is presented in Annex E (Annex E1) and this section summarizes
the main findings. In some states, especially in the south, public spending tends to be allocated across
each income quintile in equal measure, while in the other states, particularly in the north, spending
tends to be pro-rich. The analysis of public spending on basic education for the country as a whole
shows that the poorest quintile receives almost as much as their proportion share of population (19
percent) suggesting that the average public spending at national level is close to being equitable.
However, as mentioned above, some states demonstrate various degrees of bias towards the rich in
public spending on basic education. At the state level, the share of benefits that go to the lowest quintile
varies greatly ranging from 12 percent in Gombe to 22 percent in Enugu. The corresponding figures for
the richest quintile are 27 percent and 19 percent, respectively for Gombe and Enugu states. This
implies that public spending in Gombe state is highly inequitable, disfavoring the poor while Enugu
shows a slight pro-poor spending pattern. Overall, in all northern states except for Bauchi and Kaduna,
the poorest households benefit less from public spending, that is, the lowest quintile receives less public
benefits than their population share (20 percent). In contrast, public spending in the southern part of
the country tends to be generally pro-poor except in the three states (Abia, Awka Ibom and Oyo).

71The concept of benefit incidence analysis (BIA) was originally pioneered in studies by Gillespie on Canada
1965, and extended to the developing countries context by Meerman (1979) on Columbia, and Seloswski (1979)
on Malaysia and in its modern stage by Need (1995), Selden and Wasylenko (1992), Sahn and Yonger (1999) on
Africa, Demery (2000).

126.     Although income inequality is higher than inequality in education spending, the northern
zones are clearly pro-rich in their spending while the southern ones tend to demonstrate pro-poor
spending. A BIA is presented in an alternative way using the concentration curve to evaluate the
targeting of government subsidies. Figure 31 presents the BIA results for the six geographic zones. This
also includes the consumption concentration curve, which is a proxy for the general wealth and income
inequality across quintiles. In general, public spending on education is pro-poor if the concentration
curve for education is above the 45-degree line.72 The result shows that the concentration curve for
basic education spending is just above the line of perfect equity in the three southern states while in
the three northern states basic education spending is entirely below the line of equity. This suggests
that public spending in education in the Nigeria favors the relatively wealthier households in the
northern part of the country while it favors the poor in the southern part of the country. In addition,
the fact that the education spending curve is above the concentration curve in all zones implies that,
the benefits of public expenditure in basic education are relatively more biased towards the poor than
the distribution of income. It is also worthwhile to note that, while public spending at the basic
education level is not pro-poor in the north per se, spending in basic education promotes greater
equality than the general observed income inequality.




72 The Lorenz curve is a graphical interpretation of the cumulative distribution of income on the vertical axis
against the cumulative distribution of population on the horizontal axis. Spending is pro-poor if the poor receive
more of the program’s benefits than the non -poor and more than their share of the population; graphically this
line appears above the diagonal since the 45° line indicates that each quintile in the distribution is receiving the
same share, or in other words, each quintile (which represents 20 percent of the population) would receive 20
percent of spending. Not-pro-poor but progressive is if the non-poor receive more than the poor, but still the
poor receive a share larger than their share of consumption; graphically this line appears below the diagonal but
above the Lorenz curve. Not-pro-poor and regressive occurs if the non-poor receive more than the poor, and the
share of the poor is less than their share of consumption; graphically this line appears below the diagonal and
below the Lorenz curve.

                                                              Factors that affect school participation

                                                              127.     In addition to disparities in public spending, there are other key factors that affect education
                                                              participation and outcomes. Several econometric models are employed to investigate how demand and
                                                              supply side factors affect the probability of school participation (full results are presented in Annex B).
                                                              The following are key supply side factors used in the analysis: (i) public spending on education at the
                                                              state level measured in terms of per student spending (unit cost) which allows us to determine whether
                                                              there is a shortage of public resources devoted to basic education at the state level, and (ii) state total
                                                              revenue per official school-age child which is a proxy for the financial constraints facing the state in
                                                              the provision of education. The first analysis is used to determine whether finance really matters in
                                                              Nigeria. The following are demand side factors included in the model73: (i) household head education,
                                                              gender, sex and sector of employment, (ii) household wealth status and family size, (iii) prevalence of
                                                              conflicts, (iv) areas of residence, (v) child sex and age, and (vi) household spending per child. In
                                                              summary, the result shows that (i) three supply side financial indicators, total public spending, state

                                                              and south geographic divide.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           71
revenue and household spending, are strong predictors of children’s school participation, with state
revenue and household spending having the two largest effects on education outcomes, (ii) from
demand side factors, while household head education is the most predominant determinant of
schooling, all other factors such as household head sector of activity, wealth status, areas of residence,
head age, household size and children age and gender also play crucial roles in schooling decisions, (iii)
analysis of the model separately between the northern and southern parts of the country shows that all
supply and demand side factors listed above have a strong influence in the north while household
spending and education of household head seems to matter the most in the south and (iv) finally, the
decomposition results under the four categories (north vs. south, urban vs. rural, male vs. female and
poorest vs. richest) show that the endowment (or explained factors) plays a significant role in
explaining the difference across the four categories.

128.     As indicated, despite the fact that public spending is a key factor in determining school
participation, the analysis clearly highlights that children from poor households face resource shortages
and that public funds are not equally available for all Nigerian children, as stipulated in the UBE Act.
In practical terms, the constitutional breakdown of responsibilities, as reflected in the mandated
formula for resource mobilization and reallocation, has been difficult to implement. Although several
criteria are used to determine the amount allocated to each state and local government from the
Federation Account, including consideration of inequalities, in practice this is not happening. For
example, the government is constrained in its ability to direct the UBE intervention funds to the areas
where the need is highest due to political sensitivities and rigidities in the system. As a result, UBE
funds are distributed almost entirely equally across states. Information gathered from the education
services delivery value chain also confirms that funding is one of the key challenges for basic education,
leading to calls for increases in funding as a possible solution to service delivery issues. Policy
inconsistency is also referred to as another key challenge area, which is mostly connected to states’
willingness, or lack of willingness, to implement national policy such as the UBE law. Box 5
Summarizes key challenges of the basic education subsector in terms of problems, and offers possible
solutions.

 Box 5: Key challenges and possible solutions proposed by policy makers
 Policymakers concur that inadequacy of funding and poor levels of teacher qualifications are among
 the top challenges of the education sector. The table below shows the response from the three groups
 of administrative representatives attending the first workshop held on these issues, in response to
 the question asking them to list the top five key challenges in the education sector and possible
 solutions for the government to consider. The result is a group discussion output, which was sorted
 in order of importance. The group discussion was structured around key discussion topics on (i)
 Institutional Effectiveness, (ii) Accountability, and (iii) Fiduciary Integrity. The responses were,
 naturally, guided and informed by the role of the respondent within the responsibilities of the
 administration system. For example, among the commissioner/permanent secretary group of
 respondents, the main issue and solutions flagged were related to finance. Similarly, for the director’s
 group, planning and policy inconsistencies were identified as the key challenges, while the data-
 driven NEMIS group picked availability of data as one of the key challenges. Overall three areas were
 flagged as the main cross-cutting issues: (i) finance, (ii) teachers, and (iii) consistency of policy
 implementation. This finding is consistent with issues identified as key determinants of learning
 outcomes in basic education above, which suggests that policymakers are very much aware of the
 issues that that affect learning outcomes.

Efficiency of resource utilization and implication of drop in oil price

129.     While the equity analysis highlights the fact that resources are not equally distributed, in
particular given that less is spent per child on education in the north, this section investigates whether
the available resources are efficiently and effectively utilized. As such, this section covers the following:
(i), an analysis of the efficient utilization of resources using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
model, (ii) an analysis identifying the states with potential to expand access through efficiency
improvement and those that require additional help, and (iii) an estimate of the amounts needed to
accommodate the out-of-school children, in terms of both additional students waiting to be
accommodated and associated costs, and the additional implied teacher requirement, also in terms of


                                                                                                                                 73
numbers and associated costs. Given the recent developments in the oil market and Nigeria’s heavy
reliance on oil revenue, efficient utilization of resources is all the more necessary.

130.    The main purpose of the DEA model is to analyze how different states utilize the available
resources available to them in light of their associated education outcomes. In other words, the analysis
seeks to identify those states that are able to generate the best educational outcomes relative to their
means. We used 7 inputs and 4 outputs for the efficiency score calculation. The input variables include
public expenditure, household spending, total teachers, share of qualified teachers, total number of
schools, total classrooms, and share of good classrooms. The output variables include: GER (both for
primary and junior secondary), percentage of out-of-school children, NER (primary and junior
secondary), and gender parity ratio (primary and junior secondary). The methodological framework
and descriptive statistics for all input and output variables are displayed in Annex (Annex B).

131.     The overall result of the DEA model shows that the efficiency score varies from 32 percent in
Sokoto to 90 percent in Ebonyi state.74 Figure 32 shows the efficiency score by state and identifies the
states that need additional resources after accounting for optimal use of the existing resources. Most
states in the north are associated with a low efficiency score such as Sokoto, Katsina, Benue and Niger,
each with an efficiency score below 50 percent while at least some high efficiency scores are observed
across all the geographic zones. This is particularly consistent with the high out-of-school rate in the
North East and North West zones given that the existing resources only serve few school-age children
since there is a high out-of-school incidence. It should be noted that the DEA result is a relative
comparison model and therefore, it does not mean that states with high efficiency scores are efficient
in absolute terms, or that those with low efficiency are inefficient in absolute terms. Rather, this should
be seen as a measure of relative efficiency of one state compared to another. This could also be used as
a benchmark of good practice for south-south knowledge exchange on efficiency improvement.

132.    Overall, the efficiency level in Nigeria’s public basic education system is about 75 percent,
which implies that there is a room for efficiency improvement. An average efficiency score of 75
percent implies that 25 percent of resources could have been saved if all states were as efficient as the
relatively most efficient state among them. In other words, the same level of education outcomes could
be achieved with about 25 percent less resources if all states were as efficient as the most efficient states
in Nigeria.

133.    After accounting for the optimal utilization of resources, the DEA analysis suggest that most of
the northern states need additional resources in order to provide full access to all children while only
a few states in the south need such help. The estimate shows that from 19 northern states, 17 need
additional resources in order to achieve full access while only 6 of the 17 southern states need help in
order achieve full access. It is also important to note that even among the states that need additional
resources, the extent of this need varies. The spectrum of additional resources needed is detailed below
for each state. The key assumptions considered in determining the needs are summarized as follows:




74 As stated above the UBEC matching grant fund was not disbursed to Ebonyi state and the high efficiency score
is partly explained by low utilization of resources.

                                                                                                            74
      The optimal student teacher ratio (STR), is set at 40:1 for primary education and 25:1 for junior
       secondary75. An STR close to the recommended values indicates, on one hand, adequate number of
       teachers for all students in the system and on the other, adequate attendance/ capacity of students
       in each class and is therefore a key determinant of access to schooling. Many states underutilize
       their resources, such as in Ekiti, Lagos, Cross River, Delta and Enugu in the southern zones with
       STRs below 25:1 at the primary level, while some northern states have very high rates, such as
       Kano and Tabara with STRs above 75:1. There are also some northern states with lower STRs, such
       as Zamfara, Niger, Adamawa, and Borno, and some southern states with relatively high STRs such
       as Kogi, Anambra, and Akwa Ibom. Similar scenarios are present in junior secondary. Thus, the
       efficiency improvement (optimal use of exiting STR) implies that those who have lower STRs
       would increase the STR without additional resources and those above the optimal STR would
       reduce it to optimal levels.
      The out-of-school rate is assumed to determine how many students need to be accommodated.
       Note that the total students to be accommodated may be below or above the current number of
       out-of-school children.
      Public and private household unit costs are used to estimate how much accommodating the out-
       of-school children would cost.

134.   At the national level, the estimate of additional funding needed to ensure full access in basic
education requires a funding increase equivalent to 36 percent of current spending. Table 2 presents

75World Banks empirical studies (2005) indicate that optimal use of STR for secondary is 25:1 and GPE best
practice suggests 40:1 for primary education.

                                                                                                                                                                                        75
the summary of additional children to be accommodated and the associated cost under different
scenarios by state. The total number of teachers and students were determined based on the above
assumptions about the STR and out-of-school children. We estimated cost under two scenarios: (i)
given that basic education is compulsory by law in Nigeria, the cost estimate assumed that the public
sector would accommodate all children of official basic education school-age (age 6-14) by covering all
costs including full household out-of-pocket expenses, such as learning materials and uniforms (labeled
Full cost), and (ii) assuming a free fee policy, the second option considers no school fees but does not
account for households’ other non-fee education costs (labeled public + HH fees). The last column of
the table (share of current spending) is estimated based on the second scenario (i.e. including only fees
paid by households to the total cost of schooling).

135.      Although the estimate shows that 23 of the 37 states (including F.C.T. Abuja) need some level
of additional help, the extent of financial support needed as a share of their current spending ranges
from 1 percent in Kwara to 149 percent in Kogi state. Almost all states demonstrating additional
funding needs are from the north with the exception of five states in the south, although the latter have
comparatively low needs. While this exercise calculates the financial cost associated with ensuring full
access to basic education, all things being equal, given that the main reason for out-of-school children
is not a financial one, additional funding might be needed to address the other socio-economic issues
that hinder schooling. For example, although opportunity cost is not a main reason at the national level,
there are some states where it matters and in such cases a financial boost would help. In other states
where parent education is the main issue, arrangements of an alternative education system or second
chance schooling may be needed, which often costs more than formal schooling as it involves high
opportunity costs for prospective students. Similarly, in states where parents and children do not place
a high premium on education because they do not see the returns to education, more awareness
campaigns might be needed along with clear economic plans to develop the labor market to create clear
opportunities for children graduating from the education system. Thus, the cost estimate in this
exercise is a minimum requirement benchmark rather than what is actually needed to truly engage in
reform. The summary section will provide specific implications and priorities including those
stemming from the equity and quality sections of this report.

136.     Overall, the national STR indicates that Nigeria is in line with the recommended GPE STR
level of 40:1 at the primary level, but the variation by state is large. The national junior secondary STR
was 33:1, compared to the SSA average of 25:1. Annex B, Figure B12 shows STR by zone for both
primary and junior secondary levels of education. The primary STR was the highest in the South East
and South West with STRs of 50 and 42, respectively, while the North East (38) and North West (37)
had STRs slightly below the recommended levels for the primary level. Given the high incidence of
out-of-school children in the northern states, it is not entirely surprising that the STR levels tend to be
relatively lower in the north but differences within each zone and within each state need to be tracked.
With respect to within-state differences, for example, in Kano, STR at the LGA level ranges from a low
of 26 to 90 with an average of 46. On the other hand at the junior secondary level, the STR in the North
East (45:1) and North West (46:1) tends to be much higher than the national average and much higher
than in the southern zone. This is mostly indicative of the lack of teachers at this level of education. In
fact, although the north accounts for about 52 percent of all enrolled students in junior secondary, only
about 43 percent of all junior secondary teachers are located in the northern states. This clearly shows



                                                                                                        76
that further analysis is required to provide an accurate cost estimate to arrive at the indicated number
of teachers.

137.     When accounting for all school-age children within the primary and junior secondary school-
age, the adjusted STRs indicate that the current teaching staff resources are not adequate to
accommodate all children, especially in the North East and North West. Annex B, Figure B13 shows
the adjusted STR for all school-age children only, meaning for children aged 6-11 for primary level and
12-14 for junior secondary. The national average for the adjusted STR indicates that, ignoring the
overage issue, if all school-age children were to be absorbed into the education system in Nigeria, the
STR at the primary level would be about 54:1 while at the junior secondary it would be 68:1, both
higher than the GPE recommended levels of 40:1 and 25:1, respectively. The inadequacy of the current
resources highlights the current supply side barriers facing the education system, in particular the
difficulty the system would face in accommodating out-of-school children, should they be able to join.
This inadequacy is particularly strong in the north, where the adjusted STR at the primary level was
about 48:1 in the North East and 61:1 in the North West and 101:1 and 119:1, respectively, at the junior
secondary level.

138.     Lack of consistency in the enforcement of the UBE law has also contributed to internal
inefficiency in the education system. Although Nigeria has invested heavily in M&E systems and


                                                                                                                    77
quality assurance, at times with duplicate efforts, the country still suffers from the loss of already scarce
resources through internal inefficiency. In particular, the incidence of repetition and dropout at the
basic education level corresponds to a public deadweight loss equivalent to 18 percent of total public
spending and 14 percent of household spending. Figure 33 presents the cost of repetition and dropout
as a share of (i) total public spending, and (ii) household spending on basic education. Although Nigeria
has an automatic promotion policy, repetition and delayed entry leads to overage enrollment, which
also factors into why students tend to dropout prior to completion. The associated cost was calculated
using the number of dropouts and repetitions per year at the basic education level and was based on
the unit costs of public and private per student payment. In particular, the cost was estimated from the
total number of repeaters and based on per student annual unit cost in public schools. Note that due to
the lack of significant returns to education in the northern states, the discounted value of forgone
opportunity in terms of expected earnings – is not included into the estimate. However, from the
current estimate, it is clear that given the already strained budget for some states, wastage of resources
due to internal inefficiency represents a significant loss to the sector, one that could be saved and
redirected to productive investments instead. Reducing repetition not only improves the internal
efficiency but also leads to better completion rates and better lifetime earnings prospects. This is a key
area where the states, particularly those with very tight budgets, can create some room to enable
expansion of access to education.

139.    The current drop in oil prices, Nigeria’s main source of revenue, has direct implications for the
sustainability of basic education spending and provides a strong rationale for greater efficiency in

utilization of the existing resources. This study covered data from 2009-2014 given that there is a lack
of complete data from the post-price-drop period. Figure 34 shows average monthly oil prices for select
years from 2006 to 2014 and trends of average production, sale and price between 2006 and 2014. The
result shows that although the price between 2011 and 2013 remained almost constant, the sale and
production figures decreased slightly. This implies that with the current sales and production trends,
increase in production to overcome the revenue drop due to drop in the price oil is unlikely. This could
be justified by limitation of the capacity to increase production at least in the short run and is highly
likely to affect budget sources especially for social sectors given the already tight budget and limited
availability of spending on education.

140.    The estimated cost of the oil price drop on the basic education sector at the national level has
been a 5 percent cut in total spending on basic education and 9 percent of resources allocated per
students and it greatly varies by state. Figure 35 shows the effect of the oil price drop in the second half
of 2014 on basic education spending by state. The estimate is based on the average oil price in 2014,
although the price fall was observed especially in the second half of the year. If the oil price remains at
current depressed levels the effect on basic education spending at the national level will lead to a 25
percent cut in the basic education budget which is associated with about a 29 percent drop in resources
available per student (unit cost). It is apparent that the effect is much more severe in states which
heavily depend on federal allocations, implying that states with better IGR patterns face a smaller
decrease. For example, Lagos, whose internal revenue share accounts for more than half of its total
education budget, the effect was only a 2 percent budget cut based on the 2014 average and 10 percent
if the oil price continues at the current price during the upcoming years. In contrast, states such as
Borno, which heavily depend on oil revenue either because, like Akwa Ibom, they are oil producers,
or because they depend heavily on this source due to a lack of other IGR, face large cuts to their
education budget. Given that there was already low spending on the education sector in the favorable

                                                                                                                   79

improvement of efficiency of resource utilization to cope with the challenges.

Challenges of uniform UBE provision and implementation of UBEC intervention funds

141.     The institutional framework set up by the UBE Act of 2004 has succeeded in promoting a fair
level of policy alignment and coordination between the federal and the state governments. However,
it suffers from weak accountability mechanisms—political, managerial and professional—which
prevent it from achieving stated policy objectives. Since UBEC manages funds belonging to the
federation (and not transferred from the budget of the federal government), it should be accountable
to the state and federal governments together. During the program’s 10 years of existence, no evaluation
has been conducted to assess whether the program works or not, including no assessment of the various
changes that were made to the UBEC requirements, for example the change from a 70 to a 50 percent
matching requirement.

142.    Federal resource allocation aims at political equity (by granting each state the same share of the
whole) without consideration for financing needs, absorption capacity (including their own financial
capacity) or policy performance at the state level. Lack of intergovernmental coordination in resource
mobilization is reflected in the rapidly decreasing disbursement rate of these fiscal transfers. In
particular, the matching grant component, which takes the highest share of the UBEC program,
changed its matching requirements from 70 percent in 2004 to 50 percent in 2010 without any
assessment to support this change. The change is largely a political move as many states were not willing
to meet the requirement to match 70 percent of the funds disbursed by UBEC. As it faced resistance,

                                                                                                              80
UBEC entered into negotiations with the states and agreed to lower their obligation to a 50 percent
matching requirement, as well as to establish a loan arrangement with a local commercial bank for
collateral funds for UBEC fund release. However, although UBEC gradually relaxed the rules, most of
the states tend to see UBEC intervention as a challenge to their constitutional rights, which means that
the conflict in this aspect is still ongoing. Another source of conflict is the fact that UBEC distributes
most resources equally to all states, despite the wide spectrum of needs across states and of education
performance in enrollment rates, gender parity ratio, learning outcomes etc. Lastly, while states
recognize the importance of the UBEC fund, they do not seem convinced that UBEC, which is a
centralized program, could ever be more efficient than the states in using the support.

143.     The institutional framework set up by the UBE Act in effect deprives local governments of any
significant responsibility in the provision of basic education. It also introduces confusion in secondary
school management (as a result of the challenging disarticulation of junior and senior secondary
schools). For example, prior to the UBE Act, the LGAs were responsible for personnel costs within the
primary school network but since then personnel costs have been automatically deducted from the
LGA allocations at the source for basic education, which in addition to primary level also includes JSS
salaries. As per the stipulations under the UBE regulations, the new structure called for the
disarticulation of junior secondary schools from senior secondary schools, effectively moving JSS
schools under the SUBEB management. Some states were unable to complete the disarticulation
process, while others did and still others even went through a re-articulation process, moving junior
secondary back under the board of senior secondary management. This unclear division of
responsibilities renders UBEC’s responsibilities to basic education less obvious. In particular, states tend
to believe that UBEC is not helping to achieve the UBE goals and would rather go back to the original
management structure.

144.     To further understand the issues of disarticulation and the reasons behind the lack of
compliance on this aspect of the UBE law, and to better understand the chances of the law being
implemented, we carried out interviews at the state ministry of education as well as at the SUBEB level
in Edo, Kano, Kogi and Lagos. The key findings to this question are: (i) Kogi: Lack of adequate funding
made total transition impossible. There is already financial pressure on SUBEB to manage the salaries
for the schools that fall under their responsibility and the fiscal space does not allow them to
accommodate other staff, i.e. incorporate the JSS that are currently still under state administrative and
financial management; (ii) Lagos: the state wanted to engage in the management of basic education to
ensure the quality of the basic education level and there is no conflict in such arrangements between
the state and SUBEB; (iii) Edo: SUBEB cannot manage both Primary and JSS since this represents an
overwhelming task given their resources, and while there is no conflict per se, there is a lack of
communication between the two managements. For example, SUBEB does not receive any reports or
evaluations from the state although they do provide such information on their activities back to the
state; and (iv) Kano: JSS management is under SSSMB because the state has re-articulated JSS schools,
but SUBEB still has a mandate by virtue of the UBE Act. The overlap creates confusion in the M&E
system.

145.     In summary, it is evident that the federal government is unable to assume the additional costs
associated with the disarticulation process, which has forced SUBEBs and state ministries of education
to find compromises to effectively fund the JSS education level, despite the stipulations in the UBE Act
that made JSS a federal responsibility. An important question is whether these solutions are satisfactory;

                                                                                                         81
it is perhaps preferable to the situation in which, SUBEBs managed JSS schools, assuming they had
funding for that purpose. On the other hand if the reason for the messy outcome offered by the four
focus states accurately reflects the situation across Nigeria, then it points to a serious problem, since
management should cost a fraction of the total teacher salaries. For example, the reason offered by
Lagos' MOE is quite plausible, but indicates a fundamental flaw in the elaboration of the UBE
legislation: the absence of preliminary negotiations with the states. Such negotiations would have
prevented the confusion and complications created by the move to disarticulate, then to re-articulate
as in some states, like Kano. The confusion in the system is real and has morphed into formal policy
action, leaving states to formulate their own state-specific suitable management approach. In order for
the UBE Act to be fully implemented, the current law and its application needs to be investigated,
evaluated and updated to ensure the uniformity in the provision of basic education.

146.    In response to questions from some of the states, UBEC has been adjusting the formula for
resource allocation in the agreed program including changing the matching grant allocation formula
which is mostly motivated by political reasons rather than a problem-driven approach. For example,
in the northern part of the country, infrastructure is a key challenge as observed from large class sizes
on top of the high incidence of out-of-school children. In particular, the reduction in the matching
grant requirement from 70 to 50 percent did not take into account that the infrastructure needs in the
north are far greater than those in the south. In the North East and North West zones, where the
infrastructure shortage is the greatest, the matching grant disbursements were all above 80 percent
compared with the south where only three states had disbursements above 80 percent (Figure 36).

147.    The question surrounding the frequency of disbursement of UBEC funds has generated some
confusion and led to assumptions that UBEC was not releasing funds, when the reality was more
complicated. In particular, although UBEC is expected to release matching grant funds every quarter,
it does not necessarily do so at this frequency. Given that each state has different fiscal space and may


                                                                                                                                  82
need more time to meet the 50 percent requirement, states are granted a 5-year grace period to provide
the funds. Therefore, an annual evaluation of disbursements may be misleading and does not really
make sense given the context. There have been more recent discussions by UBEC on reducing the grace
period to 2 years and offering increased access to banking facilities for the states to borrow, if they
wish, to match the amount. This would also help control potential opportunities for misuse of funds. It
is also noteworthy that matching grant funds are off-budget since they are neither in the federal nor
the state level budgets.

148.     That said, there are two additional reasons that prevent states from accessing matching grant
funds despite UBEC having relaxed the matching requirement from 70 to 50 percent, technically
making it easier for states to meet the requirement: (1) some states (such as Lagos, Edo and Kogi) do
not accurately plan for the financial needs over time and do not take into account inflation, displaying
institutional inefficiency in managing projects. In Lagos, for example, utilization of funds is affected by
inflationary pressures, where the initial cost evaluation of the project may not reflect the actual cost at
the implementation stage, making it difficult to complete the initial project phases before requesting
the next round of release. This is a problem since one of the conditions for release is the execution of
the previous request. In addition, the fact that the slow pace of procurement and construction allows
inflation to manifest and translate into higher costs is also in itself a source of inefficiency. (2) How
much a state government is willing to commit to the infrastructure fund, and how fast it accesses these
funds, depends on political will, and on its stake in education matters. But overall, as stated above,
states with a significant need for infrastructure development tend to access matching grants at a higher
rate (such as Kano, Bauchi and Anambra).

149.     As indicated above, observations on fund utilization across states reveal that there is a clear
lack of evidence-based, problem-driven policy choices; instead policy often appears to be motivated by
political considerations. Different states in Nigeria face different challenges but the UBEC program
tends to implement uniform intervention in all states regardless of the need. For example, regarding
the share of funds allocated to redress educational imbalances, all funds have been distributed equally
to each state. Based on the most complete data year (2011), all states received about 2.2 percent of all
allocations, except for a few states that did not tap into their matching grant funds (Ebonyi) or that
only collected part of it (Enugu). Figure 37 presents funds disbursed by UBEC in 2011 against the out-
of-school rate, which clearly shows the need-blind, equal allocation practice.76

 We used 2011 disbursement as it represents the most reliable data because of the five-year grace period of
matching grant release.

150.     Some aspects of the creation of UBEC and its affiliated programs have been successful and
others less so. The establishment of SBMCs in all basic education institutions in Nigeria is one of the
two main potentially successful provisions of the UBE Act, the other success being the establishment
of the automation of teachers’ salary payment. Although there has been no rigorous impact evaluation
of the UBEC program since its inception, there is much evidence showing that automation of salary
payment is a key milestone for the UBE law. On the other hand, the evidence is less readily available
regarding the SBMCs and its full impact is yet to unfold; most SBMCs were established between 2011
and 2014 and most started their activities between 2012 and 2014. Even though it is too soon to evaluate
the effect of SBMCs on basic education service delivery, there are two concerns at this early stage for
policymakers to consider: (i) although education is free and compulsory by law it appears that SBMC
leaders tend to substitute an informal fee collection for the now abolished formal fee. For example in
Kano, schools, through the SBMC, still collect about the same amount from parent contributions as
they did before the abolition of fees. In addition, parents with more than one child in school have to
contribute to the SBMC for each child. This situation may counter the intended effect, given that
although one of the objectives of SBMC is to raise funds for the school with the intention of providing
required resources and expand access to education for the community, it may also cause parents who
are unable to pay the fees to withdraw the children from school. (ii) If SBMCs are not fully engaged in
the decisions on key issues in the running of the school, including teacher evaluations and financial
management, the SBMC itself may become a weak and ineffective institution, especially since its
members are there on a voluntary basis, which has implications for the sustainability of the committee.
In all six of the focus states, none of the SBMCs are empowered to fulfill their intended purpose, which
suggests a close monitoring of the role effectively assigned to SBMCs.

151.   Under the current resource allocation formula and given the states’ ability to generate internal
revenue, it is apparent that some states have already stretched their resource use and are very unlikely




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   84
to mobilize additional funds77 to achieve the universal basic education full access target. Figure 38
presents the salaries in basic education as a share of (i) the total of LGA revenue and (ii) the statutory
allocation from federation accounts. In some states, the share of salaries is already taking up more than
half of their total statutory allocation or more than a third of their total revenue, and therefore, with
the given resources, it is impossible to cover the cost needed. For example, in Kogi state, 149 percent
of the current spending is needed, but given that they already spend close to 60 percent of their
statutory allocation on salaries, and even if all of the LGA’s statutory allocation is spent on salaries, they
can only increase their spending by 40 percent instead of 149 percent. In addition, many states face
state-specific political challenges—at times intangible—to expanding access, that affect the proper
utilization of the available resources, let alone allowing an increase in resources.

152.     While all states have their own specific issues, it is very clear that some Nigerian states are
fiscally or geopolitically constrained in their efforts to achieve universal basic education and there is a
rationale for the federal government to scale-up assistance in such areas for greater improvements of
efficiency. In reference to this issue, the following question was asked during the qualitative data
collection: “From your assessment what are the key political economy, cultural and social factors that
affect outcomes of equity, quality and access to schooling in the state?” and the answer varies greatly
across the six states. For example, access is not an issue in some states but a challenge in many others
states mainly due to parents’ views of education as alien to their culture. In contrast, poverty and
limited funds constitute the main problem in almost all northern states, albeit for different reasons.

77The lack of fund mobilization abilities also hinges on two factors: (i) given the decrease in oil revenues, there
are concerns that states might cut back on spending in human development areas such as education; better
contingency planning is needed to avoid such scenarios, (ii) given the relative fiscal autonomy of each state,
reallocation of resources across state borders is not a viable possibility and, therefore, limits options that might
otherwise be available.

Summary of key conclusions

153.     Inequality in access to education widely observed in the Nigeria across geographical zones,
incomes status, gender, and areas of residence, but there are specific concerns about inequality facing
the children from poor families, in particular those from the northern part of the country. Nigeria’s
overall low education performance is clearly driven by the poor performance in the northern states. In
particular, 30 percent of children aged 6-14 years old are out-of-school in Nigeria, and 95 percent of
them live in the northern states, with the incidence increasing faster among girls, children from the
poorest two income quintiles and in rural areas. In particular, although there are both demand and
supply side reasons that explain this finding, the analysis clearly shows that public finance matters in
reducing the out-of-school rate.

154.    The analysis shows that the reason Nigeria is not achieving key milestones in basic education
such as the MDGs, is the lag in the northern states. This has been observed through all levels of
education, pre-school to junior secondary. For example the primary GER is as low as 17 percent in the
north compared with the highest rate of 133 percent in the south. Similarly, NER at ECD stands at 2
percent in the poorest quintile while in the richest it goes up to 5 percent, which is another key driver
of inequality. To a lesser extent, inequalities in gender and across areas, also contribute to the problem.

155.    Despite ECD provision being a key focus of efforts to reduce inequality, the UBE program
currently covers only one year of pre-primary education, although the sector officially recognizes ECD
as covering children aged 3-5 years old. The current enrollment in ECD shows that this level of
education is mostly used by children from wealthier households, but there are clear benefits that could
accrue to children from lower income households as well, such as greater on-time enrollment. Given
the three tenets of education investment: invest early, invest smartly and invest for all, the weaker
focus on ECD programs and the inequality at this stage could hamper future efforts for inclusive growth
and equal opportunities.

156.     As indicated in the previous chapter, total public spending in education as a share of GDP
stagnated at 1.7 percent between 2009 and 2013. It remains low compared to the average SSA spending
(4.6%) and is also below GPE recommended levels (4.7%). Even in terms of the share of total public
spending, education only represented about 12.5 percent of total spending in 2013, whereas the GPE
sets its recommendation at 20 percent of total spending. In addition, the analysis shows that public
spending also tends to be pro-rich in the north while spending in the south tends to be pro-poor,
therefore reinforcing inequalities in the northern part of the country, instead of alleviating them.

157.     Higher financial commitment both from the public budget and from households could lead to
a reduction in the out-of-school incidence. According to the analysis, greater public as well as
household spending per student tends to be associated with higher probability of school attendance.
Indeed, states with higher revenue generating capacities are better equipped to spend more on
education, as households from the southern states, and more generally affluent households, tend to
prioritize education more as reflected in their investment patterns in education. These households also
tend to increase their investment proportionately more over time than poorer households or
households from the northern states. As a result, resources available per child in the northern states
and in general from poorer households tend to be significantly lower, negatively impacting education
outcomes.

                                                                                                        86
158.     Public spending in education tends to be pro-rich, or benefit the rich more, in the northern
zones while the southern states tend to demonstrate pro-poor spending. Education spending however
is still more equitable than income disparity across all zones. The fact that education outcomes are
lower in northern states, this highlights the failure of the financial allocation mechanism to adequately
respond to the needs on the ground. The available regional-level data clearly show positive correlations
between government spending and education outcomes. These findings suggest that increasing
spending in lagging states is likely to narrow the geographic inequalities. Yet, in the current allocation
framework, federal government spending on basic education is not related to regional income
inequality or other social factors that determine participation rates in schooling. Since the federal
government does not have a policy for providing compensatory funding for poorer states, total
government spending is biased towards wealthier states as well as affluent families within the states.

159.    There are large variations in unit costs across states, which could indicate underlying
differences in the governance system linked to resource allocation, distribution and utilization. The
variation in unit costs across states could reflect (i) unequal variations in resource allocations, (ii)
variations in efficiency, and (iii) variations in the number of children in the education system in each
province. These variations could also translate into differences in the amount charged as school fees to
households. Furthermore, this also reflects the capacity of the state to generate internal revenue and
free up additional resources for schooling. Given that the resource allocation formula is politically
determined, it is impossible for the states to equalize unit cost under the current governance structure.

160.     To accommodate all out-of-school children, it is estimated that spending in education should
increase by about 36 percent. An analysis of the efficiency in the use of resources indicates that Nigeria
could save 25 percent of its resources if all states were as effective as the most efficient state, but that
even if states were to utilize the resources efficiently, 17 of the 19 northern states would still require
additional resources compared to only 6 of the 17 in the south. The extent of the additional help
required by states ranges from 1 percent in Kwara to 149 percent in Kogi state. However, the states’
ability to respond to this need is, as described earlier, limited to their revenue generating capacity, and
therefore on the flexibility within their fiscal space to accommodate higher spending in education,
including increasing human resources.

161.     Although the UBE legal framework allows for a fair level of intergovernmental policy
alignment and coordination, it also entails implementation challenges at the secondary school level and
does not provide a clear accountability framework. As for school management for example, one of the
key components of the UBE Act (2004) entails the disarticulation of junior secondary from senior
secondary schools. However, the application of this component has not been uniform across all states,
in part due to the fact that the UBE law has been ratified in each state with modifications. Some states
have chosen to physically combine their primary and junior secondary schools by building onto
existing primary schools, for example, while others have not. Some states facing fiscal constraints have
yet to start the disarticulation process at all. And due to general dissatisfaction with the rolling out of
the disarticulation process, some states have even started a re-articulation process, bringing back the
junior secondary schools to their original arrangements. This has resulted in various degrees of
disarticulation across the country and therefore an uneven application of the law.

162.  The institutional framework set up by the UBE Act, which aims at to ensure both
implementation effectiveness and policy alignment and coordination in the provision of universal basic

                                                                                                         87
education, fails to ensure performance and only succeeds, to some extent, in intergovernmental and
interagency coordination. The institutional framework does not ensure full alignment of political,
managerial, professional and social accountability: UBE executive agencies at federal and state levels
(UBEC and SUBEBs) are not accountable to the line ministry; UBEC is not accountable to state
governments; teachers are not held accountable for results; SBMCs’ oversight of school management
has yet to be operationalized, and LGEAs are not accountable to local governments.

163.    There is a disconnect between the objective of UBE and the allocation of the intervention fund
across the states, which rests on a principle of political equity and is not determined on needs or
performance. Although the objectives of the law are clearly laid out: to ensure “free, compulsory and
universal basic education for every child of primary and junior secondary school-age,” the allocation
of UBE funds has not been targeted to the geographical areas which demonstrate the greatest gaps in
access to education, and therefore have the greatest need for intervention. For example, the matching
grant allocation formula is mostly motivated by a principle of political equity rather than a problem-
driven approach.

164.     The UBE Act also provides that “any principal, headmaster, teacher or P.T.A official who
obtains fees is guilty of an offence punishable with a N10,000 fine or three months of imprisonment or
both” and that “the stipulated period of schooling is free and no one is allowed to charge for it” (UBE
Act 2004). However, it is common practice for schools to charge parents with PTA contributions or
other fee collections; in fact, school fees constitute around 55 percent of total education expenditures,
which constitutes a violation of the UBE law and, as mentioned earlier, is an indication of the
inconsistency in its implementation. The law requires parents to send their children to school. But this
gap in the application of UBE renders enforcement difficult and by failing to enact the free education
component, could also promote the exclusion of poorer children from school, thus increasing inequity
in access. In particular, given that the northern part of the country has higher poverty rates, such a
failure could further exacerbate the exclusion rate there.

165.    Cost sharing by state governments as a requirement for accessing UBE funds, such as the 50
percent requirement on the matching grant component of funds channeled through UBEC, has created
constraints on states to adequately access the funds, especially on those states that are already fiscally
more constrained, and therefore has limited the application and success of the implementation of the
UBE program. The matching grant allocation formula is mostly motivated by a principle of political
equity rather than a problem-driven approach. In effect, it has resulted in uneven disbursement rates
across the states, i.e. an actual distribution of funds which is at odds with the allocation formula.

166.    Private schools tend to be more present in the south than in the north, contributing to the
access gap between the two zones, and they tend to accommodate children from affluent families more
while religious and public schools tend to be more important for children from poorer households.
Increasing private school provision, and thereby providing alternatives for more affluent households,
would free up resources in the public sector that could be used to target children from poorer
households. However, the current management system does not account for an increased provision of
private providers as part of the UBE program, or in the budget allocation framework.

167.    Despite the implementation of automatic promotion, repetition rates and dropout rates are still
a source of internal inefficiency in basic education, with 11 percent dropout rate in primary, a 6 percent


                                                                                                       88
rate in junior secondary, and repetition rates close to 5 percent for both levels. The analysis shows that
the incidence of repetition and dropout in basic education corresponds to a public deadweight loss
equivalent to 18 percent of total spending and 14 percent of household spending.

168.     The existing accountability framework does not promote performance. For example, there is
no incentive built-into the UBE law that would reward adherence to the disarticulation process of
junior secondary schools, such as financial incentives tied to the rate of disarticulation. As a result states
have no added motivation to obey the law and rather prefer to modify it as they see fit given their
socio-economic context. At the same time, the partial enforcement of the law effectively undermines
the relevance of the other components of the law, which could have been easily implemented. For
example, if the disarticulation process has not taken place in a secondary school, given that the school
collects fees from parents of senior secondary students, it is typically next to impossible to prevent fee
collection from the junior secondary parents as well, even though junior secondary is supposed to be
free according to the law.

169.      A lack of transparency and awareness in basic education management renders the system
complex and creates a fragile environment. There is a clear lack of communication between the
different actors in the service delivery value chain, and their associated roles and responsibilities are
often unclear, which creates confusion and affects the ability to properly enforce accountability. For
example, it is very common for teachers to be unaware of the source of financing of their salaries and
it is often unclear to them whom to contact in order to raise issues to. In Kano, although UBEC
discontinued the school feeding program (even though the program is required under the UBE Act), it
was later taken up by the state. However, it is usual to still find the common misconception that UBEC
is still funding the school feeding program. In yet another case, although it happens that UBE policy
on resource allocation changes from time to time, it is not clear whether the changes are initiated based
on a critical assessment of the program or due to pressure in the form of criticism from the states. In
such circumstances, it is hard to enforce other stipulations of the law, for example, requiring that
parents must send their children to school.



Key policy recommendations


Strengthen the legal and institutional environment in education policy implementation

170.    To improve policy implementation and ensure policy objectives are met, executive agencies
should be accountable for the results to the relevant line ministries. For that purpose, a performance
agreement would be helpful to frame the relationship between the ministry of education and UBEC at
federal level and between SUBEBs and the state ministries of education at state level. A similar
agreement could be envisaged at the local level to link LGEAs and LGAs. This would also help leverage
synergies and complementarities between the respective institutional capacities and mandates of the
principals (ministries) and their agents (UBEC, SUBEBs, LGEAs) and reduce the overall cost of the
governance framework in basic education.

171.    There should be a national framework ensuring enforcement and compliance with education
policy across states while operating within the boundaries of the states’ constitutional rights. An


                                                                                                           89
education policy framework would enable the enforcement of disarticulation, for example, taking into
account the variation in the states’ fiscal rigidities and therefore their ability to financially take on the
associated costs of disarticulation. This would allow channeling of additional funds to support those
states that need additional help.

172.     The role of local governments can be better leveraged. As it is, local governments are hardly
autonomous in Nigeria; their chairman is often appointed by the state governor and local elections are
a rare occurrence. Although in principle they spend, on average, close to one-third of their resources
on primary education (CBN, 2013), they also hardly play any effective role in basic education since
their funds are, in effect, mostly managed by state governments; this deprives basic education of a
potentially useful institutional lever and social accountability mechanism. The role of local
governments in basic education remains a topic of political debate; there is an urgent need for a review
of this role, as local governments are a critical factor in local education governance, potentially both
positive and negative. The participation of local government councils in SBMCs and LGEAs can be
considered as well as their involvement in the decision-making process and supervision of school
performance.



Create incentive mechanisms in basic education policies and ensure alignment of resources with sector
priorities

173.    To ensure successful implementation of national policies, there should be an incentives
framework encouraging compliance and an adequate budget should be allotted to that effect. To
effectively achieve the objectives of the UBE Act, the resource allocation formula of the UBE
intervention fund should be defined within a results-based intervention framework and therefore
should be policy-driven, and as such it should focus on states with the greatest needs.

174.     In order to enhance the implementation effectiveness of basic education policies, the
institutional framework needs to be streamlined horizontally by rationalizing the distribution of roles
and responsibility between the line ministry and the executive agencies at federal and state level and
pooling their resources (e.g. for quality assurance and M&E). It should also be streamlined vertically
by ensuring effective subsidiarity of higher levels of government through adequate devolution of
responsibility and integration of information. This can be done by framing the relationship between
the ministry of education and UBEC at federal level and between SUBEBs and the state ministries of
education at state level. A similar agreement could be envisaged at local level to link LGEAs and LGAs.
This would also help leverage synergies and complementarities between the respective institutional
capacities and mandates of the principals (ministries) and their agents (UBEC, SUBEBs, LGEAs) and
reduce the overall cost of the governance framework of basic education.

175.   Building on interstate coordination/consultation could help foster emulation and
mainstreaming of best practices across the states, especially given the variety of institutional set ups
and practices across Nigerian states. The National Council of Education could anchor such peer learning
and exchange of experience between state officials and other stakeholders. A benchmarking framework
of education indicators at the state level should be established to promote such knowledge exchange.
For example, states that successfully went through disarticulation of junior secondary schools should
be taken as an example for other states to estimate the cost and learn from the process.

                                                                                                          90
176.    In addition to strengthening the managerial accountability of basic education executive
agencies (UBEC, SUBEBs, LGEAs), the role of school principals should also be further strengthened
and operationalized: 1) school principals need be granted leeway to exercise their important role in
managing, supervising and mentoring teachers and endowed with the qualifications to do so; and 2)
they need to be provided the necessary management tools to that effect, i.e. the information to allow
them to assess and benchmark their school performance (school score cards are essential for that
purpose – the experience in Lagos state under the World Bank EKO secondary education project
showed that such assessment and benchmarking tools also help build collective accountability and
leadership at the school level, supporting further the school principal in the exercise of their managerial
responsibilities); 3) the oversight of School-Based Management Committees on school management
should also be a potent social accountability check and should be operationalized to that effect.

177.    Establish goals and targets that could be nurtured from time-to-time with commensurate
incentive packages focusing on policy priorities. For example, in states with high-out-of-school rates,
results-based contractual agreements could be made with incentive packages added upfront at the
project design stage.



Ensure adequate education budget with focus on lagging states and communities

178.    Increase spending on education targeting the challenge areas. As it currently stands, public
investment in education in Nigeria, at 12.9 percent of total public spending and 1.7 percent of GDP is
far below the recommended levels to effectuate any real change in the sector. In addition, due to the
constraints of operating within the federal system, federal intervention should be carried out in
coordination with the states. Higher education spending would enable states to meet their biggest
challenges, including helping to increase access, through targeted investments.

179.     An increase in public education spending would enable the states to carry out necessary
interventions to target basic education challenges and to address the inequity issues. Introducing
explicit mechanisms to ensure more effective coordination of resource mobilization between the three
tiers of government would allow the country to reach its goals faster and more efficiently. In particular,
given that all tiers of government share the same goals in basic education, it is vital to ensure they are
all coordinating their efforts and resources to achieve these goals in the most efficient way possible.
This should include: clearly identifying how much each tier is contributing to basic education, where
the gaps are in education outcomes, and how to help bridge the financial need.

180.     Use unit cost as an instrument in the preparation of policies aimed at accommodating out-of-
school children into the education system. The cost of accommodating the out-of-school children is
and reasonably within the means of the country but requires a strong financial commitment on behalf
of the government. The analysis shows that to accommodate all out-of-school children, spending in
education should increase by about 42 percent. In addition, given that the issue is one that especially
affects girls and children from poor households, this would be one of the key areas in which the
government could clearly align its investment strategy with its agenda for greater equity.

181.   Decentralization, under the right conditions, can help foster political accountability, but does
not remedy the inequality across states. On the contrary, financial decentralization can widen


                                                                                                        91
disparities to the detriment of poorer states. In order to redress this issue, there should be a built-in
commitment to equity in the financing formula adopted for resource allocation. It is important for the
federal government to retain a strong redistributive role, facilitating the transfer of resources from
federal sources to poorer states and LGAs. In determining the financing formula underlying transfers
to states, the federal government should pay particular attention to equity indicators—such as poverty
levels, resource availability and share of children out of school—guided by the principle that those in
greatest need should receive the most support.



Earmark budget for basic education reducing potential inefficient use of funds in the sector

182.      The basic education sector budget should be earmarked. As it currently stands, staff salary is
withheld at source based on the number of staff in the system, which is a first step, but having a full-
fledged earmarked budget is necessary for proper planning and evaluation of the sector. In addition,
adequate Human Resources management should be prioritized as a way to save misallocated resources
(e.g. inflated administrative and non-teaching staff) while incentivizing teachers’ and school managers’
performance, for example through a more enticing wage structure.



Adopt governance and financing strategies to address poverty, social, cultural and other barriers to
achieving education goals

183.    Institute pro-poor education policy intervention programs focusing on marginalized
communities. This may include conditional cash transfers (CCT) to parents to send their children to
school, or school feeding programs targeting children from poor families, rural areas or even girls, as
poverty is one of the factors that hinders school participation. Impact evaluations in a number of
countries show positive results from such targeted interventions on school attendance rates including
CCTs targeting girls in Pakistan, Mexico and Brazil, school meals in rural India and Kenya, and girls’
scholarship programs in Cambodia and Indonesia, (see Annex D for details).

184.     Ensure schools are equipped to provide a gender-friendly environment, for example, having
adequate toilets and sanitary facilities on the school premises, and access to water; but also ensuring
female teachers and staff are adequately represented to make the school environment attractive and
safe for female students and give parents confidence to send their children to school. For example, with
assistance from UNICEF, Ethiopia began implementing the CFS program in 2007 in 51 selected primary
schools with an estimated reach of more than 80,000 students. The program sought to improve
education quality, outcomes and childhood development by addressing perceived school-based barriers
that limit access to education and participation in school. Interventions included renovation or
construction of classrooms, teaching and ECD centers, libraries, and water and sanitation facilities;
provision of furniture, education materials, equipment, and uniforms. The results were positive in all
aspects (see Annex D for details).

185.    Government should consider the expansion of alternative learning programs to provide second
chance education for parents and youth. Adequate provision of UBE opportunities for parents could
have positive effects, not only in raising their own education level, but also in motivating them to send
their own children to school and gradually narrow the equity gap. For example, given that the out-of-

                                                                                                      92
school issue is most pressing in the north, where poverty rates are higher, parents are less educated,
and resources are sparser, funds could be dedicated to increasing the public provision of schooling. As
found in the analysis, poorer households tend to depend on public and religious schools more, and
targeting an increase in public provision in the north could have a significant impact on reducing the
out-of-school incidence for inequality improvement. This program has been implemented in several
countries with similar issues. For example, Alistair Smith (2008) noted the benefits of accelerated
learning programs across four core dimensions: (i) process: creating awareness of learning, (ii)
psychological: developing relationships for learning, (iii) psychological: ensuring readiness for learning,
and (iv) physical: creating movement and space for learning. Such programs have been successfully
implemented in emergency and post-conflict situations (Baxter and Bethke, UNESCO 2009).78
Similarly, an impact evaluation of Mali’s speed schools confirms that such programs successful
reintegrate out-of-school children into the formal public school system79 (see Annex D for details).

186.     Strengthen SBMCs and other community-level grassroots mobilization to generate awareness
for education. SBMCs could also develop sensitization campaigns for communities to overcome social
and cultural barriers to such practices as girls’ education in those areas that are more sensitive to these
issues and where girls might be lagging. This can be done by providing enough resources, both technical
and financial, for effective utilization of SBMCs. Regularly prepare community oriented programs
through the SBMC to increase parent participation in school events and child activities at school. Given
that one of the main factors explaining why children are out of school is the fact that many parents of
children and children themselves express no interest in pursuing an education, SBMCs have a
particularly important role in creating awareness about the benefits of education. For example, in 2002
the Government of Indonesia empowered public school committees with a greater role in advising and
supporting school management, and also promoting engagement with the community. School
committees in treatment schools received a grant conditional on the school committees developing an
expenditure plan, which had to be posted on the school notice board. They also received a combination
of three interventions – training, democratic election of school committee members, or a linkage to the
village council through facilitated meetings. The impact was positive and was measured based on
education outcomes (i.e. dropout rate, repetition rate, and test scores), and intermediate outcomes, for
example public perceptions of student learning, awareness of school committees, parental level inputs
etc. (see annex D for details).



Establish a strategic non-public school management system

187.      Enhance public-private partnerships (PPPs) within a coherent policy and regulatory
framework. Private schools in the southern part of the country are important service providers in
education, offering strong alternatives to parents, and when compared to the total unit cost in public
schools (household and public sector spending per child), private providers appear to be overall more
cost-effective. Given their apparent cost-effectiveness, and their ability to increase access to schooling,
there are clear benefits to extend private participation in the northern states where the out-of-school
issue is critical. This can be done, for example, by providing grants to private schools to enroll children

                                                                                                        93
from poor households. Such a program would significantly alleviate the pressure on the public school
system to build thousands of additional classrooms to accommodate both current and future students.
At the same time, increasing private school provision would give affluent families the opportunity to
increase their use of the often more attractive private schools, creating room for the public sector to
accommodate children from low and middle income families. For example, in Pakistan a Low-Cost
Private Schooling program in Rural Sindh was implemented by the Sindh Education Foundation to
increase access to primary education in underserved rural communities through PPPs with local
entrepreneurs. The program led to large gains in enrollment within both the targeted age group and
older children, with similar impacts on both girls and boys (see Annex D for details).

188.    However, for this partnership to be effective, there should be an accompanying and enforceable
accountability structure, regulating the quality and standards of education provision such as regular
monitoring and evaluation to ensure high standards of provision of services and avoid the risk of sub-
par, predatory provision. There should be a clear policy for management of private schools with clear
standards of accreditation and development of curriculum. As mentioned earlier, private school
providers can be important partners for the public sector in the provision of education services in
Nigeria, especially in remote or difficult to reach areas.

189.    The governance framework for public schools needs to be extended to government oversight
of private and religious schools, which do not yet satisfy all standards and, therefore, would gain from
being streamlined. Nigeria can benefit from the experience of other developing countries in this regard
such as Indonesia, where madrasahs have been fully integrated since 1989 and redefined from religious
schools to “regular schools with religious characteristics” (EDOREN, 2015).



Strengthen M&E system and practices to ensure consistency and enforceability

190.    The role of local governments needs to be clarified and strengthened. SBMCs and LGEAs
should establish clear accountability channels with the LGA, with regular reporting mechanisms, and
LGAs should be involved in the decision-making process for the allocation of funds to the schools that
belong to their area. They should be fully engaged in the M&E process. Empowerment of the LGA is
key in communities where grassroots campaigning for access expansion is needed.

191.    Given the financial resource constraints under which the public sector is operating, there is a
strong rationale to explore potential efficiency savings, that is, savings arising from more efficient use
of resources. Repetition and dropout rates are a source of internal inefficiency and in order to address
these issues, it is essential to ensure that the automatic promotion policy is effectively applied. In
addition, the community, through the SBMC, could coordinate with the school and parents more
closely to ensure that children stay in school. For example, an impact evaluation was carried out on a
program that involves parents directly in the management of schools located in highly disadvantaged
rural communities. The program finances parent associations and motivates parental participation by
involving them in the management of the school grants. The program resulted in an increase in the
participation of parents in monitoring school performance and decision-making as well as improved
intermediate school quality indicators (see annex D for details).




                                                                                                       94
192.    Social accountability mechanisms should be used for the monitoring of school performance.
SBMCs can be further operationalized to strengthen school management and performance oversight
and effective social accountability. In order for SBMCs to contribute effectively to the improvement of
basic education in Nigeria, their feedback and reports to state governments need to be consolidated and
publicly disclosed. This would provide all stakeholders with data on the quality of basic education —
both aggregate (at state and national level) and disaggregated (at school level); for that purpose, they
should be provided simple templates to report on a set of school-level performance indicators (student
and teacher attendance, quality of school infrastructure, etc.).

193.    Reduce duplication of efforts in basic education management, especially with respect to
supervisory roles. There are currently overlapping supervisory responsibilities across UBEC, SUBEBs
and LGEAs. This duplication of efforts has led to inefficiencies in the use of resources, and unclear
accountability channels without the added benefit of improved outcomes.



Establish response measures to direct and indirect impacts of armed conflicts on the education sector

194.     Ongoing conflict is one of the drivers of inequity in access to basic education, affecting mainly
the northern states with some spillover to nearby states. Prolonged instability could create longer term
consequences for education outcomes in those affected areas. The analysis only captured the effect of
the conflict on school participation the effect on school infrastructure and other school inputs,
including teachers, is not within the scope of this study. It is also clear that the increase in the out-of-
school rate (drop in the access rate) following the outbreak of the conflict as well as the actual damage
to the school system and infrastructure requires further investigation. The conflict may be expected to
compound the impact of pre-existing problems, such as high class size, large STR, low qualified
teachers, and poor classroom conditions. Therefore, there is a clear rationale for federal government
intervention with special technical support and additional funding to address such problems that were
direct results of the conflict.



Quality of basic education

195.    In Nigeria, concerns about the quality of education are perhaps a more pronounced issue than
concerns about access, especially since access is mainly a concern among northern states. As discussed
in the introduction, quality of learning outcomes is narrowly defined as the performance of children
in schooling at the basic education level in terms of (i) learning assessment results (ii) on time
completion of appropriate basic education levels and (iii) literacy and numeracy skills. This section
investigates whether the north-south divide, which is a central feature in the issue of access to
education, is also a prominent feature in the diagnosis of the quality of education and the outcomes
from schooling. This section is organized as follows: (i) descriptive statistics of quality indicators, (ii)
an analysis of both demand and supply side determinants of key quality indicators, including a
breakdown of key drivers of quality by social group (full analysis is presented in Annex C), and (iii) key
areas where quality improvement is needed, followed by a summary conclusion and policy
recommendations. In particular, this section aims to address the following questions:


                                                                                                         95
        Are quality of education and learning outcomes varies across geographic areas?
        Does finance matter for quality of education?
        What are key determinants of learning outcomes and what should be done to improve quality
         of education?
        Is the M&E framework adequate and reliable to implement quality services delivery?
        Does the political economy of the Nigerian education sector context promote quality
         education?


Proxy for basic education quality

196.    While many studies employ test scores or learning assessment results as proxies for quality of
education, in this section we use the broader definition of quality of education based on the Dakar
Framework for Action, adopted in 2000, which affirmed that quality was ‘at the heart of education’ –
a fundamental determinant of enrollment, retention and achievement.80 Accordingly, the following
quality indicators are used to measure quality of basic education in Nigeria: (i) primary completion rate
and on-time completion of junior secondary school; this is based on the fact that completion of
education by the official completion age leads to better post-education outcomes, including enhanced
social and economic benefits, (ii) grade 6 test results for entrance to unity college81, and (iii) numeracy
and literacy rates based on the national learning assessment in 2010/2011 and literacy rates of children
(age 11 to 14) currently enrolled in grade 4 and grade 6 of the basic education level. These indicators
are available for all 36 states and the federal capital territory (Abuja).

197.     Learning outcomes measured by results on grade 6 entrance exam shows high zonal variation.
It should be noted that there is a standardized learning assessment throughout the basic education cycle
Figure 39 shows the percentage of students with at least a 75 percent score on grade 6 standardized
tests, by state. At the national level, the results for this measure improved from 27 percent in 2010 to
41 percent in 2013. Most of the improvement over this period was driven by improvements in
performance in the northern states. This stands in contrast to the growing out-of-school rates in the
north over the same period. However, there are two key underlying factors at play in this dynamic: (i)
given that there is generally an inverse relationship between quality of education and class size, the
better learning outcomes in the northern states could be at the expense of out-of-school children. In
other words, those who do attend school in the north tend to have access to better resources including
better student-teacher ratio, smaller class size and greater access to learning materials, all of which
contribute to better performance on exams. (ii) Children who do attend school in the northern states
are mostly from relatively better educated and affluent parents. As observed earlier, these children tend
to have access to higher household per student spending, which is tied to better learning outcomes. For

80 The Dakar Framework for Action’s expanded definition of quality set out the desirable characteristics of
learners (healthy, motivated students), processes (competent teachers using active pedagogies), content
(relevant curricula) and systems (good governance and equitable resource allocation). Although this established
an agenda for achieving good education quality, it did not ascribe any relative weighting to the various
dimensions identified
81 There are 104 unity colleges operated by the Federal government in Nigeria. This exam serves as an entrance

requirement for those seeking to join these colleges and quality assessment using this indicator is therefore
limited.

                                                                                                             96
example, in Yobe only 15 percent of the children in the basic education age group were in school in
2013 and satisfactory test results for those in school increased from 9 percent in 2010 to 51 percent in
2013. At the same time, the out-of-school rate increased from 40 percent in 2010 to 85 percent in 2013
which further corroborates the assumption that the improved performance rates are artificially
improving, driven mostly by the fact that resources are devoted to a much smaller group of students.
Only two states, Zamfara and Gombe, both in the north, have registered a decrease in the share of
students having obtained at least 75 percent on the grade 6 exam.

198.     Both primary and junior secondary completion in Nigeria is low with a clear north-south
divide. Figure 40 shows the primary and junior secondary completion rate by state. Completion of the
education cycle is contingent on the ability of the educational system to retain students throughout the
cycles, and also reflects the quality of learning. When the school quality is low, both parents and youth
tend to reduce the importance they attach to education. Low school quality coupled with a lack of
motivation at school, act as factors pushing students to drop out by hindering student achievement and
progress82. Poor organizational features of schools, such as a lack of clear and rigorous school goals,
appear to amplify such push factors: youth who dropped out perceive teachers to be less interested in
them, and viewed school discipline as ineffective and inequitably applied83. This particular measure of
quality is highly correlated with out-of-school incidence; a similar regression model to one run in the
out-of-school analysis is employed here and the results are summarized later in this section.

199.     The literacy rate is a key indicator of learning outcomes and one of the basic skills necessary in
the workplace; the literacy rate among youth who have completed grade 6 reached 84 percent in 2010.
Figure 41 shows the literacy rate for children aged 11-14 attending grade 4 and 6 in 2010. This figure
indicates that there are strong dynamics in the development of literacy skills between grade 4 and grade
6. For example, in 2010, the literacy rate at grade 4 stood at 71 percent compared with 84 percent for
those in grade 6. However, by international standards, children after grade 3 are expected to be fully
literate. Nigeria’s low quality performance has been highlighted in three different studies, which also
point out that quality varies from state to state and is particularly low in the north. The three studies
include: (i) the 2015 SDI study in 4 states (Anambra, Bauchi, Ekiti and Niger), which showed that
student test scores in the southern two states (Anambra and Ekiti) were better than those in Bauchi
and Niger, (ii) ESSPIN and UKAID (2010), assessed 6 states (Enugu, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Kwara and
Lagos) and found that Kwara state had better scores in Mathematics both in public and private schools
and had better English scores in private schools. And (iii) an early grade 3 reading test (RTI
international and USAID, 2011) found that reading levels for two northern states, Sokoto and Bauchi,
were low. These studies all reflect the same conclusions, that quality of education is an issue both in
the northern and southern states, albeit slightly more so in the north. Since we have data for all states
on the literacy status of grade 4 and 6 students, the modeling analysis uses these indicators to determine
which factors influence learning outcomes. Similar results were observed from learning assessment at
grade 3 based on Math, English and life sciences test results (Annex C).

Determinants of learning outcomes

200.    A summarized spatial analysis clearly indicates that there is a divide in terms of quality
indicators between the north and south geopolitical zones but the divide is not as severe as in the case
of access. Annex C, Figure C 1 presents the geographical representation of key basic education quality
indicators by state. While this figure clearly highlights the quality issues facing the education sector, it
is very important to investigate the supply and demand factors other than finance, which include
cultural and social aspects, which may also factor into these results.

201.     Similar to the equity analysis, several econometric models are employed to investigate how
demand and supply side factors affect the key learning outcome indicators described above. While the
models and factors used in this section are the same as in the equity case (except in the decomposition
model), for the learning outcomes assessment, public financial inputs are measured in two ways: (i)
direct financial input, which consists of availability of public resources per student and financial
wellbeing of the states, and (ii) quality of resources used, measured by the student teacher ratio, class
size, average salary of teachers and share of qualified teachers (this is the only difference from the out-
of-school factors). As stated above, we used five indicators as proxies for quality of educational: grade
6 test score, literacy rate after completion of grades 4 and 6, primary completion rate, and junior
secondary completion rate (Annex C presents a series of regression tables and detailed discussion). In
summary the results show that: (i) financial indicators are key determinants of learning outcomes--the
effect of direct financial input (public unit cost, state revenue per school-age child, household unit cost,
and teachers’ salaries) and indirect financial input (STR, class size and share of qualified teachers),
affects all the key learning indicators, and (ii) learning outcomes are more sensitive to supply side
factors than demand side factors like gender, area of residence, and wealth status of the household,
among others.



                                                                                                               99
Effective utilization and management of human resources

202.     This section highlights two aspects of HRM in education that affect learning outcomes: (i)
teachers’ motivation and in-class teaching skills, and (ii) number of teachers relative to the number of
children. Teachers’ financial compensation is one of the main sources of motivation, and this section
investigates whether teachers remuneration levels are optimal and in line with the objectives of the
sector. In particular, evidence from teachers’ assessments, such as the SDI study in four states
(Anambra, Bauchi, Ekiti and Niger), a ESSPIN and UKaid study in five states (Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano,
Kwara and Lagos), and an RTI International and USAID study in two states (Bauchi and Sokoto),
concluded that (a) teachers often go on strike to press for salary raises and (b) teachers’ competence
level is very low. In terms of the adequacy of the number of teachers, the STR is one of the main
determinants of learning outcomes. This section explores the question of whether management of
teachers by the states and the salary payments by the LGAs has created some bottlenecks in the
adequate recruitment of teachers.

203.     Education sector staff represents the largest share of the public wage bill in the north, although
in terms of actual number there are fewer teachers in the north compared to the south. Figure 42 shows
(a) trends in total number of education sector staff and their average annual growth rate, and (b) the
share of primary school teachers in the total public wage bill and its average annual growth rate. There
is a disproportionately lower number of education sector employees in the north relative to the number
of students, which explains the larger STR; the ongoing conflicts in this area could also be an important
factor in explaining the relatively low number of teachers. This is an important issue, especially given
the strong growth potential and educational needs in this area of the country.

204.     At the national level, the relative share of education sector staff in the total public wage bill
increased by 1 percentage point between 2010 and 2012 (from 23 percent to 24 percent). As mentioned
earlier and despite having a smaller share of education sector staff, the north has a higher proportion
of education sector staff in the total public wage bill and this proportion is growing faster than in the
south. In addition, the fact that they have fewer teachers but maintain a very high ratio of teachers as
share of total public employment suggests that not only is the education sector affected in the north,
but so are other sectors, which have indirect effect on education such as child health provision. As
stated above, lack of employment opportunities, either in the public or private sectors, has prevented
the north from realizing the benefits of education through better employment.

205.     In some northern states, the share of education staff in the public wage bill is more than 50
percent. Figure 43 shows the share of teachers in the total wage bill and the share of administrative
staff in basic education by state. The administrative staff ratio is on average only 11 percent of total
staffing, indicating that teachers account for the largest share in the wage bill. In particular, in some
northern states teachers represent a very high share of total public workers, such as in Zamfara (60
percent), Katsina (53 percent), and Gombe (43 percent), while only Ekiti in the south has a relatively
high share (37 percent). This trend implies that there is a need for better teacher management policies,
especially in the north. In addition, the large share of education staff in the wage bill is an indicator of
a potential tendency for political patronage, whereby the teachers’ lobbying may influence and
determine teacher quality enhancement policies.

206.    The overall trend in growth in the number of s between 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 indicates
that there has been a greater focus on junior secondary, where teaching staff grew on average 9.6
percent compared with 0.4 percent at the primary level over the same two-year period. Figure 44 shows
the growth in the number of teachers for primary and junior secondary education between 2010/2011
and 2012/2013 by geographical zone. The primary level registered the most modest overall national
growth, with the northern states having the highest average growth rates, ranging between 1.2 and 1.7
percent, while the South East and South West recorded a drop in the number of teachers over that
same period. On the other hand, recruitment of teachers at the junior secondary level was relatively
strong with an overall average growth rate of 9.6 percent, driven mostly by the increase in South East
(18%) and South South (17%), but also in North Central (17%). In comparison, growth rates in the
north, particularly North East and North West were much more modest at 5.6 percent and 0.7 percent
respectively. However, since the quality, as well as quantity, of teachers matter, in terms of impact on
education outcomes, there is no evidence that an increase in the number of teachers leads to an increase
in learning outcomes, but it is important that the number of teachers grows proportionately to student
growth to maintain a manageable STR.

207.     Growth in the number of teachers is not aligned with growth trends in student enrollment.
Figure 45 shows the growth rates of teachers and associated growth rates in number of students at both
levels of education by geopolitical zone. The greatest shortfall in the teacher-student trends is at the
primary level where on average student enrollment grew by 6.1 percent while the number of teachers
grew on average 0.4 percent over the 2010/2011-2012/2013 period. The gap was particularly large in
the south with the South East and South West showing the largest deficit. On the other hand,
nationwide teacher growth at the junior secondary level (9.6%) far exceeded the growth in student
enrollment (-0.7%) at that level of education, across all geopolitical zones, most predominantly in the
South East and South South as well as North Central. Student enrollment at the junior secondary level
dropped between 2010/2011 and 2012/2013, mostly driven by a fall in enrollment in North West (-
4.2%) and South East (-9.4%), whereas teacher growth in those two zones stood at 0.7 and 18.1 percent
respectively. Overall, the trends in growth rates, in both teachers and students, does not suggest any
specific impact on education outcomes, especially in the northern zones.

208.    On the other hand, the lack of qualified teachers, within both the primary and junior
secondary, is mostly a concern within the northern states and has direct implications on the education
outcomes. Figure 46 shows the share of qualified teachers for each level of education by zone. The lack
of qualified teachers is particularly important at the primary level in the North East and North West
zones. When considering the availability of qualified teachers in the existing teaching staff pool, the
STR based only on available qualified teachers (Annex B, Figure B12) indicates that there is an
inadequate number of qualified teachers relative to the currently enrolled students within both the
primary and junior secondary levels in those two northern zones. At national level, the STR at the
primary level increased from 40:1 to 65:1, and from 33:1 to 39:1 at the junior secondary level, driven
mostly by the higher STR in the North East and North West zones. In particular at the primary level,
the STR in the North West increased from 37 to 104 when considering only qualified teachers. This
dramatic worsening appears mainly due to the Boko Haram insurgency, which led many teachers refuse
to work in these zones. The lack of qualified teachers may be linked to the lower learning outcomes
observed earlier in the north, such as the lower grade 6 results, completion rates and literacy rates.

209.     Average class size across Nigeria, often closely correlated with STR, were on average around
66 and 61 students in primary and junior secondary respectively, and tend to be higher in the North
than in the South in both primary and junior secondary levels of education. Figure 47 shows the class
size in both primary and junior secondary by zone and the relationship between junior secondary STR
and class size. The North East and North West had the highest class sizes with on average 63 and 69
students per classroom in primary and 70 and 79 students per classroom in junior secondary. STRs are
lower than that in the North East and North West; so the higher class sizes within these two zones may
indicate a lack of adequate infrastructure to accommodate all students. The strong correlation between
class size and STR at the junior secondary level suggests that states with higher class size also suffer
from high STR, which appears to heavily affect the northern states though there is some variation
within the zones as well.

210.     Overall, although competence of teachers matters for learning outcomes, qualifications of
teachers also matter in impacting education outcomes. Figure 48 shows the correlation between the
share of qualified teachers in primary schools, primary class size, and grade 6 test results. While there
is a clear correlation between learning outcomes and share of qualified teachers, class size does not
have a strong direct effect. However, it should be noted that, in the modeling section, class size does
negatively affect learning outcomes, when controlling for other factors. This clearly suggest that class
size by itself is not a problem but when other factors are added, its compounded effect does matter. The
southern part of the country tends to have a relatively high share of qualified teachers and lower class
sizes, even if the differences compared to the north are not as pronounced as variation in educational
outcomes. This is another aspect where financial input could improve learning outcomes. Additionally,
it should also be noted that although other quality related school inputs such as learning materials and
other school facilities are not fully captured in this analysis, in the states visited by the team, concerns
regarding the condition of classes, including desks and tables, were also raised.

211.    Whether it be the availability of teachers, their qualifications, level of remuneration of the
teaching staff at primary education level, or even the availability of adequate infrastructure, by its own
admission, the government recognizes that resource shortage is an important contributor to low
provision of quality education in Nigeria. For example, legal provisions have not granted basic
education enough financial resources and, according to the Nigerian government, “funding continues
to be a major problem in government’s effort to raise both quality and access to education. For instance,
some State Governments are not forthcoming when it comes to funding basic education, as many fail
to access their UBEC matching grant disbursement. Poor remuneration and working conditions of
teachers, especially at basic education level continues to discourage qualified teachers [which is
compounded by] decaying infrastructure and poor learning resources at all level.” (Bureau of Public
Service Reforms, 2014).

212.  In addition to the resource shortage, quality of education has suffered from a deterioration in
academic integrity, which the M&E system has not been able to avert due to the lack of effective

                                                                                                       106
enforcement mechanisms in the quality assurance process. Figure 49 shows the average response on
the 20 question survey administered to high-level representatives from 15 different states. The results
show that while some issues are state specific, there are a few common concerns. As shown, academic
integrity was listed as the most important concern. For example, 86 percent present of respondents
agree or strongly agree that academic integrity is a key challenge in Nigeria while only 6 percent
disagree or strongly disagree.

213.     Concerns about academic integrity extend to teachers, schools as well as students. Qualitative
information from the second technical workshop with education sector experts revealed that academic
fraud as well as the recurrent and protracted issues of teacher strikes are, in some states, key aspects of
why parents choose to send their children to private schools. The following are key highlights of the
reasons why parents are sending their children to private school despite the fact that public schools are
officially free, but in any case relatively cheaper in terms of household out-of-pocket payment: (i) in
Nigeria teachers often go on strike, sometimes for months at a time, and parents prefer to keep their
children in private schools because this ensures a degree of stability and continuity throughout the
year, (ii) quality control in some private schools is at times less stringent and students prefer to stay in
private school to benefit from an easier promotion from grade to grade, and (iii) cultural affiliations of
communities to specific private and religious schools motivate parents to pay higher fees and keep their
children in such schools84. In addition, some private schools use cheaper and less qualified teachers.

214.     The debate over teacher quality often focuses on academic fraud and false qualification but
most states face the even more basic challenge of achieving adequate levels of qualified teachers- even
if qualified just on paper. The widely perceived reason is the failure in the teacher management system
including lack of regular and consistent in-service training, proper salary review and a shortage of funds
to pay attractive salaries. Political clout of teacher unions has also been highlighted as a hindrance to
proper management of teachers; in some states it has been noted that teachers may influence the
outcome of elections, thereby wielding influence over policymakers, making it hard for the
implementation of an effective accountability structure. At the state and local levels in particular,
teachers represent a significant share of public employees and are therefore an important constituency
for elected officials. For example, a former state commissioner of education claimed that as a
commissioner he could not remove a school principal without the concurrence of the local majority
party leader85. Similarly some states attempted to institute polices that requires teachers to take a test,
but this faced strong objection from the teachers union. This reflects three specific features of education
in Nigeria: 1) the weight of local politics on the education system, 2) the influence of politics on policy
implementation and 3) the weight of the education sector on politics.




84 For example, in Kogi state repeated teachers’ strikes encourage households to keep their children in private
schools. This has led to a mushrooming of private schools in the state and a serious issue of non-compliant and
non-accredited private schools. As such, these schools charge very small fees, which leads to low unit costs in
private schools; Kogi has one the lowest private school unit cost among all states.

215.     There are inefficiencies in the teacher management system-- with overlaps in responsibilities
resulting in duplicated efforts, for example in the M&E process. All actors along the service delivery
value chain engage in parallel monitoring and evaluation activities, from UBEC, SUBEB, LGEAs to
SBMCs, but there is no clear coordination on accountability mechanisms across these various M&E
activities.

216.      The lack of a clear and uniform HRM system has several implications on the quality of teachers
as well as the ability to sustain high standards of teaching. The high share of the teaching staff in the
wage bill in Nigeria (specially at local and state government levels) has several implications; (i) as stated
above, teachers influence political outcomes, which also influence any policy for quality improvement
that requires teachers accountability, (ii) this affects the ability of LGAs to provide adequate salary rates
to increase the moral/motivation of teachers, particularly for states with apparent shortages of teaching
staff, (iii) given their low remuneration levels, teachers are often discouraged. This may also adversely
affect teaching quality, especially if the teacher is regularly absent or late, which in turn affects learning
outcomes, and lastly (iv) there is an important lack of female representation in rural areas, which
heightens gender parity issues in the sector.



                                                                                                                                          108
217.     With regards to the M&E system in Nigeria as it pertains to the regulation of the private sector,
there is a lack of clear policy guidelines and of enforcement of rules and regulations, which encourages
practices such as academic fraud- a clear source of system failure. The lower quality private schools
tend to use cheap and unqualified teachers, exploiting the failures and instability in the public school
system and even appealing to cultural sensibilities within the Nigerian population. It is worth
mentioning that there are private schools that meet high standards and in such cases, the state, such as
Lagos, has been able to promote private-public partnerships to ensure better service delivery.



Summary of key conclusions

218.     Learning outcomes, similar to access outcomes, tend to be stronger in the south. Whether
measured by primary and junior secondary completion, literacy rates in grades 4 and 6, or performance
on the standardized grade 6 examination for entry into federal unity colleges, learning outcomes
indicate a similar north-south divide but to a lesser extent than in the access indicators. Supply side
factors, whether direct measures such as public investment in education or indirect measures such as
the STR or class size as proxies, tend to be more important in explaining the variations in learning
outcomes than other factors like demand side variables such as gender, area of residence, and wealth
status of the household.

219.     Differences in learning outcomes can be linked to the availability, quality and use of the
teaching staff. The overall growth in the number of teachers, especially qualified teachers, has not kept
pace with the growth in students. In addition, there is no clear and uniform strategy in human resource
management, which in itself has several implications. Given the high share of teachers in the wage bill:
(i) teachers’ unions exert strong influence on political outcomes, which translates into strong lobbying
power on policies affecting teachers accountability, (ii) this affects the ability of LGAs to provide
adequate salary levels to motivate teachers, particularly for states where there are apparent shortages
of teachers, (iii) given the low incentive mechanism environment, teachers are often discouraged-
which may also adversely affect teaching quality, especially if the teacher is regularly absent or late
which in turn affects learning outcomes, and (iv), lastly there is an important lack of female
representation in rural areas, which presents a serious gender parity issue in the sector.

220.     The analysis shows, in turn, that adequate provision of these school inputs matter. Better
student/student-teacher and class ratios and higher per-student government spending are positively
correlated with better participation and completion rates at the regional level. Adequate school inputs,
such as the presence of better-qualified teachers, correlated with better learning outcomes. These
results cannot be interpreted in a causal manner; the findings indicate that higher government spending
and better input ratios are associated with better outcomes in public schools.

221.     There is no or very limited consistent if any and standardized assessments of learning levels or
examinations in basic education to mainstream standards and ensure quality of education, especially
given the fact that the UBE Act instituted automatic promotion between primary and junior secondary
levels. There is no standardized or compulsory mechanism across states either for “effective school-
based assessments”, as stipulated in the UBE Act, or regarding the BECE examination at the end of
grade 9, making it impossible to assess the performance of students at school level and across states.


                                                                                                      109
222.    Weak accountability and lack of systematic management of teachers adversely affects the
competence, motivation and skills of teaching staff, which in turn contributes to low level of student
learning outcomes. Some weaknesses also contribute to widespread issues of academic fraud and low
integrity.



Key policy recommendations


Establish a clear and systematic HRM system

223.     The HRM system should create mechanisms to hold teachers accountable in some way for
student’s learning achievements. Teacher performance is critical for education outcomes and it requires
both incentives and an accountability mechanism for learning improvement. Accordingly, policy tools
to enhance professional accountability should be carefully designed, calibrated and sequenced in order
to ensure an effective teacher in every classroom. This requires: (i) an adequate supply of teachers; (ii)
the ability to deploy teachers where they are required; (iii) training teachers with the required skills;
and (iv) management and career structures that result in consistent, high-quality performance by
teachers. Several countries have adopted different intervention modalities for teacher development.
For example, in Kenya two programs, namely (i) ‘school governance, teacher incentives, and student-
teacher ratios’ and (ii) ‘teacher incentives, tracking and peer effects’ were evaluated to have positive
effects on basic education learning outcomes. The first program was based on a teacher annual contract
and contract renewal conditional on performance. The second program focused mainly on teacher
incentives for better learning outcomes (see Annex D for details).

224.    Establish a clear minimum criteria guideline on teacher promotion and recruitment, as well as
an incentivization mechanism including in-service training, and merit-based rewards. Given that basic
education salaries are entirely paid from the federal revenue allocation, at least for those under SUBEB
management, the federal government could yield greater influence on teaching force development. In
particular, there should be a clear and transparent selection mechanism to identify teachers who should
receive training. The current UBE Act does highlight this as one of the areas that should be promoted
but the stipulation seems ineffective due to lack of any enforcement mechanism.

225.    School report cards should be used as instruments for all stakeholders to engage in monitoring
and improving the performance of schools and may also be useful as an input for policy discussion
during education planning and budgeting stages. Disclosure of information collected on the school card
promotes transparency and accessibility to diverse education stakeholders. This makes successful
monitoring not just about generating information. Rather, it is also about creating institutional
mechanisms through which monitoring can inform the development and implementation of policy.
School report cards can be used in different dimensions including monitoring teacher’s activities,
evaluating school performances and efficiency, which are key for learning outcomes. Evidence from
many countries including Nigeria’s own experience from the Lagos state EKO project in secondary
school shows that use of school report cards reveals key performance indicators. For example, refined
tracking of learning outcomes has been introduced in Lagos state under the World Bank funded EKO
secondary education project: school score cards capture several dimensions of learning achievements


                                                                                                      110
under each subject which allows teachers to benchmark their own teaching effectiveness against that
of their colleagues in the same school, with other neighboring schools, etc. School score cards under
the project also capture other qualitative dimensions such as extra-curricular activities; school
beautification, staff training, student counseling, communication, students’ interest in learning and
availability (e.g. whether they are busy with menial jobs during school hours), and reading habits.
Similarly in India, monitoring teachers’ classroom activities increased learning outcomes (see Annex D
for details).

226.    Nigeria faces huge challenges in deploying female teachers in rural areas. As such, the human
resources management strategy should also focus on improving teachers’ deployment in remote, rural
and difficult locations. This could be done though hiring teachers locally and building their professional
capacity through in-service training, as well as by providing a better incentive mechanism for
retention.

227.     Nigeria currently harbors a very large number of education sector staff engaged in M&E and
administrative activities, and most of these staff are involved in duplicative efforts. Streamlining these
efforts could allow for a redeployment of staff into more efficient roles within the system or could
result in savings that could be recycled into other investments such as the purchase of vehicles to reach
remote locations, providing more targeted in-job training to teachers, and supporting schools with
infrastructure needs.

228.    In order to promote the competence and performance of teachers in the classroom, relevant
curricula and teaching materials should be provided. In addition, in-service teacher training programs
should be provided, based on the school-level needs and lacunae of the teaching staff. As recorded
during the field interviews, participation in the teacher career development programs is often arbitrary.
In order to ensure teacher training programs are effective, there should be a clear and transparent
selection mechanism to identify teachers who should receive training, and there should be clear
planning for improvement of training programs (see Annex D for evaluated programs in select
countries).

229.    An increase in public education spending earmarked to teacher training and professional
development is needed, including the expansion of existing teacher training centers/colleges and in-
service training at local or LGA centers, to improve learning outcomes. In particular, more financial
support could be given to providing in-service training to teachers to maintain high standards of
teaching as well as reinforce the initial qualification process and avoid fraudulent qualifications. For
example, in India, group and individual teacher performance pay programs implemented across a large
representative sample of government-run rural primary schools in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh
found consistently positive and significant impacts of the individual teacher incentive program on
student learning outcomes across all durations of program exposure (see Annex D for details).

230.    Lastly, SBMCs can be further operationalized to strengthen school management and
performance oversight. For example, strong SBMC activity reduces teacher and student absenteeism
and increases in-class presence of teachers which tends to be associated with high learning outcomes
as indicated in the recent SDI report conducted in four states (Anambra, Bauchi, Ekiti and Niger). There
are several instances showing the positive effect of school based management on learning outcomes.
For example, community-based information campaigns that provided information through a structured


                                                                                                      111
outreach program to communities had a positive impact on learning outcomes in Indonesia, India and
Mexico (see Annex D for details).



Strengthen accountability mechanisms and data collection environment to reduce likelihood of
academic fraud practices

231.    The education sector in Nigeria needs to establish a proper national academic accreditation
system and information verification center as well as a strong and consistent M&E system for
verification of the certificate issuing process. In fact, creating a tracking mechanism to verify
authenticity of diplomas would minimize risks related to academic fraud which has been an issue
documented across zones.

232.    The National Education Management of Information System (NEMIS) needs to be adequately
funded and rolled out; it needs to build on an adequate integration of state and local level Management
of Information System (MIS) capacity and be designed to provide necessary evidence to each tier of the
Nigerian government: federal, state and local; institutionalized third party monitoring (under SBMCs)
needs to be operationalized as well, in order to allow for data consolidation at local, state and federal
level and disaggregation at school level to serve the purposes of policy makers as well as of local
communities. A stronger NEMIS would enable more reliable data and therefore stronger empirically
based policy making.

233.    To strengthening capacities for evidence-based decision-making, data quality needs to be
drastically improved, planned surveys need to be funded, performance indicators need to be captured
along the entire value chain to help identify delivery bottlenecks, institutionalized third party
monitoring needs to be operationalized and information should be made publicly available. Learning
outcome results should also be linked to teacher management.



Ensure school environment and infrastructure are conducive to learning

234.   Availability of adequate school inputs and good learning environments is key for learning
outcomes, and as such, it is crucial that appropriate funds (operating costs and capital expenditure) be
earmarked to improve the learning environments. For example, matching grants, which are a key
source of funding for infrastructure projects, are limited by the states’ ability to meet the matching
requirement. This is one of a number of political factors that undermine the equality of learning (see
Annex D for evaluated programs in select countries).



Introduce a standardized and streamlined learning assessment system

235.    For better M&E of learning outcomes, Nigeria needs to establish standardized evaluation
system such as a compulsory national test at the end of each level of education. The current approach
relies heavily on arbitrary school-based assessments and state-level examinations that are not directly
comparable across states. This makes it impossible to accurately assess children’s performance to ensure

                                                                                                     112
standards are being met (see Annex D for evaluated programs in select countries). For example, with a
goal of improving education quality, in 2005 Brazil’s Ministry of Education expanded its sample-based
assessment called the National Basic Education Evaluation System (SAEB) and the assessment has led
to marked progress in raising math skills of low performing students (see Annex D for details).



Matrix for policy recommendations

236.    The detailed set of policy recommendations was presented above under each section and the
matrix below summarizes these recommendations, highlighting sequencing of actions (steps) for
effective implementation of the recommendations which seek to improve both equity and quality.
However, it should be noted that the first step is not exclusively a precondition to the next step, but is
rather an indication that the preceding step is critical for the subsequent step to be most effective and
efficient in addressing the issues. The matrix also aligns policy action to the responsible tier of
government. Although policy decisions are not taking place at the school level, in order to strengthen
actions on the ground, some recommendations also refer to school level action such as action by SBMC
or communities. When policy action is critical from one tier of government but requires policy action
from the other tiers, a double check mark ( ) is used to indicate when action from one tier is
particularly crucial. The matrix also suggests a timeline for the policy action where some
recommendations require immediate action but may require longer to effectively complete. In this
matrix, we assumed activities indicated as “short term” are ones that can be implemented in the next
1-2 years; medium term is 3-5 years; and long term more than 5 years. The matrix presents
recommendations for equity and quality separately following the analysis in the main text but it should
be also noted that equity-related policy recommendations are a necessary condition for improved
quality outcomes.

Structure of the education system

1.      The formal education system in Nigeria uses a common basic structure across the country. The
Nigerian education system follows the 1-6-3-3-4 structure, starting with one year of pre-primary86 at
age five, followed by six years of primary education, which usually targets children aged 6 to 11 years
old. Students then proceed to junior secondary school (JSS) which lasts 3 years (JSS1- JSS3) targeting
children aged 12-14 years old. Upon successful completion of the JSS level of education, students
advance to senior secondary school (SSS) or technical college, which also lasts three years. After
completing SSS, students can advance to the first cycle of higher education which lasts 4 years for the
Bachelor’s, followed by 2 years for the Master’s and an additional 2-3 years for the doctorate (Figure A
1). Basic education in Nigeria is defined as six years of primary followed by three years of Junior
Secondary School level (grades 1-9) and is designed to equip all Nigerian children with a common
education foundation.

86Pre-school usually corresponds to 3 years of schooling for children aged 3-5. However, the Federal Ministry of
Education (FMoE) announced in 2011the addition of one-year of pre-primary education as part of the official
system to better prepare children for school (National Bank of Nigeria Annual Report, 2011).

                                                                                                            122
Education sector performance

2.     This annex presents the evolution in the education sector performance in Nigeria between 2008
and 2013, based on 2008 and 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, and 2010 and 2012
GHS data. This diagnostic of the education sector performance centers on three main areas: (i) access
and equity, (ii) MDGs, and (iii) dropout, repetition, delayed entry and retention.



Enrollment

3.       Access to education in Nigeria has stagnated over the last several years and remains below its
full potential at all levels of education, including primary school. The GER stood at 84 percent at
primary level, 75 percent in junior secondary, 64 percent in upper secondary in 2013, and 13 percent
in tertiary in 2012, and has generally either stagnated or decreased in recent years at all levels of
education (Figure A 2). Access remains generally very low, even at primary education level even
though primary education has been the focus of the UBE program since 1999. Access at tertiary level
is particularly low with only 12 percent GER in 2012.

 Note: Tertiary GER for 2008 and 2013 are not reported since DHS data does not report enrollment past age
 24 and as such would grossly understate the GER.

4.       Access to education for girls and residents of rural areas has not improved and remains more
difficult than for the general age cohort at all levels of education. In Nigeria like many other developing
countries, there are disparities in access depending on the area of residence and gender. Participation
of girls in education remains below that of boys across all levels of education (Figure A 3) and the
gender gap is significantly more pronounced at the upper secondary level where the GER among girls
is 56 percent compared with 72 percent among boys. The difference between areas of residence is even
starker with a GER of 100 percent in urban areas compared with 74 percent in rural areas at the primary

level, especially given the country’s focus on increasing access through Education For All policies
(Figure A 3).

5.      The zonal breakdown of access indicates great variation within Nigeria and highlights the
pronounced disparity in access between the north and the south. Whereas all southern states achieved
GERs close to 100 percent and above in 2013 in basic education, the north west and north east
registered a GER of 66 and 63 percent, respectively, at the primary level and 54 and 42 percent,
respectively, at the junior secondary level in 2013. North Central, which includes the FCT Abuja, fares
considerably better than the other northern states with 100 percent GER at primary and 80 percent at
secondary.

Dropout, repetition and overage children in the system

6.      This sub-section considers some aspects of the internal efficiency of the education system in
Nigeria, where internal efficiency is defined as the ability of an education system to educate the greatest
number of students in the shortest period of time and most efficiently. Several indicators are
considered, including the NER as an indicator of the overage children in the education system,
repetition and dropout rates. Repetition and dropouts have significant impacts on assessing the
education system’s internal efficiency because repeating grades means more years of schooling
requiring more resources to be invested and higher costs per output (the completion of a level). In fact,
dropping out early from the education cycle, at primary school level for instance, has greater
implications on the economy than inefficiencies in investment in education or wastage of public

                                                                                                                                 124
resources. This is because dropout has direct implications such as an increase in illiteracy in the
population and a higher risk of child labor.

7.      The Nigerian education system has a significant share of overage children at the primary level
and this carries forward into further education levels as well. The large difference between the GER
and the NER at all levels of education indicates the sizeable presence of overage children in the system,
with GER of 84 percent and NER of 60 percent87 in 2013 at the primary level (Figure A 4). This could
be in part due to delayed entry into the school system- children in Nigeria start school on average 10
months late- but also due to repetition or dropouts who re-enter the education system later on.

8.      Dropout rates, especially at the primary and upper secondary levels, pose a significant problem
for the Nigerian education system, especially within rural areas at all levels of education and for girls
at the basic education level. The dropout rates at the primary level in 2013 were 11 percent, but as high
as 14 percent in rural areas and 11.3 percent among girls (Table A 1), indicating a weakness in the
system in terms of retaining students who may be considered more vulnerable, such as girls and those
from rural areas, who could benefit the most from completing this level of education.

9.      Compared to dropout rates, repetition rates are much lower, which is not surprising given the
automatic promotion policy in force at the basic education level. The debate on repetition is not new
and some supporters say that failing students lose interest in learning and it is better for them to repeat
a grade. The factors that decide repetition are not only students’ learning outcomes but also teachers’
qualification and schooling conditions. Although the impact of repetition on learning achievements is
not empirically proven, there is a significant correlation between repetition and dropout. Also
repetition is an inefficient usage of public resources as it costs more for one to graduate. Repetition

rates at the primary level were about 5.1 percent, with 5.0 percent and 5.6 percent at the junior
secondary and upper secondary respectively.

Millennium development goals performance

10.      As described above, access to education has stagnated since 2008 and a big effort is needed in
order for Nigeria to keep its commitments to the Millennium Development Goals. Little progress has
been made to (i) have all children complete a full course of primary schooling, and (ii) eliminate gender
disparity at all level by 2015, and it is unlikely that the country will meet its targets. Particularly, the
low NER and low primary completion rates, coupled with persistent delayed entry into the schooling
system and high out-of-school rates are significant barriers in achieving the education MDGs (Goals 2
and 3). Given the country’s poor trends in ensuring completion of the primary level of education and
equal access for boys and girls, it is highly unlikely that Nigeria will meet its 2015 MDG target.

11.     The Primary Completion Rate (PCR) is stagnating and generally remains below the MDG
target. The PCR, like enrollment trends, did not improve much between 2008 and 2013, increasing
from 72.5 percent in 2008 to 73.4 percent in 2013. The strong disparities across gender and area
residence (urban vs. rural) also persist, remaining unchanged into 2013. In particular, the PCR among
girls was lower (69 percent compared to 78 percent among boys) and the PCR for children in rural area
much lower as well (66 percent compared to 85 percent in urban areas) (Figure A 5).

12.     However, the comparison of PCR across zones in Nigeria indicates that the north performs less
well than the south, particularly in North East and the North West, although the North West has
improved the most over this period. PCR among the southern zones varied between 88 and 99 percent
in 2013 compared with 44 and 58 percent in the North East and North West, respectively. A closer
look shows that the North West showed the most improvement between 2008 and 2013, increasing by
12 percentage points, although it remained at just 58 percent. With the exception of South South, all
of the other zones had little change in their PCR during the same period.

13.        With a 73 percent PCR, Nigeria still is below the SSA average of 80 percent and still lags behind
many of its neighbors (Figure A 6). Even when compared with its immediate neighbors (other than
those affected by conflict), such Cameroon (98 percent) and Benin (85 percent), Nigeria’s performance
is still lagging. Ghana, the other English-speaking country in the zone, also outperforms Nigeria with
a PCR of about 111 percent.

14.     Nigeria is also lagging in its MDG commitment to address the gender gap in access to education,
especially at the primary level of education. Gender disparities in enrollment at all levels of education
have not significantly narrowed since 2008, and despite some minor improvement from 84 to 90
percent at the primary and from 81 to 83 percent at the junior secondary, the gender parity index (GPI)
remains below the target of 100 percent. In 2013, primary, junior secondary, upper secondary, and
tertiary level GPIs, of 90 percent, 83 percent, 84 percent, and 71 percent respectively, indicated a
persistent imbalance in the education system (Figure A 7).

15.    The breakdown of the gender gap by zone for basic education (primary and junior
secondary) indicates that the northern states are even further away than the rest of the country
from achieving the MDG goal of gender equality in access to education, although they made
the most progress between 2008 and 2013. The North East and North West zones increased
their GPI by 14 percentage points each between 2008 and 2013 at the primary level, reaching
89 and 87 percent respectively while the South East and South West were at 100 percent in
2013. However, at the junior secondary levels, the northern zones still have much work to do
to catch up to the south with GPIs between 71 and 78 percent in 2013 (Figure A 7).

Educational attainment of the population

16.      The education performance of a country is directly tied to how well-educated and productive
its labor force is and therefore how well-prepared the work force is to respond to demand in the labor

population has not changed much since 2008, increasing from a national average of 6.5 to 6.6 years
between 2008 and 2013. The disparities between male and female remain unchanged with an average
of 7.6 years of school for males and 5.6 for females, and the disparities between urban and rural remain
very high with an average of 9.1 in urban areas compared with 4.7 years in rural areas (Figure A 8).

17.     About 54 percent of the population has completed primary education or more, although 32
percent of the working age population has no education at all. This is especially true among women
(39 percent without education) and residents of rural areas (43 percent without education). The well-
educated group remains urban residents where 66 percent of the population has completed basic
education or higher (Figure A 9).

18.     The zonal breakdown of education attainment of the labor force indicates very strong
disparities between north and south. The share of the working age population with no education in the
north ranges from 37.5 percent for North Central, 50.5 percent for North East and 61.9 percent for
North West compared with 10.2, 12.6 and 12.5 percent in the South East, South South and South West
zones, respectively. The zone with the best-educated workforce is the South West where 84 percent
have at least primary or higher.

Modeling of determinants of access and equity

19.      Several econometric models are employed to investigate how demand and supply side factors
affect the probability of being out-of-school. For the purpose of this analysis, we measured school
participation indicators in two ways: (i), school participation status of basic education age group (age
6-14), which show the status of school attendance (in school vs out-of-school). In particular this allows
us to investigate factors that matter for school attendance for those not in school or for those in school,
(ii), NER at primary and junior secondary. This is particularly important to account for internal
inefficiency related to overage children either due to delayed entry, repetition or school interruption,
for example due to conflict.

20.      The following are key supply side factors used in the analysis: (i), public spending on education
at the state level measured in terms of per student spending (unit cost) which allows us to determine
whether there is a shortage of public resources devoted to basic education at the state level, and (ii),
state total revenue per official school-age child which is a proxy for the financial constrains facing the
state in the provision of education. The first analysis is used to determine whether finance really
matters in Nigeria. The following are demand side factors included in the model89: (i), household head
education, gender, sex and sector of employment, (ii), household wealth status and family size, (iii)
prevalence of conflicts, (iv) areas of residence, (v) child sex and age, and (vi) household spending per
child.

21.     The covariates are estimated at the national level and for the northern and southern states
separately to determine heterogeneity of factors across the geographical zones. In addition, a
decomposition model is employed to determine the relative importance of determinants between the

89Note that religion was deliberately excluded from the determinants as it is strongly correlated with the north
and south geographic divide.

                                                                                                             141
following four categories: (i), north and south, (ii) areas of residence, (iii) gender, and (iv), poorest and
richest wealth quintile. The decomposition model aims to determine whether known factors
(endowments or explained) justify the difference observed between say the north and the south or
whether the differences are attributed to some other unknown factors (coefficients or unexplained).
The detailed methodology of the analysis is presented. To determine the relative importance of school
inputs and other factors, the endowment (known factors) are aggregated into 6 categories: (i), student
(age and sex), (ii), school (number of classrooms, number of teachers, and number of schools), (iii)
teachers (share of qualified teachers and teacher salary), (iv) finance (public spending on education,
total state revenue and unit cost), (v) parent (education of head of household, wealth status, HH unit
cost and areas of residence), and (iv) social and political factors (conflict, UBEC fund access on time).
To determine the effect of all the three sources of funding (total public spending, state revenue and
household spending) on school participation, we estimate them one at a time controlling for all other
factors, and altering the three variables of interest. To determine the marginal effect of each variable
of interest, the following models include all factors at once. The Tables below present a series of
regression tables, and the results are summarized below.

22.     The results show that the three financial indicators, total public spending, state revenue and
household spending, are strong predicators of children’s school participation, with state revenue and
household spending having the largest effects on education outcomes of the three. Public per student
spending is associated with a higher probability of school attendance- for every 1 percent increase in
public spending, there is an increase in school attendance by 5.1 percent, holding all other factors
constant at mean (marginal effect) (Table B 2). The corresponding increase in probability of attendance
with an increase in state revenue per school-age child and household spending per student is 13.6
percent and 12.2 percent respectively. Under the same specifications, similar results were observed, for
net primary enrollment rate (Table B 3) and junior secondary NER (Table B 4). This implies that
financial resources in Nigeria are a key determinant of education outcomes, particularly revenues of
the state and household spending. This means that states with higher revenues tend to spend more on
service delivery and allocate more per child (higher unit cost), which in turn implies that children have
access to better schools and better learning environments. The result from the combined model, shows
that all three financial factors are strongly associated with children’s school participation but the
marginal effect is relatively lower due to potential substitution effect. For example, states with a lower
federal allocation may supplement from state revenue or schools may charge more fees to households
(Table B 5).

23.     From demand side factors, while household head education is the most predominant
determinant of schooling, all other factors such as household head sector of activity, wealth status,
areas of resident, head age, household size and children age and gender also play crucial roles in the
schooling decision. For example, a child whose parent had some primary education has an 11.9 percent
greater chance of attending school than a child whose parent had no education, and the probability
increases to 18.4 percent, 20.6 percent and 23.1 percent for a child whose household head has
completed primary, some junior secondary, and has upper secondary or above, respectively, compared
with a child whose parent had no education. Similarly, the probability of going to school decreases by
6 percent for children from households engaged in agriculture.




                                                                                                         142
24.      Analyzing the model separately between the northern and southern parts of the country, shows
that all supply and demand side factors listed above have a strong influence in the north while only
household spending and education of household head seems to matter in the south. The results are
presented in (Table B 6) for the north and (Table B 7) for the south. The tables suggest that both demand
and supply side factors are key determinants of schooling in the north while household head education
and household per student payment are the main factor in the south from the demand side. This is also
consistent with the earlier findings that parents in the south invest more in their children’s education,
and the public unit costs are higher in most of the southern states mainly due to high participation of
private sector in services delivery. It is also self-evident that the north is more affected by the internal
conflict compared to the south but this effect is excluded because of high correlation with educational
outcome. If the youth continue with current schooling trends, this may affect the next generation and
any policy action should also consider alternative education structures.

25.      Finally, the decomposition results under the four categories (north vs. south, urban vs. rural,
male vs. female and poorest vs. richest) show that the endowment (or explained factors), plays a
significant role in explaining the difference across the four categories. Table B 8 shows decomposition
results. Except for the difference between genders, endowment accounts for more than 60 percent of
gaps between the other three categories. For example, 67 percent of the difference between north and
south in terms of school participation is explained by the known factors (factors related to students,
teachers, schools, finances, parents and other social factors). The breakdown of the group of
explanatory variables for north and south shows that parents are the most important, followed by social
factors, and finance. Overall, parent, social factors and finances explain the vast major of the differences
between the four categories while student level factors, school and teachers are only significant for
some. In particular, student sex and age are only significant in explaining the gap between north and
south and rural and urban differences, but not between poorest and richest quintiles. Similarly,
teachers’ salary and qualifications only explains the difference between north and south while school
level information (number of school and classrooms) is significant in explaining the difference between
rural and urban. Therefore, demand side factors such as parents, finances and social factors have been
consistently found to be the dominant factors for schooling decisions.

Modeling of determinants of quality

26.     Similar to the equity case, several econometric models are employed to investigate how demand
and supply side factors affect the key learning outcome indicators described above. While the models
and factors used in this section are the same as in the equity case (except in the decomposition model),
for the learning outcomes assessment public financial inputs are measured in two ways: (i), direct
financial input, which consists of availability of public resources per student and financial wellbeing of
the states (this is the same as the “how finance” factor used in the equity section), and (ii) quality of

                                                                                                      149
resources used, measured by the student teacher ratio, class size, average salary of teachers and share
of qualified teachers (this is the only difference from the out-of-school factors). As stated above, we
used five indicators as proxies for quality of educational: grade 6 test score, literacy rate after completion
of grades 4 and 6, primary completion rate, and junior secondary completion rate. Model justification,
steps of analyses and methodological setups are also same as for the out-of-school section, except how
the finance and outcome indicators are measured. In other words, to determine the effect of finance
(total public spending, state revenue, STR, share of qualified teachers, class size, and household
spending) on learning outcomes, we estimated one at a time, controlling for all other factors. To
determine the marginal effect of each variable of interest, we estimated models that include all factors
for grade 6 test results and onetime completion of junior secondary school at the national level and for
the north and south separately. A series of regression tables and the results are summarized below.

27.     The results show that financial indicators are key determinants of learning outcomes (Table C
1). The effect of direct financial input (public unit cost, state revenue per school-age child, household
unit cost, and teachers’ salary) and indirect financial input (STR, class size and share of qualified
teachers), affects all the key learning indicators. For example, a 1 percent increase in public spending
per student is associated with a 3 percent increase in grade 6 test results. The corresponding effect of a
1 percent increase in state revenue per official school-age child, household unit cost or primary school
teachers’ salary is associated with an increase in grade 6 test results of 3 percent, 19 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively. Similarly, a unit decrease in STR and class size and a unit increase in the share of
qualified teachers is associated with an increase by 16 percent, 17.5 percent and 18.5 percent,
respectively in grade six test results.

28.      Overall, learning outcomes are more sensitive to supply side factors than demand side factors
like gender, area of residence, and wealth status of the household, among others. The results for the
other learning outcome indicators show similar findings and are presented in the Tables (primary
completion rate—Table C 2, literacy rate at grade 4—Table C 3, literacy rate at grade 6—Table C 4,
and junior secondary completion rate on time—Table C 5). However, when all factors are combined
in the jointly estimated model, the marginal effect of STR, class size, and share of qualified teachers
among all teachers remains significant while the effects of public unit cost and state revenue are still
significant but smaller in magnitude (Table C 6). This implies that although direct financial input
matters for learning outcomes, the effect is more significant when the financial input leads to
improvement in the learning environment such as class size, STR and qualified teachers. Similar to the
access case, the household head education plays a significant role both in the north and south while
other factors such as wealth status are only significant in the north.

Conditional Cash transfer programs

30.      Pakistan Conditional Cash Transfers: Pakistan Gender-based CCT. In 2003, the Government of
Pakistan announced a CCT program targeted to female students in Punjab, with a goal of reducing
gender disparity in education. A monthly stipend was provided to girls on condition they were enrolled
in grades 6 to 8 at a government school and maintain a minimum attendance of 80 percent. Program
districts were selected based on district-level literacy rates for the population aged 10 and over, and
only those with rates below 40 percent were eligible. The impact evaluation found that the program
increased the enrollment of girls, and also that of boys. However, the student-teacher ratio in treated
districts rose, which could cause instructional quality to suffer if not addressed. The program success
appears to have been driven by enrollment increases in urban schools, which suggests the need for a
reassessment of the targeting criteria in rural schools. (Amer Hasan, 2010)

31.     Mexico Conditional Cash Transfers: School Subsidies for the Poor: Evaluating the Mexican
Progresa Poverty Program. The Progresa program provides poor mothers in rural Mexico with
education grants in order to boost enrollment. Poor children who reside in communities randomly
selected to participate in the initial phase of the Progresa are compared to those who reside in other
(control) communities. Pre-program comparisons check the randomized design, and double difference
estimators of the program's effect on the treated are calculated by grade and sex. Probit models are also
estimated for the probability a child is enrolled, controlling for additional characteristics of the child,
their parents, local schools, and community, and for sample attrition, to evaluate the sensitivity of the
program estimates. These estimates of program short-run effects on enrollment are extrapolated to the
lifetime schooling and the earnings of adults to approximate the internal rate of return on the public
schooling subsidies as they increase expected private wages. (T. Paul Schultz, 2004)

32.      Cambodia Student Scholarships and Incentives: Getting Girls into School: Evidence from a
Scholarship Program in Cambodia. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) scholarship program
was launched in 2004 with the goal of to increasing school attainment of girls. It awarded grants to
girls transitioning from the last year of primary school to the first year of secondary school. Students
received a scholarship throughout the three years of junior secondary school on condition that they
maintained a passing grade and were absent “without good reason” for less than 10 days a year. The
impact evaluation shows that the JFPR program had a large, positive effect on the school enrollment
and attendance of girls, and appears to have had the largest impact among girls with the lowest
socioeconomic status at baseline. The results are robust to a variety of controls for observable

differences between scholarship recipients and no recipients, to unobserved heterogeneity across girls,
and to selective attrition out of the sample. (Deon Filmer and Norbert Schady, 2006)

33.     Indonesia Student Scholarships and Incentives: Protecting Education for the Poor in Times of
Crisis: An Evaluation of a Scholarship Program in Indonesia. This paper analyses the impact of an
Indonesian scholarship program, which was implemented in 1998 to preserve access to education for
the poor during the economic crisis. Scholarships were targeted pro-poor and the allocation process
followed a decentralized design, involving both geographic and individual targeting. The identification
strategy exploits this decentralized structure, relying on instrumental variables constructed from
regional mis-targeting at the initial phase of allocation. The program has increased enrollment,
especially for primary school-aged children from poor rural households. Moreover, the scholarships
seem to have assisted households in smoothing consumption during the crisis, relieving pressure on
households' investments in education and utilization of child labor. (Robert Sparrow, 2007)

34.     Brazil Conditional Cash Transfers: The Impact of the Bolsa Escola/Familia Conditional Cash
Transfer Program on Enrollment, Drop Out Rates and Grade Promotion in Brazil. The Bolsa program
provides monthly cash payments to poor households with children between the ages of 6 and 15 who
are enrolled in school. Using eight years of school census data (from 1998 to 2005), the study compares
changes in enrollment and in dropout and grade advancement rates across schools that adopted the
Bolsa program at different times. After accounting for cumulative effects, the Bolsa program has
increased enrollment in Brazil by about 5.5 percent in grades 1-4 and by about 6.5 percent in grades 5-
8. The program has also lowered dropout rates by about 0.5 percentage points and raised grade
promotion rates by about 0.9 percentage points for children in grades 1-4, and reduced dropout rates
by about 0.4 percentage points and increased grade promotion rates by about 0.3 percentage points for
children in grades 5-8. (Paul Glewwe and Ana Lucia Kassouf, 2010)



School meals program

35.      India School meals program: The Impact of school meals on school participation: Evidence from
rural India. This paper assesses the effect of transition from monthly distribution of free food grains to
the daily provision of free cooked meals to school children on enrollments and attendance in a rural
area of India. School panel data allow a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to address possible
endogeneity of program placement. The results suggest that program transition had a significant impact
on improving the daily participation rates of children in lower grades. The average monthly attendance
rate of girls in grade 1 was more than 12 percentage points higher while there was a positive but
insignificant effect on grade 1 boys' attendance rate. The impact on enrollment levels was insignificant.

36.     Kenya School Meals: School Meals, Educational Achievement and School Competition:
Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation. The program was implemented in Western Kenya in 25
randomly chosen preschools from a pool of 50. It provided a fully subsidized in-school breakfast on
every school day to all students attending preschool. School participation was 30 percent higher in the
treatment group than in the comparison group. The breakfast program led to higher curriculum test
scores, but only in schools where the teacher was relatively experienced prior to the program. The

school meals displaced teaching time and led to larger class sizes. Despite improved incentives, teacher
absenteeism remained at a high level of 30 percent. (Christel Vermeersch and Michael Kremer, 2004).



Child-friendly schools

37.      Ethiopia Child-Friendly Schools (CFS): With assistance from UNICEF, Ethiopia began
implementing the CFS program in 2007 in 51 selected primary schools with an estimated reach of more
than 80,000 students. The program sought to improve education quality, outcomes and childhood
development by addressing perceived school-based barriers that limit access to education and
participation in school. Interventions include renovation or construction of classrooms, teaching and
early childhood development (ECD) centers, libraries, and water and sanitation facilities; provision of
furniture, education materials, equipment, and uniforms. The CFS program had a positive and
significant effect on enrollment, especially in favor of girls, and community participation. However,
the CFS program did not reduce dropout and repetition rates over the program period (UNICEF, 2010).



Public-private partnership

38.     Pakistan Public-Private Partnership: Extending educational access in Pakistan through the
Promoting Low-Cost Private Schooling in Rural Sindh (PPRS) program. The PPRS program was
implemented by the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), a quasi-governmental agency of the Sindh
provincial government in Pakistan. The program sought to increase access to primary education in
underserved rural communities through PPPs with local entrepreneurs. In return for a per-child
subsidy by the Sindh provincial government, private entrepreneurs established and operated primary
schools to which children between the ages of 5 and 9 were eligible for free enrollment. Entrepreneurs
in half of the treatment villages received the same amount for male and female students, while the
other half received a higher subsidy for girls than boys. The PPRS program led to large gains in
enrollment within both the target age group and for older children, with a similar effect for both girls
and boys. The gender-differentiated subsidy showed no greater effectiveness in increasing female
enrollment than the equal-value subsidy. (David S. Blakeslee, Dhushyanth Raju, Felipe Barrera-Osorio,
Leigh L. Linden, Matthew Hoover, 2011).

39.     Pakistan Private School Subsidies: Can Private School Subsidies Increase Enrollment for the
Poor? The Quetta Urban Fellowship Program sought to expand primary education for girls by creating
private girls’ schools in poor urban areas of Quetta, Pakistan. Enrollment growth in these randomly
selected neighborhoods is compared to enrollment growth in similar neighborhoods that were
randomly assigned to a control group. The impact evaluation shows the program increased girls'
enrollment by around 33 percentage points. Boys' enrollment also rose, partly since boys were allowed
to attend the new schools and partly because parents would not only educate their daughters without
also educating their boys. The success of the program varied across neighborhoods, although success
was not clearly related to the relative wealth of a neighborhood or to parents' level of education.
(Jooseop Kim, Harold Alderman, and Peter F. Orazem, 1999).

Community participation

40.     Indonesia Community Participatio: Improving Educational Quality through Enhancing
Community Participation: Results from a Randomized Field Experiment in Indonesia. Education
ministries worldwide have promoted community engagement through school committees. This paper
presents results from a large field experiment testing alternative approaches to strengthen school
committees in public schools in Indonesia. Two novel treatments focus on institutional reforms. First,
some schools were randomly assigned to implement elections of school committee members. Another
treatment facilitated joint-planning meetings between the school committee and the village council
(linkage). Two more common treatments, grants and training, provided resources to existing school
committees. We find that institutional reforms, in particular linkage and elections combined with
linkage, are most cost-effective at improving learning. (Menno Pradhan, Daniel Suryadarma, Amanda
Beatty, Maisy Wong, Arya, Gaduh, Armida Alisjahbana, and Rima Prama Artha, 2013).

41.      Mexico Tracking and Peer Effects: Neighborhood Peer Effects in Secondary School Enrollment
Decisions. This paper identifies neighborhood peer effects on children's school enrollment decisions
using experimental evidence from the Mexican PROGRESA program. We use exogenously variation
in the school enrollment of program eligible children to identify peer effects on the schooling decisions
of ineligible children residing in treatment communities. We find that peers have considerable
influence on the enrollment decisions of program-ineligible children, and these effects are
concentrated among children from poorer households. These findings imply that policies aimed at
encouraging enrollment can produce large social multiplier effects. (Gustavo J. Bobonis and Frederico
Finan, 2009).

42.      India community-based information campaign: What Can Experiments Tell Us About How to
Improve Government Performance? The community-based information campaign consisted of eight to
nine public meetings in each of 340 treatment villages across three Indian states. It sought to
disseminate information to the community about its state mandated roles and responsibilities in school
management. The findings from the first follow-up (2-4 months after the campaign) show that
providing information through a structured campaign to communities had a positive impact in all three
states. In two states there was a significant and positive impact on reading (14-27 percent) in one of the
three grades tested; in the third state there was a significant impact on writing in one grade (15 percent)
and on mathematics in the other grade tested (27 percent). The intervention is associated with
improvement in teacher effort in two states. Some improvements occurred in the delivery of certain
benefits entitled to students (stipend, uniform, and midday meal) and in process variables such as
community participation in each of the three states. (Rachel M. Gisselquist and Miguel Niño Zarazúa,
2013).



School based management

43.     Mexico School-Based Management: Empowering Parents to Improve Education: Evidence
from Rural Mexico. The authors examine a program that involves parents directly in the management
of schools located in highly disadvantaged rural communities. The program, known as AGE, finances
parent associations and motivates parental participation by involving them in the management of the
school grants. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we show that the AGE

                                                                                                       160
greatly increased the participation of parents in monitoring school performance and decision-making.
Further, the authors find that AGE improved intermediate school quality indicators, namely grade
failure and grade repetition, controlling for the presence of a conditional cash transfer program and
other educational interventions. (Paul Gertler, Harry Patrinos, and Marta Rubio-Codina, 2008).

44.     Latin America Countries School-Based Management: Does School Decentralization Raise
Student Outcomes? Theory and Evidence on the Roles of School Autonomy and Community
Participation. Using data on primary schools in 10 Latin-American countries, the study evaluates the
impact of decentralized school decision-making on student performance. The model developed shows
that local autonomous effort will be jointly determined with student academic performance. The model
predicts that least squares estimates are biased toward finding a positive impact of school autonomy on
student performance. Empirical tests confirm these predictions. Least squares estimates show a strong
positive effect of decentralized decision-making on test scores, but these results are reversed after
correcting for the endogeneity of school autonomy. However, results support the role of parental
participation in the schools as a positive influence on student achievement. (Victoria Gunnarsson, Peter
F. Orazem, Mario Sánchez, and Aimee Verdisco, 2004).

45.     Kenya School Resource Provision: Many Children Left Behind? Textbooks and Test Scores in
Kenya. A randomized evaluation in rural Kenya finds, contrary to the previous literature, that
providing textbooks did not raise average test scores. Textbooks did increase the scores of the best
students (ones with high pretest scores) but had little effect on other students. Textbooks are written
in English, most students' third language, and many students could not use them effectively. More
generally, the curriculum in Kenya, and in many other developing countries, tends to be oriented
toward academically strong students, leaving many students behind in societies that combine a
centralized educational system; the heterogeneity in student preparation associated with rapid
educational expansion; and disproportionate elite power (Paul Glewwe, Michael Kremer, and Sylvie
Moulin, 2009).

46.      Kenya School Governance: School governance, teacher incentives, and student-teacher ratios:
Experimental evidence from Kenyan primary schools. Under the Extra Teacher Program (ETP), school
committees at randomly selected Kenyan schools hired an additional teacher on an annual contract
outside usual Ministry of Education civil-service channels. Compensation was pegged at one-quarter
normal levels, and contracts renewal conditional on performance. Test score for students randomly
assigned to existing classes did not increase significantly, despite an average reduction in class size from
82 to 44. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to classes taught by locally-hired contract
teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates compared to centrally-hired
civil-service teachers in schools participating in the ETP. Civil-service teachers also captured rents for
their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing
teachers. (Esther Duflo, Pascaline Dupas, and Michael Kremer, 2012).



Incentives for quality improvement

Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Kenya. To the extent that students

benefit from high-achieving peers, tracking will help strong students and hurt weak ones. However,
all students may benefit if tracking allows teachers to better tailor their instruction level. Lower-
achieving students are particularly likely to benefit from tracking when teachers have incentives to
teach to the top of the distribution. We propose a simple model nesting these effects, and test its
implications in a randomized tracking experiment conducted with 121 primary schools in Kenya.
While the direct effect of high-achieving peers is positive, tracking benefited lower-achieving students
indirectly by allowing teachers to teach at their level. (Esther Duflo, Pascaline Dupas, and Michael
Kremer, 2011).

48.     Nigeria EKO project: A refined tracking of learning outcomes has been introduced in Lagos
state under the World Bank funded EKO secondary education project: school score cards capture
several dimensions of learning achievements under each subject (as shown below for English language)
which allow teachers to benchmark their own teaching effectiveness with their colleagues in the same
school, with other neighboring schools, etc. School score cards under the project also capture other
qualitative dimensions such as extra-curricular activities; school beautification, staff training, students’
counseling, communication, students’ interest in learning and availability (e.g. their being busy with
menial jobs during school hours), reading habits, etc.

49.     Nigeria EKO project. In Nigeria itself, performance-based school grants have been introduced
in 2009 in secondary education in Lagos state under a World Bank funded project (Lagos EKO
Secondary Education project): school grants are awarded to all secondary public schools to help
improve learning achievements but those meet the following criteria pertaining to 1) students’ testing
scores; 2) monitoring of teachers attendance and; 3) participatory school management measured
through evidenced participation of the School Based Management Committee, are awarded additional
resources (i.e. on top of school development grants).

50.     India Teacher Incentives: Long-Term Effects of Teacher Performance Pay: Experimental
Evidence from India. The study presents results from a five-year long randomized evaluation of group
and individual teacher performance pay programs implemented across a large representative sample of
government-run rural primary schools in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It found consistently
positive and significant impacts of the individual teacher incentive program on student learning
outcomes across all durations of program exposure. Students who completed their full five years of
primary school under the program performed significantly better than those in control schools by 0.54
and 0.35 standard deviations in math and language tests respectively. (Karthik Muralidharan, 2011).



Learning assessment and E&M system

51.     Brazil Prova Brasil: With a goal of improving education quality, in 2005 Brazil’s Ministry of
Education expanded its sample-based assessment called the National Basic Education Evaluation
System (SAEB) that was introduced in 1995. Renamed Prova Brasil, the exam tests all grade 4 and 8
students in math and Portuguese every two years. (SAEB remains a sample-based assessment for the
11th grade level.) Prova Brasil’s census-based approach for primary education yields data on the average
learning performance in each school administered by Brazil’s 5,564 municipalities, 26 states, and the
federal district. The assessment has led to marked progress in raising math skills of low performing

students, but the share of high performing students did not increase. Performance in reading is mixed,
with a very small share of high performing students, and a lack of improvement in basic literacy levels
of the lowest performing students. (Barbara Bruns, David Evans and Javier Luque, 2012).

52.     Brazil Index for Basic Education Development (IDEB): IDEB was introduced in 2007 to measure
both student learning results and student flows (grade progression, repetition and graduation rates) at
school, local government, state and national level, which “has become rapidly accepted in Brazil as the
leading metric for gauging the relative performance of individual schools as well as municipal , state,
and private school systems” and is used by a few states and local governments to run teacher bonus
programs. (Bruns, 2011).

53.     India Teacher Training: The Impact of Diagnostic Feedback to Teachers on Student Learning:
Experimental Evidence from India. The program provided low-stakes diagnostic tests and feedback to
teachers, and low-stakes monitoring of classroom processes across a representative set of schools in the
Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Teachers in treatment schools exerted more effort when observed in
the classroom, but students in these schools did not outperform students in the control group on
independently-administered tests. This suggests that though teachers in the program schools worked
harder while being observed, there was no impact of the feedback and monitoring on student learning
outcomes. (Karthik Muralidharan and Venkatesh Sundararaman (2010).

Annex E: Methodological note

Annex E 1: Approach to Qualitative Data Collection

  To understand the political economy of basic education services delivery we collected qualitative
  data from the three tiers of government organized in two phases: (i), Field to two states (Edo and
  Kogi) as pilot for consultation and information availability at state level followed by consultation
  with policy makers and (ii), field visit for qualitative data collection from all services delivery value
  chain from the selected 4 states followed by consultation with education sector experts and
  stakeholders focusing on the three key challenge areas. In the first phase, we visited two States to
  test data collection instrument and also to customize the consultation workshop with State policy
  makers. The consultation workshop was carried out in September 2014 with about 74 participants
  comprising of representatives from 15 States, as well as the Federal Ministry of Education and
  UBEC. The consultation targeted three levels of participants within the education sector
  management: (i) permanent secretary, or State education commissioner, (ii) directors, and (iii)
  NEMIS representatives. The workshop was structured around broader discussions of the education
  management system as well as governance and accountability issues, followed by a 20 question
  survey that was designed to capture different dimensions of education sector issues. In the second
  phase, qualitative data collection instrument was administrated with bottom-up-approach of
  tracing services delivery issues in the three tiers of government starting at school and community
  level in the 4 or the 6 selected states while the other two similar instrument much more broader
  instrument administrated as part of the PETs. Both field visits and experts discussion were
  structured around the three specific basic education challenges at the core of this report, (i) equity
  in access, (ii) quality of education, and (ii) the out-of-school prevalence. In addition, supplemental
  quantitative data were collected in the six States, specifically capturing quantitative and qualitative
  information from UBEC at the Federal level, SUBEB at the State level, State Ministry of Education,
  LGA, LGEA, SBMCs and school level. The main objective of the data collection was to capture the
  variations in the political economy of service delivery across States. In particular, it provided two
  important additions to the analysis: (i), it captured the complexities of the social and cultural
  aspects, which supplemented the information already available in the quantitative data, and (ii), it
  helped to understand whether the policymakers were aware of the issues at hand and gathered
  their input on potential viable solutions. The survey instruments used during the field visits and
  during the workshops are presented in detail in the annex, including summary of the key findings.
  Building on the information gathered and in order to provide comprehensive and yet focused
  policy recommendations, the qualitative analysis particularly helps to conceptualizations key issues
  including weather policymakers aware of the key basic education sector challenges, how
  policymakers’ priorities and challenges vary by state, how influence of socioeconomic and cultural
  factors affect the education sector, factors hindering the full implementation of the UBEC law and
  whether there is a standard norm regarding human resource management in its the accountability
  framework.




                                                                                                         164
Annex E 2: Benefit Incidence Analysis




54.     Benefit incidence analysis (BIA) illustrates how public expenditure on services is distributed
among population sub-groups, utilizing both the service provision costs and participation or usage rates
of a specific service (Heltberg, Simler, and Tarp 2003). Benefit incidence studies are particularly useful
in determining the extent to which public spending on social sectors - for the present chapter,
education - benefits the poorest strata and therefore creates a well-targeted instrument for poverty
reduction.90 BIA can likewise analyze expenditure by different groups or zonal locations, though this
analysis requires greater disaggregation in spending data which was not available for this analysis. This
chapter has been therefore limited to the income group (denoted by expenditure quintile).

55.     Benefit incidence analysis requires three elements: household-level survey data which gathers
(i) information from which to construct a proper welfare indicator (i.e. per capita household
consumption expenditures, appropriately adjusted) and (ii) utilization of or participation in the public
service of interest (enrollment in school), as well as administrative or budget data that provides (iii)
unit costs to the government for the provision of those same services (e.g. the cost of one year of
schooling per student).

56.     In the case of the Nigeria, the GHS 2010/11 and Panel 2010/11 and 2012/13 are an adequate
instrument that can be used to conduct a BIA with as it gathers appropriate information on both
enrollment figures as well as consumption measures for constructing accurate welfare indicators.
Welfare, in this case, is measured by aggregating household consumption over the last twelve months,
after incorporating food consumption, non-food consumption, housing, and benefits derived from
durable goods. The unit costs of education are derived from figures for public spending on education
reported by the Ministry of Finance for Public Spending on Education. By utilizing government
expenditure sources in addition to household expenditure on education, a more accurate unit cost can
be calculated.

57.       Individuals (or households) must first be ranked by their measure of welfare according to the
household survey, and then aggregated into population groups in order to compare how the subsidy
itself is distributed across these groups. These groups are typically quintiles or deciles. This analysis
utilizes expenditure quintiles, in which the first quintile holds the poorest 20 percent of the population,
and so on.

58.     Next, using the data provided in the household survey, the total number of individuals who
participated in or used the publicly provided service in question (those who were enrolled in school)
must be identified. Each user (or household) is then be multiplied by the unit cost of service provision
and finally, these beneficiaries are aggregated into their appropriate population groups (consumption



90The concept of benefit incidence analysis (BIA) originally pioneered by studies by Gillespie on Canada 1965,
and extended to developing countries context by Meerman (1979) on Columbia, and Seloswski (1979) on Malaysia
and in its modern stage by Need (1995), Selden and Wasylenko (1992), Sahn and Yonger (1999) on Africa, Demery
(2000).

                                                                                                          165
quintiles). It is the distribution of this in-kind transfer of the population that constitutes a benefit
incidence analysis. The BIA model for the Nigeria at hand can be expressed as:
                                                4          4 E
                                                      Si
                                        X j   Eij        ij Si
                                               i 1   Ei i 1 Ei
59.     where Xj is the value of the total education subsidy imputed to consumption quintile j. Eij
represents the number of school enrollments of consumption quintile j at education level i, and Ei the
total number of enrollments (across all consumption quintile) at that level. Si is government spending
on education level i and i (=1,..,4) denotes the level of education (primary, junior secondary, upper
secondary, and tertiary). Note that Si/Ei is the unit subsidy of providing a school place at level I (Demery
2000).

60.      The resulting profile illustrates the distribution of public spending on education that is
allocated to each welfare group (expenditure quintile), or the “benefit incidence”. Concentration curves
can then be plotted that show the cumulative distribution of these benefits across households, and can
be compared to the cumulative distribution of total consumption (what is typically referred to as the
Lorenz curve). The Lorenz curve is a graphical interpretation of the cumulative distribution of income
on the vertical axis against the cumulative distribution of population on the horizontal axis. The
progressivity of spending is pro-poor if the poor receive more of the service’s benefits than the non-
poor, as well as a share greater than their share of the population; graphically this line appears above
the diagonal line as this is the line indicating that each quintile in the distribution is receiving the same
share, in this case, 20 percent of spending. Pro-poor spending is an indication of the successful targeting
of public service benefits towards poorer households (Heltberg, Simler, and Tarp 2003). “Not-pro-poor
but progressive” refers to if the non-poor receive more than the poor, but the poor still receive a share
larger than their share of consumption; graphically this line appears below the diagonal but above the
Lorenz. “Not-pro-poor and regressive” occurs if the non-poor receive more than the poor, and the share
of the poor is less than their share of consumption; graphically this line appears below the diagonal and
below the Lorenz.

61.     When determining enrollment as an element of BIA, its distribution can be interpreted in one
of two ways: (1) net enrollment (the share of children of school-age groups attending the corresponding
school level) or (2) gross enrollment (the share of all children regardless of their age who are attending
a specific school level). The differences in these two can add depth to further interpretations of the
benefit incidence analysis, particularly in the Nigeria where overages and older children still enrolled
in primary school contribute to differing enrollment rates.



Annex E 3: Oaxaca Decomposition


62.     The standard conceptual approach for education services is model as the notion of production
function (Heynema, 1979; Krueger, 2003 and Orazem and King, 2008) and others also treated as utility
function (Glewwe, and Kremer, 2005) to establish causal relationship between educational outcomes
and determinants of the outcomes. In the former case, schools are treated as producers and best viewed
as organizations that should try to maximize output, subject to their budget constraints. In the latter

                                                                                                         166
case, conceptual framework is farmed as household maximizing utility that can be consumed at
different points in time (life cycle), and each child’s years of schooling and learning. Both the
production and utility maximization approaches could fit to our data and proposed estimation
methodologies, one can refer to the cited sources for the details. In this proposal, we aims to develop
on the modified production function for education defined as:

              = () + 

Where Y is outcome measures (outcome indicators), X is a vector of variables and ε is
unobserved factors or residuals which includes student innate ability, motivations, and other
quality improvement efforts.
63.    Similar to the literature, this proposal aims to employ the extended Oaxaca -Blinder (1973)
decomposition models and estimate the learning achievement (test scores) change over-time both at
mean and distributions. Using the above production function, student performance can be modeled as
a function of various determinants of educational performance, including both individual/family
background characteristics and school characteristics. The school achievement difference change
between the following four categories: (i), north and south, (ii) areas of residence, (iii) gender, and (iv),
poorest and richest wealth quintile. Based on the first category (north and south) this can be
represented as:
∆ℎ, ℎ = (ℎ /ℎ ) − (ℎ /ℎ )
                                                         
     ̂ℎ, (
= ∑                                 ̅ℎ, ) + ∑ 
                     ̅ℎ, −                                     ̅ℎ, − 
                                                           ̅ℎ, (                ̅ℎ, )

                               ̅ℎ, − 
                          + ∑(                                                  ̂ℎ, )
                                                                 ̂ℎ, − 
                                                ̅ℎ, )(
                              =1



64.      Where k is the regressor (k=1 is the intercept) and gap will be there if there is no difference
between the two periods. The gap is decomposed in three effects: (i), the endowment (or characteristic)
effect (first term) is the difference in scores due to differences in the average for each regresor, weighted
by the group north slope. It represents the part of the score gap that can be explained just because of
different average characteristics between both groups i.e. it represents the explained component of the
performance gap. This term indicates how differences in the average endowments of individual and/or
school resource/quality characteristics between the two groups affect the average performance gap, (ii),
the returns effect or coefficient (second term) represents the proportion of the score gap that can be
explained by differences in the slopes between both groups (given the average group north
characteristics). Note that the last two terms on the right of equation collectively represent what
Oaxaca (1973) originally in the labor market context referred to as the “discrimination” or “residual”
component of the wage gap. However, Blinder (1973) went further in identifying the two separate
parts of the discrimination component as one part due to differences in the intercepts and one part due
to differences in the coefficients, and the former has since been referred to the “pure discrimination”
component and the latter as the unexplained component, and (iii), the interaction effect (third term) is
the residual part of the decomposition. In the context of this study, the component is noted as
representing the difference in “pure” efficiency; that is, differences in performance that are unrelated

65.     Studies analyzing differences between two groups have further been interested in the
investigation of the individual and collective contributions of characteristics to the explained and
unexplained components (Ammermuller, 2007). For example, we might be interested in evaluating
how much of the difference in test scores between students in the countries/areas/gender is due to
differences in individual and family background characteristics, and how much is due to differences in
school characteristics and expressed as:
 ̂ℎ − 
            ̂ℎ = 
                            ̂ℎ −                              ̂ℎ − 
                                                           ̂ℎ (
                                             ̂ℎ +                             ̂ℎ ) + ̂ℎ (
                                                                                                                      ̂ℎ − 
                                                                                                                                    ̂ℎ )
                            ̂ ′ℎ (
                         +              ̂ℎ − ̂ℎ ) + ̂ ′ℎ (             ̂
                                                                                         ̂ℎ − ℎ )

66.     It is fairly simple to identify the contributions of individual characteristics to the explained
component given that the total component is merely a sum over the individual contributions (Jann,
2008: 8). For example:
     ̂
ned       ̂ south (X
                gap = β                  ̂ north )
                               ̂ south − X
                       ̂          ̂
                     = β1,north (X1,south − ̂             ̂ 2,south (X
                                             X1,north ) + β          ̂ 2,south − ̂                 ̂ n,south (X
                                                                                 X 2,north ) + ⋯ + β          ̂ n,south − ̂
                                                                                                                          X n,north )

where X̂1,south , X                                                                                 ̂ 2,north are
                                                                                        ̂ 1,south , β
                  ̂ 2,north are the means of the individual and school characteristics, β
the associated partial regression coefficients. Furthermore, standard errors for the individual
contributions are straight forward to estimate (Jann, 2008). However, estimating the contributions of
the individual characteristics to the total unexplained component is less straightforward. This is due to
the fact that the results offered by the detailed Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of test score differentials
are not invariant to the choice of reference (omitted) group when using dummy variables in the
education production functions (Jones, 1983; Oaxaca & Ransom, 1994; Nielsen, 2000; Horrace &
Oaxaca, 2001; and Yun, 2005). The choice of reference group does not, however, affect either the total
contribution or individual contributions of each categorical variable to the explained component.
Conversely, a change of reference category is found to not only change the individual contributions of
single categorical variables to the unexplained component, but also to alter the contribution of the
category as a whole.

Thus, following Jones (1983) detailed decomposition of the unexplained component is given
as:
                         ̂
                      Unexplained gap = [( ̂        ̂north ) + ̂
                                           αsouth − α                               ̂ 1,north )]
                                                                        ̂ 1,south − β
                                                               X B2003 (β
67.     The first term on the right hand side of equation is the part of the unexplained gap that is due
to “pure” performance differentials; the second term represents that part of the unexplained gap that is
due to differences in the education production process (that is, differences in the way that educational
input X is transformed into educational outputs or returns to characteristics). Assuming further that
the zero point of a continuous variable, Xi, is shifted by adding a constant a, the decomposition is now
given by:

   ̂
Unexplained gap = [α         ̂ 1,south ) − (α
                   ̂south − aβ′                       ̂′
                                            ̂north − aβ               ̂′           ̂          ̂
                                                         1,north ) + (X north − a)(β1,south − β1,north )]




                                                                                                                                                   168
68.                                                              ̂ 1B ) from the “pure” performance effect to
                                                          ̂ 1A − β
         The scale shift in Xi results in a transfer of a(β
the other part of the unexplained gap that is due to differences in coefficients. Therefore, the detailed
decomposition results for the unexplained component changes when no natural zero point exists for
one or more of the predictor variables and one can refer to Yun (2005) for the proposed solution to the
identification problem, however, more recent studies (Fortin, Lemieux, and Firpo 2010, Machado and
Mata (2005), and Altonji, Bharadwaj and Lamge , 2008) considered this solution as less establish and
still evolving and caution should be taken when interpreting the detailed decomposition results.
Overall, while breakdown of unexplained part into coefficient and instructions seems interesting, for
simplicity and due to the narrow coverage of the analysis we used unexplained without further
decomposition.



Annex E 4: Internal Efficiency: Efficiency analysis of the Nigeria education system using DEA


69.     Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is based on the construction of an empirical non-parametric
production frontier and the measurement of the efficiency through the distance between the observed
data and the optimal value of these data given by the estimated frontier. In the current analysis, the
production frontier approximates the maximum quality or access to education (the output) that could
be achieved given different levels of educational resources (the inputs). The figure below illustrates the
efficiency measurement with DEA in a hypothetical case of one input x that is used to produce one
output y.

70.     The frontier gives maximum levels of the output that could be achieved given different
quantities of the input used. In the DEA literature, observations are called Decision Making Units
(DMUs). DMUs that are on the frontier are relatively efficient (for instance, DMU at the point C) while
those below the frontier are relatively inefficient (for instance, DMU at the point A). The level of
efficiency is given by the distance to the frontier. Let’s consider the DMU0 initially at the point A. This
DMU uses x0 units of the input in order to produce y0 units of the output. As already mentioned, DMU0
is not relatively efficient. In order to be efficient, this DMU can reduce its input in the way that it
projects on the frontier at the point B. In other terms, in order to be efficient, this DMU can keep its
output level unchanged but has to reduce its input to the optimal level. The optimal quantity of input
is given by x0 with 0    1 . The higher is  , the closer the DMU is to the frontier and the more
efficient is the considered DMU. The value of  is the efficiency measure. This approach is called
input oriented DEA. There is an alternative to the input oriented DEA (the output oriented DEA)
which is about how to get the frontier by increasing the output given the input used. While there are
also several DEA models, the model that we use is the one developed by Charles, Cooper, and Rhodes
(1981). In this study, we use input oriented approach because we would like to focus on the use of
resources in the Nigeria basic education system.

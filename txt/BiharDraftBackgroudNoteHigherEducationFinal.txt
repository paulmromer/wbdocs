Executive Summary

        This Background Report prepared by the World Bank is written at a time when the
Government of Bihar (GoB) is launching a number of reforms in higher education. A Private
Universities Bill passed the Bihar State Assembly in April 2013 paving the way for opening of
private universities in the state. A strong effort to encourage universities and colleges to obtain
NAAC accreditation has been initiated. 104 colleges and 2 universities have recently submitted
their Letter of Intent to NAAC seeking accreditation. The Education Department expects that
about 150 constituent colleges and all state universities will eventually apply for NAAC
accreditation. Progress is also expected in filling faculty positions through a merit based
transparent process facilitated by the Public Service Commission where the candidates for
universities and colleges must have taken the NET/SLET Exams to be qualified for appointment
to Assistant Professor in universities and colleges. Furthermore a working group with Prof. N.R.
Menon as Chair has been set up to revise the University Act for Bihar over the next few months.

        The GoB has furthermore drawn a five-year blue print 2013-2017, “Mission Manav
Vikas – Inclusion Through Education? with very ambitious goals for higher education. From
2012 to 2017, the goal is to raise the Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) in higher education from 15
to 30%; to increase the number of NAAC grade A Colleges from 4 to 50; to establish 50 new
community colleges; to increase the constituent colleges offering B. Ed. courses from 3 to 60,
and the set up 20 new private universities. It is foreseen that these goals would demand a tri-fold
increase in the spending on higher education to be largely covered by the budget of the GoB as
well as additional private investments.

        The objective of this Background Report is to provide policy-makers and stakeholders in
higher education in Bihar with an overview of the opportunities and challenges that the State is
facing in terms of reaching the ambitious goals in Mission Manav Vikas. The Report analyzes
the data and information which is readily available on the access, equity, excellence and finance.
It can also be used as a baseline for the State Higher Education Plan in Bihar drafted as part of
the RUSA process1.

       The Report is reflecting what has been possible to do in a short period of time with the
available data and information. Some of the key issues that would need to be further examined,
are 1) how access and equity issues for women and minorities in higher education can be
improved e.g. through cultural, social and educational policies; 2) how public spending can be
most effectively used to leverage reform and how the role and size of private financing of higher
education in Bihar can be further expanded both in terms of investments from private universities
and colleges and families paying student fees; 3) how to get information and data on graduates

inform how best to develop the planned expansion of higher education enrollment in Bihar; and
4) what governance or institutional reforms are needed to promote better quality.

Education and Labor Market Status and Outcomes of Young People

       The population in the age group of 18-23 in Bihar is estimated to be around 7.4 million,
comprising 7% of the total population of the state. Historically Bihar has fared well below the
national average in India in terms of literacy and educational attainment. 47% of the 15 years and
above are not literate in Bihar compared with 32% for all India. This is despite significant
progress over the last couple of decades in female literacy which improved from 33% in 2001 to
53% in 2011. Almost 33% of the young people in Bihar between 18-23 years old never attended
an education institution compared to the national average of 13%. Strikingly, almost half of the
women between 18-23 years have never been enrolled in an education institution.

        It has not been possible to collect data on higher education outcomes except on labor
market data presented below. For example, there is no information about graduation rates. In
Bihar, overall unemployment rates are very low, at 3.3% for those who are not literate and 9.9%
for graduates, which is not surprising since most people cannot afford not to work regardless of
their educational attainment. For all India the comparable unemployment rates are however
somewhat lower at 1.7% for not literate and 7.5% for graduates. The Labor Force Participation
of people in the age group 18-23 is relatively low at 36% compared to 44% at the national level.
For the age group of 18-23 the unemployment for graduates in Bihar is very high at 84%
indicating that for the newly graduated it takes time to find an occupation (but also they can
afford to wait to get a suitable job).

        Males and females with higher education qualifications have also quite different labor
market force participation rates. Overall, 60% for males but only 8% of females are participating
in the labor force. About 45% of the boys below 30 years of age and with a degree are in the
labor force while the percentage is only 24% for girls. Even more astonishing is the fact that 51%
of the women under 30 years with a degree are neither working nor studying; while for boys this
figure is only 12%. It seems that there are non-educational issues preventing many women from
working.

Access and Equity to Higher Education

         Bihar’s higher education GER is one of the lowest in the country at 10.5% and is
significantly lower than the national GER of 19.4%. The state has a very low median age and a
rapidly increasing number of students are projected to graduate from higher secondary schools in
the coming years. While the current higher education enrolment stands at 1.04 million students,
it is estimated that Bihar will need to increase its enrollment capacity by 2,5 to 4 times by 2018
and up to 4 to 6 times by 2023, in order to reach the national average GER.


                                                  8
        The student enrolments in Bihar are overwhelmingly in the streams of Arts, Science and
Commerce with 78% of the total higher education enrollment. More professionally-oriented
studies in medicine, polytechnics and engineering represent only about 5% of the total
enrollments. There seems to be an urgent need to increase the quantity and quality in these fields
as the economy of Bihar increasingly will demand technical and professional expertise. The state
has furthermore an insufficient number of teacher training colleges and Government B. Ed.
Colleges to meet the demand for well-qualified teachers in primary and secondary education.
Finally, access to post-graduate and doctoral level education is extremely low in Bihar as about
93% of all the students in 2010-11 were undergraduates. This compares with Madhya Pradesh,
where the percentage of students enrolled in post-graduate studies was 19% in 2010-11. Building
high-quality research-based post-graduate studies will take time and it would be important to tap
into the possibilities that the RUSA Scheme will provide as well as the different research funds
managed by UGC.

        Bihar does not perform well in terms in access for higher education for women and the
minority communities compared with other states. The gender parity index for the state is the
third lowest in India; only 42% of the students in higher education are women. Similar patterns
are seen in faculty across the state with low proportion of females and disadvantages groups.
Enrollment of women is particular low in medical and engineering education, and it falls across
disciplines as students move from undergraduate to post graduate and doctoral studies. There is
also high inequality for various disadvantaged groups’ access to higher education institutions. In
Bihar, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have very limited access to
higher education. The GER for SCs and for OBCs in Bihar (at 2.5% and 8.6%) are the lowest
and second lowest in the country, respectively. Poor attendance in earlier phases of education is
an important factor in explaining low enrolment in higher education of women and
disadvantaged groups. It would be important to look further into the reasons why Bihar is doing
poorly compared to other states in providing access to higher education for women and
minorities.

        There are nine General State Universities in Bihar and 616 affiliated and constituent
colleges; the average size of the colleges, roughly 1840 students, is larger than the average size
of colleges in India but low by international standards. To improve access to higher education,
the GoB can either increase institutional density (create a higher number of colleges that are
geographically spread out) or it can increase the average size of institutions (by adding to the
infrastructure, facilities, faculty etc. of existing institutions). While many small institutions do
make higher education more accessible geographically, they might not give access to good
quality education. Larger institutions have the advantage of economies of scale and they can
offer inter-disciplinary learning, more exposure to diverse student population often in an urban
setting, and better labor market interactions. The GoB could support students from rural areas to
enroll in an urban area, which would have the advantage that young people from rural areas
would study in larger, better-equipped institutions. In practice, the GoB would most likely both
have to build more and create larger institutions to meet the demand for higher education (this
balance needs further exploration).
                                                   9
Excellence in Higher Education

        With the available data in Bihar, there is no straightforward way of measuring excellence
or quality of teaching and research in higher education. There are however a number of
indicators that can be evidence of quality. An important indicator is the number and
qualifications of the teaching faculty. The student teacher ratio in Bihar is 39:1 which is
substantially higher than the national average of 16:1. University colleges and local bodies have
particularly high ratios at 47:1 and 63:1, respectively. It underpins the need for the GoB to
proceed with the planned filling of the faculty positions under the auspices of the Public Service
Commission in the fields where there are severe faculty shortages as well as high student
demand. The division of teachers across various grades also shows that lecturers, tutors and
temporary teachers form 71% of the teaching staff in Bihar. Faculty at junior levels often does
not have enough expertise in their field to properly supervise Masters and Ph.D. students. As
universities and colleges in Bihar are expanding their post-graduate capacity, it would be
important to fill in more senior faculty positions.

        Another way of looking at quality of higher education is the number of institutions or
departments that have cleared quality parameters set by national bodies such as UGC and have
been recognized for their excellence. Very few institutions from Bihar qualify for criteria-based
grants given by UGC. Bihar has only 6 colleges and no universities that qualify for “institutions
with potential for excellence?. The comparable figures for Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
Uttar Pradesh are 26, 8 and 24, respectively. Moreover, Bihar has only 3 major research projects
supported by UGC whereas Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have
respectively 134, 9 and 63 such projects.

         Good infrastructure is another requirement for providing good quality education. While
most universities and colleges are equipped with libraries and sport facilities; laboratories are not
available in as many as 21% of the institutions. About 44% of the colleges and 20% of the
universities do not have computer centers. Other facilities that are essential for the quality of
student life such as health centers and cafeterias are not available in the large majority of
institutions. It should be underlined that these figure report the availability of infrastructure, not
its quality.

Financing Higher Education

        Bihar’s expenditure on higher education as a proportion of total public education
expenditure in 2008-09 was relatively high at 15% compared to the all India average of 10%. On
the other hand the per capita expenditure on higher education in Bihar in 2010-11 at Rs. 1221 is
less than a third of the all India level at Rs. 3865. Three factors can be put forward to explain this
apparent paradox. Firstly, the GDP per capita in Bihar is about half of India’s GDP per capita;
secondly the relative number of students enrolled in higher education in Bihar is significantly
lower than the national GER in India; and thirdly the annual amount that each higher education

                                                   10
student paid on higher education fees, etc., in Bihar is also significantly lower in Bihar (Rs. 4665
in 2007-08) than at the national level (Rs. 7360 in 2007-08).

        A sizeable source of finance for colleges is student fees. In 2010-11, the colleges in Bihar
received 19% of their financial income from student fees. As the annual expenditure per student
in higher education in Bihar is lower than most other states, the colleges in Bihar most likely
derive less of their income from student fees than it is the case in other states.

        The proportion spent by universities and colleges in Bihar on salaries was 77% in 2010-
11, which is significantly lower than e.g. the 90% spent on salaries in Madhya Pradesh. This is
encouraging in terms of there being resources for quality improvement. In the short term, as the
state is in the process of recruiting more teachers to fill its vacant posts, it is likely that
expenditure on salaries will increase. However, it is advisable that spending on the non-salary
component also increases proportionately.

        In order to meet the ambitious goal raising the GER in higher education in Bihar to 30%
by 2017 significant additional resources from the GoB, from the Government of India through
RUSA, and not at least from investments from private universities and families will have to be
identified and spent in an way that would improve the quality and relevance of higher education.
It is not only more resources that is needed, but also new higher education institutions such as
community colleges, which offer 2-year college studies with a combination of skills courses and
a wide range of work-relevant activities including internships in a working place. Furthermore,
new methods of curriculum delivery, especially student centered learning, and greater use of
contemporary knowledge resources would need to be expanded. The learning environment of
universities and colleges needs be modernized to enable technology-intensive pedagogy and
learning. It would be crucial to build capacity in Bihar both at the state and institutional level to
monitor and evaluate the higher education reforms. Finally, there will be a series of governance
and institutional reforms necessary to meet this challenging agenda. The World Bank will be
exploring these issues in more detail during the next phase of its support to the GoB.

Access

        The GER for Bihar is 10.5%, i.e., only 10.5% the population in the age group of 18-23
years is enrolled in institutions of higher education (Figure 1). India’s GER stands at 19.4%2 and
Bihar’s GER is above only that of Jharkhand, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli.

        By 2026 Bihar is expected to have the third lowest median age at 29 years, 3 making it the
state with the youngest and possibly largest workforce after Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Unless enough capacities are created in the vocational and higher education system to
accommodate the large number of students that will be exiting the schools, Bihar will fail to use
the potential of this human resource.

which MHRD calculates GER have changed from 2010-11 onwards. The data from the past years may not be
comparable to the data in 2010-11 on all parameters.

Young People in Bihar

        There are approximately 7.4 million people in the age group of 18-23 in Bihar. The
composition of the young population of Bihar shows that 32.6% of 18-23 year olds have never
had access to any educational institution and 42.5% of the young people have some education
but are currently not engaged in higher education. Only 15.6% people of this age group have
finished school, the number of graduates and post graduates is 8.2% and 0.5%, respectively. SCs
and STs are the weakest groups in the population; when compared with others as their access to
higher education is far more limited than their access to school education.

Future Demand for Higher Education

        In 2010, 592,196 students passed out of higher secondary education system (both CBSE
and the Bihar State Board) 5 . In the same year, about 348,100 6 students entered the higher
education system in undergraduate and diploma courses. This implies (keeping in mind
variations caused by the students migrating in and out of the state for higher education), the
transition rate from higher secondary to higher education was close to 58%.

        As of 2009, the national average of transition rate from school to college stood at
67.55%7. Considering that, like the rest of the country, Bihar will be looking at higher transition
rates in the future as well as higher number of students passing out of higher secondary schools,
enough capacities will have to be created in higher education to accommodate these students.
From 2005 to 2010, the CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of students passing out of
Bihar Education Board has been about 14.6%. Depending upon the growth rate of students
passing out of school and the transition rates from higher secondary to higher education, the
student intake in higher education may vary from .8 mil to 1.3 mil by 2018 (2.5 to 4 times
current capacity) and 1.1 mil to 2.0 mil by 2023 (4 to 6 times). This will call for substantial

Enrolments and Institutional Spread

        In 2010-11, Bihar had a student enrolment of about 1.05 million students in 20
universities and 631 colleges, across all levels of higher education. The average enrolment of a
college in Bihar was 1858, the third highest after Delhi, Arunachal Pradesh and Chandigarh (and
it is worth noting that Delhi and Chandigarh are exceptions as both areas are educational hubs
that attract a large student population, especially the large institutions of national importance).
The institutional size varies a lot; there are four colleges in Bihar with enrolments between
10,000 and 16,000, and there are also many institutions that are very small, notably Sanskrit
colleges with an average enrolment of only 237 students. On the whole, constituent colleges are

25-30% larger in size than affiliated colleges in Bihar. As can be expected, the size of rural
colleges is smaller than urban colleges. Looking at colleges under various managements, private
aided institutions have the largest average enrolments while private unaided institutions are
considerably smaller. The average enrolments need to be seen in conjunction with factors such as
availability of land, infrastructure and faculty to assess the quality of these institutions. The size
of existing institutions and the resources at their disposal can be valuable inputs for the
expansion of the higher education system in the state.

         To improve access to education, the State can either increase institutional density (create
more number of colleges that are geographically spread out) or it can increase the average size of
institutions (by adding to the infrastructure, facilities, faculty etc., of existing institutions). While
a large of small institutions do make higher education more accessible physically, they might not
necessarily give access to good quality. Large institutions have the advantage of economies of
scale; they offer inter-disciplinary learning, exposure to diverse student population, urban
environment, better labour-market interaction etc. More importantly, in a state like Bihar,
physically creating institutions from scratch will require heavy investments; the same
investments may yield greater returns if applied in strengthening existing institutions.

       Out of the 1.05 million students studying in Bihar, 92.8% are enrolled in undergraduate
education. This indicates that a large number of students do not opt for higher education after an
undergraduate level. The reasons for this need to be explored, but could be because of a variety
of reasons such as the perceived lack of value added by post graduate or doctoral studies, poor
quality of teaching at higher levels, lack of resources to pursue further education, limited
capacity of institutions to support PG studies. There are also a very small proportion of students
opting for diploma and PG diploma courses. Usually, such courses are designed for shorter
periods of time and provide skills that are relevant in the job market. Lack of enrolments in such
courses gives an indication towards the level of job-orientation of the higher education system
and the flexibility provided to students.

        The situation in engineering and medical education is not very different from other fields
in higher education. Engineering institutions do not have any students enrolled in masters or PhD
level education. Medical colleges do have a higher proportion of students in masters and PhD
level studies, which is expected, given the research-based nature of these disciplines.

        Out of the 20 Universities in Bihar, 16 institutions are funded by the State. Of these, only
9 are State Universities dedicated to general higher education, 7 others are uni-disciplinary.
These include a Medical University and 2 Agricultural Universities both of which have
constituent colleges; the National Law University, the recently constituted Technical University,
the open University and the Urdu University which do not have any attached colleges. Apart
from this, there are 4 centrally funded institutions in Bihar; IIT Patna, NIT Patna, Central
University Bihar and Nava Nalanda Mahavihar.

agricultural universities in Bihar and 2 under the medical university. Enrolments in technical/medical/agricultural
institutions have not been included.

degree of administrative control over such institutions. The affiliated colleges, on the other hand,
have different ownership and often receive very little or no funding from the state government.
They are dependent on the affiliating university only for academic and examination related
matters.

         Most other states have the system of constituent colleges/government colleges and
affiliated colleges. However, usually the number of affiliated colleges far exceeds the constituent
colleges. In Bihar, the numbers of institutions under state or university management (430) far
exceed the numbers under local body, private aided or unaided management (94). This shows the
extent of state control in the higher education sector. There are also many governance and
autonomy related implications of this kind of institutional spread. Constituent colleges are under
the control of the university/government, the decision-making process regarding various
(academic, financial, administrative) matters is often slower as one more layer of authority is
added, these colleges are also less autonomous in many ways. Affiliated institutions are
relatively faster in arriving at some of these decisions and hence more responsive to changes.

        The following diagram looks at the general make-up of the student population of Bihar in
terms of the type of institutions and physical location across gender. This table has been
constructed using the information from All India Survey of Higher Education; it includes
enrolments of 517 colleges out of the 630 colleges in Bihar. Almost all the institutions for which
the information is not available are affiliated colleges. Thus, it would be safe to assume that the
enrolments for affiliated colleges as mentioned in the table can be 15%-25% higher. Having said
that, the number of students enrolled in constituent and affiliated colleges might roughly be
equal.

Equity

        Equal access to higher education is another important perspective of looking at higher
education. Bihar does not fare very well in terms of access to higher education for women and
the minority communities. While the overall GER of Bihar is 10.5%, the GER for SCs and OBCs
stands at 2.5% and 8.6%11, well below the national average and some of the lowest scores for
these indicators. Indeed Bihar is unusual in doing poorly with all types of disadvantaged groups.
Given states’ different experiences in enabling access of disadvantaged groups, this is an area
where Bihar can learn from other states (and will be explored further).

   Population of Scheduled Tribes in Bihar is extremely low, thus very detailed data about their higher education
status is not available. Sampling for such a small and thinly spread group is statistically unreliable, thus estimates
have not been included in the analysis.
                                                                              20
       The distribution of faculty members across categories in Bihar tells a similar story. While
the participation of OBCs in teaching is comparatively higher, the number of SC teachers is
extremely low (despite existing quotas). For greater inclusion at the faculty level, it is an
imperative to get more students from the disadvantaged groups into the fold of higher education
and more importantly, promote their participation at post-graduate and doctoral levels.

       Across the categories, for students as well as faculty, the gender disparity is very obvious.
The gender parity index for Bihar is 0.53, as compared to a national average of 0.74. Bihar’s
performance is better than that of only Jharkhand and Odisha. In terms of the GPI for Scheduled
Caste category students, Bihar is at the absolute bottom (GPI of 0.34).

        As seen in Table 1 earlier, in Bihar the proportion of women (in 18-23 year age group)
who have never attended education institutions (at 46.3%) is 26.1% points higher than the men
who have never attended any educational institutions. Out of the 53.7% who have ever attended
educational institutions, 13.3% are attending any today while for men, out of the 79.8% who ever
attended educational institutions, 35.4% are still attending institutions. This means that the rate
of women attending educational institutions as well as them not continuing their education is far
higher than men. A similar trend in seen is the labor market, with the labor force participation
rate of women is very low and high rates of women who are neither studying nor working. This
paints a rather grim picture; it is obvious that the coverage of the existing education system and
the labour market it contributes to, is very limited and excludes many women. It brings to fore
the question whether bringing girls into the fold of the education system is enough when no
efforts are made to increase their participation in the labor force.

        As of 2010-11, in terms of enrolments, out of the 1.04 million students, 620,202 students
are males while 425,925 students are female. The disparity in the enrolments of males and
females increases as the level of studies increases. A very sharp difference is seen across gender
lines in the medical and engineering enrolments, with very small proportion of female students.

       Bihar does not have any women’s university. According to the All India Survey of
 Higher Education, amongst the colleges, only 43 (out of the 524 colleges covered) are women’s
 colleges (as illustrated in the diagram below). However, the impact of creation of more
 women’s institutions on women’s enrollments needs to be investigated further.

        In terms of geographical distribution of institutions, 51% of the colleges in Bihar are
 situated in rural12 areas; this might partly be explained by the fact that the urbanization level is
 lower in Bihar than many other states in India. Surprisingly, the reach of affiliated colleges is
 deeper in the rural areas than that of constituent colleges. There are more constituent colleges in
 urban areas than affiliated colleges. Since most affiliated colleges are private institutions, it is
 interesting to see their participation in rural areas, as in most other states private players are
 reluctant to establish institutions in rural parts of states. Understanding further why this is the
 case in Bihar would be important.

  For the AISHE survey, rural/urban status of an institution depends on the location of the administrative unit of the
college and the way district administration designates said area
                                                            23
District-wise spatial Distribution

         The institutional density of colleges differs across districts in Bihar. There are some
districts with very low density such as Sheohar, Pashchim Champaran, Purba Champaran,
Supaul, Kishanganj, Kaimur, Banka etc., (0 to 3.5). On the other hand there clearly are districts
with high concentration of institutions such as Darbhanga, Nalanda, Patna, Saran and Jehanabad
(density of 10 to 26 institutions). Districts with low institutional density are also the institutions
with lower higher education enrolments compared to total population. In terms of absolute
enrolments, Patna, Darbhanga and Saran attract the largest number of students. The districts with
low density of institutions and low absolute enrolments are largely rural and many are located at
the border of the state with Nepal and Bangladesh.

        In about 40% of the districts, more than half the students are enrolled in rural institutions.
Arwal, Samastipur, Nawada and Banka have more than 74% students in rural areas. In
Kishanganj, Purba Champaran, Jehanabad and Bhojpur, girls form less than one third of the
student population. The average institution size again varies widely: Kishanganj and Siwan have
less than 1000 students on an average in a college, while Nawada, Saran, Bhagalpur and Vaishali
have institutions with more than 3000 students on an average.

       In order to have a more balanced development, Bihar must aim to get more students from
the backward and rural districts into the higher education system.

Excellence

        Quality of the higher education system can be looked at from multiple perspectives. The
preferable means of assessing the quality include measurement of the learning outcomes, labor
market outcomes etc. In case of Bihar, the available data only relates to some very basic
indicators such as job orientation of the courses, student teacher ratio, infrastructural availability
and performance of the state institutions against certain defined quality parameters.


Subject-wise distribution of students

        The student enrolments in Bihar are overwhelmingly in the streams of Arts, Science and
Commerce. 78% of the enrolments are in these courses, while engineering and medical only
form 5% of the total enrolments. The other end of the spectrum is a state like Tamil Nadu that
has a very diverse mix of disciplines being pursued by the students. Bihar must look at the future
needs of its economy and consider which fields of education would benefit it the most. Trends
show an increasing demand for skill-based education from the labor markets. According to EY-
FICCI (Higher Education in India: Twelfth Five Year Plan 2012-2017 and beyond), out of the
455 million jobs currently in the country, 89.7% are skill-based ((Sales, Service, Production,
Farmers and related workers), 9.3% Knowledge Based (Professional, Administrative, Clerical)
and 1% Knowledge + Skill Based (Architects, Engineers etc.). It suggests that out of the 75 to
80 million jobs that will be created in the 5 years (2012-17), about 75% would require vocational
training. It also mentions that industry reports across the country indicate that around 20% of the
graduates in general streams (BSc/ BA) are perceived to be unemployable as they lack specific
skills while 25% of technical graduates and 10%–15% of other graduates are considered
employable by the IT/ITES industries.

Labor Force Participation of Young People

         The unemployment levels in any state can give a partial indication towards the quality of
higher education in the state. As can be noticed from the tables below, unemployment and
idleness levels are very high in the 18-23 year age group in Bihar. The levels jump a lot higher
for graduates. This is an indication of the fact that either graduates are unable to find
employment that fits them or they are unsuitable for the employment opportunities that exist in
the labour market. Often, students with graduation degrees are unwilling to do jobs that they
consider to be “low paying? or not fit for their level of education, they choose to stay
unemployed instead. It implies that if higher education does not keep up with the external
environment, it becomes counter-productive. The important aspect to consider here is the fact
that there is a gap between the expectations of the labor market and the resources that the higher
education system is producing. In order to justify its cost, the system must be able to impart
skills that improve earning capacity of the students. Institutions Bihar urgently need to align their
curriculum and mode of instruction to the changing needs of the market. Despite their education
status, women’s participation in the labour force is low in Bihar, thus they also add to the idle
population. Efforts must be made by the institutions to prepare greater proportion of women for
the labour markets.

         A very small proportion of students engage in post graduate or doctoral studies. This has
many implications on the system in terms of quality. Firstly, it points towards the lack of
research done at college and university levels, by teachers as well as students. Secondly, it points
to the small pool of students that the system is producing for the future consumption of the
academic institutions in the form of faculty, teaching aids etc. Limited postgraduate studies are
also an indication of the quality (or lack thereof) of faculty that is currently teaching at
institutions of higher learning.


Faculty and Student-teacher Ratio

        The quality and number of teachers is a very critical determinant of the quality of
teaching, learning and research that happens in any institution. High student teacher ratios may
exist because the number of positions as compared to the number of students are less, the
existing positions are vacant or both. States throughout India face challenges with faculty
recruitments. Bihar’s situation is a lot worse than many other states. The information regarding
faculty vacancies is not available; however, it is known that the student teacher ratio in Bihar is
39:1. This ratio is lower than the national average of around 25:1 in 2009-10. The situation in
Local Body Colleges and University colleges are of particular concern. It is important to note
that we only have information about the faculty in terms of sufficiency but assessments of
quality of the faculty, their qualification and training are elusive. Following are the student
teacher ratios in Bihar across various categories of institutions:

         The division of teachers across various grades shows that the teaching staff in Bihar is
bottom heavy. Lecturers, tutors and temporary teachers form 71% of the faculty. Given the
existing faculty vacancies, this trend is a matter of concern. Faculty at junior levels do not attain
enough expertise in their field to ably handle masters or PhD level students, there is also a
shortage of PhD and post-doctoral advisors in such cases. Consequently, research work by the
faculty also suffers. As years pass, institutions could be left with a bloated middle or senior
faculty body; this is bound to cause imbalances in teaching loads, management and leadership of
institutions. Institutions need to consciously recruit faculty at all levels to maintain the balance
between various levels of faculty, even if it costs less to recruit junior or temporary faculty.

Accreditation and UGC Grants

        Another way of looking at the quality of institutions across the state is to look at the
number of institutions or departments that have met quality parameters set by national bodies
such as UGC, and have been recognized for their excellence. Bihar does not have any
Universities with Potential for Excellence while there are 6 Colleges with Potential for
excellence (Table 14).14 An area where many states have excelled, especially the southern states
is the Minor and Major research projects. Bihar can claim to have only a couple of these grants.
Such grants depend as much on the quality of the institutions and proposals as on the timely
availability of information regarding such opportunities. Efforts need to be made to increase the
orientation of students and faculty towards research and make them aware of the resources for
which they can apply.

         Accreditation is an important measure of quality. As of now, only 13 colleges in Bihar
have received accreditation, this is about 2% of the total number of colleges in the state. NAAC
awards accreditation through a fairly robust process that considers multiple aspects of an
educational institution such as infrastructure, quality of teaching learning processes, research
activities etc. Even in the process of preparing and applying for accreditation, institutions often
improve their quality significantly. Thus, more institutions must be encouraged and enabled to
go through this process. Bihar has already begun efforts in this direction whereby 51 institutions
are being prepared for accreditation.

Infrastructure

        Infrastructure is one of the requirements for providing good quality education. Certain
basic infrastructural facilities along with important inputs such as qualified teaching staff,
teaching aides, resources for research etc. can go a long way in creating an environment
conducive for better teaching and learning experience. The status of availability of various
infrastructural components in universities and colleges in Bihar is varied. While most
universities and colleges are equipped with libraries and playground, laboratories are not
available with as many as 21% of the institutions. About 44% of colleges and 20% of the
universities do not have computer center. This points towards the kind of teaching methods that
may be used for instruction in such institutions as well as the exposure of students to technology.
Other requirements that are essential to the quality of student life on campus such as health
centers and cafeterias are not available in a large majority of institutions. The data only points
towards the availability of infrastructure; it is very likely that there are further inadequacies as
regards the quality and sufficiency given student enrollment at different institutions of this
infrastructure.

Financing

        This section discusses how the higher education system in Bihar is financed. It analyzes
the public financing of general higher education in the state and draws comparisons with other
states in India both in terms of contributions from the GoB and from UGC grants from the
national government to the state universities and colleges. Furthermore, there is a brief analysis
of information on private expenditure on higher education in terms of fees from students which
forms an important source of funding in higher education.

Public Spending

       In 2008-09, Bihar’s expenditure on higher education as a proportion of total education
expenditure at nearly 15% was higher than the all India average of 10%. Leaving out Manipur,
which shows an unusually high proportion spent on higher education (Figure 15) due to low total
expenditure, Bihar ranked second highest among all other states, the highest being Andhra
Pradesh at nearly 17%. Among the neighboring states, the proportion spent by Orissa and
Jharkhand was quite close to that of Bihar, while West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh spent lower on
higher education, at around 12% and 7% respectively.

       Per capita expenditure on higher education is however low in the state. Recent figures
from 2010-11 reveal Bihar to be the fourth lowest ranked among all states at a per capita
expenditure of Rs. 1221 on higher education; the all-India average being Rs. 3865. Three factors
can be put forward to explain this apparent paradox. Firstly, the GDP per capita in Bihar is about
half of India’s GDP per capita; secondly the relative number of students enrolled in higher


                                                  36
education in Bihar is significantly lower than the national GER in higher education in India; and
thirdly the average annual amount that each higher education student pursuing higher education
is paying on fees etc. in Bihar is also significantly lower in Bihar (Rs. 4665 in 2007-08) than at
the national level (Rs. 7360 in 2007-08).

        As seen in (Figure 16), there is not a very strong relationship between GSDP per capita
and expenditure per capacity on higher education. However, the line of correlation rises upwards,
indicating that generally richer states spend a higher amount on higher education, but the gentle
slope of the line signifies that this relation is not very strong. If Tamil Nadu would not be
included in the calculation, there might not be any correlation.

       In the section below, we look at details of receipts and expenditure of the constituent
colleges of universities of Bihar. After grants, the major source of finance for colleges is fees
from students. In 2010-11, colleges of Bihar received 19 per cent of its financing from fees
(Figure 17) amounting to more than Rs. 110 cr. This is indicative of the amount of private
expenditure on higher education in the state.

        Break up of college expenditure shows that the highest proportion of nearly 77% is spent
on salaries (Figure 18). Based on our observation of other states, such as Madhya Pradesh where
salaries constituted nearly 90% of expenditure on higher education from 2004-05 onwards, the
proportion spent by Bihar on salaries is lower. In the short term, as the state is in the process of
recruiting more teachers to fill its vacant posts, it is likely that expenditure on salaries will
increase. However, it is advisable that the share of non-salary component also increase
proportionately. Expenditure on construction, repair and maintenance and infrastructure such as
library and laboratory constitute another 11 per cent of non-plan expenditure. Colleges of Bihar
spent a total of Rs. 5 cr on scholarships in 2010-11, accounting for 1% of overall expenditure in
the year.

UGC Funding

        UGC grants have been less than 1 per cent of total expenditure on higher education in the
state (Figure 19). Also, the quantum of grants has dropped significantly from 2008-09 onwards.
This is mainly due to reduction in plan grants by UGC, illustrated in (Figure 20). Moreover,
UGC has not been providing any funds for non-plan expenditure for state universities and
colleges of Bihar since 2010-11. Though even before that, the non-plan grant amount was quite
low (Rs. 64 lakh and Rs. 17 Lakh in 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively).

Student Expenditure

        The average annual expenditure that each student paid on general higher education
(tuition fee, exam fees and other payments, books, and transport) in 2007-08 is lower in Bihar
than any other state exempt Chattisgarh, Goa and Uttarakhand Students pursuing general higher
education in Bihar paid on average Rs. 4665 in 2007-08, which was significantly lower than
comparable states such as Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh as well as Uttar Pradesh (Please see
Table 15). It should be noted that these figures on student expenditure do not only include
payment of fees to the higher education institutions but also for books and transport. It is
however very likely that the largest part of the Rs. 4665 would be paid to these institutions.

Introduction

In response to a request from Central Asian (CA) countries at the CAREC Energy Sector
Coordination Committee meeting, held in March 2015 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, the World
Bank commissioned a study to estimate unrealized benefits from regional power trade for the
four Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan1 during
the period from 2010 – 2014. The study was implemented by AF Mercados from October
2015 through June 2016.

This report reviews the key findings of the AF Mercados Report, with further details to be
found in the Report itself. The analysis was focused on power trade benefits aggregated at the
regional level, as well as country-specific benefits. Three cases were considered, namely (i)
benefits including fuel savings only at historic energy prices, (ii) benefits including both fuel
savings and economic value of avoiding unserved energy at historic fuel prices, and (iii)
benefits including fuel savings and the economic value of avoiding unserved energy with fuel
costs estimated to be at “market? energy prices.

The findings of the report, presented in the table below, show that the benefits for the region
could have amounted to nearly USD1.5 billion if only fuel savings were taken into account.
Should economic value of avoiding unserved power demand be added to benefits, the
benefits would have reached almost USD5.2 billion for historic energy prices and about
USD6.4 billion for market energy prices. It’s worth noting that each country could also have
benefited in any of the cases, except for Kyrgyzstan for the case of including fuel savings
only.

market prices from outside sources.

1.     The Current Situation

1.1    Historical Background

The Central Asia Power System (CAPS) was designed and developed in the former Soviet
Union to serve the needs of the USSR republics of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan and the southern portion of Kazakhstan. Both the regional transmission system
(based primarily on the CAPS 500 kV transmission “loop? transiting through Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan) and overall operating regimes were developed in order to allow
the coordinated and optimized use of fossil fuel and hydroelectric resources throughout the
region to meet electrical demand while at the same time managing water flows for irrigation
purposes.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five newly independent republics
initially acted to put in place a framework of intergovernmental agreements intended broadly
to maintain many of the operating goals of the previously integrated system. An agreement
on parallel electricity system operations was signed in late 1991, and an agreement on water
sharing (essentially maintaining previous Soviet practices) was signed in early 1992.

However, soon after obtaining independence in 1991, differences both in domestic interests
and priorities as well as in natural resource endowments among the independent republics put
pressure on these and subsequent related agreements. Problems adhering to agreed energy
import / export levels as well as water release volumes appeared, and became particularly
apparent in years of extreme hydrology.

Over time, the operations of CAPS evolved. In 2003, Turkmenistan effectively withdrew
(apart from occasional bilateral transactions) and synchronized with the Iranian system. In
2009, a series of changes left Tajikistan essentially isolated from CAPS, with only some
lower voltage level connections with Kyrgyzstan available.

It should be noted that throughout this historical period (as well as at present), the energy
situation within CAPS, especially in the hydropower-based systems of Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan, has been one marked by both seasonal (winter) energy shortages and (summer)
surpluses, together with a strong joint reliance on the trans-boundary transmission
interconnections. Prior to the problems experienced in 2009, the ability to use the region's
hydro resources nearly optimally helped to alleviate the problem of summer surpluses, and,
via trade or energy exchange (barter), somewhat mitigate winter shortages. Nevertheless,
shortages still occurred, and today with a smaller CAPS (and increasing load growth) the
problem has become more acute, even in countries with dominant thermal generation.

 1.2      The Current Situation

 The current situation in CAPS can be characterized as one of steady load growth, coupled
 with high and increasing levels of energy-not-served (ENS, or “unserved energy?) in some
 countries, and economically inefficient use of regional energy resources.          These
 characteristics, taken together, contribute to a costly situation for the region.

 estimated demand for the region and also each of the four countries during the 2010 – 2014
 period.

 As Figure 1 shows, demand2 growth for the region as a whole was generally steady,
 averaging about 2% per annum throughout the period. Unserved energy was typically about
 5% of total consumption in each year, and limited to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.

 Figure 2 shows that despite the fairly steady regional growth, there were significant
 differences among the countries.

 The fact that regional resources are used inefficiently is probably best illustrated by the
 pattern of water spillage from hydroelectric plants over the period. Figure 3 shows the
 energy lost by water spills in each year of the period:

  By “demand?, we refer to actual consumption plus the estimated unserved energy (i.e., shortages and customer
 curtailments). Note that Tajikistan’s consumption (and demand) fell over the period (as shown in Figure 2)
 primarily due to the reduction in production at the aluminium smelter TALCO. In years prior to the study
 period, TALCO represented as much as 40% of Tajik consumption; by the end of the study period it had
 dropped to 26%.

The most significant energy losses due to water spills occurred in Tajikistan, which could be
expected due to its currently limited transmission links in the region. Spills also occurred in
Kyrgyzstan and (to a lesser extent) Uzbekistan. Only Kazakhstan had no reported energy
losses due to water spills.

In total, the energy lost due to water spills varied from about 1% to 3.6% of aggregate
regional energy consumption annually. While this may seem like a small proportion, the
analysis of the Report shows that harnessing these losses through better interconnection and
efficient trade has significant economic value.

Finally, the overall level of cross-border trade throughout the region is itself an indicator of
the general failure to efficiently utilize and share regional resources. Over the period from
2010 – 2014, the average annual power flows among the countries of the region were only
about 10% of the level achieved in the early 1990s. This is a stark indicator of the ever-
growing inefficiency of trade in the region.

2.     The Analysis

2.1    Objectives of the Analysis

There have been previous studies3 of the potential benefits of efficient energy trade in the
region. While these studies have always shown benefits, they have tended to focus on these
benefits within the context of a forward-looking analysis, often focused also on system
development issues.

This study has instead been structured to look backwards at what happened historically
during a specific period (i.e., for the years 2010 – 2014), and then to calculate what
incremental economic benefits would have been obtained had efficient trade been pursued

Markets International (Spain) for the World Bank.

throughout that period.      Specifically, the analysis was focused on the following three
questions:
        ?      What would have been the aggregate additional benefits for the four-country
               region had efficient trade been pursued?
        ?      How might those total benefits been distributed among the four countries had a
               set of pricing rules which evenly shared the benefits for cross-border trade
               been adopted?
        ?      How might those benefits have changed if fuel prices for generation in the
               region had been at “export market? levels for cross-border trade, rather than at
               the levels which historically prevailed?
The “backward-looking? focus for the analysis was chosen specifically in order to eliminate
uncertainty over the sorts of assumptions which need to be made in forward-looking analyses
(e.g., assumptions regarding future demand levels, fuel prices, availability and cost of new
capacities, etc). However, as we have noted above, previous “forward -looking? studies have
been performed and the general message – that efficient trading brings substantial regional
benefits – is consistent throughout all of these analyses.

2.2     Structure of the Analysis

The analysis is based on a set of simulations of four-country operations (i.e., dispatch) for the
historical period 2010 – 2014. Each simulation is based on differing assumptions, thus
creating individual different scenarios. Table 2 below summarizes the characteristics of each
of the individual simulation scenarios, with further descriptions following the Table.

The first two pairs of scenarios – REAL SIM C andT100C ENS, followed by REAL SIM C
and T100C, all shaded in the table above – are the principal scenarios of focus for this work.

             The “REAL SIM C ENS? scenario can be considered as the “Base Case? for
              the analysis of estimating “cash costs? benefits. It is structured to simulate
              (within the bounds of the modelling tools and techniques) the actual total cost
              of operating the four-country system as it was actually operated (in terms of
              generation, hydro utilization, cross border power flows, levels of consumption
              and unserved energy, etc.) during the five-year period. It was developed based
              on data from CDC Energia.

             The “T100C ENS? scenario is the main “Efficient Trade? scenario. It is
              structured to retain the same levels of generation and hydro utilization
              availability, but to dispatch the system not as it actually was dispatched, but
              instead in an aggregate four-country least-cost basis in order to serve power
              demand observed in the REAL SIM C scenario. In addition, the T100C
              scenario makes the full transmission capacity of the modelled system (see
              explanation below) available for cross-border trade, including restoration of
              the Tajik system to the CAPS grid.

       ?      The “REAL SIM C? case is similar to the REAL SIM C ENS case, but
              structured to track ENS levels in order to allow estimation of the benefits of
              serving unserved energy (in the T100C case). It differs from the REAL SIM C
              ENS case only due to small modelling effects.

             The “T100C? scenario is the same as the T100C ENS scenario, except for
              meeting total demand (i.e., actual consumption, as observed in the REAL SIM
              C scenario, plus estimated unserved energy) as well as possible.

             The T100 scenario mirrors the assumptions of the T100C scenario, but instead
              uses “export market? prices for fossil fuels, including a charge for CO2
              emissions to optimize aggregate system dispatch and to assign values to cross-
              border trade. This scenario was designed to help answer the question of how
              the benefits of trade might have been affected had fossil fuel-based energy
              been priced at “market? levels for export/import substitution as electricity or as
              exports as fuel during the period. In the analytical results, it is paired with a
              “REAL SIM? alternative base case which itself is also based on the same
              assumptions regarding fuel prices and carbon costs.

                The “T033? and “T066? scenarios are conceptually the same as the T100
                 scenario, with the exception that cross border transmission capacities are
                 limited to 33% and 66% respectively of actual total capacity

The system simulation modelling was carried out using the “SDDP? model which is able to
dispatch the combined thermal / hydro system taking into account major transmission links.
The four-country system was modelled as individual countries connected by transmission
links, with two countries (Kazakhstan and Tajikistan) further incorporating internal north /
south transmission limitations. The general schematic of the physical system modelled is
shown in Figure 4 below.

Further details of the SDDP model, the modelling methodology, and various input data can
be found in Chapter 4 of the AF Mercados Report.

The analysis proceeded by computing the full four-country system operating cost
corresponding to each case and using the differences in this total costs between cases to
determine the incremental benefits of efficient trade (represented by the economic least-cost
dispatch) in any individual case relative to the appropriate Base Case (e.g., by comparing the
T100C case to the REAL SIM C case). The operating costs were represented by variable
operating costs (fuel plus variable O&M costs) of generation, plus an additional economic
cost of USD 150 / MWh for any unserved energy in the scenario4.

Thus, if a scenario (e.g., T100C) was able to use system resources more efficiently than the
Base Case scenario, either by using overall resources to reduce the base case levels of
unserved energy and / or to use cheaper (hydro) resources to reduce the use of more
expensive fossil fuels, then that scenario would show aggregate benefits relative to the Base
Case. The analysis further was able to estimate a reasonable allocation of those benefits on a
country-by-country basis by creating an artificial “price? for cross-border power exchanges
where the “price? was based on the marginal cost of the power exchange. While it is
recognized that this latter analysis relies on a “modelled? or artificial pricing rule, the
4
 AF Mercados have also performed a sensitivity analysis which essentially does not assign a benefit to meeting
historically unserved through trade, and limiting economic benefits essentially to fuel savings. This sensitivity
analysis is described in Section 4.2 below.


Document of the World Bank                             7
analysis itself is intended to demonstrate whether it is possible that with a reasonable pricing
scheme, benefits might flow to all countries. As the analysis described in the next section
shows, in fact this is the case.

Finally, a separate calculation was also made to estimate the total savings to the region of
maintaining reserve requirements since a more fully integrated four-country system would be
expected to need to maintain fewer reserves than a more independent country-by-country
operation.

3.          Results: Fuel Savings only from Efficient Trade at Historic Fuel Prices (REAL
            SIM C ENS vs T100C ENS)

In this analysis, the objective was to estimate the benefits of efficient trade (with historic fuel
prices) while meeting historic consumption levels in each of the countries. It is important to
note that “historic consumption levels? are different from “historic demand levels? because
the latter includes unserved energy (as was shown in Figure 1). While the economic benefit
of avoiding unserved energy is certainly real, it is not a direct and immediate “cash expense?,
and so this analysis can be viewed as determining the cash-only benefits of implementing
efficient trade with historic fuel prices.

3.1         The Base Case: REAL SIM C ENS

In the REAL SIM C ENS case, the system was operated on the basis of historical actual
generation, with cross border flows constrained (within model capabilities) to actual levels.
Figure 5 below shows the aggregate 5-year system dispatch by fuel type, and Figure 6 shows
the total generation by each individual country.

The system is dominated by coal-fired production, with a roughly even split between gas and
hydro for the remainder (recognizing that in this base case there are still substantial hydro
spills due to lack of trade).

As a benchmark for later comparisons, we note that the calculated level of CO2 emissions for
the five-year period covered in this scenario are approximately 500 million tons in aggregate.
The system’s cross border flows (as modelled) are shown in Figure 7 below.

3.2    Efficient Trade, Fuel Savings Only: T100C ENS

The efficient trade case for assessing the value of fuel savings (ignoring unserved energy)
uses the same level of fuel costs and consumption as the REAL SIM C ENS case, but
removes constraints on individual station generation levels and actual transmission capacity
usage. By removing these restrictions, the system can be dispatched to meet consumption
levels on a least-cost basis, subject only to actual physical maximum transmission constraints.
Furthermore, it is also assumed that Tajikistan is physically re-connected to CAPS, thus
restoring the effective transmission links shown in Figure 5 above.

Figures 8 and90 below illustrate the system-wide dispatch results of the T100C ENS case
relative to the REAL SIM C ENS Base Case (which has also already been shown previously
in Figures 5 and 6).

 It is worth noting the (expected) increase in hydro generation (due to lack of water spills)
 with the corresponding reduction mostly in high-cost gas-fired generation.

 The total CO2 emissions over the five-year period for this scenario are actually less than in
 the Base Case, corresponding to 492.6 million tons, or about a 1.5% reduction in emission
 levels. This is due primarily to the substitution of hydro energy for gas-fired generation.

 components include:



 Document of the World Bank                              10
        ?        Cost: This represents the dispatch cost (fuel and variable O&M) of operating
                 the system. In this Figure, it can be seen that cost is shown as an incremental
                 benefit (i.e., a positive value in the figure), thus telling us that the system
                 operating cost actually decreased (due to better utilization of hydro resources)
                 in the Efficient Trade scenario relative to the Base Case.

        ?        Unserved Energy: This is not shown in the above figure since the quantity of
                 unserved energy was intentionally held constant in the two cases. However, in
                 the results for other scenarios (described in Sections 4 and 5 below), the
                 efficient trade cases will reduce unserved energy, thus providing an economic
                 benefit. The value of this economic benefit (calculated at USD 150 / MWh)
                 will in these subsequent cases be shown as a positive benefit in the appropriate
                 later figures.

        ?        Imports and Exports: Within the region, there are substantially more cross-
                 border trades (i.e., imports and exports) in the Efficient Trade case relative to
                 the Base Case. These trades are “priced? based on the marginal costs of
                 production in individual hours modelled. The bars for “exports? and “imports?
                 simply represent the price multiplied by the quantity of the power flow. In the
                 aggregate analysis, the total costs of imports should balance the total costs of
                 exports, although they will of course vary country-by-country. However, the
                 increased power flows also cause increased transmission losses which are
                 accounted for in the “import? value5. It is useful to note that from an
                 economic perspective, the “economic value? of an export or import will be the
                 total money paid for the power exported or imported (which is what is shown
                 in these bars), net of the change in dispatch costs for either country (which is
                 accounted for in “cost? above) or, for the importing country, reductions in
                 unserved energy (also noted above).

        ?        Net Benefits: The net benefits are simply the sum of the individual positive
                 benefits (in this instance, “exports? and “cost?) less the increased costs (in this
                 instance, “imports?). The aggregate regional net benefits here come to
                 approximately USD 1.5 billion over the five-year period.

3.3      Individual Country Benefits

It is useful also to consider the distribution of these total benefits among the four countries.
Table 3 below summarizes the country-by-country situation.

 In addition, there are also (small) effects related to how assumed costs in the (later-described in Section 4)
T100 scenario might affect the economics of extra-regional imports / exports.

It can be seen that all countries (apart from hydro-dominated Tajikistan) enjoyed substantial
Dispatch Cost savings as previously-spilled or under-utilized hydro resources in the region
were applied to reducing fossil fuel costs. All countries enjoyed substantial benefits, apart
from Kyrgyzstan. For Kyrgyzstan, while the country enjoyed the greatest fossil fuel cost
savings, it also lost value on its export sales (due to more hydro-electricity generally reducing
cross-border prices throughout the region) and of course purchased imports in order to reduce
its fossil fuel costs. These competing factors almost exactly balanced out its dispatch cost
savings, leaving Kyrgyzstan with a small negative benefit over the 5-year period. The other
countries had total benefits ranging from about a quarter to over half a billion USD.

4.       Results: Benefits from Fuel Savings and Meeting Unserved Power Demand via
         Efficient Trade (REAL SIM C vs T100C)

In this section, we analyze the economic benefits of efficient trade including the value of
meeting previously unserved energy demand as well as dispatch fuel savings. This is
achieved through the creation of a new base case (“REAL SIM C? which is quite similar to
REAL SIM C ENS and differs primarily due to modelling details) and a new efficient trade
case (“T100C?) which both optimizes dispatch and trade (using full transmission capability)
and attempts to meet total demand rather than merely historic consumption levels.

4.1      The Base Case: REAL SIM C

In the REAL SIM C case, the system was operated on the basis of historical actual
generation, with cross-border power flows constrained to actual levels. Figure 13 below
shows the aggregate 5-year system dispatch (by fuel type) and aggregate system unserved
energy, while Figure 14 shows the total generation by each individual country.

The overall system was dominated by coal (about 47% of production), followed by a roughly
even split between hydro (not including water spills which amounted to about 6.5% of useful
hydro production) and stations burning gas or oil. The estimated amount of unserved energy
for the period was about 38,500 GWh, or approximately 5 percent of total consumption. The
unserved energy (ENS) rate by country ranged from zero in Kazakhstan, to about 9 -10 % of
consumption in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

The system’s cross border flows (as modelled) are shown in Figure 15 below.

  4.2        The Efficient Trade Case: T100C

  The efficient trade case (T100C) uses the same level of fuel costs and demand (i.e.,
  consumption plus energy-not-served) as in the Base Case (i.e., REAL SIM C), but removes
  the base-case constraints on individual station generation levels and actual transmission
  capacity usage.

  Figures 16 and 17 below illustrate the system-wide dispatch results of the T100C case
  relative to the Base Case (which has also already been shown previously in Figures 13 and
  14).

  Several points are worth noting. First, in terms of aggregate dispatch, every country apart
  from Kazakhstan enjoyed an increase in output (Kazakhstan’s decrease was only about 1% of
  output). In terms of generation by fuel type, coal generation actually increased by the
  greatest amount (about 8%) with hydro generation increasing by about 6%, thus making
  nearly full use (97%) of previously spilled water resources. Only gas / oil-fired generation
  decreased in aggregate (by about 1%). The system’s total energy-not-served was reduced by
  90%.

  The total level of emissions for this scenario are 523.7 million tons of CO2 over the five year
  period, corresponding to an increase of approximately 4.7% compared to the Base Case
  described in section 3.1. This is due primarily to the overall increase in thermal generation
  (to meet unserved energy needs) in this scenario.

  Figure 18 below illustrates the cross-border power flows in the T100C (Efficient Trade) case,
  with Figure 19 showing the incremental flows (i.e. increase or (decrease) in flows) of T100C
  relative to the Base Case (REAL SIM C).

As can be seen from the Figures, flow over all inter-country links apart from two increased
relative to the Base Case, in several cases substantially. We note that the modelling is done
on a monthly basis, and so the effects of seasonality are shown in the flows, with all links
operating in both directions at various times over the years modelled.

The incremental benefits (i.e., cost savings or other benefits) and incremental costs of the
Efficient Trade case relative to the Base Case are shown in Figure 20 below.

It is worth noting that in contrast to the analysis presented in Section 3, there is now a
substantial benefit derived from meeting previously unserved energy. In this case, overall
dispatch costs have actually increased relative to the base case, as both previously spilled
hydro resources and thermal resources are used to meet this previously unserved demand.
The aggregate net benefits to the system are approximately USD 5.2 billion.

4.3      Individual Country Benefits

The analysis also allows the net benefits to be computed on a country-by-country basis. As
noted previously, this requires a “price? to be estimated for cross-border power flows. This
has been done by using the standard economic approach of setting the price at the marginal
cost of production for unconstrained cross-border flows6.            The sub-sections below
summarize the resulting effects by country.

As the Table shows, Kazakh dispatch costs decreased relative to the Base Case,
corresponding to the fact that Kazakhstan generates less energy in the Efficient Trade case.
The country also shows incremental benefits in terms of imports, due to the reduction in
calculated import prices. These benefits outweigh a decline in the total value of exports,
leading to a net benefit of USD 190 million.

 Where transmission constraints exist, so-called “congestion costs? are created which are split among the
imports / exports. This effect was quite small in the modelling and does not have any effect on the overall
general results or conclusions.

Uzbekistan’s principal benefits arise from avoiding significant unserved energy. This value
was only partially offset by an increased cost of imports (as Uzbekistan imported hydropower
from Tajikistan), resulting in total net benefits to Uzbekistan of about USD 3.2 billion for the
five-year period.

Kyrgyzstan’s principal benefits arose due to the avoidance of unserved energy and a
reduction in the cost of imports. Its dispatch costs increased through the increased use of
coal. The net overall benefits to Kyrgyzstan amounted to USD 900 million over the five-year
period7.

 As we also discuss in Section 4.2 below, Kyrgyzstan – and, indeed, the whole region – could benefit by
sharing the provision of reserve capacity through the use of both Kyrgyz and Tajik hydro resources. The total
potential regional benefits of avoided costs would amount to some USD 80 million / year which would be
allocated by reserve capacity pricing among all the countries.

5.         Results: Benefits from Fuel Savings, Meeting Unserved Demand from Efficient
           Trade at Market Fuel Prices and CO2 Costs (REAL SIM vs T100)

In the previous cases set out in Sections 3 and 4, the power flows and energy dispatch costs
were based on the actual costs of the fuels used for power generation in each individual
country. These fuel costs were – in several cases – below what would be considered “export
market? fuel prices.

Figure 21 below compares the variable operating costs of several illustrative power stations
in the region, depending on whether they are assumed to produce with the fuel prices actually
experienced (as the cases set out in Sections 3 and 4 above assume), or whether they are
assumed to be operating with “export market? fuel prices together with an explicit cost for
CO2 emissions.

If the system were to be dispatched and power flows optimized on the basis of the higher
variable costs (i.e., “export market? fuel prices etc.), we would expect the net benefits of
efficient trade (including benefits of serving previously unserved energy) to be larger as there
would be greater scope for low-cost thermal generation (e.g., Kazakh coal) to displace higher
cost generation (e.g., Uzbek gas / oil) in addition to the value of using hydro generation to
replace the highest cost thermal generation first.

Figure 22 below illustrates this. The “T100? case was developed using “export market? fuel
prices (with carbon charges) to determine the value of dispatch savings (i.e., economic
resource costs) which would be achieved under this scenario. It is compared to the “REAL

 As noted in footnote 6 above, Tajikistan could also share the provision of regional capacity reserves with
Kyrgyzstan, thus increasing the economic value benefits to Tajikistan.

SIM? case which is analogous to the REAL SIM C case with the exception that it too is based
on “export market? fuel prices (with carbon charges) to provide the baseline for calculation of
the changes in dispatch costs and the value for cross-border flows.

In this case, the value of reduced unserved energy is the same as in the principal Efficient
Trade case, but the system dispatch cost savings has grown substantially, reflecting the
benefits of saved resources priced at “export price? values. Both exports and imports values
have grown with the net difference between them representing mostly transmission losses
(now more costly as they are based on “export market? fuel prices) as previously. The
overall net benefits to the aggregate system have grown from USD 5.2 billion in the analysis
set out in Section 4 to about USD 6.4 billion here over the five-year period.

6.      Ancillary Services

It is possible that a more unified CAPS system would also be able to make savings in terms
of operating reserves. If each country were to provide its own reserves individually9, it is
estimated that a total of 1900 MW of reserves would be required. In contrast, if reserves
were shared among the four countries, the total requirement would drop to an estimated 800
MW.

Figure 23 below shows the cost of different scenarios for providing reserves. The left-hand
bar shows the estimated cost of the provision of 1900 MW of reserves (i.e., individual
country provision). If the countries were to share reserves, only some 800 MW of reserves
would be required. The right-hand bars show this shared provision, first as if they were
purchased at regional market prices, and second at the cost of provision using Kyrgyz and
Tajik hydro resources.

 We recognise that in fact today some reserves are purchased from the Russian power system; the costs and
MW extent of this are not addressed here

It is clear that the least-cost option would be for the region to use Tajikistan’s and
Kyrgyzstan’s hydro resources, which it is estimated could be harnessed without disruption to
those countries’ generation plans. The resulting savings for the region – of over USD 400
million over a five-year period relative to purchasing reserves at regional market prices –
could be shared among the countries for the benefit of each, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
making payments below the Russian market rate to the hydro generators that would provide
the reserves and enjoy the resulting revenues.
Thus, all countries in the region can benefit from pooling reserves. The benefits come in two
forms: first, from the reduction in the overall total quantity of reserves needed, and second
from the potential sharing of the least-cost source of providing reserves, the large
hydroelectric stations in the Kyrgyz and Tajik Republics. This latter choice would not only
bring considerable cost savings to all, but would effectively result in the whole regional
system operating once again in the manner in which it was originally designed.

7.      Overall Conclusions

     1. The Current Situation is Costly for All Countries

The shortcomings of today’s mode of operations are obvious to all. First, the regional system
is not operating as planned and as it was organized with the development of the regional high
voltage network. Summer surpluses in the hydro countries are not being exchanged
efficiently with thermal generation in other countries in a manner to meet overall demand and
summer water release requirements. Today’s operational mode results in substantial waste of
hydro resources (through water spills) while at the same time consumer demand goes
unfulfilled. Overall system operations are excessively costly and countries have reduced
potential for exports of both electricity and fuel.

     2. Efficient Trade Brings Significant Benefits to the Region

As the principal analysis shows, efficient trade brings substantial benefits to the region. The
monetary value of the aggregate benefits from the main comparison (i.e., the “REAL SIM C?
case compared to “T100C?) comes to USD 5.2 billion over the historic five-year period.
This value could have been shared via economic pricing of trade, with Uzbekistan enjoying
some USD 3.2 billion in benefits and Kazakhstan having USD 190 million. Tajikistan (USD
879 million) and Kyrgyzstan (USD 900 Million) would each enjoy benefits in between this
range. These values – the overall total and the corresponding benefits to each country – have
already been lost to the region.


Document of the World Bank                                 20
The region has been able to withstand this loss of value because (again, as the analysis has
shown) much of the loss is due to not providing service to meet consumers’ aggregate
demand. While curtailing consumers does not result in an immediate cash cost, it does hinder
economic growth and eventually (if not already) cause consumers – both businesses and
individuals – to become displeased with their energy suppliers, and, eventually, their
governments. However, even if only the cash value of benefits is counted, the analysis of
REAL SIM C ENS / T100C ENS illustrated that the cash-only benefits of efficient trade still
came to approximately USD 1.5 billion.

     3. It is Possible That All Countries in the Region will Benefit from Efficient Trade

The total benefits of efficient trade are “allocated? among trading partners by trading prices.
We expect that prices in any future market will be determined by the rules and organization
of those markets. Nevertheless, this analysis has shown that a relatively simple pricing can
result in each individual country being a “winner? from increased trade. Some countries will
benefit from saving high cost fossil fuels in favor of imported hydro; others will benefit from
greater ability to meet domestic demand; others will benefit from either exporting low-cost
thermal generation or even saved fossil fuels. The various allocations of the total value are
noted in point 2 above.

     4. The Estimates of Trade Benefits are Robust to Different Scenarios

We have tested the results with varying approaches. In addition to the principal efficient
trade case, we have also developed a case (T100) which values traded electricity and also
potentially exported saved fuels at “export? prices. We have also examined trade in cases
where cross-border transmission capacities were constrained to less than full availability. In
all cases, benefits can be enjoyed through efficient trade.

     5. The Future may be Uncertain, but Trade Benefits can be Achieved Now

Certainly there are projects in the region focused on opportunities other than intra-regional
trade; large-scale transmission projects such as CASA or TUTAP are examples. If these, or
other, projects are realized, they will bring new markets to the energy producers of the region.
However, the realization of these projects is in the future, whereas the benefits of efficient
regional trade are here today, waiting only to be grasped.

8.      Next Steps

There are many practical steps necessary to take in order to implement efficient trade.
However, a suitable plan could be developed which could bring substantial benefits of trade
relatively quickly (possibly through simplified trading systems), with greater sophistication
and technical capabilities developed over time.

Many of the detailed steps are described in the AF Mercados Report. Key among them are:

     1. Near-Term Steps, including:
           a. Develop inter-governmental and stakeholder agreement on the potential
              benefits and the nature and objectives of the systems to be adopted

             contracts; spot markets, etc.) and well as principles for a fair methodology for
             settlements and compensation of schedule deviations
          c. Identify the role of central trading and dispatch institutions (such as CDC

             software
          e. Identify and adopt necessary pan-regional technical and commercial
             documents (e.g., grid codes, metering codes, settlement rules)
          f. Define a scheme for mutual support during emergency operations

   2. Medium-Term Steps, including:
        a. Improve system supervision and control software
        b. Improve commercial metering
        c. Adopt a system for coordinated system planning, especially insofar as high
           voltage grid development is concerned

   3. Longer-Term Steps, including:
         a. Implement necessary technological changes and improvements
         b. Move forward with regional grid development and power system projects

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Tunisia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Tunisia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Tunisia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2015, 763 stakeholders of the WBG in Tunisia were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 202 stakeholders participated in
the survey (27% response rate).

Respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in person.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Tunisia; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Tunisia; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 44%, N=58). As a rule, the COS data are weighted for year
comparisons in order to reach the same stakeholder composition in two fiscal years. However, in
the case of Tunisia, due to the small number of respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey,
weighting would have been statistically unsound. Therefore, only basic comparisons of the
unweighted data from the FY’15 and FY’12 Country Surveys are presented in the report and
should be considered provisional. For the FY’15 and FY’12 stakeholder breakdown and year
comparison results, please see appendix D (page 111).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from private sector
       organizations were combined with those from the financial sector/private banks; and few
       respondents from independent government institutions, local governments, private
       foundations, youth groups, and other organizations were included in the “Other?
       category. Note that there were no respondents from trade unions, faith-based groups, and
       the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Locations
     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from coastal cities, other urban
      centers, and other areas, analyses comparing geographic locations would not be
      statistically reliable and, therefore, were not conducted. There were no respondents from
      rural/mountainous areas.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
          Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’12 Country
           Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (mean familiarity
           rating in FY’15 = 5.76; mean familiarity rating in FY’12 = 5.34)1.
          Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
           with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Tunisia and the extent to which
           the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Tunisia, and significantly, moderately
           correlated with their ratings of the extent to which the WBG helps to achieve
           development results in Tunisia.

IV. General Issues Facing Tunisia
Headed in the Right Direction
      Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly more likely to indicate that
       Tunisia is headed in the right direction, compared to respondents in the FY’12 Country
       Survey.
      Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
       President/Prime Minister/Minister and the office of a parliamentarian were most positive
       about the prospect of Tunisia.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’12 Country Survey indicated that
       they most often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to “the
       Government working inefficiently? (47%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from NGOs/CSOs
       were significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to
       that “there is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation? compared to
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Tunisia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty seven specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Tunisia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Tunisia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year
Comparing responses across Country Opinion Surveys (COS) reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also
changes in respondent samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter
factor, only those questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Unfortunately, only 58
respondents completed the FY12 COS. Hence, the comparisons presented here should be considered provisional.

Abstract: This paper builds on global experience and the DRC‚Äôs specific context to
identify an effective nutrition approach along with costs and benefits of key nutrition
interventions. It is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective
interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The paper considers both relevant
‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions, largely delivered through the health sector, and
multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-sensitive‚Äù interventions, delivered through other sectors such as
agriculture, education, and water and sanitation. We estimate that the costs and benefits of
implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all provinces of the DRC would require
a yearly public investment of $371 million. The expected benefits are enormous: annually
over 5.4 million DALYs and over 76,000 lives would be saved, while at least 1 million
cases of stunting among children under five would be averted. Economic productivity
could potentially increase by $591 million annually over the productive lives of the
beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 13.6 percent. However, because
it is unlikely that the Government of the DRC or its partners will find the $371 million
necessary to reach full coverage, we also consider scale-up scenarios based on
considerations of their potential for impact, burden of stunting, resource requirements, and
implementation capacity. The most cost-effective scenario considered would provide a
subset of key interventions in provinces with the highest rates of stunting and would cost
between $97 and $185 million depending on how many provinces are covered. We then
identify and cost six nutrition-sensitive interventions relevant to the DRC and for which
there are both evidence of positive impact on nutrition outcomes and some cost
information. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and
a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective
approach to reducing child malnutrition in the DRC.


Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, nutrition-sensitive interventions, cost-
effectiveness of nutrition interventions, Democratic Republic of Congo, nutrition
financing.

Aflatoxins are a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds, especially Aspergillus
flavus, which contaminate stored food supplies such as animal feed, maize, and peanuts. Research
shows that human consumption of high levels of aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis (Kuniholm
et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). It is widely understood that there is
a relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, but this relationship has not yet been
adequately quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt Associates 2014).

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the
benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed
in monetary terms. The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized
by implementing a project versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio,
the better the investment. A general rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its cost,
the project is a good investment.

Biocontrol (also called biological control) is the use of an invasive agent to reduce pest or mold
population below a desired level. Aflatoxins can be reduced through biocontrol; the most effective
method involves a single application of a product (such as aflasafe‚Ñ¢) that contains strains unique
to the specific country or location.

Biofortification is the breeding of crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done either
through conventional selective breeding or through genetic engineering.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country
human capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions
(World Bank 2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and
community volunteers to improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany
program implementation or, when possible, precede program implementation. In this costing
analysis we allocate 9 percent of total programmatic costs to capacity development for program
delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an intervention
against its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits of an
intervention and estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net present
value. Net benefits are the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of the
intervention. The net present value is defined mathematically as:
                                        Ì†µÌ±á
                                                  Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°
        Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±í = ‚àë              ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂0
                                               (1 + Ì†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°
                                       Ì†µÌ±°=1

where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±° is net cash inflows, Ì†µÌ∞∂0 is the initial investment, the index Ì†µÌ±° is the time period, and Ì†µÌ±ü is
the discount rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that
the present value of cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost of
financing). Interventions with net present values that are at least as high as alternative interventions

                                                             xi
provide greater benefits than interventions with net present values equal to or lower than
alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis can also be expressed in terms of the benefit-cost
ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify
interventions that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis
requires two components: the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention‚Äôs
impact, such as the number of lives saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:

                                                            Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ì Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±î Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions with
the same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the most
cost-effective intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due
to a health condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of
life lost from a disease (YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD).
DALYs count the gains from both mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature
death are prevented) and morbidity (how many years or parts of years of life lost due to disability
are prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a metric that is recognized and understood
by external audiences such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases relative to the overall
burden of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data, DALYs allow for
estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in different
countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash flows.
The concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is worth more
than the same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential. A higher
discount rate reflects higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in capital. A
higher discount rate may also reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows
equal to zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of return
equals or exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates of
return than alternatives tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to project
how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part of an
integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.




                                                                         xii
Monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for program delivery
are all elements of cost-effective and efficient program implementation. Monitoring involves
checking progress against plans through the systematic and routine collection of information from
projects and programs in order to learn from experience to improve practices and activities in the
future, to ensure internal and external accountability of the resources used and the results obtained,
and to make informed decisions on the future of the intervention. Monitoring is a periodically
recurring task. Evaluation is the assessing, as systematically and objectively as possible, of a
completed project or intervention (or a phase of an ongoing project). Operations research aims
to inform the program designers about ways to deliver interventions more effectively and
efficiently. Technical support entails ensuring that training, support, and maintenance for the
physical elements of the intervention are available. In this costing exercise we allocate 2 percent
of total intervention costs for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical
support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect impact on nutrition and are
delivered through sectors other than health such as the agriculture, education, and water, sanitation,
and hygiene sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops, conditional cash transfers,
and water and sanitation infrastructure improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate determinants of child
nutrition, such as adequate food and nutrition intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and treating
disease. Examples include community nutrition programs, micronutrient supplementation, and
deworming.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables
change. It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of
the intervention, and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of the
variable on the outcome.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is an indicator of chronic
undernutrition and is the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is
measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child is
considered stunted with a height-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age. It is used as a composite
indicator to reflect both acute and chronic undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between
them. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child
is considered underweight with a weight-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is an indicator of acute
undernutrition and the result of more recent food deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of
Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below). A child with a weight-for-height Z-
score of ‚àí2 or lower is considered wasted.

                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The overall objective of this report is to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) in developing a costed scale-up plan for nutrition. It builds on the recently developed
national nutrition policy by costing the interventions proposed therein. The goal is for this analysis
to serve as an input into the strategic multisectoral plan to fight malnutrition currently in
development. The executive summary is written for policy makers; it highlights the study‚Äôs main
findings and discusses their implications for nutrition policy in the DRC. The paper itself is more
technical in nature and is written for planners and programmers. The analysis is expected to bring
evidence of potential for impact and allocative efficiency into nutrition programming in the DRC.

Despite being home to only 1 percent of the world‚Äôs population, the DRC is one of the five
countries responsible for half of all deaths globally among children under five years of age (WHO
2012a). High prevalence of stunting among children is one of the major underlying causes of child
mortality in the country. Between 2001 and 2014, the prevalence of stunting among children under
five remained practically unchanged, at about 43 percent. Despite reductions in the prevalence of
underweight (which dropped from 34 percent in 2001 to 23 percent in 2014) and wasting (21
percent in 2001 to 8 percent in 2014), progress in stunting has been very slow in recent years, with
declines of just 1 percent over the last four years (DHS 2013‚Äì14). There is also considerable
variation by province in the prevalence of stunting, with the highest prevalence rates concentrated
in three provinces: Kasai-Occidental, Nord-Kivu, and Sud-Kivu. Micronutrient deficiencies
(hidden hunger) are also prevalent, with vitamin A deficiency and anemia rates particularly high.

Malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to increased mortality rates, increased
illness, and longer-term effects on cognitive abilities. These result in irreversible losses to human
capital that contribute to later losses in economic productivity. Undernutrition is responsible for
about one-half of under-five child mortality and one-fifth of maternal mortality in developing
countries. Children who have been malnourished early in life are more likely to experience
cognitive deficiencies and poor schooling outcomes. In the longer term, stunting results in a loss
of 10 to 17 percent in wages earned over a lifetime. In addition, it is estimated that vitamin and
mineral deficiencies in the DRC collectively add up to an estimated loss of over $100 million in
gross domestic product (GDP) every year (World Bank 2011).

At the same time, nutrition interventions are consistently identified as being among the most cost-
effective development actions, with huge potential to contribute to the World Bank Group ‚Äôs twin
goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Cost-benefit analysis shows that
nutrition interventions are highly effective (World Bank 2010; Hoddinott et al. 2013). It is
estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs GDP by 3 to 11 percent annually
(Horton and Steckel 2013). Stunted children are less likely to attend school, more likely to drop
out, and less likely to be able to learn when in school, thereby compromising future human capital
and national productivity. On the other hand, investments in early nutrition lock in human capital
for life and help drive future productivity and growth. Evidence also shows that these early
investments in nutrition have the potential to boost wage rates by 5 to 50 percent, supercharge the
demographic, make children 33 percent more likely to escape poverty in the future, and address
gender inequities.

The costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest, especially when compared with the
potential benefits. At a global level, the cost of scaling up key nutrition interventions across 68
high-burden countries is estimated at $10.3 billion per annum (World Bank 2010). These
investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million children, save at least
1.1 million lives and 30 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and reduce the number of
stunted children by about 30 million worldwide (World Bank 2010).

This report builds on global estimates to identify costs and benefits of key nutrition programs in
the DRC and is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions and
scenarios for scaling these up. The report uses the costing framework established by Scaling Up
Nutrition: What Will It Cost? (World Bank 2010) as a starting point, and applies this framework
to the country-specific context of the DRC. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms
of lives saved, DALYs saved, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will
make the case for nutrition stronger and aid in priority-setting by identifying the most cost-
effective packages of interventions in situations where financial and human resources are
constrained.

We first estimate the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all
provinces of DRC.1 We refer to this as the full coverage scenario and estimate that it would require
an annual public investment of $371 million. The expected benefits are enormous: over 5.4 million
DALYs and over 76,000 lives would be saved annually, while at least 1 million cases of stunting
among children under five would be averted. This investment of $371 million also has the potential
to increase economic productivity by $591 million annually over the productive lives of the
beneficiaries and to yield an impressive internal rate of return on the investment of 13.6 percent.

Given resource constraints, few countries are able to effectively scale-up all 10 nutrition-specific
interventions to full national coverage immediately. We therefore consider three potential scale-
up scenarios, based on considerations of burden of stunting, potential for impact, costs, and
capacity for implementation in the DRC:

‚Ä¢         Scenario 1: Scale up by province
‚Ä¢         Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
‚Ä¢         Scenario 3: Scale up by province and intervention

When considered in terms of resource requirements and cost-effectiveness (cost per benefit unit),
two scenarios stand out as the most attractive (see Box 1). The first would scale up a limited set of
effective interventions in the nine provinces that have rates of stunting over 40 percent, requiring
an annual public investment of $185 million. The second costs less ($97 million) and would
provide the same set of effective interventions in the five provinces where stunting rates are higher
than 45 percent and severe stunting rates exceed 25 percent.

    The 10 nutrition-specific interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A
      supplementation, therapeutic zinc supplement with ORS, micronutrient powders, deworming, iron-folic acid
      supplementation for pregnant women, iron fortification of staples, salt iodization for the general population,
      public provision of complementary food for prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, and community-based
      management of severe acute malnutrition in children.

                                                           Box 1: Three Cost-Effective Scale-Up
When the DRC is ready to commit substantially                            Options
more resources to fighting undernutrition,            If full coverage is not immediately feasible, the
another scenario offers an equally attractive         annual costs and benefits of the three most cost-
cost per DALY saved of $49, but it requires a         effective gradual scale-up scenarios are:
much larger annual investment of $279 million.
This scenario would also provide the                     1. Most cost-effective: Scale up a subset of the
extraordinary benefits of over 5.3 million                most cost-efficient interventions in nine high-
DALYs and 66,000 lives saved. This scenario                             burden provinces:
has the added benefit of providing nutrition                ‚Ä¢ $185 million required annually ($523
interventions in all provinces and is thus more                 million over five years)
                                                            ‚Ä¢ 3.6 million life years saved*
politically feasible.
                                                            ‚Ä¢ 44,000 lives saved
                                                            ‚Ä¢ cost per life year saved = $48
Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full
coverage in one year, we consider the costs of           2. Lowest cost: Scale up the same subset of the
scaling up over five years for the most attractive          most cost-efficient interventions in the five
scenarios. The most cost-effective would                            highest-burden provinces:
require an investment of $523 million over five              ‚Ä¢ $97 million required annually ($275
years and the lowest-cost scenario would                         million over five years)
require $275 million, assuming a full scale-up               ‚Ä¢ 1.8 million life years saved*
in five years. These total five-year costs are               ‚Ä¢ 22,000 lives saved
significantly less than the $1.04 billion needed             ‚Ä¢ cost per life year saved = $50
for the full coverage scenario, but still represent
a significant increase over current spending on          3. Greatest benefits, very cost-effective: Scale
nutrition in the DRC. Interventions are assumed               up a subset of the most cost-efficient
to scale from current coverage as follows: 20                    interventions in all provinces:
percent of coverage in Year 1, 40 percent in                 ‚Ä¢ $279 million required annually ($790
                                                                million over five years)
Year 2, 60 percent in Year 3, 80 percent in Year
                                                             ‚Ä¢ 5.3 million life years saved*
4, and 100 percent in Year 5.
                                                             ‚Ä¢ 66,000 lives saved
                                                             ‚Ä¢ cost per life year saved = $49
A critical next step will be to identify potential
sources of financing for the enormous gap *Life years saved adjusted for disability (DALYs)
between what is currently being invested in
nutrition interventions and the most modest of
the scale-up scenarios proposed here. As discussed above, currently there are negligible public
budget allocations to nutrition interventions and to date the bulk of financing comes from
international aid, which totaled about $25 million in 2012. More recently, the Department for
International Development (DFID) is providing $7.3 million in support of nutrition interventions
during 2013‚Äì2015, and the World Bank is planning $16.4 million in support for key nutrition
interventions for 2015‚Äì2020. USAID contributes about $10 million a year to the treatment of
severe acute malnutrition plus about $30 million a year for food assistance programs. ECHO, the
Government of Belgium and the Government of Japan also support emergency nutrition services
and community based management of severe acute malnutrition.
Nevertheless, given that the most modest of the scenarios presented here would require $97 million
in annual investment, a priority is to identify additional sources of funding.

Although every attempt has been made to use real programming costs for these estimates, the costs
presented here are likely to be slight overestimates, while the benefits are likely to be
underestimated. In many cases, actual program costs will be lower than estimated because these
programs can be added to existing ones. Program experience shows that the incremental costs of
adding to an existing program are lower than the cost of starting an entirely new program because
existing implementation arrangements can be used, thereby minimizing costs for staffing,
operations, and training. The estimate of costs presented here is therefore high because it does not
account for expected economies of scale. With respect to the benefits of these programs, estimates
are likely to be underestimates of the true benefits because the LiST tool we use has limitations,
making it possible to estimate the full benefits of only some of the interventions that are proposed
to be scaled up.

This analysis takes an innovative approach to nutrition costing by estimating not only the costs
and benefits of nutrition-specific interventions, but also by exploring costs for selected nutrition-
sensitive interventions implemented outside of the health sector. While recognizing that the
evidence base for the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions is less conclusive than the
evidence for nutrition-specific interventions, we consider six nutrition-sensitive interventions in
other sectors that have shown some potential for improving nutrition outcomes. These include
three interventions based in the agriculture sector: biofortification of vitamin A‚Äìrich yellow
cassava, aflatoxin control in maize and groundnuts through biocontrol, and the promotion of the
wetting method for konzo control. Two interventions based in the education sector are also
considered: school-based deworming and school-based promotion of good hygiene. A water,
sanitation and hygiene infrastructure intervention (WASH) with a behavior change component is
also considered. The estimated annual costs are modest: $13 million for the biofortication of
yellow cassava; $31 million for aflatoxin control; $5 million for the promotion of the wetting
method for konzo control; $2 million for school-based deworming; $13 million for school-based
promotion of good hygiene, and $1.04 billion for the WASH intervention. However, these costs
must be considered rough approximations, as there are significant limitations in the available data
and in the methodological approaches. In addition, we were not able to estimate the benefits of
these interventions because of data and methodological shortcomings, although we do report
benefits calculated by others. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions are needed to
inform future scale-up priorities.

Overall, these findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate
list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing
the high levels of child malnutrition in the DRC. Critical next steps are for the Government of the
DRC and its partners to develop a road map of key actions to pursue and to identify milestones to
be reached in addressing undernutrition in the country.

                                             COUNTRY CONTEXT

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a vast, resource-rich country that nonetheless
remains one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations. With more than 80 million inhabitants spread across a
landmass roughly equivalent to two-thirds the surface area of the European Union and endowed
with significant mineral and agricultural resources (see Appendix 1 for a map of the DRC and its
provinces), the DRC has the potential to be one of the richest countries on the African continent
(National Statistics Institute 2013; World Bank 2014). However, decades of armed conflict, weak
institutions, underdeveloped infrastructure, and an overwhelmingly rural population (over 60
percent of its inhabitants live in rural areas) have prevented the DRC from exploiting its natural
wealth (World Bank 2014a). According to the most recent World Bank estimates, 63 percent of
the country‚Äôs inhabitants live in poverty, life expectancy stands at just 49 years, and the DRC ranks
186th out of 187 countries on the United Nations Development Programme‚Äôs (UNDP‚Äôs) 2013
Human Development Index (World Bank 2013a; UNDP 2014). Although GDP has increased at a
solid annual rate of above 7 percent since 2010, driven largely by growth in the extractive
industries, many Congolese‚Äîparticularly those displaced by past and ongoing conflicts‚Äîcontinue
to live hand to mouth (World Bank 2014a).


                             HEALTH AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN THE DRC

Despite being home to just 1 percent of the world‚Äôs population, the DRC is one of the five countries
responsible for half of all deaths globally among children under five years of age (WHO 2012a).2
About half of these deaths are caused by malnutrition. Even with efforts to improve the nutritional
status of Congolese children, the prevalence of stunting among children under five has remained
practically unchanged‚Äîjust under 45 percent‚Äîbetween 2001 and 2014 (Figure 1). This
prevalence has persisted despite reductions in the prevalence of underweight in children under five
(this has dropped from 34 to 23 percent) and wasting (21 to 8 percent): reduction in child stunting
has seen declines of just 1 percent over the last four years (DHS 2013‚Äì14). High child stunting
rates remains one of the most intransigent health issues in the DRC.

    The other four countries are China, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

Whether or not a child will be stunted is largely determined during the first 1,000 days of life.
Stunting rates among Congolese children increase sharply from birth until 24 months of age, after
which they begin to level off at about 50 percent (Figure 2). These data underscore the importance
of investing in interventions that target the first 1,000 days of life, after which it becomes extremely
difficult to reverse the physical and cognitive effects of stunting.

Considerable variation is evident among the provinces in the prevalence of stunting, with stunting
rates exceeding the national average in 8 out of 11 provinces. In fact, three provinces have stunting
rates that exceed 50 percent: Kasai-Occidental (51.7 percent), Nord-Kivu (52 percent), and Sud-
Kivu (53 percent). The stunting rates in the remaining provinces are much lower (MICS/ELIM
2010). Only three provinces have stunting rates below the national average: Bandundu (39
percent), Equateur (38 percent), and Kinshasa, where stunting prevalence is the lowest (16 percent)
(MICS/ELIM 2010). Figure 3 demonstrates the disparities among provinces in the prevalence of
stunting, as well as the fact that poverty is not necessarily the key determinant of nutritional status
in the DRC.

Child undernutrition and poverty do not have the same distribution in the DRC. As seen above in
Figure 3, the geographic distributions of stunting and poverty differ substantially. Figure 4 presents
stunting rates by income quintile and shows that stunting prevalence is more or less even across
the bottom 80 percent of the population. Only children in the wealthiest quintile have lower
stunting rates (22 percent), which is half the rate of children in the poorest quintile (42 percent).
This suggests that factors such as informational asymmetries, disease, and optimal feeding and
caregiving practices are more closely associated than income with nutrition outcomes.

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies (hidden hunger) are also pervasive in the DRC and have caused
the country to lose approximately $100 million annually (UNICEF and the Micronutrient Initiative
2004; World Bank 2011). An estimated 61 percent of preschool-aged children and 16 percent of
pregnant women are deficient in vitamin A, increasing the risk of child mortality, vulnerability to
infectious diseases such as measles, and blindness among children under five years old (MOH et
al. 2000; WHO 2009). In fact, the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF) and the
Micronutrient Initiative estimate that vitamin A deficiency alone precipitates 76,000 child deaths
annually in the DRC (UNICEF and the Micronutrient Initiative 2004). Another study calculated
that vitamin A deficiency caused the loss of approximately 390,000 DALYs per year (Meenakshi
et al. 2010). After more than a decade of interventions designed to reduce vitamin A deficiencies,
coverage of vitamin A supplementation is high in the DRC, with a reported 97.9 percent of children
6‚Äì59 months of age receiving a supplement in the last national campaign (PRONANUT 2013).
However, given the inaccuracy of population projections and the absence of recent census data,
the actual coverage rate is probably lower: data from MICS/ELIM 2010 reported vitamin A
supplementation coverage at 82 percent, while DHS 2013‚Äì14 reports a rate of 70 percent.

In addition to vitamin A, deficiencies in iron, folate, and iodine also remain significant challenges.
According to the most recent data, 60 percent of preschool-aged children and 38 percent of
pregnant women are estimated to be anemic, down from 71 and 58 percent in 2007, respectively
(DHS 2007, 2013‚Äì14). Although no data on iron folic acid supplementation are available, only 48
percent of pregnant women attend four or more prenatal consultations (DHS 2013‚Äì14), and folate
deficiency is responsible for an estimated 5,250 neural tube birth defects each year (UNICEF and
the Micronutrient Initiative 2004). Furthermore, just under half of all households do not consume
adequately iodized salt, and in the Kasai-Occidental and Katanga provinces the rate of iodized salt
consumption is as low as 26.1 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Children in these households
are predisposed to IQ losses of up to 13 points and these mothers are at increased risk of still births;
their risk of being underweight during their pregnancy is also higher.

Poor maternal health, early pregnancy, and short birth spacing‚Äîalong with high levels of sexual
and gender-based violence‚Äîset the stage for a poor nutritional start for many children in the DRC.
The mother‚Äôs health, as measured by body mass index (BMI), is known to affect child morbidity
and mortality. The DHS 2013‚Äì14 found that 14 percent of women aged 15‚Äì49 had a low BMI
(<18.5) in 2014, but the youngest women were the most malnourished (27 percent of 15- to 19-
year-olds). Coupled with low BMI, an early age of first pregnancy and short birth spacing in
mothers are associated with poorer health outcomes in children. The average age of first birth was
19.9 for women aged 25‚Äì49, and more than one quarter of 15- to 19-year-olds had already begun
procreating, while the average birth spacing was about 30 months and represented minimal change
since 2007 (DHS 2013‚Äì14). High levels of sexual and gender-based violence have been
documented in the DRC (UN News Centre 2013), and although there is no analysis of the
relationship between gender-based violence and malnutrition for the DRC specifically, the
relationship is well established in other countries (e.g., Bangladesh).

The DRC has the third highest morbidity from diarrhea globally among children under five.
Diarrhea causes about 13 percent of the world‚Äôs child deaths each year, and an estimated 60,450
Congolese children died as a result of diarrhea-related illnesses in 2010 (Emina and Kandala 2012).
Diarrheal episodes exacerbate the relationship between malnutrition and infection, as children
experiencing these episodes tend to eat less, absorb fewer nutrients, and exhibit reduced resistance
to infections. Prolonged diarrheal episodes lead to impaired growth and development (Ejemot et
al. 2008). Poor sanitation also contributes‚Äîthrough its impact on malnutrition rates‚Äîto other
leading causes of child mortality including malaria, acute respiratory infections, and measles.
According to MICS/ELIM (2010), just 47 percent of the population has access to safe drinking
water and only 14 percent of the population has access to adequate sanitation facilities.

In the DRC, a 2005 study found that an estimated 82 percent of children under five were infected
with parasitic intestinal worms (helminth infections) (WHO 2006). In the short term, helminth
infections potentially cause anemia and increase morbidity and undernutrition, as well as impair
mental and physical development (Hotez et al. 2008). In the long term, infected children are
estimated to have an average IQ loss of 3.75 points per child and they earn less as adults (43
percent) than those who grow up free of worms (Bleakley 2007). Although the 2005 study
prompted a national effort to expand deworming treatment among Congolese children, the last
national campaign was able to treat only 38.3 percent of children 12‚Äì59 months old because of
disruptions in the supply of anthelmintic medications (mebendazole) (PRONANUT 2013).

Another health burden in the DRC is the high level of aflatoxins‚Äînaturally occurring carcinogenic
by-products of common fungi‚Äîgrowing on crops such as maize and peanuts. In the DRC, the
average person consumes 57 and 52 grams of peanuts and maize (respectively) per person per day,
which translates into an average daily exposure of 0.07‚Äì27 nanograms per kilogram of weight
(assuming an average weight of 60 kilograms per consumer) (Liu and Wu 2010). Evidence shows
that consuming high levels of aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer in adults
(Kuniholm et al. 2008; Abt Associates 2014). Furthermore, it is widely understood that there is a
relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, although the evidence base is more
tentative and this relationship has not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature
(Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt Associates 2014). However, although the evidence of the links

                                                 5
between aflatoxins and child stunting is still tentative, the links with liver cancer are well
established: aflatoxin exposure in the DRC is estimated to cause up to 724 new cases of liver
cancer each year (Liu and Wu 2010). This provides sufficient impetus for actions to control
aflatoxin exposure in the DRC.

Residents of some provinces in the DRC also face the threat of permanent disability and/or death
as the result of a condition known as konzo, which is caused by eating poorly prepared cassava.
Konzo is a sudden epidemic spastic paraparesis (paralytic) disease that leads to permanent
paralysis of the lower limbs (Kasongo and Calo 2011), with children above the age of three years
and women of childbearing age being most vulnerable to the effects of the disease (Nzwalo and
Cliff 2011). It is caused by consuming cassava containing high levels of cyanide, which the plant
produces naturally as a self-defense mechanism. Bitter varieties of cassava tend to contain higher
levels of cyanide than sweet varieties (1 gram/kilogram versus 20 milligrams/kilogram), as do
cassavas grown during drought (Kasongo and Calo 2011). The disease is present in four provinces
in the DRC (Bandundu, Kasai-Oriental, Kasai-Occidental, and Sud-Kivu) (Banea et al. 2012).
However, over 90 percent of all reported cases are found in Bandundu (FAO 2014). In 2009, the
DRC had the highest number of reported cases in the five African countries where konzo is found
(3,459 out of 6,768 total), but the actual incidence is likely much higher: a 2000 study by the
Ministry of Health estimated that the number of konzo cases totaled 100,000 (Banea et al. 2012).

Vulnerability to konzo is thought to be the result of three broad factors: a lack of dietary diversity,
poor soil quality, and drought/poor access to water. Families that are food insecure and rely
primarily on cassava for their caloric intake are at the highest risk of developing konzo. Because
of its natural toxicity, cassava must be properly prepared before consumption, which includes
peeling, grating, and soaking it in warm water for several days. However, during the hungry
season, families that rely primarily on cassava for calories sometimes take shortcuts in its
preparation, not processing it long enough to remove the toxins. Families with low dietary diversity
also do not consume sufficient quantities of protein-rich pulse crops such as peas and beans, which
contain sulfur-based amino acids that help break down and eliminate cyanide in the bloodstream.
Additionally, because bitter varieties of cassava produce more cyanide, people living in the areas
with poor soil quality in which these varieties are more common are prone to consuming higher
levels of cyanide. Finally, both drought and poor access to water influence the cyanide content of
cassava. Droughts cause the cassava plant to produce more cyanide, and a lack of water resources
prevents adequate processing (Kasongo and Calo 2011).

Although konzo itself is not fatal, its effects tend to potentiate the risk of morbidity and mortality
from other diseases, including acute malnutrition. Moreover, the disease negatively affects visual-
spatial aptitude and mental processing capacity. Recent research has also shown that in villages
where konzo is present, even children who do not exhibit physical symptoms of the disease still
suffer damage (Fogarty International Center 2014).


                          THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN NUTRITION

Undernutrition is an underlying cause of approximately half of deaths in children under five and
one-fifth of maternal deaths in developing countries. The joint effect of suboptimum breastfeeding

                                                  6
and fetal growth restriction in the neonatal period alone contributes 1.3 million deaths or 19 percent
of all deaths of children under five (Black et al. 2013). Undernourished children are more likely to
die from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, pneumonia, malaria, or
HIV/AIDS.

Those malnourished children who survive face long-lasting health and schooling consequences,
including cognitive deficits and poorer schooling outcomes. Children with impaired cognitive
skills have lower school enrollment, attendance and graduation, which in turn results in lower
productivity, earnings, and economic well-being. Stunted children lose 0.7 grades of schooling
and are more likely to drop out of school. An adequate intake of micronutrients‚Äîparticularly iron,
vitamin A, iodine, and zinc‚Äîis critical for growth and cognitive development. Iodine- deficient
children lose on average 13 IQ points, and iron deficiency anemia reduces performance on tests
by 8 IQ points, making these children less educable and less productive in the long run (World
Bank 2006). Behrman et al. (2009) showed improved schooling and test scores from
supplementation in early childhood.

In the DRC, being underweight in the early years accounts for 13 percent of disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs). This was the biggest risk factor affecting DALYs, with micronutrient
deficiencies and suboptimal breastfeeding also among the 15 highest risk factors (IHME 2010b).
The DRC also loses nearly 5 million DALYs as a result of diarrheal diseases each year among
children under five years old (IHME 2010b).

Malnutrition costs developing countries billions of dollars in lost revenue through reduced
economic productivity, particularly through lower wages, lower physical and mental capabilities,
and more days away from work as a result of illness. At the individual level, childhood stunting is
estimated to reduce a person‚Äôs potential lifetime earnings by at least 10 percent (World Bank 2006).
Other studies have shown that a 1 percent loss in adult height results in a 2 to 2.4 percent loss in
productivity (Strauss and Thomas 1998; Caulfield et al. 2004). In addition, micronutrient
deficiencies in childhood and adulthood have tremendous economic cost for both individuals and
countries. Childhood anemia alone is associated with a 2.5 percent drop in adult wages. Anemia
in adults has been estimated to be equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP; this estimate goes up to 3.4
percent when including the secondary effects of retarded cognitive development in children
(Horton 1999). Horton and Ross (2003) estimate that eliminating iron-deficiency anemia would
result in a 5 to 17 percent increase in adult productivity. As mentioned earlier in this report,
micronutrient deficiencies in the DRC collectively add up to an estimated loss of over $100 million
in GDP every year (World Bank 2011). The economic costs of undernutrition have the greatest
effect on the most vulnerable in the developing world. A recent analysis estimates these losses at
up to 11 percent of GDP in Africa and Asia each year (Horton and Steckel 2013)‚Äîequivalent to
about $149 billion of productivity losses.

Investing in early childhood nutrition interventions has the potential to supercharge the potential
demographic dividend in the DRC. The term demographic dividend refers to the growth in a
country‚Äôs economy that result from certain changes in the age structure, leading to a youth bulge
and reduced dependency ratios in the population. This dividend is more likely to be realized if
these cohorts are better nourished and productive. By increasing investment in human capital as
fertility rates decline, the DRC could potentially harness the demographic dividend.

                                                  7
Because most of the detrimental effects of malnutrition that occur in the first 1,000 days of a child‚Äôs
life are essentially irreversible, the window of opportunity for preventing malnutrition is the first
1,000 days, until the child is two years of age. After that age, most actions are too little, too late,
and too expensive (World Bank 2006; Black et al. 2008, 2013). Figure 5 shows that the rates of
return from nutrition investments are highest for programs targeting the earliest years, since these
investments build a foundation for future learning and productivity, prevent irreversible losses,
and lock in human capital for life (Heckman and Masterov 2004).

       Note: Age refers to the child‚Äôs age from birth, depicted in years for infancy and preschool, then in aggregate
       for school age and adulthood.



Malnutrition and poverty are interrelated and exacerbate each other. A recent study (Hoddinott et
al. 2011) concludes that individuals who are not stunted at 36 months are one-third less likely to
live in poor households as adults. Poverty increases the risk of malnutrition by lowering poor
households‚Äô purchasing power, reducing access to basic health services, and exposing these
households to unhealthy environments, thereby compromising food intakes (both quality and
quantity) and increasing infections. Poor households are also more likely to have frequent
pregnancies, larger family sizes with high dependency ratios, more infections, and increased health
care costs. Conversely, malnutrition causes poor health status, poor cognitive development, and
less schooling, resulting in in poor human capital and long-term productivity losses. However, as
Figure 2 shows, while child stunting rates are highest among the poorest four quintiles in the DRC,
even among the richest quintile more than 20 percent children are stunted. As discussed above,
this suggests that factors other than income (informational asymmetries, feeding and childcare
practices, etc.) influence nutritional status.



                                                        8
Nutrition interventions are consistently identified as cost-effective development actions, and the
costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. Global benefit-cost ratio of micronutrient
powders for children is 37 to 1; of deworming it is 6 to 1; of iron fortification of staples it is 8 to
1; and of salt iodization is 30 to 1 (World Bank 2010).

A recent World Bank study estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs GDP by
at least 3 percent annually (World Bank 2010). The same study estimated these costs at $10.3
billion per annum globally, to be financed through domestic public and private sector and donor
resources. These investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million
children, save at least 1.1 million lives and 30 million DALYs, and reduce the number of stunted
children by about 30 million worldwide. Bhutta et al. (2013) came up with similar estimates. In
another study, Hoddinott, Rosegrant, and Torero (2012) estimate that, for just $100 per child,
interventions including micronutrient provision, public provision of complementary food for the
prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, treatments for worms and diarrheal diseases, and
behavior change programs could reduce chronic undernutrition by 36 percent in developing
countries. Clearly there is huge potential pay-off for dedicating more resources to the scale-up of
evidence-based, cost-effective nutrition interventions.



                   A MULTISECTORAL APPROACH FOR IMPROVING NUTRITION

The determinants of malnutrition are multisectoral. Therefore, to successfully and sustainably
improve nutrition outcomes, a multisectoral approach is needed. At a proximate level, access to
food, health, hygiene, and adequate child-care practices is key to reducing malnutrition. At a more
distal level, poverty, women‚Äôs status, and other social factors play an important role. It has been
demonstrated that direct actions taken to address the proximate determinants of malnutrition can
be enhanced by action on some of the more distal levels. For example, programs supporting
improved infant and young child feeding practices will be more effective if they are complemented
with programs to address gender issues by reducing women‚Äôs workloads, thus allowing women
more time for child care. Similarly, conditional cash transfer programs that target the poor, if
designed appropriately, have the potential not just to address poverty but also to increase demand
for nutrition services and good nutrition behaviors.

synergy with other sectors is critical to                improvements
breaking the cycle of malnutrition and
sustaining the gains from direct nutrition-
specific interventions (World Bank 2013b).

Guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions is currently very limited for at least two
reasons. First, evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive interventions with respect to
nutritional outcomes is limited. Second, compared with nutrition-specific interventions, estimating
and attributing the costs of nutrition-sensitive interventions is quite complex since these
interventions have multiple objectives and improved nutrition outcomes is only one of them.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the availability of costing information is crucial to assess the
cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This series of papers on costing nutrition interventions
makes a first-ever attempt to address these issues.

We identify and cost six selected nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant for scale-up in
the Congolese context, for which there is evidence of the positive impact on nutrition outcomes
and for which there is some cost information. These include three interventions delivered through
the agriculture sector‚Äîbiofortification of cassava, aflatoxin reduction through biocontrol, and
konzo control via promotion of the cassava flour wetting method; two delivered through the
education sector‚Äîschool-based deworming and school-based promotion of good hygiene; and one
delivered through the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector‚Äîincreasing access to
improved WASH infrastructure. Other potential nutrition-sensitive interventions include reducing



                                                  10
women‚Äôs workloads through improved technologies in agriculture; and conditional cash transfers,
targeted toward the poor, which are designed to have an impact on nutrition outcomes.

Biofortification has the potential to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in a highly cost-effective
manner. Biofortification uses plant breeding techniques to enhance the micronutrient content of
staple foods. Evaluation of the orange-flesh sweet potato biofortification program in Uganda and
Mozambique showed high farmer adoption, significant increase in vitamin A intakes, and
improvement of child vitamin A status (Arimond et al. 2011; Hotz et al. 2012a; Hotz 2012b). An
ex-ante cost study of biofortification in 14 countries suggests that most cost per DALY averted
fall in the highly cost-effective category, particularly in South Asia and Africa (Meenakshi et al.
2010). A recent study by HarvestPlus that ranked countries using country-level data according to
their suitability for investment in biofortification interventions identified the DRC as a ‚Äútop
priority‚Äù country for the biofortification of cassava (Asare-Marfo et al. 2013). According to one
estimate, biofortification of cassava has the potential to reduce the DALY burden of vitamin A
deficiency by 32 percent for a cost per DALY averted of as little as $8 (Meenakshi et al. 2010).

Biocontrol of aflatoxins has the potential to reduce aflatoxins in maize and groundnuts by at least
80 to 90 percent (Bandyopadhyay and Cotty 2013). Field testing of biocontrol products in Burkina
Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal, although not formally published, is producing extremely
positive results. The method involves a single application of a product (aflasafeTM) that contains
strains unique to the specific country.

Training women to utilize the wetting method for preparing cassava flour in villages where there
is a high risk of children developing konzo has proven to be a highly cost-effective means of
reducing or eliminating cases of the disease (Australian National University 2014). The wetting
method involves soaking cassava flour in water, spreading it out in a thin layer, and allowing it to
dry in the sun for two hours or in the shade for five hours. This process allows hydrogen cyanide
gas to escape before the flour is used to make fufu, which is a type of traditional porridge. Each
training intervention lasts nine months, during which time senior women are taught the wetting
method and each, in turn, teaches 12‚Äì15 additional women. Women are also provided with a bowl,
a knife, and a mat for drying (Australian National University 2014).

Follow-up studies in four villages where interventions were previously implemented found that
the training efforts had a significant impact on both the women‚Äôs behavior and the incidence of
konzo. Most of the women who learned the wetting method continued to use it in preparing fufu,
and they actually preferred the taste of fufu prepared with this method to that made with traditional
preparation methods. Furthermore, there were no new reported cases of konzo and children showed
a significant reduction in urinary thiocyanate. To date, Australian Aid has funded interventions to
prevent konzo in 13 villages involving nearly 10,000 people in Kwango District, Bandundu
Province (Australian National University 2014).

School-based deworming has been proven to be an efficient and cost-effective intervention to
address health and nutrition outcomes, with a cost per DALY saved estimated at $4.55 (J-PAL
2012). Delivering deworming tablets through schools is inexpensive because it uses existing
infrastructure and delivery platforms in schools and community links with teachers. Teachers need
only minimal training to safely administer the tablets, so their workloads are not significantly

                                                 11
increased. The delivery costs of school-based deworming in schools are about $0.04 per treatment
(Guyatt 2003), yet the benefits are enormous. Bi-annual deworming significantly boosted school
attendance and reduced self-reported illness and anemia, while providing modest gains in height-
for-age Z-scores in Kenya (J-PAL 2012). Evidence from India also suggests that deworming has
the potential to reduce cases of childhood stunting and underweight (Awasthi et al. 2013). In the
long term, deworming improved self-reported health, increased total schooling years, and
increased earnings by 20 percent (Baird et al. 2011).

At one point, school-based deworming in the DRC was included as part of the World Food
Program (WFP)‚Äôs school feeding programming. The last such campaign, which reached more than
1 million school-aged children, was undertaken in 2011 with supplies of mebendazole donated by
the American nongovernmental organization (NGO) Deworm the World. Deworming proved
extremely cost-effective when delivered with school feeding, even though it reached only children
in school, but the future sustainability of the program is unclear.

Improved hygiene behaviors through the promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior
would decrease the risk of stunting in one in three children. Correct handwashing at critical times
can reduce diarrhea by 42 to 47 percent, lower the incidence of diarrhea for children by 53 percent,
and reduce the incidence of acute respiratory infections by 44 percent (World Bank 2013b). A
recent campaign promoting handwashing with soap in primary schools in China, Colombia, and
Egypt demonstrated significant reduction in absenteeism related to diarrhea and respiratory illness
(UNICEF 2012). A study in Brazil showed a relationship between the effects of early childhood
diarrhea on later school readiness and school performance, revealing the potential long-term
human and economic costs of early childhood diarrhea (Lorntz et al. 2006).

The effectiveness of promoting good hygiene behavior in schools is demonstrated by the long-
terms impact and broad effect of good hygiene on communities. Schools are ideal settings for
hygiene education, where children can learn and sustain lifelong proper hygiene practices through
peer-to-peer teaching, classroom sessions with focused training materials, and role-playing or
interactive songs. A study on the long-term effect of a hygiene education program for both adults
and children found that hygiene behaviors are sustained beyond the end of an intervention. The
study also found that educated students can influence family members by sharing this information,
which may in turn affect behavior change at the community level (Bolt and Cairncross 2004).

At the same time, WASH interventions, which provide improved water sources, hygienic latrines,
and behavior change communication programs, can help to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and
child mortality. The World Bank argued that the reduction in diarrhea from improved WASH
ultimately depends on both the quality of existing WASH infrastructure and on child mortality
levels in the country (Gunther and Fink 2011). Given the high levels of child mortality in the DRC
and the poor quality of its current infrastructure, it follows that WASH interventions could have a
significant impact. In studying the potential benefits of scaling up WASH interventions in the
DRC, DFID cites estimates that these programs could reduce diarrhea-related DALYs by 39
percent and save an average of $7.50 per person per year in reduced health care costs (DFID 2012).
Additionally, DFID claims that by reducing the time that households, and women in particular,
spend gathering water, WASH interventions could save an average of 1.5 hours per household per
day (DFID 2012).

Although the DRC has a school feeding program, we do not include it in our analysis of nutrition-
sensitive interventions because research has consistently shown no effects resulting from such
programs on the nutritional status of children as measured by stunting and wasting (World Bank
2012a). The lack of impact from school feeding on nutritional status is probably because the most
influential time in a child‚Äôs life to address malnutrition is the first 1,000 days of life, which occurs
before children are of school age. School feeding programs, however, undoubtedly have other
benefits, such as attracting and keeping students in school and some educational gains (World
Bank 2012a). Nevertheless, those outcomes are beyond the scope of this analysis.


       GOVERNMENT AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MALNUTRITION IN THE DRC

In spite of government and donor commitments to improving nutrition in the DRC, several
constraints impede the implementation of strategies to improve nutrition outcomes. The first is the
scarcity of funds for nutrition interventions: the Government of the DRC continues to rely heavily
on the support of donors and implementing partners to deliver essential services. Second is the
lack of clear implementation plans, with the result that the coverage of evidence-based
interventions remains limited. A related constraint is the poor coordination among stakeholders.
(DFID and MQSUN 2013).

Ongoing conflicts and crises in several provinces have led to a focus on humanitarian aid and
emergency responses to nutrition challenges. This is apparent both in the large proportion of
financing allocated to short-term humanitarian projects (see Financing Current and Proposed
Nutrition Interventions in Part III), as well as the concentration of nutrition programs in conflict-
affected areas. In its 2013 Humanitarian Action Plan, UN OCHA notes that although ‚Äústabilized‚Äù
zones contribute most to the burden of malnutrition and under-five mortality, these are the least
likely to receive funding for nutrition interventions (UN OCHA 2013). For example, high-burden
provinces such as √âquateur and Kasai-Occidental have not received the attention from donors that
has poured resources into conflict-affected areas in the country‚Äôs east (DFID and MQSUN 2013).
Furthermore, given the continuing emphasis on treating acute malnutrition, crucial preventative
interventions remain underfunded (UN OCHA 2013).

Current national programmatic efforts to improve nutrition outcomes are coordinated by the
National Nutrition Program (PRONANUT) with significant funding and support from UNICEF,
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WHO, the World Bank, the WFP,
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the European Commission for
Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), DFID, the European Union, the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and
national and international NGOs (SUN 2014). However, because government resources allocated
to nutrition are limited, the coverage and duration of nutrition interventions depend largely on
external support (DFID and MQSUN 2013).

The coverage of nutrition-specific interventions in the DRC is currently relatively limited; the
exception is vitamin A supplementation, which is delivered twice per year through a door-to-door
campaign. Salt iodization coverage is also reasonably high, and this is achieved largely through

                                                  13
import quality controls. The lowest level of the health system in the DRC is the health zone, which
is comprised of health centers linked to a referral hospital. The health zones should and could
provide basic preventive nutrition services such as growth promotion and nutrition counseling,
distribution of zinc tablets with oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diarrhea treatment, iron-folic
acid supplements as part of antenatal care for pregnant women, and multiple-micronutrient
powders for young children to address anemia and other deficiencies, but the coverage of these
interventions is currently low. These health centers can also screen children for severe acute
malnutrition and refer them for treatment (in referral hospitals for cases with complications and
community-based treatment for regular cases). The DRC also has a system of community
extensions (relais communautaires) that could be used for behavior change communications and
other community-based services for nutrition. There also exist national and international NGOs
that deliver nutrition services, but these are not (yet) financed by the government and thus do not
form part of the national service delivery system. A model could be developed whereby a body
such as the Fonds Social de la R√©publique could contract NGOs to deliver key community-based
services, including nutrition, building on successful experience in community-driven development
projects. These various delivery channels are currently being used to deliver nutrition services to
some extent, but this is not done systematically and the monitoring is weak. The responsibility for
quality control and monitoring rests with PRONANUT within the Ministry of Health.
PRONANUT is based in Kinshasa and has a presence in all the provinces, but the program‚Äôs
logistics and human capacity is weak.

Following the government‚Äôs decision to join the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in 2013,
there has been a renewed national commitment to multisectoral nutrition approaches to combat
malnutrition. This includes the establishment of a national multisectoral nutrition committee, under
the authority of the Prime Minister and composed of the heads of key ministries, including the
Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. The committee has
formulated a comprehensive, evidence-based and rigorous national nutrition policy. Important
next steps will include clear operational plans to implement the policy, the establishment of a donor
network (led by World Bank), a UN network (led by UNICEF) and a civil society SUN network
co-led by Helen Keller International and Save the Children.

         PART II ‚Äì COSTED SCALE-UP SCENARIOS: RATIONALE,
                   OBJECTIVES, AND METHODOLOGY
The overall objective of this research is to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of
Congo in developing a costed scale-up plan that furthers the operationalization of the recently
released National Nutrition Policy. These efforts will provide the Government of the DRC with
the tools needed to leverage adequate resources from their domestic budgets, as well as from
development partners, in support of the costed scale-up plan. Within this context, the objectives of
this analysis are as follows:

   ‚Ä¢   To estimate scale-up costs in the DRC for a set of well-proven nutrition-specific
       interventions that have the potential to be scaled up through tested delivery mechanisms
   ‚Ä¢   To conduct a basic economic analysis to calculate the potential benefits and cost-
       effectiveness associated with the proposed scale up
   ‚Ä¢   To propose a series of scenarios for a costed scale-up plan that rolls out this package of
       nutrition-specific interventions in phases, based on considerations of impact, geography,
       implementation capacity, and costs
   ‚Ä¢   To explore initial costs for a limited number of nutrition-sensitive interventions through
       the agriculture, education, and water and sanitation sectors

Although the economic arguments for increasing investments in nutrition are sound, one of the
first questions raised by key decision makers in any country is ‚ÄúHow much will it cost?‚Äù In 2010,
the World Bank spearheaded a study called Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? to answer
that question at the global level. The analysis estimated the level of global financing required to
scale up 10 evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions in 36 countries that account for 90
percent of the world‚Äôs stunting burden and 32 smaller countries that also have a high prevalence
of undernutrition. The results of the study highlighted the global financing gap, underscored the
importance of investing in nutrition at the global level, and laid out a methodology for estimating
the costs of nutrition-specific interventions. However, these global estimates did not capture the
nuances and context in each country, nor were these estimates contextualized to every individual
country‚Äôs policy and capacity setting or its fiscal constraints. This report builds on the early work
to address this gap and contextualize the cost estimates for the DRC.

The multisectoral approach requires nutrition-sensitive approaches or interventions that can be
delivered through other sectors. As discussed above, globally there is currently very limited
guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions. Therefore this present report provides an
exploratory analysis to be used primarily to engage other sectors in planning for improved
nutritional outcomes. This initial exercise will contribute to a broader discussion about
methodological and other issues for costing nutrition-sensitive interventions, and will thereby
encourage the formulation of standard definitions, methodologies, and guidance for costing these
interventions in the future.

              SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTIONS

The costed scale-up plan is presented in two sections. The first section presents estimated costs
and benefits for the set of 10 nutrition-specific interventions that have strong evidence of impact
and were included in the World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010) and are primarily
delivered through the health sector. These interventions and the associated target population and
current coverage for each intervention are specified in Table 1.

The nutrition-specific interventions considered are a modified package of the interventions
included in the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to the
DRC context. These 10 interventions are based on current scientific evidence and there is general
consensus from the global community about the impact of these interventions. Some
interventions‚Äîsuch as deworming and iron-fortification of staple foods‚Äîthat were included in
the 2008 Lancet series but no longer listed in the 2013 Lancet series are included here because
they remain relevant to the DRC. Others‚Äîsuch as calcium supplementation for women and
prophylactic zinc supplementation‚Äîare excluded because delivery mechanisms are not available
in client countries, including the DRC, and/or there are no clear WHO protocols or guidelines for
large-scale programming. In other cases, there are limited capacities for scaling up the
interventions. Only those nutrition-specific interventions that are relevant to the DRC context and
that have strong evidence of effectiveness, a WHO protocol, and a feasible delivery mechanism
for scale-up are included in the proposed scale-up package below. As this evidence base grows,
other interventions can be added over time.

The analysis in the following section focuses on nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant
to the DRC context and that have the potential to have an impact on nutrition outcomes. A
description of these interventions, associated target populations, and responsible sectors are listed
in Table 2. As discussed above, the evidence base for nutrition-sensitive interventions is not as
strong as it is for nutrition-specific interventions. Therefore these estimates are exploratory and
are limited to six potential interventions relevant to the DRC context that can be scaled up and
have potential for impact on nutrition outcomes. Additional interventions were not included in
these initial estimates because their impact on nutrition is yet to be clearly documented (Masset et
al. 2011; Ruel et al. 2013; World Bank 2013b), because this is an exploratory instead of an
exhaustive effort, or because they were not considered relevant to the needs of the DRC.
Furthermore, cost attribution is complex because these nutrition-sensitive interventions are
designed for multiple purposes.

ESTIMATION OF TARGET POPULATION SIZES, CURRENT COVERAGE LEVELS, AND UNIT COSTS

Target population estimates are based primarily on demographic data obtained from the National
Institute of Statistics (INS), PRONANUT, MICS/ELIM 2010, and the preliminary results from the
DHS 2013‚Äì14, which are provided in Appendix 2.3 In the absence of recent census data, we use
INS projected population estimates by province for 2013, while the population breakdown by age
was calculated using the results of the MICS/ELIM (2010) survey. The prevalence of child stunting
(height-for-age Z-score <‚Äì2), underweight (weight-for-age Z-score <‚Äì2), and severe wasting
(weight-for-height Z-score <‚Äì3) among children under five years of age in each province were
obtained from the preliminary DHS (2013‚Äì14) survey data.

Data on current coverage levels of different interventions were obtained from various sources.
Current coverage levels for multiple micronutrient powders for home fortification, iron
fortification of staple foods, and the provision of complementary food for the prevention of
moderate malnutrition were set to 0 percent either because the intervention was not being
implemented and coverage was very minimal or because current reliable data were not available.
Coverage data for vitamin A supplementation and deworming coverage were obtained from
MICS/ELIM (2010). For coverage of iron-folic acid supplementation for pregnant women, the
percentage of women attending four or more prenatal consultations (MICS/ELIM 2010) was used
as a proxy in the absence of reliable data. The MICS/ELIM (2010) survey data were also used to
estimate the proportion of households consuming adequately iodized salt in each province. Finally,
data on the number of children treated for severe acute malnutrition were obtained from the Annual
Report for UN OCHA‚Äôs 2013 Humanitarian Action Plan in the DRC. Results from DHS 2013‚Äì14
provided estimates of the current incidence of severe acute malnutrition and moderate acute
malnutrition. We also used DHS 2013‚Äì14 to classify the provinces according to levels of stunting.

Whenever possible, unit costs of the nutrition-specific interventions were estimated using
programmatic data that were provided by local implementing partners and the Ministry of Health,
based on actual program experience. The estimated unit costs and the delivery platforms are listed
in Table 3. In cases where the intervention was not yet being implemented or local data were not
available, the global unit cost estimate from the World Bank (2010) was used. A complete index
of data sources and relevant assumptions for these interventions can be found in Appendix 3.

    The bulk of the data used in the analysis comes from MICS/ELIM 2010. The full dataset from the 2013 ‚Äì14 DHS
       was not available at the time the analyses were undertaken. Although it is not feasible to re-do the analysis with
       the newer DHS data, a review of the 2013‚Äì14 DHS data suggests that the results would not change substantially
       were the newer data to be used.

For the nutrition-sensitive interventions, the unit costs were estimated using local cost data, with
the exception of aflatoxin control and school-based deworming, which are taken from similar
programs in Nigeria and Ghana, respectively. Biofortification cost estimates do not lend
themselves to a unit cost framework, but country-specific, overall cost estimates were obtained
from Meenakshi et al. (2010). The cost of school-based promotion of good hygiene was derived
from financial data from the DRC‚Äôs √âcoles Assainies program. Konzo control interventions are
costed using the estimated unit cost reported by Australian National University (2014). Finally,
the costing of WASH interventions is based on average unit costs presented in a DFID Business

                                   ESTIMATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS

The program experience methodology employed in the Scaling Up Nutrition report (World Bank
2010) is used for calculating the cost of scaling up in the DRC. This approach generates unit cost
data that capture all aspects of service delivery, including the costs of commodities, transportation
and storage, personnel, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, relevant overhead,
wastage, and so on for each intervention from actual programs that are already in operation in the
DRC, and considers the context in which they are delivered. Another commonly used method is
the ingredients approach, in which selected activities are bundled into appropriate delivery
packages (for example, number of visits to a health center) (e.g., in Bhutta et al. 2013). Although
the program experience approach tends to yield cost estimates that are higher than the ingredients
approach, the estimates more accurately reflect real programmatic experience, including
inefficiencies in service delivery. It should be noted, however, that the calculated costs are reported
in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social resource requirements, which
account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by beneficiaries accessing the services.

We calculate the annual public investment required to scale up the interventions as follows:

         Ì†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•3

where:


                                                   21
           Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage4
           Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
           Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
           Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions

Appendix 4 describes the methodology in detail.

The expected benefits from scaling up nutrition interventions are calculated in terms of (1) DALYs
saved, (2) number of lives saved, (3) cases of childhood stunting averted, and (4) increased
program coverage. To calculate the number of DALYs, we use the method employed by Black et
al. (2008) to estimate the averted morbidity and mortality from scaling up different nutrition
interventions. The method uses population attributable fractions (PAF) based on the comparative
risk assessment project (Ezzati et al. 2002; Ezzati et al. 2004) to estimate the burden of infectious
diseases attributable to different forms of undernutrition using most recent Global Burden of
Disease Study (IHME 2010a). DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor age-
weighted, in line with the methodology used in the Global Burden of Disease Study and the WHO
Global Health Estimates (2012b). Appendix 5 describes the methodology for estimating DALYs.
The projected number of lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted are calculated using
the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates measured coverage changes into estimates of
mortality reduction and changes in the prevalence of under-five stunting. This analysis included
all ten interventions to calculate the number DALYs saved. However, because of the
methodological limitations of the LiST tool, the calculation for the number of lives saved is based
on only six of the ten interventions,5 and cases of childhood stunting averted is based on only four
of the ten.6 As such, our estimates are likely to underestimate the number of lives saved and cases
of childhood stunting averted. Appendix 6 describes the methodology for the LiST estimates.

The measures for cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions are calculated in terms of
cost per DALY saved, cost per life saved, and cost per case of stunting averted. Estimates of
benefits were combined with information on costs to produce the cost-effectiveness measures for
each intervention as well as for the overall package of interventions. The evaluation of the cost-
effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs saved is based on the categorization used by WHO-
CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective):7 an intervention is considered to be
‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù if the range for the cost per DALY averted is less than GDP per capita;8 it is

4
    Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for community-based
       treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent.
5
    The six interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A supplementation,
       therapeutic zinc supplementation with ORS, iron-folic acid supplementation, the public provision of
       complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition and community-based management of
       severe acute malnutrition.

    The four interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A supplementation, iron-
       folic acid supplementation and the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute
       malnutrition.

    The DRC‚Äôs GDP per capita in current U.S. dollars was $454 in 2013 (World Bank 2014).

                                                          22
considered to be ‚Äúcost-effective‚Äù if it is between one and three times GDP per capita; and it is
considered ‚Äúnot cost-effective‚Äù if it exceeds three times GDP per capita (WHO 2014).

The cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to
nutrition-specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value for the impact on mortality and
morbidity of a five-year scale-up plan, we use estimates of the number of lives saved and the
reduction in stunting prevalence produced by the LiST tool. Following established practice, a life
year saved is valued as equivalent to gross national income (GNI) per capita; this is considered to
be a conservative measure because it accounts for only the economic and not the social value of a
year of life. In order to estimate the value of the reduction in stunting, we follow the methodology
used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which values a year of life lived without stunting based on the
assumption that stunted individuals lose an average of 66 percent of lifetime earnings. Future
benefits are then age-adjusted and discounted at three potential discount rates (3, 5, and 7 percent)
in order to arrive at their present value. The present value of future benefits is then compared with
the annual public investment required, which allows us to estimate the net present value (NPV)
and internal rate of return of the investment. A detailed explanation of the benefit estimation
methodology can be found in Appendix 7.

The annual increase in economic productivity attributable to each package of interventions is
calculated based on the same estimates of future benefits. Although these benefits occur only once
beneficiaries have reached productive age, we assume that they serve as an approximation of the
present value of economic productivity lost each year as a result of mortality and morbidity that
would otherwise be prevented by scaling up nutrition interventions. Values presented are taken
from a year in which all beneficiaries have reached productive age.

The approach for estimating the potential costs and benefits of nutrition-sensitive interventions
differs from the methodology used for nutrition-specific interventions. Similar to nutrition-
specific interventions, the total cost for scaling up the interventions is calculated by multiplying
the unit cost by the target population (either country unit costs for the DRC or Africa regional unit
costs are used, depending on availability). However, since most nutrition-sensitive interventions
have multiple objectives, it is not always feasible to attribute the nutrition-related benefits to the
overall costs of the interventions. Because these constraints limit the accuracy of cost-effectiveness
estimates, we instead rely on secondary sources and published literature when available, with cost-
effectiveness presented in terms of cost per DALY saved.


                    SCENARIOS FOR SCALING UP NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS

When estimating the costs and benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions, we begin with
estimates for scaling all 10 interventions to full national coverage, followed by estimates for
various scale-up scenarios. The full coverage estimates can be considered the medium-term policy
goal for the Government of the DRC. However, resource constraints will likely limit the
government‚Äôs ability to achieve full national coverage in the short-term. Therefore we also propose
several scenarios for prioritizing the scale-up of nutrition interventions over the short-term time
frame of five years:



                                                 23
‚Ä¢      Scenario 1: Prioritize scale up by province
‚Ä¢      Scenario 2: Prioritize scale up by intervention
‚Ä¢      Scenario 3: Prioritize scale up by province and by intervention

Within each of the above scenarios, we consider multiple variations and analyze their cost-
effectiveness in terms of cost per DALY saved, cost per life saved, and cost per case of childhood
stunting averted. After our initial analysis, we present the most attractive scale-up scenarios and
discuss them in more detail.

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for
community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be
80 percent. This definition is consistent with the methodology used in World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up
Nutrition report (2010), and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs
have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

    PART III ‚Äì RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS
                   TOTAL COST, EXPECTED BENEFITS, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS

The total additional public investment required to scale up 10 nutrition-specific interventions from
current coverage levels to full coverage at the national level in the DRC is estimated to be $371
million annually (Table 5). This cost includes the additional cost of scaling up all 10 interventions
across the entire country from current levels ($378 million per year), plus additional resources for
capacity development for program delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations
research, and technical support for program delivery (estimated at $42 million). Of this total
amount, part of the costs for iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and
complementary food ($49 million) would be covered by private households with incomes above
the poverty line, resulting in an annual financing gap of $371 million required to reach full national
scale.

Reaching full national coverage for all 10 interventions nationwide is estimated to cost $1.04
billion over five years. These figures (Table 6) are based on specific scale-up assumptions and are
provided as an example in order to demonstrate how interventions can be scaled up progressively
in the context of a five-year strategic plan. The five-year scale-up assumes that capacity building
and system strengthening costs will be front-loaded, with coverage increasing steadily by 20
percent of the target population each year.

The expected benefits from scaling up these 10 nutrition-specific interventions to full national
coverage are enormous (Table 7). Almost 5.5 million DALYs and over 76,000 lives would be
saved annually, while more than 1 million cases of stunting among children under five would be
averted. Program coverage is assumed to increase to cover the following beneficiaries:

   ‚Ä¢    The families of 15.8 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
        nutrition programs for growth promotion
   ‚Ä¢    2.5 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
        vitamin A supplementation

b. DALY estimates for iron-folic acid supplementation are calculated for DALYs averted among pregnant women.

c. The total of the interventions implemented simultaneously does not equal to the sum of the individual interventions.
This is because some interventions affect nutrition outcomes via similar pathways causing their combined impact to
be different than the individual sums.


For the package as a whole, we estimate the total cost per DALY saved at $70, the total cost per
life saved at $4,929, and the total cost per case of child stunting averted at $368 (Table 8). Variation
in cost among the interventions is high and, as a result, some interventions have a lower estimated
cost per DALY saved ($21 for community nutrition programs), whereas others have much higher
costs ($1,825 for the public provision of complementary foods). Overall, these cost estimates
translate into an increase in annual public resource requirements of $23 per child, which compares
favorably with the cost of $30 per child found in the global costing exercise (World Bank 2010).

Nine of the 10 nutrition-specific interventions are very cost-effective according to the WHO-
CHOICE criteria (WHO 2014). The exception is the public provision of complementary food for
the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, with a cost per DALY of $1,825, which exceeds
three times the GDP per capita of $454. Therefore, in a country like the DRC where fiscal and
capacity constraints will limit scale-up, certain expensive interventions‚Äîsuch as the public
provision of complementary foods‚Äîmay be a lower priority. Furthermore, issues of governance,
accountability, and supply logistics will all put pressure on the cost and complicate the scale-up of
the public provision of complementary foods.

Scenario 1: Scaling Up by Province
Table 9 shows the estimated costs and benefits of scaling up the 10 nutrition-specific interventions
according to the stunting burden found in each province. Significant disparities in malnutrition
rates exist, with stunting rates exceeding 45 percent in five of eleven provinces. These are the
highest-burden provinces in the table and they would disproportionately benefit from scaling-up
nutrition interventions, as demonstrated by high expected benefits in terms of DALYs saved and
lives saved. The middle-burden provinces have stunting rates between 40 and 45 percent or severe
stunting between 20 and 25 percent, and the lowest-burden provinces have stunting rates less than
40 percent and severe stunting less than 20 percent.

Given the high burden of stunting in Bas-Congo, the two Kasais, and the two Kivus, the preferred
scenario (Scenario 1) is to scale up interventions in these provinces, with an annual public
investment of $135 million. This scenario would save almost 1.9 million DALYs and over 26,000
lives. It would also increase program coverage as follows:

    ‚Ä¢   The families of 5.5 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
        nutrition programs for growth promotion
    ‚Ä¢   911,000 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
        vitamin A supplementation
    ‚Ä¢   4.7 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
        diarrhea management
    ‚Ä¢   1.1 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
        multiple micronutrient powders
    ‚Ä¢   1.6 million children 12‚Äì59 months of age would receive deworming medication

                                                        29
       ‚Ä¢   714,500 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal
           care
       ‚Ä¢   29.6 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
       ‚Ä¢   13.5 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
       ‚Ä¢   246,000 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
           community-based management practices;
       ‚Ä¢   1.3 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive a small amount of nutrient-dense
           complementary food (~250 kilocalories/day) for the prevention or treatment of moderate
           malnutrition

Scenario 2: Scaling Up by Intervention
Scenario 2 considers prioritizing the scale-up by intervention according to cost-effectiveness. The
proposed plan for a step-wise scale-up by intervention is summarized below and illustrated in
Figure 6.

       ‚Ä¢   Step 1 focuses on a package of micronutrient and deworming interventions that can be
           scaled up quickly, either with existing capacities or with modest investment in capacity
           building for community nutrition programs and national campaigns. The cost of scaling up
           all micronutrient and deworming interventions to full national coverage is $61.2 million
           (this cost assumes no scale-up of the public provision of complementary foods; for an
           alternative scenario, see footnote 9). An additional $6.7 million for capacity development
           for program delivery, and for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical
           support brings the total cost of Step 1 to $67.9 million. Once the costs covered by
           households above the poverty line ($14.4 million) are deducted, the total public investment
           required for Step 1 is estimated at $54 million.9
       ‚Ä¢   Step 2 includes the costs of a full scale-up of community nutrition programs for behavior
           change communication, in addition to the scale up of community-based management of
           acute malnutrition programming to 80 percent national coverage. The estimated cost of this
           scale-up is $203 million. We also include an additional $22 million for capacity
           development for program delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations research,
           and technical support for program delivery, which brings the total public investment
           required for Step 2 to $225 million.
       ‚Ä¢   Step 3 scales up the public provision of complementary foods for the prevention of
           moderate malnutrition to full national coverage. This intervention requires an investment
           of $125 million in addition to the $14 million needed for capacity development for program
           delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for
           program delivery. Households above the poverty line are expected to contribute $38
           million, leaving a total public investment required of $100 million.

9
    If complementary foods are provided, children who are moderately malnourished or at risk of becoming moderately
        malnourished would receive complementary foods rather than micronutrient powders. In this case, Step 1
        interventions would cost $50.2 million, with $5.5 million for capacity development for program delivery, and
        for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for program delivery; and $11 million
        covered by households above the poverty line, bringing the total public investment required to $44.7 million.



                                                           30
       Figure 6. Scenario 2: Step-Wise Scale-Up by Intervention




       Note: There is no household contribution for Step 2 interventions.


The public provision of complementary food (Step 3) is assigned the lowest priority for the
following reasons: (1) the 2013 Lancet nutrition series concluded that there are no additional
benefits of public provision of complementary foods beyond those provided by dietary counseling
and education; (2) at $1,825 per DALY saved, the cost-effectiveness of the public provision of
complementary foods is less attractive than that of the other proposed interventions; and (3)
governance, accountability, supply-chain, and logistics are key challenges associated with large-
scale food distribution and are not inconsequential in a country the size of the DRC. Under these
circumstances, rapid scale-up is neither feasible nor recommended.


The preferred scale-up scenario (Scenario 2) would be to scale up Step 1 and 2 interventions,
requiring an annual public investment of $279 million (Table 10). This scenario would save over
5.3 million DALYs and at least 66,000 lives. It would also provide the following program benefits:

The first recommended scenario (Scenario 3a) is to scale up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions in
provinces with stunting rates above 40 percent (highest- and middle-burden provinces),10 requiring
an annual public investment of $185 million. Scenario 3a would save over 3.6 million DALYs and
over 44,000 lives (Table 12). Scenario 3a would provide the following program benefits:

      ‚Ä¢   The families of 10.9 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
          nutrition programs for growth promotion
      ‚Ä¢   2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
          vitamin A supplementation
      ‚Ä¢   9.4 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
          diarrhea management
      ‚Ä¢   4.6 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
          multiple micronutrient powders
      ‚Ä¢   3.3 million children 12‚Äì59 months of age would receive deworming medication
      ‚Ä¢   1.4 million pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal
          care
      ‚Ä¢   58.8 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
      ‚Ä¢   28.7 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
      ‚Ä¢   454,600 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would treated for severe acute malnutrition using
          community-based management practices

A second scenario (Scenario 3b) under Scenario 3 would scale up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions
in the five provinces where stunting rates are higher than 45 percent and severe stunting rates

10
     The highest-burden provinces are Bas-Congo, Kasai-Occidental, Kasai-Oriental, Nord-Kivu, and Sud-Kivu; the
       middle-burden provinces are Katanga, Maniema, and Orientale.

exceed 25 percent (highest-burden provinces).11 Scenario 3b would require an annual public
investment of $97 million and would save over 1.8 million DALYs and 22,000 lives. Furthermore,
Scenario 3b would provide the following program benefits:

      ‚Ä¢   The families of 4.9 million children 0‚Äì59 months would be reached by community
          programs for behavior change
      ‚Ä¢   774,000 children 6‚Äì59 months would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving vitamin A
          supplementation
      ‚Ä¢   4.2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
          diarrhea management
      ‚Ä¢   2.1 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
          multiple micronutrient powders
      ‚Ä¢   953,000 children 12‚Äì59 months of age would receive deworming medication
      ‚Ä¢   521,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal
          care
      ‚Ä¢   26.7 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
      ‚Ä¢   9.2 million people who do not currently used iodized salt would be able to obtain it
      ‚Ä¢   274,000 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
          community-based management practices

The final scenario proposed under Scenario 3 (Scenario 3c) would scale up micronutrient and
deworming interventions in all 11 provinces. In addition, Scenario 3c would target the scale-up of
community nutrition programs to the five highest-burden provinces, while also increasing the
reach of community-based management of severe acute malnutrition in the six provinces with
global acute malnutrition rates over 10 percent (Bandundu, Bas-Congo, the two Kasais, √âquateur,
and Orientale). Scenario 3c would require an annual public investment of $222 million and save
over 3.8 million DALYs and 48,000 lives. The beneficiaries of Scenario 3c would be distributed
as follows:

      ‚Ä¢   The families of 5.5 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
          programs for behavior change
      ‚Ä¢   2.9 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
          vitamin A supplementation

                   COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE SCALE-UP SCENARIOS

When considered in terms of cost-effectiveness (cost per DALY/life saved/case of stunting
averted), all scenarios promise significant value for money. Table 13 presents a comparison of all
five scenarios, and shows that full national coverage and Scenarios 1 and 3c feature some of the
highest costs per DALY saved and life saved. Overall, Scenarios 2, 3a, and 3b stand out as the
most cost-effective, with a cost per DALY saved of $48‚Äì50.

Scenarios 3a and 3b maximize cost-effectiveness while also minimizing resource requirements.
Of these two scenarios, Scenario 3a offers the greatest cost-effectiveness at half the cost of scaling
up nationwide, while Scenario 3b also maintains significant cost-effectiveness at just a quarter of
the cost of reaching full national scale. One important aspect of both Scenarios 3a and 3b is that
they both target the most highly burdened provinces rather than the nationwide population.
Another attractive choice is Scenario 2; it is equally cost-effective ($49 per DALY saved) and
would provide interventions nationwide, although this scenario would require more public
resources ($279 million per year).

Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full coverage in one year, and assuming a five-year time
frame for any potential strategic plan, we consider the costs over five years for each scenario.
Scenarios 3a and 3b require the fewest resources over five years as compared with the other
scenarios. Interventions are assumed to scale from current coverage as follows: 20 percent of
coverage in Year 1, 40 percent in Year 2, 60 percent in Year 3, 80 percent in Year 4, and 100
percent in Year 5 (Table 14). For these calculations, we consider the expenditures on capacity
development for program delivery required to scale to full coverage to be a fixed cost, with some
additional funds allocated to refresher training and rehiring in the years after scale has been
reached. Thus the average annual amount spent on capacity development is allocated across the
five years rather than increasing in proportion to coverage, as is the case with the other costs.

A high burden of malnutrition negatively impacts a nation‚Äôs human capital. Therefore an
investment in improving nutrition outcomes among the DRC‚Äôs children is also an investment in
the country‚Äôs economic future. The two main ways through which malnutrition affects economic
productivity are increased mortality and morbidity‚Äîin other words, lives lost and years lived with
a disease or disability. For the purposes of this analysis, we estimate the potential economic
benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions in terms of lives saved (reduction in mortality) and
cases of stunting averted (reduction in morbidity). Because each life lost results in one less citizen
contributing to the nation‚Äôs economy, and because stunted children tend to earn and consume less,
these impact estimates help us to arrive at approximations of the return on investment attributable
to the scale-up of a particular package of interventions. We estimate that a five-year scale-up plan
that brings all 10 interventions to full national coverage in the DRC could produce $591 million
annual increase in national economic productivity over the productive lives of the children affected
(Table 15).

These estimates of economic benefits are based on a highly conservative methodology that does
not necessarily account for all of the potential benefits associated with improving nutrition
outcomes among Congolese children. For example, these figures do not account for future growth
in GDP per capita that would also be expected to increase with improved nutritional outcomes.
Furthermore, it is likely that these estimated increases in GDP would also improve equity in the
DRC because productivity among the poor would benefit the most from improved nutritional
outcome. However, these estimates clearly demonstrate that the opportunity costs of not scaling
up nutrition interventions are at least $591 million per year.

Our analyses also show that the nutrition interventions are excellent economic investments at a
range of possible discount rates (Table 15). Because an increase in the assumed discount rate
reduces the present value of future benefits, we present the results using three possible discount

                                                      37
rates: 3, 5 and 7 percent. At the 3 percent discount rate, the net present value of the interventions
would be $7,268 million and have a benefit-cost ratio of 8.7. At the 5 percent discount rate, the net
present value would be $3,837 million with a benefit-cost ratio of 5.4. At the 7 percent discount
rate, the net present value would be $2,005 million with a benefit-cost ratio of 3.4. These results
show that, even at the most conservative discount rate of 7 percent, the interventions are an
excellent economic investment. In addition, the investment yields a highly positive internal rate of
return of 13.6 percent, another indicator that it is an excellent economic investment.

                 FINANCING CURRENT AND PROPOSED NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS

Current government funding is very limited and covers only salaries for some staff who provide
nutrition services in Kinshasa and a few provinces (MOB 2014). Overall government financing
for health care also remains low at just $2 per capita per year. Between 2006 and 2010, national
health expenditures from domestic resources amounted to approximately 4 percent of the budget;
and out of a total of $14 per person/per year, the government provides just $2, much of which is
used to pay salaries for the staff noted above.

In addition to out-of-pocket household expenditures, development partners are the main source of
financing for health and nutrition interventions in the DRC. In 2011, financing from development
partners represented 47 percent of total health expenditures, with donors responsible for financing
everything from essential drugs to the salaries of health care workers. Development partners often
‚Äúadopt‚Äù a health zone and ensure the provision of a package of interventions in that area. However,
partner resources are insufficient to cover a country the size of the DRC. This has left much of the
population either lacking access to health services or unable to afford the user fees charged by
underfunded clinics (World Bank 2014b).




                                                         38
Total donor financing for nutrition interventions is also low in the DRC, but it has gradually
increased from about $20 million annually in 2007 to about $25 million in 2012 (Figure 7).12 The
majority of these funds have been for humanitarian assistance‚Äîmainly the treatment of severe
acute malnutrition‚Äîtargeted to a few provinces in the east of the country, leaving other parts of
the country underserved. Furthermore, current aid for nutrition is heavily weighted toward
addressing wasting, despite the fact that wasting levels are low relative to stunting, and most
current donor funding supports supply-side interventions such as nutrition supplements and
community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition. Efforts to expand donor funding to
incorporate demand-side interventions, such as behavior change campaigns that change the
choices households make for good nutrition, are needed.

Although no comprehensive information is available on current and planned donor funding for
nutrition, both the World Bank Group/IDA and DFID are supporting nutrition projects in the DRC.
The World Bank/IDA approved a project of $226.5 million in December 2014 to fund government
health programming from 2015 through 2020, $16.4 million of which is allocated to nutrition
(World Bank 2014b). The project will include, as part of the basic health care package, indicators
that will be ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù using performance-based financing. In addition to indicators (for antenatal
care visits for pregnant women, immunization for children, etc.) that will have an impact on
maternal and child nutrition, the project also has an indicator for ‚Äúchildren 6‚Äì23 months receiving
preventive nutrition services.‚Äù This will be centered on growth promotion, along with counseling
and referral. Importantly, the quality checklist of the performance-based financing system will also
focus on the quality of the nutrition services, and household visits will provide a mechanism for
enabling the counseling to take place as well as enabling the monitoring of the growth of young
children. The project is also innovative in that it will introduce household visits (performance-
based financing projects typically focus on service delivery in facilities) that will be conducted
using a protocol intended to promote healthy behaviors at the household level, including behaviors
that have an impact on nutritional status. The project will finance service delivery in 140 health
zones in the following four provinces: √âquateur, Bandundu, Maniema, and Katanga. DFID
recently partnered with UNICEF to provide $7.3 million to fund direct nutrition interventions from
2013 to 2015 (DFID 2013).

Other development assistance includes USAID funding on the order of $30 million per year in
development food assistance programs that work to prevent chronic malnutrition through a
multisectoral response; this funding is expected to continue through 2021. USAID also supports
emergency food and nutritional assistance to the WFP, UNICEF, and NGOs, and although the
annual total varies year to year,13 it is estimated that about $10 million per year is allocated to the
treatment of acute malnutrition (USAID 2015). Other donors that provide nutrition assistance
include ECHO, which also supports emergency nutrition response; the Government of Belgium,
which supports stunting prevention and nutrition interventions among refugees from the Central
African Republic; and the Government of Japan, which supports the community-based
management of severe acute malnutrition.

A critical next step will be to identify sources of financing for the large financing gap between
what is currently being invested in nutrition interventions and the most modest of the scale-up
scenarios proposed here. As discussed above, public budget allocations to nutrition interventions
are currently negligible and, to date, the bulk of financing comes from international aid of about
$25 million per year. Given that the most modest of the scenarios presented here would require an
additional $97 million in annual investment, a priority is to identify supplementary sources of
funding. The planned World Bank funding will cover only a modest part of these financing needs.
Additional resources are needed to cover the key interventions identified here and to move from a
humanitarian approach to a more development-focused approach that addresses both
undernutrition and the social context in which it occurs.


                                                 UNCERTAINTIES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Because actual unit costs may differ from our estimates, it is important to consider the effects of
either an increase or a decrease in these costs on the overall cost of the interventions. This
uncertainty is greatest for higher-cost interventions, and less significant for those with lower costs.
For example, given the prevalence of information on and experience with the less-expensive
micronutrient and deworming interventions, there is a relatively high degree of certainty around
their estimated costs and financing needs. On the other hand, the costs of community nutrition
programs can vary greatly depending on their context: the intensity of community nutrition
programs for growth promotion, the number of community health workers employed, and the
amount of incentives provided all affect unit costs. Finally, there is very little information on the
costs associated with the public provision of complementary food. In the DRC, no delivery
mechanism is available to be used as a reference for these programs, while unit costs are highly

                                                                               40
dependent on the choice of targeting method and other factors, such as widespread corruption and
diversion of food supplies. In order to account for these uncertainties, we perform a partial
sensitivity analysis that describes the impact of variation in unit costs while holding other variables
constant. These results are presented in Appendix 8.

               PART IV ‚Äì NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS
This section presents cost-benefit estimates for six nutrition-sensitive interventions delivered
through the agriculture, education, and water and sanitation sectors: biofortification of cassava;
aflatoxin reduction through biocontrol interventions; konzo control via the wetting method;
school-based deworming; school-based promotion of good hygiene practices; and investments in
increasing access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure. Table 16
summarizes the cost of scaling up these interventions and, when available, the estimated DALYs
saved and cost per DALYs saved. Biofortification of cassava, school-based deworming, and
WASH interventions are considered to be cost-effective scenarios in the DRC. Costs per DALY
saved are not available for konzo control or school-based promotion of good hygiene.

                                          BIOFORTIFICATION OF CASSAVA

The projected total cost of scaling up biofortification of yellow cassava is estimated to be $12.8
million (Meenakshi et al. 2010).14 This includes the costs of research and development, adaptive
breeding, maintenance breeding, release, and dissemination components of the intervention. It is
estimated that the DRC loses approximately 390,000 DALYs annually to vitamin A deficiency,
and that the successful adoption of yellow cassava would save between a pessimistic 3 percent and
an optimistic 32 percent of these lost DALYs each year (Meenakshi et al. 2010). Birol et al. (2014)
have provided some preliminary results of updated cost and DALY calculations for biofortified
cassava in the DRC with an estimated cost per DALY saved of between $0.40 and $1.00,
depending on the assumed reduction in DALYs lost to vitamin A deficiency. Unfortunately, no
estimations are currently possible for the number of lives saved as a result of the biofortification
of yellow cassava.


                                AFLATOXIN REDUCTION THROUGH BIOCONTROL

The total cost of scaling up aflatoxin reduction through biocontrol is estimated to be $31.43
million. The cost calculation uses the unit cost of aflasafeTM biocontrol developed by the
International Institute for Tropical Agriculture and tested in Nigeria, with a cost per hectare of
approximately $15.6, including material and distribution costs (Bandyopadhyay 2013). The crop
area calculation is based on the FAO‚Äôs 2012 projections of DRC maize and groundnut planting
area, which are estimated at 1.54 million and 477,000 hectares, respectively. For the purposes of
this exercise, it is assumed that aflasafeTM will be applied to all maize and groundnut fields.15

The cost per DALY saved for biocontrol in the DRC is between $3,806 and $2,114, which is not
considered to be cost-effective. However, biocontrol is considered the most cost-effective method
for aflatoxin control when compared with other agricultural interventions. The estimated DALYs
saved annually is between 8,260 and 14,868, depending on the assumed efficacy of the biocontrol
method (between 50 percent and 90 percent).16 Because of a lack of evidence, it was not possible
to estimate the impact of biocontrol on stunting prevalence.


                       PROMOTION OF THE WETTING METHOD FOR KONZO CONTROL

In order to control outbreaks of konzo in the four provinces in which it remains prevalent
(Bandundu, the two Kasais, and Sud-Kivu), the cost of scaling up the promotion of the wetting
method is estimated to be $4.8 million. This calculation is based on a unit cost of $10.00, which
was derived from information on pilot projects in Australian National University (2014). The

14
     This figure is the present value of costs distributed over a 30-year horizon and discounted at a 3 percent rate.
15
     Most maize is for human consumption in the DRC but some is also for other purposes. We were not able to estimate
           how many hectares produce maize for human consumption versus other purposes.
16
     DALY calculations are based on methodology derived from Khlangwiset and Wu (2011), liver cancer incidence
         data from IARC (2015), and country-specific DALY estimates from the IHME‚Äôs Global Burden of Disease
         (2010a). DALYs are assumed to lag investment by five years and are discounted at a 3 percent rate.

target population for this intervention is assumed to be food-insecure households living in the four
provinces where konzo is found .17


                                      SCHOOL-BASED DEWORMING

The cost of scaling up school-based deworming is estimated to be $1.8 million annually. Because
data for the DRC are not available, the unit cost ($0.08) used in the calculation is obtained from
regional estimates of delivery cost in schools for Ghana (Guyatt 2003), assuming treatment twice
a year. These estimates compare well with recent regional bottom-up cost analysis, based on
neglected tropical disease national plans from 36 Sub-Saharan Africa countries (Seddoh et al.
2013), which estimates the unit cost of preventive chemotherapy of five neglected tropical diseases
(lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, and soil-transmitted
helminthiasis) in the Africa region at $0.26. The major cost components for deworming are human
resources, surveillance and mapping, non-donated drugs, advocacy, infrastructure and logistics,
and implementation and management. The target population is school-aged children (6 to 19 years
old) enrolled in primary and secondary schools, and current coverage is assumed to be negligible.


                            SCHOOL-BASED PROMOTION OF GOOD HYGIENE

The annual cost of scaling up school-based promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior
is estimated to be $12.7 million. Although promoting WASH in schools normally includes
sustainable, safe water supply points, handwashing stands, and sanitation facilities, the costing of
this intervention includes only the hygiene education component. The unit cost is obtained from a
Ministry of Public Health report on the Programme Villages et √âcoles Assainis (MOH 2013), and
the unit cost for hygiene education component is estimated to be $1.18 per student and includes
the cost of capacity building, monitoring, advocacy, and social mobilization. The target population
is school-age children and the current coverage is assumed to be approximately 4 percent, based
on programmatic coverage data from the Ministry of Health (2013).


                              WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH)

The total cost of providing adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene for all households in the DRC
is estimated to be $1 billion. This high price tag reflects the overwhelming lack of WASH
infrastructure in the DRC, where an estimated 34 million people (the target population used) live
without access to clean drinking water (MOH 2013). This cost estimate is based on a unit cost of
$33 and program coverage of 7 percent, derived from data on the DRC Villages Assainis (Healthy
Villages) program in the Ministry of Health (2013). Finally, the estimated number of DALYs
saved through WASH interventions is based on the assumption that they can save between 21 and
57 percent of DALYs attributable to diarrheal diseases (DFID 2012) and DALY estimates from
17

financing for sustaining costs in communities that have already been certified to be assainis
(healthy) through the program.

           PART V ‚Äì CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Systematic costing of highly effective nutrition interventions is important for setting priorities,
mobilizing resources, and advocating. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of
lives saved, DALYs saved, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will make
the case for investment in nutrition stronger and will aid in priority-setting by identifying the most
cost-effective packages of interventions in situations where financing is constrained. This will
potentially be a powerful evidence-based advocacy tool for policy makers‚Äîfor example, it can
assist the Ministry of Finance to make efficient budget allocations because it provides useful
evidence on what the government can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (in terms of lives saved, DALYs saved , or cases of
stunting averted) given available resources.

Reaching full national coverage of the 10 nutrition-specific interventions would require $371
million. Because it is unlikely that the government or its partners can allocate these resources, we
consider strategies that make the most of the resources available. Therefore, our findings and
recommendations are based on cost-benefit analyses that can help policy makers prioritize the
allocation of resources more effectively to achieve maximum impact. The recommendations of
this report represent a compromise between the need to increase coverage and the constraints
imposed by limited resources and capacities. The most attractive scenario (3a) would scale up key
interventions in provinces with stunting rates above 40 percent at a cost per DALY saved of $48.
Scenario 3a would require an annual public investment of $185 million and would save at least 3.6
million DALYs and 44,000 lives. Scenario 3b is also attractive because it would require fewer
resources ($97 million), while also providing a cost per DALY saved of $49.

Recognizing the challenges of scaling to full coverage in one year, we estimate the investment
required to scale up over five years to be $523 million for Scenario 3a and $275 million for
Scenario 3b. These total costs for five years are significantly less than the $1.04 billion needed for
the full coverage scenario, but they still represent a significant increase over current spending on
nutrition in the DRC. An important next step will be the identification of sources of funding for
these key nutrition interventions.

Although every attempt has been made to use real programming costs for these estimates, the costs
estimated here are likely to be slight overestimates, while the benefits are likely to be
underestimated, as discussed earlier. Another limitation of the analysis is that it does not capture
differences in costs across provinces. In a large country such as the DRC, we would expect a wide
range in actual costs because they depend in part on population density, social and cultural
differences, available infrastructure, and other factors.

Even though this report focuses extensively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of
malnutrition are multisectoral, so any longer-term approach to improving nutrition outcomes must
also include nutrition-sensitive interventions. This analysis takes an innovative approach to
nutrition costing by not only estimating the costs and benefits of nutrition-specific interventions
but also considering costs of a selected number of nutrition-sensitive interventions implemented
outside of the health sector. This report explores costs and benefits for six nutrition-sensitive
interventions implemented outside of the health sector. However, the analysis presented here is
only a starting point meant to spur more analytical work to identify interventions that substantially

                                                 46
improve nutritional status. As the government continues to develop a multisectoral nutrition
policy, it would be useful to consult across sectors and ministries in order to identify other possible
nutrition-sensitive interventions that are cost-effective. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive
interventions are needed to do this.

Overall, the findings presented in this report point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific
interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a cost-effective
approach to reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in the DRC. Key next steps are for the
Government of the DRC and its partners to develop a road map of key actions and to identify
milestones in addressing undernutrition in DRC.

               APPENDIX 4: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING COSTS FOR THE DRC

The following steps lay out the methodology used to estimate costs for each intervention:

1. Describe each intervention
2. Define target populations for each intervention
3. Estimate the size of the target populations for each intervention in each province using the
   most current demographic data
4. Specify the delivery platform or channel(s) for each intervention, based on the country context
   and the accepted delivery modes
5. Identify data on the current coverage levels for each intervention in each province
6. Estimate the unit cost per beneficiary for each intervention from program experience in the
   DRC, whenever possible, and/or Africa region
7. Calculate additional costs of scaling up to full coverage by multiplying the unit cost for each
   intervention with the size of the ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù target population for each intervention by
   province. The formula for calculation is:

         Ì†µÌ±•1 = Ì†µÌ±ß1 (100 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ß2 )

where:

         x1 = additional costs of scaling up to full coverage
         z1 = unit cost per beneficiary
         z2 = current coverage level (percentage)

8. Estimate additional resources for (1) capacity development for program delivery and (2) M&E,
    operations research, and technical support, estimated at 9 percent and 2 percent of total cost of
    interventions, respectively
9. Estimate a portion of the total cost that can be covered by private household resources. It is
    assumed that households above the poverty line could cover their own cost of iron fortification,
    multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization. and complementary food from private
    resources
10. Calculate the annual public investment required to scale up these interventions to full coverage
    using the following formula:

         Ì†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•3

   where:

         Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
         Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions




                                                  53
Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which is set to 80 percent. This is consistent with World
Bank (2010) methods and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs
have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.




                                               54
                APPENDIX 5: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING DALYS FOR DRC

The following steps were undertaken to estimate the impact in DALYs averted of implementing
the various nutrition interventions:

   1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each targeted
      cause
   2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD due to each cause-risk factor combination for the target
      population
   3. Calculate the DALYs averted under current or counterfactual coverage scenario
   4. Calculate the DALYs averted under the proposed intervention coverage scenario
   5. Calculate the net DALYs averted by the proposed intervention


1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
targeted cause
To estimate the effectiveness of the interventions, key articles by Black et al. (2013) and Bhutta et
al. (2013) in the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition were first consulted. Additional
literature searches for the latest evidence were conducted in the Pubmed online database and the
Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Effectiveness figures that were
reported as statistically significant were extracted and used for the calculations.

2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD
The WHO‚Äôs 2012 Global Health Estimates (GHE 2012) data tables provide country-specific YLL
and YLD rates for each cause of death or disease (WHO 2012b). GHE 2012 morbidity and
mortality estimates were used in combination with country-specific population attributable
fractions (PAF) from the Global Burden of Disease (IHME 2010a). This assumes that the risk
factor impacts on morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between the two estimates.

To calculate the rate of morbidity and mortality from a cause due to a specific risk factor, the first
step is to calculate the PAF for the cause-risk factor combination. The PAF was extracted from the
country-specific risk factor attribution table from the 2010 GBD data. This was done separately
for YLL and YLD. In the second step, the country-specific YLLs and YLDs for the target
population‚Äîin most cases children under five years old‚Äîwere extracted from the GHE 2012
estimates. To calculate the YLL rate, the country-specific YLL is multiplied by the YLL PAF and
then by 100,000. The final figure is divided by country-specific population of interest (usually
children under five) to get the rate. The same final steps are followed to calculate the YLD,
although instead multiplying country-specific YLDs by the YLD PAF. The population estimate
for the rate calculation was extracted from GHE 2012.

         YLL per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLL * YLL_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_ population
         YLD per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLD * YLD_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_population

where:

         U-5_population = the population of children under five
                                                 55
3. Calculate counterfactual DALYs averted
To calculate the DALYs averted if current intervention coverage were maintained, the following
formula was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage *
       intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage *
       intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_current = YLL + YLD

4. Calculate total DALYs averted under intervention coverage
To calculate the potential DALYs averted under the intervention coverage, a similar formula as
above was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage *
       intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage *
       intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_intervention = YLL+YLD

5. Calculate net DALYs averted
The potential net DALYs averted by the intervention is:

       DALYs averted = DALY_intervention - DALY_current




                                              56
                     APPENDIX 6: METHODOLOGY FOR DRC LIST ESTIMATES

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is a part of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum
policy modeling system. These tools include DemProj for creating demographic projections; AIM
to model and incorporate the impact of HIV/AIDS on demographic projections and child survival
interventions; and FamPlan for incorporating changing fertility into the demographic projection.
LiST is used to project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal
survival. The table below summarizes data sources used for the DRC LiST estimates.

Once the demographic and health data have been updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for each
intervention is introduced into LiST. LiST can use either a sequential method to calculate the
impact of individual interventions or LiST can calculate the simultaneous impact of a set of
interventions implemented at the same time. The second, simultaneous method is like to yield
slightly lower estimates because interventions may have overlapping benefits. In this analysis we
present the both the individual/sequential results of the individual interventions in the ‚Äúfull
coverage‚Äù scenario (with totals calculated using the simultaneous method) and the simultaneous
impact in the various scale-up scenarios.

Note on Estimates of Cases of Stunting Averted
In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual
investment in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, we use LiST to model changes in the
prevalence of stunting over five years, during which the interventions are projected to have reached
100 percent of the target population. Next, we model changes in the prevalence of stunting over
five years with no scale-up of the interventions. We then take the difference between the estimated
stunting prevalence in Year 5 with the scale up and the prevalence in Year 5 absent a scale-up, and
multiply this percentage point difference by the total population of children under five years of
age.

Our reason for using stunting prevalence in Year 5 relates to the assumptions built into the LiST
model, which assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next time
period. As a result, stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-up,
before dropping precipitously until Year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. We
assume that continuing investments in maintaining scale after Year 5 will serve to maintain the
gains in stunting prevalence reduction, and therefore we present this reduction as the benefits
attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five- year
scale-up plan, we model this scale-up directly in LiST and use the annual results over five years
in our cost-benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate portrayal
of the direct benefits attributable to a five-year scale up plan, and it does not assume that the scale
will necessarily be maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.

                   APPENDIX 7: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the best methodology for monetizing the
value of a life saved. In this analysis, we focus solely on the economic value of a life year, which
we measure as equal to GNI per capita. Other studies attempt to estimate the social value of a life
year as well as its economic value; because we do not, we acknowledge that our results are an
underestimate of the true value of a life year saved.

Still, valuing years of life saved alone does not account for the economic benefits of reduced
morbidity, which includes the long-term, nonlethal impacts of malnutrition on individuals.
Although there are a number of long-term impacts of nutritional deficiencies, we choose to focus
on stunting because of the availability of country-specific impact estimates produced by the LiST
tool.18

In order to estimate the economic value of a case of childhood stunting averted, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), who begin by assuming that stunted individuals lose
an average of 66 percent of lifetime earnings, based on direct estimates of the impact of stunting
in early life on later life outcomes found in Hoddinott et al. (2011).19 This estimate for the effects
of stunting on future consumption is used as a proxy for the effect of stunting on lifetime earnings.
Additionally, Hoddinott et al. (2013) account for uncertainty by assuming that only 90 percent of
the total gains will be realized, which we also include in our calculations. However, unlike those
authors, we adjust our calculations to reflect the country‚Äôs labor force participation rate.

For both lives saved and cases of stunting averted, the benefits of a five-year scale-up plan are
attributed to a group of children that is assumed to enter the labor force at age 15 and exit the labor
force at age 49, which is equivalent to life expectancy at birth in Mali. Benefits from both stunting
and lives saved are then multiplied by a lifetime discount factor (LDF) in order to obtain the present
value of benefits incurred during the expected years of productivity (years between the age of entry
into and exit from the workforce). The LDF is derived from three potential discount rates (3
percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent), an adjustment for age at the time of investment (for simplicity,
we assume an average age of two years for all children), and the years of lifetime productivity
expected. The LDF represents the years of productivity that are ‚Äúcounted‚Äù in the calculation,
discounted back to their present value in the year in which the investment in nutrition is made.
Because we assume an average age of two years for all beneficiaries, we use an LDF that assumes
that these children will enter the labor force 13 years from the time of investment. Importantly,
given the time frame considered under this analysis, we do not attempt to account for projected
growth in the country‚Äôs GDP and per capita incomes. This downward bias contributes to the
conservative nature of our estimates.



18
     It should be noted that because stunting is just one of many long-term consequences of poor nutrition, actual
        economic benefits of improving nutrition may be much higher than estimated here.
19
     Hoddinott et al. (2011) provided direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life outcomes, which
       found that an individual stunted at age 36 months had, on average, 66 percent lower per capita consumption over
       his or her productive life.

                                                             59
The following equations are used to estimate (1) the economic value of lives saved (reduced
mortality) and (2) increased future productivity (reduced morbidity):



   1. Present value of reduced mortality = (lives saved attributable to intervention scale-up)
           *(GNI per capita) * LDF

   2. Present value of reduced morbidity = (cases of child stunting averted)
          * (coefficient of a deficit) * (percent of income actually realized) * (GNI per capita)
          * (LDF)

where:

   ‚Ä¢     Lives saved attributable to the intervention scale-up are estimated using the LiST tool.
   ‚Ä¢     Cases of child stunting averted are calculated by subtracting the projected under-five
         stunting prevalence (%) after the interventions are scaled up calculated by LiST from the
         projected stunting prevalence under a scenario with no scale up and multiplying it by the
         total under-five population.
   ‚Ä¢     The coefficient of deficit is equal to the reduction in lifetime earnings attributable to
         stunting.
   ‚Ä¢     The lifetime discount factor (LDF) is used to discount future benefits to their value at the
         time of investment. It is derived from a discount rate, age at the time of investment and
         the estimated age of entry and exit into the workforce. The equation used to calculate the
         LDF is:



                         Ì†µÌ±°=Ì†µÌ±á
                                    1

                                 (1 + Ì†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°
                        Ì†µÌ±°=13



         where:

         LDF = the lifetime discount factor
           r = is the discount rate
           t = the time period since the initial investment in scaling up the interventions (we
           assume that children are 2 years old at the time of investment and enter the labor
           force at 15 years old, which is reflected in the starting value for t)
           T = the last time period before individuals exit the labor force (we assume individuals
           are out of the workforce at life expectancy at birth)




                                                  60
Note, the beginning time period t and ending period T is adjusted for each cohort based on the year
of investment. For example, the first cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=13
and exit at time T, the second cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=14 and
exit at time T+1, and so forth.

where c is the cohort group and t is the time period.

Finally, the annual addition to economic productivity is measured by taking the total economic
benefits for the year in which all beneficiaries of the initial one-year investment have reached
productive age. These benefits are not discounted back to their present value, as they are
considered the annual opportunity cost of not investing in scaling up nutrition interventions. It
should be noted that these benefits are derived from a progressive, five-year scale-up plan, and
therefore subsequent investments that maintain the target scale will increase the total annual
benefits as new beneficiaries are reached.

This paper builds on global experience and the DRC‚Äôs specific context to identify an effective nutrition approach
along with costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the selection of the most
cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The paper considers both relevant
‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions, largely delivered through the health sector, and multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-
sensitive‚Äù interventions, delivered through other sectors such as agriculture, education, and water and sanitation.
We estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all provinces of the
DRC would require a yearly public investment of $371 million. The expected benefits are enormous: annually
over 5.4 million DALYs and over 76,000 lives would be saved, while at least 1 million cases of stunting among
children under five would be averted. Economic productivity could potentially increase by $591 million annually
over the productive lives of the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 13.6 percent. However,
because it is unlikely that the Government of the DRC or its partners will find the $371 million necessary to reach
full coverage, we also consider scale-up scenarios based on considerations of their potential for impact, burden
of stunting, resource requirements, and implementation capacity. The most cost-effective scenario considered
would provide a subset of key interventions in provinces with the highest rates of stunting and would cost
between $97 and $185 million depending on how many provinces are covered. We then identify and cost six
nutrition-sensitive interventions relevant to the DRC and for which there are both evidence of positive impact on
nutrition outcomes and some cost information. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific
interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective
approach to reducing child malnutrition in the DRC.

Executive Summary
The national and state governments in India have committed to transforming how water
resources are managed in the country. The critical needs are: (i) improved water resource
assessments; (ii) rationalization of water supplies; (iii) improved service delivery; (iv)a robust
national hydro-informatics system; (v) institutional reform of central agencies; and
(vi) improvements in professional human resources and infrastructure.

The objective of this trust funded activity was to support this transformation by strengthening the
capacity of institutions within the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), River Development
and Ganga Rejuvenation (RD&GR) for sustainable water resources management, including
through international training that provided exposure to innovative techniques for water
resources management. The activity not only filled key capacity gaps and strengthened key
institutions to tackle emerging challenges in the water sector, but also triggered national reforms
and contributed to the design of the National Hydrology Project (NHP).

The activity benchmarked four MoWR, RD&GR institutions against international standards and
introduced a tool for benchmarking Water User Associations (WUAs) to strengthen participatory
irrigation management. The activity introduced advanced geophysical techniques for
groundwater management and training, and ran workshops that trained 700 state and central
agency engineers in modern hydromet, flood management and river basin techniques. Key
activity outcomes (amongst many) are summarized below.

National water institutes benchmarked and ready to drive a reform agenda. A major
outcome is the availability of framework to strengthen capacity of national institutions to work
collaboratively with state agencies. The reports with action plan include strengthening Human
Resource (HR) reforms and training programs of the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), the
National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), the Central Soil and Materials Research Station
(CSMRS), and the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS). This guided budget
allocations under the 12th Five Year Plan (FYP, 2012-17) for long-term international exposure
and training needs. These institutes systematically evaluated their own performance by
benchmarking against international best practices and standards. The organizational
improvement recommendations from this benchmarking were approved by the committee to the
12th FYP. MoWR, RD&GR now plans to upgrade these institutes into centers of excellence.
Organizational development has commenced in some institutions and MoWR, RD&GR is
developing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) for long-term capacity building programs with
internationally recognized institutes.

Web based e-tool for benchmarking WUAs (www.wua.aquiferindia.org). To further boost
and scale-up participatory irrigation management, a standardized web-based tool for
benchmarking WUAs was developed and adopted. This enables benchmarking of WUAs across
the country against various parameters. This tool will contribute to strengthening not only
existing WUAs but also help establish new groups where needed. This work was undertaken in
collaboration with the Indian Network on Participatory Irrigation Management.

State-of-the-art technology for groundwater mapping and modelling. While the feasibility of
these technologies was established through the World Bank funded Hydrology Project Phase II

                                                7
(HP2) in six pilot areas, under the trust fund activity experts from the United States Geological
Survey (USGS) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) guided the actual introduction
of these innovative techniques for groundwater investigations, analysis of field data, and for
modelling. The activity also launched formal training programs on these techniques. This helped
MoWR, RD&GR develop the methodology for the National Program of Aquifer Mapping under
the 12th FYP.

Tools for monitoring and assessing the impacts of irrigation projects. The activity supported
the use of remotely sensed data to assess impacts of irrigation schemes. The prior practice of
collecting field data for the assessment of baseline and current agricultural status via
questionnaires provided only limited impact assessment. This activity developed and piloted a
model to supplement the traditional impact assessment processes using remote sensing to
evaluate land use and land cover changes following project implementation.

Real-time hydromet and flood forecasting. The training and guidance provided under this
activity enabled the introduction of real-time hydromet and flood forecasting systems in over
half a dozen states under HP. The activity supported international training programs and
workshops for the benefit of a large number of trainees. The training resources and knowledge
products are available online (www.indiawrm.org) for wider usage.

River basin approach for scoping and design of the national HP. The activity ‘set the stage’
for a pan-India reform agenda influencing all stakeholders across all major river basins of the
country. It directly increased awareness on the need for a strategic basin planning approach to
water resources planning and development, including in multi-state and multi-country basins,
that promotes leadership, knowledge generation and sharing and innovative management tools.
This led to the request for NHP, which aims to extend water resource management applications
developed in Southern India across all river basins in the country. Without this trust fund
activity, the introduction of real-time and evidence based-decision support tools involving
multiple stakeholders would not have been possible.

Background
India’s water resources, considered abundant in 1950, are now under stress given a three-fold
increase in population since that year. A proliferation of tubewells has led to unsustainable
extraction of groundwater for irrigation, and lowering of water tables, particularly in north-west
India. In some river basins (for example, the Pennar and Kanyakumari), annual water availability
is as low as 240 cubic meter (m3) per person. Many more river basins are expected to become
water scarce in the near future. Limited availability of water is constraining India’s ability to
meet the water supply, industrial and agriculture needs of a growing population. The 12th FYP
recognizes water availability as a key constraint on economic growth.

The total national water demand has been predicted to increase from 656 to 1,059 km3 by 2050;
the total (surface and ground) water availability is 1,123 km3. Currently, 78 percent of water use
is in agriculture. This is expected to decrease to 72 percent by 2025 and 65-68 percent by 2050,
mainly because of greater increases in demand from domestic and industrial sectors. The 12th
FYP emphasizes the need for improved assessment of water resources, particularly groundwater,
through aquifer mapping, formation of a National Water Commission, rationalization of water
provision through a new water framework and legal setup for groundwater, mechanisms to
improve services delivery (irrigation water and energy), and development of a monitoring
system.

World Bank-funded projects are also addressing some of these key interventions. At the central
level, HP2 provided technical support by strengthening the capacity of institutes and laying the
foundation for a modern hydrological information system including piloting of decision support
tools for water resources planning and management in selected river basins. World Bank-funded
water restructuring projects in various states are adopting an integrated approach supported by
regulatory frameworks and participatory irrigation management, including modernization of
irrigation schemes. Projects involving institutional and/or infrastructure reforms were
constrained by limited technical capacity in central and state agencies.

MoWR, RD&GR sets national policy and allocates funding to states according to certain criteria.
States are responsible for program implementation and development of state water policy. The
central institutes of MoWR, RD&GR, including the Central Water Commission (CWC) and
CGWB, provide technical guidance to state agencies on project design and planning, and project
monitoring. The national and state governments have committed to transforming how water
resources are managed. However, strengthening of central institutes is required to improve
service delivery to states and to enable adoption of a river basin approach. Key capacity gaps
stem from a lack of awareness of and experience in modern and innovative approaches.

Project Objective, Budget and Beneficiaries
The project development objective was to strengthen the capacity of various institutions in
MoWR, RD&GR for sustainable water resources management and to develop training tools for
innovative techniques for further dissemination to state agencies and other stakeholders. The
activity was supported by US$2.00 million grant from the Department for International
Development (DFID) India Trust Fund. Following a revision in scope, actual expenditure was
US$1.41 million. Expenditure details are provided in Annex 4.2.

                                                9
The main project beneficiaries were MoWR, RD&GR and central institutions under this
ministry. Specific central institutes strengthened by the project included CGWB, NIH, CSMRS,
and the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS). In addition to the staff of four
benchmarked institutes, over 700 central and state government engineers/scientists received
training in innovative water management techniques and technologies.

Project Achievements
The activity included benchmarking of four central institutes against international standards,
introduction of an e-tool for benchmarking WUAs, introduction of an innovative approach for
advance geophysical techniques in groundwater management, and training of 700 engineers from
central and state agencies in hydromet, flood management and river basin planning. The main
achievements (against agreed indicator targets) are summarized in Table 1 and described
subsequently by component.

Component A: Strengthening of National Institutes
This component was designed to strengthen regulatory authorities, river basin organizations, and
WUAs. However, MoWR, RD&GR focused effort on strengthening national technical institutes
and requested the benchmarking of four institutions. The activity was unable to pursue the
planned study on regulatory authorities because MoWR, RD&GR was already working on river
basin institutions and the water law framework. The final achievements of this component are
described below.

Benchmarking of National Institutes
The institutes benchmarked (CGWB, NIH, CSMRS and CWPRS) were assessed against
international standards and assessments were approved by MoWR, RD&GR. On the basis of the
assessment, the Ministry decided to upgrade the institutes to “centers of excellence? (see
pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=122281).

The activity funded international and national experts to review current practices and
infrastructure and to benchmark against international standards. The assessments focused not
only on capacity building but also on reform of staffing and training plans. The benchmarking
reports were finalized in consultation with the core team of the respective institutions and then
approved by Ministry. This provided a clear mandate for the respective institutes to prepare and
process implementation plans under the 12th FYP. Recommendations included short- and long-
term measures. Short-term recommendations focused on strengthening infrastructure and
training; long-term measures focused on empowering institutes and on staff reforms. The
recommendations for adoption of new methods, new lines of research and for new equipment are
summarized in Annex 6.



                                                11
CGWB was benchmarked against USGS. Recommendations included an upgrade to state-of-the-
art international standards, focusing on providing solutions through research and development,
and outsourcing of routine activities. Short-term recommendations related to organizational
issues and included empowering regional directors, improving communication between
headquarters and regional offices, and constitution of an interagency team to prioritize activities.
Recommendations were also made for improving monitoring networks through standardized
field procedures and public near real-time data sharing. Long-term recommendations related to
organizational issues such as the formation of an interagency group to evaluate the CGWB
mandate and benchmarking of regional offices. It was recommended that monitoring networks
and chemical laboratories should conduct groundwater assessments and provide solutions to
specific regional groundwater problems, including via artificial recharge techniques or by
through the use of geophysical techniques for aquifer mapping.

NIH benchmarking led to the preparation of a development plan to improve facilities, equipment,
buildings, scientific manpower, in order to transform the institute into a leading international
hydrology institution.

Benchmarking of CSMRS considered manpower, equipment and capacity building as well as an
assessment of the expected future workload. It was recommended that once equipment and
capacity were upgraded, a complete re-organization of the institute should be undertaken.

The benchmarking for CWPRS revealed tremendous potential. In order to meet the high national
demand for water-related infrastructure, CWPRS must continue to support experimental research
and development of numerical models. There is an urgent need for major capital investment at
CWPRS to meet the challenges identified in the 12th FYP. The development of water and power
resources emerged as a key national priority.

Benchmarking of CWC was not undertaken under the activity as this had been completed
already. Instead, the activity exposed CWC to advanced flood forecasting techniques. CWC is
the national agency mandated to forecast floods and provide support to states as India loses about
5 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) every year to flood damage. Flood damage can
be reduced through improved forecasting and early warning systems. CWC’s practice was to
issue forecasts based solely on upstream river levels; this approach has little value in small river
basins as lead times are too short for a meaningful response. Training and expert advice from
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR, USA) exposed CWC and state agencies to
long lead-time forecasting based on medium range ensemble weather forecasts. Under HP2, two
river basins (Bhakra and Krishna) have adopted advanced forecasting techniques. Recently,
CWC upgraded forecasting in one river basin following major floods in Northern India. Under
the National Hydrology Project (NHP), CWC and the states will adopt improved forecasting
India-wide.

River Basin Assessments

Initially, the activity supported the development of Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for river
basin planning and management under HP2. DSSs were set up for 13 river basins and Integrated
Water Resource Management (IWRM) training from international experts for these basins was


                                                12
provided. The experts also worked with the states to develop models and standards to progress
IWRM in other river basins.

It is increasingly recognized in India, at central and state levels that water management lacks a
basin-wide approach to water planning and allocation. A more strategic approach is required as
the demand for water from multiple sectors increases. A strategic basin planning effort is under
way for the NHP with a focus on DSSs for modelling and analysis, combined with multi-
stakeholder engagement and capacity building of government agencies at multiple levels. All
these have been catalyzed by workshops supported under this trust-funded activity (see Annex
1).

The activity supported workshops in September 2014 involving all state water resources
departments with international experts covering aspects of IWRM applications including
advances in hydro-meteorological instrumentation and modern tools and techniques for water
resources planning and management. The knowledge resources and proceedings from these
workshops have been shared at www.indiawrm.org/Masterworkshops.aspx.

Framework for WUA Benchmarking

The National Water Policy, 12th FYP and National Water Mission comprehensive mission
documents indicate that Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) through WUAs as the
preferred approach for equitable and optimal use of irrigation water. A gradual reduction in
government involvement in irrigation management requires a corresponding increase and
broadening of the involvement of farmers to ensure better performance in irrigated agriculture.
PIM has been actively promoted by state Water and Land Management Institutes (WALMIs), by
World Bank-funded water resources consolidation and restructuring projects and by the Indian
Network on Participatory Irrigation Management (India NPIM). India NPIM has the mandate to
provide standard PIM tools and practices. The trust-funded activity developed web-based e-tools
for standardizing WUA monitoring and for maintaining a national WUA database. It is
anticipated that India NPIM will coordinate with WALMIs and will encourage them to use these
online tools including database verification by district-level data administrators.

The web-based e-tool records WUA details and supports WUA benchmarking. The website
provides a transparent database to help WUAs understand their strengths and weaknesses. WUA
benchmarking is being used not only to strengthen existing PIM groups but also to help establish
new groups. The e-tool is being tested in the Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project 2
(UPWSRP2) and West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project
(WBADMI) projects but could support all irrigation projects to facilitate cross-WUA learning to
improve WUA performance.

Strong participatory hydrological monitoring by WUAs has been recognized as a means to
improve water use efficiency and demand side management, and to ensure Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) of all investments. The activity piloted scheme-wise data analysis, water
audits and improved cropping, to help WUAs use local evidence for decision making, especially
before the Rabi (dry) season for crop selection based on estimated water budgets.

Component B: Improved Groundwater Assessment

The activity supported in development of protocols for the National Project on Aquifer Mapping
(NAQUIM) that MoWR, RD&GR introduced during the 12th FYP. The pilot program tested
advanced ground-based and heliborne techniques for the first time in India, Under HP2, six pilot
watersheds were selected to test advanced geophysical techniques and to develop an
implementation plan for NAQUIM based on the following support:
   Guidance from USGS experts on integration of ground-based and heliborne measurements;
   Guidance from MIT modelling expert on improved hydro-geological modelling;
   Advanced training in borehole and surface geophysics for improved groundwater
     assessment. These tools have been adopted by Word Bank-funded projects including
     UPWSRP2 and WBADMI.
   Analysis of the challenges and advantages of geophysical methods for aquifer mapping in
     India (see Annex 1.3) based on Global practices.

             Figure 2: Training on Borehole Geophysics for Groundwater by USGS

The software introduced in training supported data integration for pilot aquifer mapping.
WBADMI now plans to conduct geophysical investigations to test the feasibility of groundwater
schemes. Further training in these techniques is planned.

The pilot NAQUIM explored heliborne Transient Electro-Magnetic (TEM) geophysical surveys
for aquifer mapping, and established the utility and efficacy of these techniques in different
hydro-geological settings. The pilot demonstrated the suitability of heliborne surveys to expedite
national aquifer mapping. Preliminary assessments indicated the efficacy of the technique for
alluvial aquifers. As demonstrated elsewhere, heliborne geophysical surveys have a high
observation density compared with traditional survey techniques and allow the development of
more accurate three dimensional groundwater models for improved assessment of groundwater
availability and for detailed investigation of groundwater management options.

Component C: Trainings and Workshops
Training workshops were conducted under this component covering: (i) real-time hydrological
information systems; (ii) M&E of on-going irrigation projects; (iii) surface and subsurface
geophysical techniques; and (iv) improved long lead-time flood forecasting. (See Annex 1 for a
list of training workshops delivered under the component.). The activity facilitated within-

                                               15
country training workshops using international experts. The knowledge resources used were
converted into web-based training resources and made widely accessible for virtual learning. In
total, the project trained 700 professional in various innovative and modern water planning and
management practices and tools.

The Real-time Data Acquisition System (RTDAS) training was very effective as participants
were able to apply learnings immediately for system installations under HP2. Adoption post-
training of the advanced groundwater geophysics methods varied according to the capacity of
participants and state-level availability of the necessary equipment. Some participants quickly
adopted the new techniques while others first need to procure equipment and may require
additional training. Similarly, the effectiveness of the long-lead forecasting training varied; it
was most useful for a few advanced modelers. Some of the training courses delivered under the
activity have been continued under other programs, while others could be continued with
additional funding.

Real-time Hydrological Information Systems

Under HP2, real-time hydrological information systems were introduced at scale for the first
time in India. To learn from international experience, two training events with international
experts were conducted and direct support provided in some states. The activity also supported
the

introduction of irrigation monitoring and operation systems in World Bank-funded irrigation
projects. This was complemented by a workshop where vendors from all around the world show-
cased products and services. This workshop enabled articulation of the specific needs and
activity scope for the participating states and central agencies in NHP.

Monitoring and Evaluation of Irrigation Projects
In recent decades, irrigated areas under irrigation projects have been declining, raising concerns
within the central government. To understand the causes for the decline, the activity supported
analysis of remote sensing data for irrigation scheme M&E. During UPWSRP1, this approach
was used during Implementation Completion and Results report to assess project impact, using
freely available NASA and USGS imagery. Traditionally, agencies in India have relied on
national imagery and were not well versed in the use of global imagery. Training was provided
to the Uttar Pradesh State Remote Sensing Center (UPRSAC) under UPWSRP2 to enable the
center to assess baseline agricultural practices of the proposed irrigated command, understanding
of the phenology of crops using temporal (free or low-cost) imageries. Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived maps were used to analyze head, middle and tail-
end of the command area. Landsat and AWiFS data were used to evaluate land use and land
cover changes before and after project implementation. This work demonstrated the potential of
remotely sensed data for determining cropping intensity and spatial-temporal variations in
cropping pattern and crop dynamics. The resultant geospatial datasets for agricultural
intensification and crop dynamics provided a new dimension to irrigation project impact
assessment, by considering issues relating to food security and climate at local, and regional
scales.

Flood Forecasting
Week-long training events on the Climate Forecasting Applications for Bangladesh (CFAB)
project issued operational flood forecasts for Bangladesh over a wide range of time scales. This
provides advanced warning of severe flood stage across the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins.
Training was tailored to impart a fully-automated short-range (one to10 day) probabilistic
forecast using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble
weather forecasts, near-real-time NASA TRMM and NOAA CMORPH satellite-derived
precipitation estimates, NOAA CPC-GTS rain gauge-based precipitation estimates and near-real-
time discharge estimates from the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC). It
was shown how these data sets can be used in conjunction with statistical analysis of weather and
discharge forecasts, together with a multi-model hydrological modeling approach. Accurate
short-term (seven-day) forecasts are being used successfully in Krishna and Upper Bhima basins.

Approach was shared with the Flood Forecasting Center at CWC to guide discussion on
improving flood forecasting centrally. Opportunities exist to integrate extended range ensemble
climate forecasts with the river flow forecasting techniques. CWC recognizes the opportunity and
is working on introducing the approach into its forecast system. This work is now in progress
under the South Asia Water Initiative Trust Fund to further apply the approach in the
Brahmaputra Basin; there is also a proposal by CWC and other agencies to upscale the work
under NHP. This will require advanced modelling skills and climatology training. Under NHP,
the intent is to partner with the Indian Meteorological Department which would verify forecasts.

Lessons Learned and Next Steps
The lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
 1. Recipient-executed grants can be slow. Initially, this activity was designed as a recipient
     executed grant. However, this delayed the activity for two years. As a World Bank-
     executed activity, implementation was simpler and faster.
 2. Accessing international expertise is critical. This expertise helped MoWR, RD&GR
     quickly and efficiently assess its own needs for support of national programs, and
     motivated it to initiate longer-term MoUs with international institutes. The international
     training was cost-effective, customizable, and ensured participation of appropriate trainees.
 3. Linking to lending operations is cost effective. Training events were linked to ongoing
     World Bank-funded projects and local logistics were supported by these projects. This was
     cost effective as the trust fund grant simply funded engagement of international experts,
     which is difficult for the client to arrange.

                                               19
 4. Renting equipment for training can be used when procurement is slow. Some training
    events were delayed as they depended upon procurement of equipment through lending
    operations; this was resolved by renting the required equipment.
 5. Technical assistance can catalyze progress in World Bank-funded projects. Providing
    support for technical innovations and preparation of technical proposals through the trust-
    funded activity proved a good means to accelerate progress in lending operations.
 6. River basin planning and extended range flood forecasting are crucial for India. The
    training and trials of river basin planning and long-lead flood forecasting demonstrated
    huge potential and were very well accepted by CWC. The NHP will focus strongly on these
    aspect of IWRM for improving water resource management across the country.

Overall, the activity greatly increased the awareness of water resources management needs in
India, leading to the NHP proposal. The recommendations and successes from the project are
also guiding aspect of the South Asian Water Initiative. Some other technical assistance activities
have also been established to continue the work commenced.

Annex 6: Summary of Benchmarking report of MoWR, RD&GR Institutes
1.1 Central Groundwater Board
The report benchmarks the methodologies, practices, equipment, and training of CGWB against
the state-of-the-art international practice. The USGS Water Resources Division was chosen as
the international benchmark institute because of its similar mission and its international
reputation as a world leader in groundwater monitoring, investigations and research. The
benchmarking involved reviewing six key CGWB activities: hydrogeological investigations
(including monitoring, assessment, hydro-chemical studies, artificial recharge, database
management, and proposals and publications); groundwater exploration; groundwater modeling;
geophysical techniques; and the recently initiated NAQUIM. Where gaps were identified,
recommendations and capacity building needs (training and equipment) were described. To help
CGWB prioritize recommendations, an implementation schedule was developed.
Recommendations included:

   1. CGWB should transition from a monitoring and resource development organization to an
       applied research organization.
   2. MoWR, RD&GR should appoint an expert panel to advice on reorganization of CGWB
       and capacity enhancement.
   3. Non-technical assignments and the public outreach program should be outsourced.
   4. Four additional referral laboratories and a central laboratory in New Delhi should be
       established.
   5. Four centers of excellence should be established: (i) unsaturated zone research and
       groundwater modelling; (ii) remote sensing and GIS; (iii) managed aquifer recharge
       using storm-water/treated wastewater; and (iv) arsenic remediation.
   6. Regional Director positions should be upgraded to Commissioner/ Chief Engineers.
   7. Delegation of authority to the Chairman, Members, Regional Directors and Executive
       Engineers.
   8. Establish a separate Project Management Unit exclusively for implementation of
       NAQUIM project with adequate delegation of financial authority and necessary
       infrastructure.
   9. Constitute an empowered committee for hiring staff needed for the NAQUIM project.
   10. Continue with pilot project(s) to disseminate technical knowledge on design for different
       conservation and recharge structures.

1.2 National Institute of Hydrology
The review revisits the original mission, objectives and scientific operation of NIH. It shows that
although NIH is engaged in a broad range of activities, its objectives should be revisited from
time to time and should evolve to remain relevant. The benchmarking included review of
objectives, lessons learnt for NIH upgrading, benchmarking process, review of selected institutes
and content for benchmarking. The purpose is identify how to transform NIH into a world-class
center of excellence in hydrology. The lessons learnt from the review of benchmarking
institutions are that the benchmark Institutions:
    1. Have a large pool of scientists and support staff while NIH has a very limited pool.
    2. Enjoy much greater autonomy leading to higher efficiency and greater productivity.
    3. Place greater emphasis on interdisciplinary water resources/environmental/ecological
         research than NIH.
                                                28
   4. Emphasize a greater blend of basic and applied research than NIH.
   5. Have collaborations at International as well as national.

The report then discusses content benchmarking, including an assessment of the status of NIH in
comparison with international benchmarks and an identification of research gaps. It was
concluded that NIH would be well served if:
   1. It had four extra divisions: database management; hydrologic modeling; vadose zone
       hydrology, and hydrometeorology.
   2. NIH expanded its research in water quality and eco-hydrology, agricultural pollution,
       industrial and highway pollution, river pollution, ecosystem hydrology, snow and glacial
       hydrology, impact of climate change on floods and droughts, urban / peri-urban
       hydrology, water-food-energy-health nexus, and uncertainty and risk analyses.
   3. Basic research and development of tools and techniques was increased.
   4. Its scientists communicated their research findings and discoveries more broadly in India.

1.3 Central Soil and Material Research Station
The CSMRS is a well-regarded national institution dealing with soils and materials in water
resources development activities. CSMRS’s unique services are increasingly in demand, with
dams and other hydro-electric projects under construction or envisaged in complex and
challenging geological and geo-technical settings. The seismic activity of the region warrants
dynamic material characterization for the state of the art designs. Projects across the region (for
example, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar) look to CSMRS for field testing, soil and rock
characterization, and estimation of construction material availability. India’s planned water
resources programs and projects call for substantial application of CSMRS research. To meet
these demands CSMRS must enhance staff capacity, training and equipment. The institutional
strengthening requirements of CSMRS were assessed by a team of international experts. The
review report by the National Apex Committee provides an action plan based on the contents of
the expert’s report that benchmarked CSMRS against similar institutions. the Committee
considered the workload expected in the years ahead to ensure a long-term plan. Staff capacity,
training and equipment were examined separately and collectively.

1.4 Central Water and Power Research Station
The status of CWPRS has been severely affected by several factors. Firstly, investment in
research infrastructure has been minimal since its substantial UNDP support ended in 1998.
Secondly, the number of sanctioned positions was reduced to 1,857 in 2001 to 1,172 in 2012.
Thirdly, the benefit of continued interaction with peer institutions and leading scientists has been
limited by restrictions on international and national travel. The report made many
recommendations including on: (i) collaborations with other research/academic institutes; (ii)
increasing the number of international/national publications; and (iii) upgrading the CWPRS
webpage. The major recommendations from the benchmarking of CWPRS were:

   1. Prioritize national water-related infrastructure: with excellent research staff and facilities,
      and adequate central funding, the CWPRS mandate should focus on meeting national
      challenges.
   2. Renovate existing buildings: renovation of 12 buildings in disrepair is a top priority;
      continuous power is also required.


                                                29
3. Upgrade laboratories and large facilities. Large-scale laboratory facilities should become
    one of the most important CWPRS assets, and can eventually provide a competitive edge
    over peer institutions around the world.
4. Construct two new buildings: a Center for Eco-hydraulic Research, and a Welcome
    Center with Administrative Services.
5. Build new facilities for emerging research areas: tsunamis, eco-hydraulics, thermal
    process and vibration technology.
6. Focus on environmental issues. This may be the most daunting challenge facing CWPRS
    and India. As much as CWPRS has focused on public safety in large infrastructure
    design, a new emphasis should be placed on environmental issues.
7. Seek autonomous status without changing the seven main CWPRS disciplines.
8. Recruit 200 new research officers and an appropriate number of support staff to assist
    them.
9. Hire and retain the best. CWPRS should have the authority to hire staff and the authority
    to dismiss non-performing staff. The responsibility of CWPRS engineers and scientists
    designing water infrastructure for public safety should be recognized.
10. Increase the budget. An absolute minimum of INR 90 crores (US$18,000,000) is required
    for the investment in research infrastructure, facilities, research equipment, computers
    and software. An increase in the operational budget of INR 20 crore should be added
    each year to support and train an increasing number of research officers and support staff.

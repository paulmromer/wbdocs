I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Yemen perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Yemen regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Yemen;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Yemen;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               project/program related issues, knowledge work and activities, and
               communication and information sharing in Yemen; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Yemen.
       Use data to help inform Yemen country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
From February to April 2014, stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Yemen were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Paper questionnaires were sent to 100 potential respondents and online questionnaires
were sent to 500 potential respondents. Of those, 41 paper questionnaires were completed (41%
response rate) and 255 online questionnaires were completed (51% response rate). Potential
respondents were initially contacted via email and completed questionnaires either with a
representative of the fielding agency (paper questionnaires) or online.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Yemen; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Yemen; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing in Yemen. In addition, every country that engages in the Country Survey
must include specific indicator questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual
Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Yemen: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Yemen is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty, which areas
   would contribute most to generating economic growth, and what would best achieve “shared
   prosperity? in Yemen.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Yemen, WBG staff preparedness, the
   effectiveness of its activities, to what extent it should provide capacity building support to
   certain groups, the importance and effectiveness of the WBG’s current capacity building
   work, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to
   which it is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the WBG to focus its resources, the
   WBG’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses, its most effective instruments, with which
   stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, if the WBG should have more or less
   of a local presence in Yemen, and to what they attributed slowed or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent
   to which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Yemen, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Yemen’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the extent
   to which the WBG helps strengthen existing country systems, the extent to which the WBG’s
   internal evaluation mechanisms hold it accountable for achieving results, and the importance
   of the WBG’s involvement and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty-six
   development areas. Respondents were also asked to indicate if WBG decisions regarding its
   Yemen program were made primarily in country or at Headquarters.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG knowledge work and to rate the quality of the
   WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which various
   aspects of the WBG’s technical assistance work contribute to solving Yemen’s development
   challenges, the extent to which the WBG is adequately staffed in Yemen, and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG. Respondents were
   also asked to indicate if the WBG operates with too much risk.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Yemen: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Yemen, which of its services the
   WBG should offer more of in Yemen, and which development areas would benefit most for
   the WBG playing a leading role versus other donors playing a leading role in Yemen.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   WBG’s websites. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank Group as a result of the WBG’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked to evaluate the WBG’s information accessibility and
   responsiveness to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they currently collaborate with the WBG, with which WBG agencies
   they work, their exposure to the WBG in Yemen, and their geographic location.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
       A majority of respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister
        indicated that they attribute failed or slow reform efforts to the WBG not being sensitive

        academia indicated that they attribute it to ongoing conflict and instability. A majority of
        respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and other organizations
        indicated that they attribute it to the National Unity Government working inefficiently.
        A majority of respondents from NGOs/private foundations and CBOs indicated that they
        attribute it to there not being an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation.
       Respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG were significantly more likely to
        indicate that they attribute failed or slow reform efforts to an inadequate level of
        citizen/civil society participation and political pressures/obstacles compared to
        respondents who collaborate with the WBG.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Yemen, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Yemen. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at sanitation.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Yemen, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at sanitation; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at social cohesion.

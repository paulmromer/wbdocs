   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   •   Share of employers in self-employed remains low in Turkey at 13 percent compared to
       the EU average of 28 percent.

   •   Gender composition varies significantly across different categories of self-employment
       in Turkey with females constituting 7 percent of employers and 76 percent of unpaid
       family workers.

   •   Share of female employers in total employers increased from 4.82 percent in 2004 to
       7.39 percent in 2012.

   •   Female employers are relatively less represented in high value added sectors such as
       construction and manufacturing.

   •   Female owned businesses tend to have smaller firm size than male owned business.

   •   Share of female employers in the informal economy decreased from 29.10 percent in
       2004 to 20.80 in 2012.

   •   90 percent of female OAW and about 60 percent of male OAW remained informal
       during 2004-2012.

   •   At 23 percent, a significant and equal share of employers from either sex has majored
       in business and management. However, there is also gender segregation in choice of
       majors, with male employers majoring in engineering and female employers majoring
       in health.

   •   Education, especially higher education increases the probability of becoming an
       employer and its effect is higher for females.

   •   Having small children decreases the probability of being an employer for females while
       it increases the probability of being an employer for males.

   •   Being female decreases the odds of looking for work as an entrepreneur by 50 percent
       over a paid employee among the unemployed.

Table 4 summarizes the effects of variables of interest on the likelihood of being an
employer or an OAW over being inactive/unemployed for working age population and on
the likelihood wanting to be an employer over a paid employee in unemployed population.

Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends


1. INTRODUCTION
1. Over a century ago, Schumpeter (1911) described the entrepreneur as a creative, driven
individual who finds “new combinations of [factors] of production” to develop a new product,
corner a new market, or design a new technology and he famously attributed endogenous
development to the creative acts associated with entrepreneurial activity.

2. Understanding female entrepreneurship is important for three important reasons. First, as
noted by Schumpeter (1911), entrepreneurship has an important role in the development
process and paying attention to only male entrepreneurs ignores economic growth potential
of half the population. Second, female led micro and small enterprises can have a more
significant impact on overall household welfare and consumption than their male led
counterparts. Women entrepreneurs and heads of households tend to spend more on
household health, nutrition and education than men (Nichter and Goldmark, 2009). Third,
understanding female entrepreneurship is important to promote gender equity in labor
markets. Increasing female entrepreneurship not only increases the number of female
employers but also female employees in the labor market since female entrepreneurs tend to
employ proportionately more females than male headed firms (Nichter and Goldmark, 2009).

3. This paper contributes to our understanding of female entrepreneurship in Turkey by
analyzing the patterns and characteristics of female entrepreneurs and examining time trends
in entrepreneurial activity. Our data on entrepreneurs comes from data on employers and
own account workers available in nationally representative Turkish Household Labor Force
Surveys of 2004-2012 (HLFS 2004-2012, TURKSTAT).

4. In Turkey, share of self-employed1 was 38 percent of total employment in 2012, much
higher than the EU-27 average of 15 percent. However, the composition of self-employed in
Turkey is markedly different than in EU-27. Only 13 percent of self-employed in Turkey are
employers in contrast to 28 percent of self-employed in EU-27.

 According to International Labor Organization (ILO), self-employed persons include employers, own-account workers,
members of producers' co-operatives, and unpaid family workers.

5. While the share of females in self-employed at 36 percent is comparable to EU-27 average
of 30 percent, gender composition varies significantly across different categories of self-
employment in Turkey. More specifically, 7.39 % of employers and 17.21 % of own account
workers are females in sharp contrast with 76% of unpaid family workers (Author’s
calculations, HLFS 2012).

6. Previous empirical studies tried to explain the determinants of low levels of female labor
force participation (FLFPR) in Turkey (Karaoglan and Okten, 2013; Tansel, 2002 and Baslevent
and Onaran, 2003, Tepav, 2013).2 Tepav (2013) also analyzed the determinants of FLFP as an
employer and found that education and being married increases the probability of FLFP as an
employer while the number of children has no significant effect.3 This study is the first
analyzing the effects of socio-demographic characteristics such as education, marital status,
number of children and urban/rural location on gender gap in entrepreneurship in Turkey. A
multinomial logistic model was used where the odds of being an employer or own account
worker over being inactive/unemployed was analyzed. The estimation strategy uses the total
working age population in HLFS 2012 where gender gap is measured by including gender
indicators and interaction terms of gender with socio-demographic characteristics such as
education, marital status and number of children. It is found that higher education reduces
the gender gap while marriage and number of children increases the gender gap in
entrepreneurship. Perhaps surprisingly, living in an urban area also increases the gender gap
as it increases the odds of becoming an employer for males and decreases the odds for
females.

  Female labor force participation in Turkey declined and is significantly lower than the OECD average but above female
participation in the MENA. In Turkey, the female Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) decreased from 36 percent in 1988 to
25 percent in 2004, and has slowly increased since then, to 32 percent in 2012 (OECD, 2012).

3
  This study uses HLFS 2009-2011 to analyze the effects of education and marital status and 2007-2010 Survey of Income and
Living Conditions Survey to analyze the effects of children on the probability of FLFPR as an employer or own account worker.
Since regressions are run separately for females and males, it is not possible to determine the effects of covariates on gender
gap in entrepreneurship.

7. In the next section, a brief literature survey on gender gap in entrepreneurial activity and
entrepreneur characteristics is provided. In section 3, the entrepreneurship setting for women
in Turkey is described. Section 4 describes the data and methodology. Section 5 presents
results. Section 6 discusses policy implications. Section 7 provides an executive summary.

2. LITERATURE SURVEY
8. In recent years, there has been considerable interest and debate over entrepreneurial
characteristics as a predictor of entrepreneurial success (Gartner and Shane 1995; Gürol and
Atsan 2006; Koh 1996; Pavlovich and Corner 2006).

9. We now know that significantly fewer women than men own and manage businesses
worldwide (Georgellis and Wall, 2005; Kim, 2007; Minniti and Naude, 2010). Though in recent
years the number of women entrepreneurs has increased dramatically (De Bruin et al., 2006),
empirical evidence indicates that still male entrepreneurs significantly outnumber female
entrepreneurs and these differences are consistent across countries (Minniti et al., 2005). This
could be because women fail more often than men or because fewer women than men start
businesses to begin with, or both. Some evidence exists that, after correcting for factors such
as size of the business and sectorial distribution, women’s failure rates are not significantly
different from those of men (Kalleberg and Leicht, 1991; Perry, 2002; Kepler and Shane, 2007).

10. Evidence to date suggests that a variety of reasons contribute to explaining observed
differences in entrepreneurial activity across genders (Minniti et al, 2006). Perhaps women
and men have different socioeconomic characteristics and, if we were to correct for factors
such as education, wealth, family and work status, those differences would disappear. Indeed,
quite a bit of empirical evidence shows that such differences do exist (Cowling and Taylor,
2001; Blanchflower, 2004; Minniti et al, 2005). Also, women tend to possess fewer years of
experience then men (Aronson, 1991; Lee and Rendall, 2001) and tend to concentrate in
different sectors (Orser et al, 2006; Klapper and Parker, 2011). In addition, the propensity of
women to start a business may differ from that of men for cultural reasons or because of
discrimination in access to credit (Neumark and McLennan, 1995, Klapper and Parker, 2011).
One could also argue that men and women have different preferences and that women like
being self-employed less than men do (Kanazawa, 2005).

11. The businesses owned and managed by men and women are also different. We now know
that women’s businesses tend to be smaller and to grow less than those owned by men
(DuReitz and Henrekson, 2000; Coleman, 2007). Also, women’s businesses tend to be less
profitable than those of men (Robb and Wolken, 2002) and to generate lower sales turnover
than men, even in same-industry comparisons (Chaganti and Parasuraman, 1996; Minniti
(2009).

12. Recent evidence shows that prevalence of female entrepreneurship tends to be relatively
higher in some of the developing countries than in developed countries (Minniti et al., 2006).
This has traditionally been explained by the fact that women face higher barriers to entry in
the formal labor market and have to resort to entrepreneurship as a way out of
unemployment and poverty.

3. SETTING: FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN TURKEY
13. Among OECD countries the share of self-employed workers in total employment ranged
from around 8 percent in Luxembourg, Norway and the United States to over 30 percent in
Greece, Mexico and Turkey (OECD, 2012).4 Self-employed persons accounted for 15.2 percent
of total EU employment in 2012 (Eurostat, 2012). 28.3 percent of self-employed persons in
the EU have employed staff and hence are employers whereas in Turkey, only 13 percent of
self- employed persons are employers. Furthermore, unpaid family workers constitute 35
percent of self-employed persons in Turkey.

14. In general, self-employment rates are highest in countries with low per capita income and
shares of self-employed persons with employed staff (employers) are higher in countries with
high per capita income (OECD, 2012).




4
 According to International Labor Organization (ILO), self-employed persons include employers, own-account workers,
members of producers' co-operatives, and unpaid family workers.




                                                           8
Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends


15. Levels and changes in total self-employment conceal significant differences between men
and women. In Turkey, almost half of all women in total employment are self-employed down
from 78.4 recorded in 1990 (OECD Fact book, 2013). This statistic is largely driven by the large
share of female unpaid family workers in total female self-employment. Women working on
the family farm are counted as unpaid family workers and their share in total employment has
decreased over the years with rapid urbanization in Turkey. Nevertheless, female unpaid
family workers still constitute 72 percent of female self-employment and 34 percent of total
female employment. 90 percent of female unpaid family workers still work on a farm.

16. Gender composition varies significantly across different categories of self-employment in
Turkey. Figure 1 presents gender composition of different categories of employment (Author’s
calculations, HLFS 2012). 7.39 % of employers and 17.21 % of own account workers were
females in sharp contrast with 76% of unpaid family workers.

  Own account worker         5682                                   27340

17. Self-employment may be seen either as a survival strategy for those who cannot find any
other means of earning an income or as evidence of entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to be
one's own boss. The self-employment rates and their composition reflect these various
motives.

Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends


18. In Turkey the prevalence of female entrepreneurship is very low compared to that of men
according to other data sources as well. According to Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
2010 data more than 70 percent of all entrepreneurs in Turkey are men.

19. The GEM 2010 data also show that gender attitudes are different towards
entrepreneurship in Turkey. A higher percentage of men than women see more favorable
opportunities in the environment for starting a business. Men are also more confident that
they possess the knowledge and experience necessary for starting a new business and they
have less fear of failure. Men have more networking resources and know, for example, more
people who started a business than do women (Karadeniz, 2010).


20. Consistent with international findings, Turkish people in the highest household income
brackets are more likely to start a new company. 76 percent of Turkish entrepreneurs are
found in the highest 33 percent income level, and only 8 percent of Turkish entrepreneurs
come from the lowest 33 percent income level (Karadeniz 2010).
In 2010, 33 percent of Turkish respondents mentioned that fear of failure prevented them
from embarking on a new business. This figure is slightly lower than the average for efficiency-
driven countries which is 35 percent.5 The share of those in Turkey delayed by fear of failure
in starting a new business decreased by about 3 percent from 2008 to 2010 Karadeniz (2010).

21. According to Global Gender Gap Index in World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap
Report 2012, Turkey ranked 124th out of a total 135 countries.6 Furthermore, Turkey has
moved down from 122nd in 2011 to 124th in 2012, among the same 135 countries included in
the rankings.




5
 Since 2008 the countries that participate in the GEM project have been classified according to Porter’s typology of “factor -
driven economies”, “efficiency-driven economies” and “innovationdriveneconomies” (GEM, 2008).

6
  The Index is designed to measure gender-based gaps in access to resources and opportunities in individual countries
rather than the actual levels of the available resources and opportunities in those countries.

4. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
22. Yearly cross-sectional Turkish Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) data for the 2004-2012
periods, made available by TURKSTAT, were used.

23. Individuals who are aged 15 or older are asked their labor force status as well as socio-
demographic characteristics in these surveys. Those who have indicated that they have
worked in the reference week are further asked whether they worked as 1) paid employee 2)
employer, 3) own account workers or as 4) unpaid family worker.

24. The “self-employed” category defined by ILO is a highly heterogeneous group composed
of employers who employ at least one paid employee, own account workers (might have
partners or employ unpaid family workers but no paid employees) and unpaid family workers.

25. In order to differentiate between the characteristics of individuals across heterogeneous
groups in the “self-employed” category, multinomial logistic analysis where individuals can be
1) inactive/unemployed or 2) paid employees or choose to be 3) employers, 4) own account
workers or 5) unpaid family workers were conducted. Inactive/unemployed dummy is the
omitted category and coefficients on explanatory variables are interpreted compared to this
omitted category. This set-up enables to make comparisons across different sub-groups of the
“self-employed” since they are all contrasted against the same omitted category.

26. The sample of unemployed and the probability of wanting to start up one’s business versus
looking for work as paid employee in a logistic estimation was analyzed.

27. The purpose is to analyze how socio-demographic factors affect the likelihood of being an
employer or own account worker. Hence, the explanatory variables in the multinomial logistic
regression of working age population sample and the logistic regression of the unemployed
sample are a dummy variable for female (equals 1 if female), age, age squared, dummy
variables for education levels completed (primary school, junior high school, high school,
vocational school and university with less than primary school being the omitted category),
variables for the number of children in the household aged 0-4, 5-11, marital status (married,
divorce widow with single being the omitted category), interaction of education, children and
marital status variables with the female dummy variable, dummy variable for urban, region
dummies at the NUTS2 level. Since observations from the same household family are available
in the data, error terms are clustered at the household level.

5. RESEARCH FINDINGS

5.1 PATTERNS AND TRENDS OF FEMALE AND MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP

28. In Turkey, share of self-employed was 38 percent of total employment in 2012, much
higher than the EU-27 average of 15 percent. The composition of self-employed in Turkey is
markedly different than in EU-27. Only 13 percent of self-employed in Turkey are employers
while employers constitute 28 percent of self-employed in EU-27. In Turkey, 36 percent of
self-employed are females slightly higher than EU-27 average of 30 percent.

29. Figure 2 presents employment profiles of females and males in Turkey (HLFS 2012). Share
of self-employed females is 47 percent in total female employed while share of self-employed
males is 35 percent in total male employed. There are large differences in the composition of
the self-employed across genders. Only 2 percent of self-employed females are employers
while 20 percent of self-employed males are employers. In contrast, 72 percent of self-
employed females are unpaid family workers and only 11 percent of self-employed males are
unpaid family workers.

Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends


30. The focus will be on time trends for employers and own account workers to provide a
comprehensive picture of female entrepreneurship in Turkey. Table 1a presents time trends
for employer population in Turkey during 2004-2012. Share of employers in working age
population (age 15+)7 steadily increased from 1.98 percent in 2004 with a peak at 2.31 percent
in 2008 and then started decreasing with a dip in 2009. In 2010, it started increasing again and
is currently at 2.21 percent of the working age population. This dip is most likely due to the
2008-2009 economic crises. Share of employers in the labor force also increased steadily from
2004 till 2008. After its peak in 2008, it started decreasing and this downward trend still
continues. Share of females in total employer population on the other hand has been steadily
increasing from 4.82 percent in 2004 to 7.39 percent in 2012. Share of female employer in the
informal economy decreased from 29.10 percent in 2004 to 20.89 percent in 2013. 8

31. Table 1b presents time trends for own account workers (OAW). Share of OAW in working
age population decreased from 10.17 percent in 2004 to 8.60 percent in 2012. The share of
OAW in labor force (LF) decreased from 25.11 percent in 2004 to 20.05 percent in 2012. Share
of females in OAW increased from 11.23 percent in 2004 to 17.21 percent in 2012. Share of
female OAW who are in informal sector remained high and nearly constant at 90 percent
during the period of analysis while share of male OAW in the informal sector increased from
62 percent in 2004 to 65.31 percent in 2009 and stared decreasing and is currently at 60.37
percent. Hence own account workers appear very different than employers in terms of their
activity mostly taking place in the informal economy.




7
  We define working age population as older than 15 rather than 15-64, since we are interested in potential entrepreneurship
population and there are older entrepreneurs/employers in our data. One can also argue that entrepreneurs are less likely
to be constrained by physical constraints and legal limits that workers face.

8
 We define a person as employed in the informal sector if is not included in the social security coverage due to his
employment.

Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends




32. There is significant gender segregation in sectors of employers and own account workers
in Turkey. Figures 3a and 3b present the sector specific gender composition of employers and
own account workers respectively. Share of female employers is smallest in sectors with high
share of total GDP. Share of female employers is less than 1 percent in construction, 2.44
percent in transportation and storage and 3.74 percent in manufacturing and the combined
sector share of total GDP of the three sectors mentioned is nearly 40 percent. Considering
that construction sector has been a fast growing sector in Turkey in recent years, absence of
female entrepreneurs in this sector implies that females are not likely to directly benefit from
growth opportunities in this sector.

33. Share of female employers is over 20 percent in financial and insurance activities sector,
health and social work sector and education sector where the combined sector share of total
GDP of these three sectors is nearly 9 percent.

34. Similar to patterns for employers, share of female OAW is also very high in health and
social work at 55 percent and education at 49 percent. In contrast to low share of female
employers in manufacturing, share of female OAW in manufacturing is 52 percent. Share of
female OAW is highest in administrative and support service activities at 84 percent.

35. In addition to sector segregation, there appears to be segregation according to firm size.
Female owned businesses tend to be smaller in size. Figure 4 presents the firm size
composition of female and male employers. Over 80 percent of both female and male
employers own businesses with less than 10 employees. However, 6.84 percent of male
employers own businesses with 25 or more employees while only 4.79 percent of female
employers own businesses with that size.

36. Although the share of females in total employers is 7 percent, share of females in university
graduate employers is 14.5 percent. This striking statistic alludes to the importance of
university education in closing the gender gap in entrepreneurship in Turkey. Hence, a closer
look was taken at university graduate employers and the majors of female and male university
graduates were examined to identify any existing similarities and differences across genders.
Figure 5 presents the majors of female and male employers who are university graduates.
Significant and equal shares (23 percent) of female employers and male employers majored
in business and management. While health appears to be an important major for females with
30 percent of female employers majoring in health, only 8 percent of male employers majored
in this field. Engineering major appears more important for males with 17 percent of male
employers majoring in this field as opposed to 6 percent of female employers.

37. Among employers who are vocational high school graduates, there are only 53 females as
opposed to 903 males; hence only 5.5 percent of employers who are vocational high school
graduates are females. While a plurality of male employers (38 percent) have majored in
engineering, share of female employers with engineering major is less than 1 percent. Similar
to results for university graduates, significant shares of females at 34 percent and males at 22
percent have majored in business and management in vocational high school.

5.2 THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE PROBABILITY OF BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR

38. The socio-demographic characteristics influencing the probability of being an employer or
OAW are examined. A multinomial logistic analysis using data on working age population (15+)
from HLFS 2012 is conducted. Individuals are classified into five possible labor market
outcomes: 1) inactive/unemployed, 2) paid employees, 3) employers, 4) own account workers
or 5) unpaid family workers. Inactive/unemployed dummy is the omitted category and
coefficients on explanatory variables are interpreted compared to this omitted category. This
set-up enables to make comparisons across different sub-groups of the “self-employed” since
they are all contrasted against the same omitted category.

39. Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations of variables used in the multinomial
logistic model by labor market outcome.

40. Females constitute 68.38 percent of inactive or unemployed population, 25.7 percent of
paid employees, 7.39 percent of employers, 17.21 percent of OAW and 76.08 percent of
unpaid family workers.

41. On average, employers and paid employees are more educated than OAW,
inactive/unemployed and unpaid family workers. 26 percent of paid employees and 21.61
percent of employers are university graduates whereas only 5.81 percent of
inactive/unemployed, 3.76 percent of OAW and 2.17 percent of unpaid family workers are
university graduates. Employers and OAW are significantly older than paid employees and
unpaid family employees.

42. Over 80 percent of employers and paid employees live in urban areas whereas only 45.13
percent of OAW and 21.8 percent of unpaid family workers live in urban areas.

43. In this analysis, the objective is to analyze the characteristics of employers and own
account workers. The focus is how gender affects the probability of being an employer or an
own account worker and how other important characteristics such as education, marital
status, number of children, urban/rural residence have differential effects for females versus
males. In this section the results of this analysis is summarized. In the appendix section
coefficients of the multinomial logistic analysis are presented in Table A1 and the explanations
on how to interpret the coefficients are provided.

44. It is found that that being female decreases the odds of being an employer, OAW and paid
employee and increases the odds of being an unpaid family worker over being inactive or
unemployed.

45. More education increases the odds of being an employer or paid employee but decreases
the odds of being an OAW or an unpaid family worker for both males and females.
Furthermore, education appears more important in becoming an employer rather than a paid
employee.

46. There appears to be differential effects of education levels on closing the gender gap in
being an employer. Primary school degree over not finishing school increases the odds of
being an employer for both males and females though its effect is higher for males. There is
no differential effect of high school education on males versus females; it increases the odds
of becoming an employer over being inactive/unemployed for both genders at the same rate.
However, higher education has a more important effect for a female than a male in becoming
an employer. A university education increases the odds of a male becoming an employer by 8
folds whereas it increases the odds of a female becoming an employer by 29 folds over being
inactive/unemployed compared to less than primary school education.

47. Being married increases the odds of being an employer for males while it has no effect for
females over being single. Being married increases the odds of being an OAW for both males
and females but its effect is higher for males. Interestingly, being married increases the odds
of being an unpaid family worker for females while it decreases the odds of being an unpaid
family worker for males.

48. Being divorced increases the odds of being an employer, own account worker or paid
employee, while it decreases the odds of being an unpaid family worker for both females and
males. Furthermore, its effect on the odds of being an OAW or a paid employee is higher for
females than males.

49. Number of children aged 0-4 decreases the odds of being an employer/OAW/paid
employee for females while it increases the odds for males.

50. Similarly, number of children aged 5-11 decreases the odds of being an employer or paid
employee for females while it increases the odds for males. This variable increases the odds
of becoming an OAW for males but has no effect on females.

51. Surprisingly, living in an urban area decreases the odds of being an employer for females
and increases the odds of being an employer for males whereas it increases the odds of being
an OAW for females and decreases the odds of being OAW for males.

5.3 THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE PROBABILITY OF BEING A NASCENT
Entrepreneur in the Unemployed Sample

52. The unemployed sample was examined and the characteristics of those who want to start
their business versus those who are looking for work as a paid employee were analyzed.

53. Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of the unemployed sample. 37 percent of those
looking for work as paid employees and 24 percent of those looking for work as employers are
females and this difference in shares is statistically significant. We also considered the sample
of unemployed whose business had been closed or gone bankrupt at the time search for
employment has started. In this sample of unsuccessful former entrepreneurs, 24 percent of
those looking for work as employees and 13 percent of those looking for work as employers
are females and this difference in shares is statistically significant. While this difference is
statistically significant, it should be noted that the share of females in persons looking for work
as employers in both of these unemployed samples is much higher than share of females in
existing employers which is 7 percent.

Female Entrepreneurship in Turkey: Patterns, Characteristics and Trends


54. Next, using the unemployed sample we do a logistic regression analysis where dependent
variable is equal to 1 if individual wants to start his/her own business 0 if he/she is looking for
work as a paid employee. Table A2 in the appendix section shows this estimation. We present
two sets of results. First one is with all the regressors used in the multi-nomial regression with
all the interaction terms and the second one excludes the interaction terms. In the second
regression we do not use the interaction terms, since interaction terms are found to be
insignificant in the first regression. The odds ratio on female is not significant in the first
regression where interaction terms are included. The odds ratios for education variables are
all greater than 1 and significant for all except primary school.

55. In the second set of results where interaction terms are excluded, it is observed that the
odds ratio for female is 0.498 and significant. This means that being female decreases the odds
of wanting to start up a business as opposed to looking for work as paid employee by 50
percent. Education, work experience and living in an urban area increase the odds of wanting
to start up a business over looking for work as a paid employee. A university graduate is three
times more likely to want to start up a business than someone with less than primary school
or with only a primary school degree.

Public Policy implications

56. The results show that higher education decreases the gender gap in entrepreneurship in
Turkey since it has a much larger positive differential impact for females than males. Primary
education on the other hand as a terminal degree has a larger positive effect for males and
increases the gender gap in entrepreneurship. High school as a terminal degree has the same
positive effect on males and females. Hence, policies that will increase university enrollment
of females will have a strong impact on female entrepreneurship rates and decrease the
gender gap.

57. Having small children decreases the probability of being an employer for females while it
increases the probability of being an employer for males. Public policies on child care subsidies
are likely to increase female entrepreneurship rates more than males and help close the
gender gap.

58. It is disturbing that over 90 percent of female own account workers work in the informal
economy. These individuals do not have social security insurance as a result of their
employment. Public policies should also be designed with the goal of transitioning these
individuals into the formal economy.

59. It is also of concern that 72 percent of self-employed females are unpaid family workers.
How women may transition from this traditional role to a more entrepreneurial role warrants
more investigation and research. Since 90 percent of female unpaid family workers work on
the family farm, agricultural policies need to consider how to encourage female
entrepreneurship in rural areas.

60. Perhaps surprisingly, living in an urban area increases the odds of being an employer for
males while decreases the odds for females. This might result from more ample employment
alternatives for women as paid employees in urban areas as well as high market
concentrations favoring large firms in urban areas putting female employers with small firm
sizes at a disadvantage. Both of these possibilities warrant further investigation.

Interpretations of coefficients in Table A1

                                                                        ̂ ), represent the
The coefficients on explanatory variables, which are calculated as exp(
impact of a percentage increase in continuous explanatory variables and a 0/1 increase in
dummy variables on the relative risk ratio/odd ratio (the odds of choosing each employment
outcome to the base category of inactive/unemployed), so that a coefficient of one for a given
employment outcome means that increasing the corresponding explanatory variable has no
relative impact on choosing that employment outcome relative to the base category. A
significant coefficient greater than 1 for a labor market outcome means that the explanatory
variable increases the odds of having that labor outcome over being inactive or unemployed.

In addition to female dummy variable which is equal to 1 if individual is female and 0 if
individual is male, we include interactions of female with education, marital status, number
of children and urban variables in order to measure the differential effects of these variables
for females versus males. When there are interaction terms of female with other explanatory
variables such as education and marital status, the coefficients on education, marital status
represent the effects of these variables on the odds of becoming an employer/OAW/paid
employee/unpaid family worker for males. If female=0 then the interaction terms become
zero as well as the female dummy, hence the coefficients on education, marital status, urban
variables represent the effects of these variables on the odds of becoming an employer, OAW
etc., for males.

To find the effect of education, marital status, urban on the probability of being an employer
for females, we need to consider coefficients on these variables as well as those on interaction
terms. To find the effect of gender on the probability of being an employer for individuals with
different education, marital status, number of children, urban characteristics, we need to
consider the coefficient on female and the corresponding interaction terms.

The odds ratio on female dummy variable is 0.187 in the employer column. This means that
the odds of a female with less than primary school education becoming an employer is 81.3
percent lower than the odds of a similar male becoming an employer. We compute 81.3
percent by subtracting 0.187 from 1. This is computed when interaction terms with female are
zero. In other words, it is computed for a female/male, who has never been married, has no
children, has less than primary school education and lives in a rural area.

The odds of a never married/no children/rural female with primary education being an
employer is 90 percent lower than the odds of a similar male whereas the odds of a never
married/no children/rural female with university education being an employer is 35 percent
lower than the odds of a similar male. The multiplication of the odds ratio of female with
interaction term female*primary (female*university) results in 0.10 (0.65) which is the odds
ratio of never married/no children/rural female with primary (university) education compared
to a similar male. Subtracting this number from 1 gives us the decrease in odds of becoming
an employer due to being female for a never married/no children/rural individual with primary
(university) degree.

The odds of an urban, never married and no children female with primary school degree
becoming an employer is 94 percent lower than the odds of a similar male while the odds of
an urban, never married and no children female with a university degree becoming an
employer is 60 percent lower than the odds of a similar male.

A university education increases the odds of a male becoming an employer by 8 folds whereas
it increases the odds of a female becoming an employer by 29 folds over being
inactive/unemployed compared to less than primary school education. We find the effect of
university education on the odds of a female being an employer by multiplying the odds ratio on
university education with the odds ratio on the interaction term of university with female:
8.385*3.458= 29

Social Protection




                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The National Social Protection Strategy Framework for Zimbabwe defines social protection as a
set of interventions whose objectives are to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability,
and alleviate poverty and deprivation. Such interventions are designed to form a coherent system
that promotes equity, resilience, and opportunities for the poor and vulnerable. As in many other
countries, Zimbabwe’s social protection system funds social safety nets (SSNs), social insurance, labor
market programs, and social care services.

Though Zimbabwe’s social protection system once ranked impressively in coverage and other
measures, recent crises and structural challenges have eroded its quality and reach. Though
Zimbabwe now spends almost 5 percent of its GDP on what could be defined as social protection,
most expenditures do not benefit the poor. Interventions targeting the poor and vulnerable are heavily
dependent on development partner financing, which has steadily declined in recent years. Even well-
targeted programs tend to incur high administration costs, owing to a lack of harmonized processes
and inadequate coordination across implementing agencies.

Compared with other countries in Africa, Zimbabwe’s system is an outlier on many fronts.
Though many African countries face unsustainable payments for public service pensions, Zimbabwe’s
expenditure of four percent of GDP ranks far ahead of other high spenders, including South Africa (2.1
percent), Cabo Verde (1.7 percent) and Botswana (1.7 percent). Spending on social safety nets is on
a downward trajectory and reached only 0.72 percent of GDP in 2015, compared with an average of
1.1 percent in other African countries. Zimbabwe supports a highly varied, diffuse mix of social safety
nets interventions, while many African countries today are backing the emergence of single flagship
interventions, such as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme in Ghana,
the Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia (PSNP), and the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF).
Despite a sustained economic crisis and recurrent emergencies, Zimbabwe has retained many of the
same social safety nets interventions for over 20 years. Most programs have not been scaled up to
respond to recent crises, which is a key shortcoming in the sector.

Amid such challenges, this review aims to inform the GoZ’s efforts to reform its social protection
system, mainly by bridging gaps in critical information on expenditure and program effectiveness.
The review examines expenditure and program information provided by the government and
development partners on social safety nets, pensions, labor programs and social care services from
2010 to 2015. The review considers challenges and opportunities in financial sustainability; coverage
and equity; results and efficiency; and institutional capacity.

In addition, the review identifies immediate and longer-term options for allocating resources to ensure an
equitable and sustainable system, with a view to meeting the evolving needs of Zimbabwe’s population.



KEY CHALLENGES
          1.	 Given economic and recurrent crises, Zimbabwe’s social protection system no longer
              meets the needs of its population. In the immediate-term, authorities must respond to
              growing poverty and food insecurity under the drought. In 2015, 16 percent of the population
              had insufficient means to meet their minimum food requirements. Over a longer-term,
              authorities must align the system to the demands of a growing youth population.

          2.	 Financing for social protection is unsustainable, and financing for most basic social
              safety net programs is in jeopardy. Expenditure on social protection was driven by social
              insurance obligations, which grew from two percent of GDP in 2010 to 4.39 percent in 2015.
              Spending on social insurance is unsustainable, reflecting the unwieldy public wage bill and

                                                                                  Social Protection


       related issues. Expenditure on social safety nets dropped starkly from an average of 1.9
       percent from 2010 to 2014 to 0.72 percent in 2015. The drop is attributable to declining
       development partner commitments, and a shift in resources towards emergency assistance.
       Such financing constraints require rethinking social protection interventions and priorities.

   3.	 Most social protection expenditure is not directed towards the poor. A substantial 67
       percent of social protection expenditure is devoted to civil service pensions, which covers
       just 1.3 percent of the population. Zimbabwe’s basic social safety net programs have low
       and unpredictable coverage, and reach only a small share of the poor. Efforts to better
       serve the poor are impaired by weak targeting mechanisms and insufficient information
       on the efficacy of most programs. An exception is the Harmonized Social Cash Transfer
       System (HSCT), which imposes strict eligibility requirements and clear mechanisms for
       identifying beneficiaries, such as household and proxy means testing.

   4.	 Social protection programs are uncoordinated and fragmented, which undermines
       the efficiency of public spending and potential for social gains. Though authorities have
       consolidated certain cash grants, multiple ministries continue to support uncoordinated,
       sometimes duplicative social safety nets and labor market programs. Many programs have
       large and costly administrative structures and separate targeting and tracking systems—but
       little coverage. By contrast, the HSCT within the MPSLSW benefits from a robust, coordinated
       management information system, but there is a need to develop an integrated social registry
       for all MPSLSW programs.

   5.	 Social protection programs suffer from weak accountability and transparency.
       Zimbabwe has seen instances of alleged bias in administering social programs, especially
       food aid. There is scope for greater program-level controls, such as audits, and mechanisms
       for engaging beneficiaries in monitoring program performance.

   6.	 The government has inadequate capacity to monitor and evaluate programs, which
       impairs effective decision-making. Authorities have not rigorously evaluated most
       social protection programs, partly due to insufficient funding, weak staff skills, and poorly
       integrated information systems. An exception is the HSCT, which has showed gains in
       increasing incomes, food security, life satisfaction, and agricultural assets.



POLICY OPTIONS
   To improve the social protection system’s efficiency and outcomes, authorities should
   work to consolidate disparate safety net interventions around a core set of programs,
   based on clear guiding principles, such as instilling greater dynamism and flexibility to
   the system. The economic challenges facing Zimbabwe underscore the need for the GoZ to
   prioritize high-impact social protection interventions, especially as funding is currently spread
   thinly across too many programs. In particular, authorities might scale the HSCT, whose design
   and results suggest it could underpin Zimbabwe’s basic social safety nets platform. As a key next
   step, officials could reallocate funding towards the HSCT to cover more districts and households.

   In parallel, the GoZ should work to improve the equity of social protection, by identifying
   and building on strategies that are pro-poor and meet both chronic and transitory needs.
   In particular, officials could improve mechanisms for targeting the poor. To do so, it will be
   important to establish a clearer evidence base on program impacts and effectiveness.

   Authorities could take steps to reform the pension system. This review highlights the
   unsustainable nature of social insurance expenditure. Follow up analysis is needed in line with
   the overall public administrative reform of the civil service wage bill.

   Efforts should be invested to improve administrative capacities and processes in social
   protection. The absence of effective mechanisms for targeting, payments and monitoring
   has led to implementation delays, duplication, and overlaps across programs. Small social

        safety nets schemes are implemented in parallel, with their own administrative mechanisms.
        A notable performance gap is program transparency and accountability. To inform related
        reforms, authorities might seek to examine the good practices of other countries (e.g., Ethiopia,
        Brazil, Colombia) in implementing audits, operational assessments, grievance mechanisms,
        and diverse social accountability measures.

        In the near-term, authorities should work to ensure stronger engagement with
        development partners. This engagement should focus on collaboration to strengthen the
        core social safety net, and longer-term positioning of social protection given Zimbabwe’s tight
        fiscal space.




    1               SECTOR CONTEXT
Role of Social Protection, Key Risks and Vulnerabilities
The National Social Protection Strategy Framework (2015) defines social protection as: “…a set
of interventions whose objective is to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability and alleviate
poverty and deprivation”. Zimbabwe’s Constitution recognizes and upholds the need to provide social
protection to its citizens as evidenced in Section 30, which states that … “the state must take all practical
measures, within the limits of the resources available to it, to provide social security and social care to those
who are in need” In addition, Zimbabwe has specific national Acts that form the basis for providing
social protection in Zimbabwe.

Since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, social protection has been part of development
policies and all national poverty reduction strategies. Indeed, Zimbabwe had a tradition of social
safety nets even in colonial times, when the English Poor Laws influenced support for social welfare,
particularly targeting the urban poor, which was the visible face of poverty. Since 1980, several
national development plans have embraced social protection as a key to poverty reduction, which
led to greater recognition and prioritization of the sector. Such plans include the “National Economic
Revival Programme, 2001; Towards Sustained Economic Growth”; “National Economic Development Priority
Programme (NEDPP), 2008-2009”; “Zimbabwe Economic Development Strategy (ZEDS), 2009-2013”, and
the “Medium Term Plan (MTP), 2011-2015”. The GoZ’s current blueprint is the Zimbabwe Agenda for
Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation, (ZimAsset), which prioritizes poverty eradication through
higher economic growth. ZimAsset focuses on main pillars of growth: Food Security and Nutrition; Social
Services and Poverty Eradication; Infrastructure and Utilities; and Value Addition and Beneficiation.
ZimAsset delineates targets for social protection outcomes.

During the 1990s, the GoZ introduced non-contributory, social safety nets interventions under
the Enhanced Social Protection Programme (ESPP), focused largely on the formal sector. Such
interventions included public assistance programs, public works programs, the Basic Education
Assistance Module (BEAM), and a program for Children in Especially Difficult Circumstances (UNICEF,
2012). Before the economic crisis, the Department of Social Services provided a variety of these transfers
to needy persons at provincial and district levels.

Yet today, Zimbabwe’s social protection system supports an array of fragmented, poorly
targeted, and donor dependent programs, achieving different degrees of performance. During
and after the economic crisis, Zimbabwe’s financial resources and human capacity eroded, such that
many social protection programs are no longer operational without development partner support (e.g.,
BEAM). The implementation of parallel social safety nets programs raises considerable administrative
costs, with considerable duplication in core processes.

In this review, social protection includes four main pillars: social safety nets, social insurance,
labor market programs, and social care services. Social safety nets comprises an array of non-
contributory safety net programs, including cash transfers, public works programs, and in-kind food
distribution and fee waivers for basic services, such as in health and education. Social insurance includes
the national social insurance scheme, the government public service insurance scheme, and the Local
Authority Pension Scheme. Though in early stages, labor market programs include skills-development
programs; job-search and matching programs; and improvements in labor policies. Social care services
are typically programs targeting the most vulnerable and destitute. This PER considers relevant lessons
from other African countries, including on how they have adapted their own safety net strategies in
recent years (see Box 1).



                       Box 1: The Rise of Social Safety Nets in Africa
  Countries worldwide and in Africa have increased their use of social safety net instruments,
  especially cash-based programs. Globally, the number of countries with conditional cash transfer
  (CCT) programs grew from 27 in 2008 to 64 in 2014. In Africa, 21 countries – about half of the
  continent’s countries – had some form of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) in place in 2010.
  By 2014, the number of African countries implementing UCTs had nearly doubled to 40. Public
  works programs have also been implemented in 94 countries – many facing fragile and conflict-
  affected situations.

  Countries seeking to establish functioning safety nets commonly base systems on a high
  impact intervention. For example, two of the largest safety net programs in Africa include South
  Africa’s Child Support Grant, and Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP). An important
  feature of safety net programs in Africa is their ability to adapt to crisis settings, scale up responses
  to crises, and scale down during ‘steady states’. For instance, Ethiopia’s PSNP increased its case
  load to cover 18 million beneficiaries in response to the El Nino drought. The capacity of a country
  to scale in response to a crisis depends on the existence of a functioning system, early warning
  information flows, ex-ante financial contingency planning, and strong political support.

  Recent experiences highlight that safety nets are affordable at all levels of country income. Low
  income and middle-income countries devote about the same level of resources to social safety
  nets (i.e., 1.5 and 1.6 percent of GDP, respectively), while richer countries spend 1.9 percent of GDP.

In today’s economic and social context, Zimbabwe faces risks and vulnerabilities that a strong
social protection system could help address. In 2011-12, about 72.3 percent of Zimbabweans (9.1
million people) were poor, and 22.5 percent (2.8 million) were extremely poor. Poverty and extreme
poverty were more prevalent in rural areas: the 2011/2012 PICES Survey indicated that 92 percent of
the extremely poor population and 91 percent of extremely poor households reside in rural areas.
Within rural areas, the shares of the poor population and households reached 80 percent and 78
percent, respectively. The rural population suffers from deeper poverty, facing a Poverty Gap Index of
42.8 percent in 2011/12, compared with 15.5 percent in urban areas. Nationally, Zimbabwe’s Poverty
Severity Index (PSI) remained high at 19.6 percent in 2011/12, having dropped from 23.2 percent in 1995.
Severity of poverty is higher in rural areas. Zimbabwe’s income Gini-coefficient was 0.42 in 2011/12.
A high 83.7 percent of paid employees received incomes between US$1 and US$500, with women
disproportionately represented in the lowest incomes in 2011/12. Slightly more than half (51.5 percent)
of paid employees were “working poor”, receiving incomes below the individual total consumption
poverty line (TCPL). Only 3.3 percent received incomes above the average household TCPL.¹




                                                                                                        2
Social Protection


Food insecurity is a major challenge in Zimbabwe, which received substantial humanitarian food
aid during most recession years. In 2015, about 1.6 million people, or 16 percent of the population,
had insufficient means to meet their minimum food needs.² Such food insecurity has endured for years.
The GoZ must find ways to increase households’ capacity to manage risks, especially from droughts,
floods, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. HIV/AIDS continues to burden and erode household resources.
About one million children have been orphaned due to HIV/AIDS and related causes.

To advance the social protection agenda, the Government developed a National Social Protection
Policy Framework in 2015, but it is not yet operationalized. Designed within ZimAsset, this policy
framework recognizes Zimbabwe’s commitment to poverty eradication in the Constitution; the
sustainable Development Goals; and other international declarations that identify social protection
as a basic human right. The policy framework is devised to mitigate weaknesses in the country’s social
protection system, including fragmentation and duplication, and make the system more predictable,
consistent, transparent, and accountable. To achieve these goals, the GoZ must consider a number
of reforms, including, to program financing, coverage, effectiveness and capacity. These issues are
addressed in Section 3.


Core Interventions
The review identifies the 31 core social protection programs implemented by the GoZ from 2010
to 2015. Despite gaps in coverage and data, these programs reflect the core interventions and mix of
social protection programs in Zimbabwe. Table 1 summarizes programs by sub-sector, highlighting
each program’s targeting approach, start year, number of beneficiaries, and implementing agency.

The programs share important characteristics. The programs are priority interventions under the
National Social Protection Policy Framework, and are federally-managed and implemented by national
agencies—with financial support from international bodies. Most programs have been established for
a few years, though some have been more recently supported by Development Partners. Individual
programs are analyzed in subsequent sections.

Programs do not sufficiently target the poor and needy. Social insurance programs are not targeted
towards the poor, benefiting instead civil service retirees or spouses of deceased military. Benefits are
solely for people who have worked in the formal sector. Programs targeting the poor and vulnerable
are heavily dependent on donor support, and are typically hampered by the lack of unified targeting
criteria and high administrative costs. One bright spot: evaluations of the recently introduced HSCT
suggest that effective targeting is the key feature of this program’s early success.

Excluded from this analysis are social protection interventions managed by NGOs and select
other programs. Programs supported by NGOs and other non-state actors are scattered throughout
the country, and typically small in investment and coverage—but with a large aggregate impact. This
analysis excludes pilot programs, such as the Productive Community Works Project supported by the
World Bank from November 2011 to December 2012. Beneficiary data from the Civil Service Pension
scheme was not factored in this analysis, as such data was available only for 2012. In addition, this
review does not examine subsidies and tax exemptions, as authorities were not able to provide relevant
information citing fragmentation of the data across districts.




    2              EXPENDITURE TRENDS
The review assesses budget, expenditure and financing data for social safety nets, social
insurance, labor market programs, and social care services. The data presented is based mainly
on a detailed desk review, which analyzed the various social protection interventions implemented by
the GoZ and development partners in Zimbabwe from 2010 to 2015. To complement the desk review,
consultations were organized with relevant government departments and development partners.

A key value of this review is its pulling together of disparate sources of information and data,
which can help facilitate a comprehensive overview of social protection in Zimbabwe. Planning
for social protection has been hindered by a gap in compiling basic expenditure data. In short, the
GoZ lacks a harmonized information system, resulting in fragmented data across multiple agencies
and government departments—with most data in paper form. The World Bank’s close collaboration
with authorities on this PER has helped to overcome challenges in data access and analysis.

Social Protection



General Trends
Figure 1 presents trends in social protection spending disaggregated by categories of interventions
from 2010 to 2015. In this period, total social protection expenditure as a percent of GDP averaged
5.03 percent, albeit with some variability. Average expenditure on social safety nets was steady at
1.9 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2014, though fell to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015. The vast bulk
of expenditures – approximately 98 percent – comprise of spending on social safety nets and social
insurance programs. Labor market interventions make up a much smaller share, and expenditure on
social care services is almost negligible.

Expenditure on social protection grew by 15 percent in nominal terms from 2010 and 2014.
During this period, actual expenditure slightly surpassed budgeted expenditure, as reflected in Figure
2. The marked 17 percent drop in 2015 in total social protection expenditures from 2014 was driven
by government fiscal challenges and decreased support from development partners for certain social
protection programs, such as the Basic Education Assistance Module. Section 3 details trends in
domestic and development partner financing.

Social Safety Nets
Table 2 shows social safety net expenditure trends by classification of safety net program.
Social safety nets expenditure as a percent of GDP fell from 1.92 percent in 2010 to about 0.72 percent
in 2015. Social safety nets programs accounted for 28 percent of total social protection expenditure
from 2010 to 2014.

A striking aspect of social safety nets has been the diversity of programs. Social safety nets
programs range from in kind transfers, including fee waivers, food transfers, and agricultural technology
inputs, to pure cash transfers, mixed cash and food transfers, and public works schemes. Until recently,
Zimbabwe has strongly emphasized fee waivers and input support schemes, which have been scaled
down or phased out in other countries.

Figure 3 highlights how the shares of different types of social safety nets interventions have
evolved from 2010 to 2015. In complement, Figure 4 highlights the evolution of spending for the most
prominent social safety nets programs within these interventions categories. Spending is dominated by
two programs: the Small Holder Farm Input Support Scheme, and WFP’s Lean Season Assistance program.

     Figure 4: Expenditure Trends of Main Social Safety Nets Interventions (US$)




In kind agricultural benefits make up the largest share of social safety nets financing—averaging 53
percent from 2010 to 2015, and peaking at 67 percent in 2013. As the primary intervention, the Small
Holder Input Support programme rapidly expanded by 40 percent from $87.7 million in 2010 to about $160
million in 2014. This programme aims to provide input technologies, such as seeds and fertilizer, to small
holder farmers. Between 2014 and 2015, expenditure of this programme fell by 80 percent as the GoZ
focused on supporting only vulnerable households without other sources of agricultural inputs. In 2015, a
small share of households received support under the Presidential Input Support Scheme, which distributed
agricultural inputs left over from the 2014/15 agricultural cycle. Moreover, the GoZ has now emphasized
reducing dependency and focusing on command agriculture. As discussed in Section 3, Zimbabwe is
unique in emphasizing agricultural inputs, unlike more prominent social safety nets interventions, which
emphasize cash and food transfers, or public works.

Fee waivers in education and health represent a significant but declining share of social safety nets
expenditure, peaking at 15 percent in 2010 and falling to nine percent in 2015. Fee waiver programs
are special subsidies to help poor households maintain minimum socially acceptable standards of living,
which entails access to health and education facilities. Fee waivers have been prominent parts of social
safety nets initiatives in Zimbabwe, including the BEAM and the Assisted Medical Treatment Orders (AMTO).
Administered by the MPSLSW, BEAM targets and provides educational support to orphans and other
vulnerable children aged 6-19. The GoZ has sharply decreased funding for BEAM, and in 2015 donors pulled
funding. As a result, the GoZ has accumulated debt to schools under BEAM of more than $20 million. The
GoZ’s budget allocation of $10 million to the program in 2016 is likely to be applied to partly pay arrears.
Similarly, AMTO is a fee waiver or voucher issued to indigent people to access intermediate and tertiary
health services, such as a provincial or national hospitals, or other specialist facilities. The Department of
Social Services (DSS) implements AMTO, which relies on a means test and an assessment by DSS staff.
AMTO faces funding challenges, as the DSS has accumulated debts to hospitals. Financing for AMTO has
been relatively stable in recent years, but with low coverage. As discussed in Section 3, the effectiveness
of user fees has been much debated in Zimbabwe, Uganda, and South Africa—and fees were eventually
eliminated in the latter two countries.

Cash transfers have made up a small, but highly visible, share of safety net financing. Spending on
pure cash interventions made up less than one percent of total social safety nets expenditure from 2011 to
2013, though increased in recent years, reaching 21 percent in 2015. The Harmonized Social Cash Transfer
is an unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program channeling cash to labor-constrained households. The GoZ
and a multi-donor Child Protection Fund jointly fund the HSCT, while the DSS with support from UNICEF
implements the program. The HSCT’s objectives are to reduce the number of ultra-poor households, and
enable beneficiary households to increase consumption and improve their nutritional status, health, and
education. The HSCT started in 2012 by supporting 20,000 households at an annual cost of $5.6 million.
By 2015, the HSCT had been scaled from 10 to 19 districts assisting 52,000 households at a cost of $16.4
million. Authorities envisage that the HSCT will replace the Public Assistance and other small cash transfer
programs. Yet due to funding constraints, the HSCT in 2016 was scaled down from 19 to eight districts,
reducing beneficiaries to 23,000 households. As further described in Section 3, the emergence of the

Social Protection


HSTC coincides with growing international evidence on the positive impacts of cash transfers, especially
on consumption, human development, productive assets, and multiplier outcomes.

Public works programs made up a very small amount of total social safety nets from 2010 to 2015,
peaking at 13 percent in 2011 and falling to less than one percent in 2013. Some public works programs
in Zimbabwe provide short-term employment in community works to create productive assets. The GOZ,
WFP, USAID, DFID, and NGOs implement public works programs. The GoZ’s public works program is the
Food Mitigation Program, though this program has been dormant for some years due to funding constraints.
With funding from bilateral donors, the WFP implements public works programs to respond to humanitarian
needs across the country. Since 2013, USAID through the ENSURE and Amalima programs has funded public
works programs. The government has made progress in harmonizing programs through its Productive
Community Works Policy Framework and Operational Guidelines, which was important, given the number
of implementing agencies. In 2011, the Government with financial and technical support from the World
Bank successfully piloted a Public Works Programme that tested the Operational Guidelines, but scaling
up this program was hindered by funding constraints. Public Community Works (PCW) initiatives, however,
lack continuity and solid evidence of their actual impact on beneficiary households. PCW programs (mainly
project based) produce productive assets expected to build resilience to poverty and food insecurity.

Food transfers remain a consistent intervention, and comprised 22 percent of social safety nets
expenditure from 2010 to 2015. The Seasonal Targeted Assistance Program (STAP) provides food transfers
to food-insecure households in rural areas. A World Food Program (WFP) initiative, the STAP relies on
geographic, community-based, and administrative targeting methods to select households. Community-
based methods include community mapping and a wealth ranking, where community members identify
and categorize different beneficiaries. Geographical targeting is based on the Zimbabwe Vulnerability
Assessments, which are conducted annually soon after the harvest. The WFP’s Health and Nutrition Safety
Net Program supports supplementary feeding. This latter program targets malnourished HIV/AIDS and TB
patients, pregnant women, and children aged 0-5 years.

Recurrent emergencies and food insecurity have influenced financing from development partners
on social safety nets. Figure 5 juxtaposes total humanitarian aid and social safety net spending from 2010
to 2016. Surprisingly, it suggests Zimbabwe’s safety net interventions lacked responsiveness to transitory
shocks, as financing for safety nets was not greatly scaled during crisis events.

Yet from 2013 to 2015, donors paid significant attention to disaster preparedness and flexibility.
The WFP was particularly active. The WFP Protracted Relief and Recovery Operations (PRRO) document
budgeted $206 million to support SSN programs in: i) creation of productive assets; ii) promotion of health
and nutrition; and iii) disaster response and risk reduction (DRRR). The aim was to support about 1.2 million
beneficiary households every year. DFID and USAID were also instrumental in funding social safety nets,
having supported productive safety net programs implemented by partners, such as FAO, World Vision
and Care International.

Finally, data suggests that between 86 to 90 percent of social safety nets expenditure is for
benefits. This figure compares favorably to international comparators, and reflects a typical trend
for administrative expenditure to be around 10 percent. However, administrative costs, especially for
Government-led programs, are likely to be underestimated, as staff tend to work across various tasks,
making it difficult to correctly attribute their time.

Social Insurance Expenditure
Zimbabwe operates three main pension schemes to protect old-age income: the Public Service
Pension Fund (PSPF), the National Pension Fund (NPF), and the Local Authorities Pension Fund
(LAPF). Expenditure for these pension programs has grown substantially—reaching 2.02 percent of
GDP in 2010 and 4.93 percent of GDP in 2015. Social insurance expenditure represents 86 percent of
social protection financing. Yet even this expenditure may be underestimated as this review is based
on partial information from the LAPF.

The PSPF makes up about 86 percent of total social insurance expenditure. As detailed in the
Public Service (Pensions) Regulations, 2992, the PSPF is designed as an unfunded Defined Benefit
pension arrangement, which is commonly known as ‘Pay-As-You-Go’ (PAYG). The ‘Pay-As-You-Go’
arrangement uses pension contributions from employees to meet benefits of those who have retired,
withdrawn from service, or died. Despite this design, the GoZ has funded the PSPF entirely since 2009,
as employee contributions have not been solicited amid worsening economic conditions. Since June
2009, all members in the Public Service have received a standard ‘allowance’, initially pegged at US$100
per month, but reviewed and increased regularly. This expected ‘Pay-As-You-Go’ pension arrangement
suffers from a huge mismatch between employee contributions and payments for pension benefits,
which is undermining the PSPF’s sustainability. In 2015, the Government estimated that it incurs a
monthly additional expenditure of US$39.8 million without adequate employee contributions.

The National Pension Fund, which is administered by the National Social Security Authority
(NSSA), provides old-age, disability, and survivor pensions and grants for workers employed
by private sector firms. The NPF does not cover self-employed persons, but about 20 percent of the
working age population are estimated to participate therein. National Social Security Expenditure has
increased from 11 percent in 2010 to 19 percent of total social insurance spending in 2015. The NSSA
in 2015 had a total expenditure of $126 million, which benefited 209,300 people.

The Local Authorities Pension Fund provides employees in local authorities with retirement,
disability, and death benefits. The LAPF is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and covers 44 local
authorities. The contribution rate to the Fund is 23.3 percent, which includes contributions of 17.3 percent
from employers and 6 percent from employees. In 2015, 12,481 beneficiaries were receiving pensions
under the LAPF, which reported a deficit in excess of $400 million, and faces an uncertain future.

Social Protection


Similar to many African countries, Zimbabwe faces challenges in financing social insurance.
The civil service pension bill is unaffordable, and delays in benefit payments have been widely
discussed and reported in recent years. Although the NSSA and CSPF provide greater than average
coverage in the formal labor market, the vast majority of informal sector workers are excluded from
the social insurance system. These issues are explored in Section 3.

Labor Market Expenditure
Labor market programs are in early stages in Zimbabwe. Such programs are commonly devised
to promote employment opportunities, especially for youth. Compared to other sub-categories,
expenditure for labor market programs is very low (see Table 4). Direct line ministries tend to support
these programs in collaboration with the private sector.

Most prominently, the Ministry of Youth, Indigenization and Economic Empowerment has
developed two programs providing finance and entrepreneurial trainings to youth aged 18 and
35 years via a loan scheme. Administered with support of commercial banks, these programs are
devised to be revolving, thus their scale depends on borrower repayments. This dependence explains
expenditure variations reflected in Table 4. The programs in 2014 had a total expenditure of $3.0
million benefiting 1,842 youths.

Vocational Training Centers provide non-formal trainings on entrepreneurial and technical
skills for school drop-outs and disabled youth. A network of 42 vocational training centers, train
youth in residential and non-residential settings. Training is provided in mechanics, civil engineering,
construction-related trades, catering, tourism, cosmetology, fashion design, and other fields. The
Centers supported 1,211trainees in 2014. Total expenditures in 2014 reached $104,586, representing
an increase of about 286% from expenditure of $36,515 in 2010.

The Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and Cooperative Development (MSMECD)
delivers entrepreneurial training and financing through the Small Enterprises Development
Corporation (SEDCO). SEDCO, a statutory body, provides incubation services for start-up businesses,
as well as training, mentoring, market linkages, and business extension services. Expenditure on this
programme fell from $2 million in 2010 to $1.5 million in 2011– but to only $150,000 in 2015. This
program has suffered from defaults and late repayment by SMEs, which has eroded its financing
capacity as a revolving fund.

Social Care Services	
Social care services represents a tiny share of social protection expenditure, having averaged
$764,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 (see Table 5). The DSS provides social care services, including
residential and non-residential care. The DSS supervises residential homes for the elderly, persons
with disabilities, and children. Specifically, the DSS supports 29 homes for the elderly, 62 institutions
for persons with disabilities, and residential homes for over 1,100 children.

    3              CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

This section considers reform options for designing and implementing Zimbabwe’s social
protection system. To appropriately assess a social protection system, the analysis covers financing
and sustainability, coverage and equity, and effectiveness and institutional capacity.

Financing and Sustainability
A prudent, sustainable social protection system appropriately balances its programs with
other government expenditure and initiatives, and integrates financing from development
partners into the public sector budget. Individual programs should be financially and politically
sustainable so that benefits reach target populations predictably. Such programs should also avoid
“stop/start” cycles, which impair the efficient administration of social protection and achievement
of program goals.

Figure 6 illustrates the shares of social protection financing assuming two key government

highlighted separately given its magnitude. Expenditure on pensions programs grew from $190

million in 2010 to $610 million in 2015. Social insurance expenditure made up 66 percent of social
protection spending during this time period.

Development partners have provided a sizeable share of Zimbabwe’s expenditure on social
safety net programs. However, financing from development partners has trended downward, falling
from 84 percent of overall expenditure in 2010 to 59 percent in 2015 (see Figure 7). During this period,
development partners were reluctant to finance social safety net interventions without government
contributions. From 2010 to 2014, the share of government financing towards some social safety net
programmes, particularly the Small Holder Input Support Programme, increased notably, yet declined
in 2015. As suggested in Section 2, development partners have shifted their resources from social
safety nets to humanitarian aid, including to respond to the El Nino drought.

Notably, Zimbabwe now spends less on social safety nets as a percentage of GDP than other
countries in the region (Figure 8). On average, African countries commit about 1.1 percent of GDP
to social safety net expenditure. In Zimbabwe and most other regional countries, most expenditure
tends to be from development partners.

In contrast, Zimbabwe spends comparatively more on its Civil Service Pension Fund (see
Figure 9). Many African countries face unsustainable public service pension payments. Zimbabwe’s
expenditure ranks far ahead of high spenders in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as South Africa (2.1 percent
of GDP), Cabo Verde (1.7 percent) and Botswana (1.7 percent). Of note, any reform of pensions should
be linked to reform of Zimbabwe’s high wage bill in the public sector.

Apart from expenditure on social insurance, government spending on broader social protection
interventions has been very modest. Excluding social insurance interventions, the Government
financed on average 12 percent of total social protection expenditures, peaking at 20 percent in
2014. The effectiveness of this expenditure is examined in Section 3.

Coverage and Equity
When designing social protection interventions, policymakers are typically concerned about
the coverage and equity of different interventions. Programs should be adequate to cover various
groups in need of assistance, including the chronic poor, transient poor, and other priority groups.
Country authorities, who aim to provide full coverage and meaningful benefits, commonly seek to
support a balanced set of programs targeted and tailored to the needs of specific populations. In this
context, equity implies ensuring that benefits reach targeted groups in a fair manner, and indeed
reach the poorest and most vulnerable.


                                                                                               16
Social Protection


Social safety nets programs in Zimbabwe tend to cover a small share of the poor, and benefits
are subject to significant unpredictability and exclusion errors. Table 6 provides the number of
beneficiaries covered by different social safety nets programs each year from 2010 to 2015.

Unfortunately, this review cannot calculate an estimate of coverage of the poor by all
programs, since available data accounts for neither overlaps across programs nor the degree
of exclusion error. In addition, some programs have not disbursed benefit payments in certain
periods, which would erode data quality. Of note, those receiving HSCT transfers are ineligible to
receive other assistance programs, most notably Public Assistance benefits.

Table 7 indicates the extent to which each social safety net program covers Zimbabwe’s poor
and extreme poor – assuming perfect targeting. This table suggests considerable gaps in coverage,
especially for programs with potential for scale, such as the HSCT.

The 2012 Poverty and Income Expenditure Survey (PICES) provides a more comprehensive picture
of coverage and equity, by supporting analysis of a smaller share of higher performing social
assistance programs, namely ALTO, BEAM and the Food Mitigation Program. The PICES did not
include the HSCT, as the HSCT was in an early stage of implementation in 2012. The charts in Figure
10 help to highlight key issues:

•	   Generosity: Based on the average value of transfers, the generosity of safety net programs is
     quite low in Zimbabwe.

•	   Coverage: The BEAM and Food Mitigation Program covered 40 percent of the poorest
     consumption quintile.

•	   Beneficiary incidence is the share of beneficiaries in each consumption quintile. Zimbabwe
     provides a progressive distribution of benefits in lower quintiles, though with considerable spread
     across quintiles (note: data on beneficiary incidence is based on a mix of programs, including the
     BEAM, ALTO, Food Distribution program, and Transfers for disasters).

Social Protection


•	   Benefits incidence is the transfer amount received by a group as a percent of total transfers received
     by the population. Benefit incidence is quite pro-poor: 43% of benefits reach the poorest quintile
     (note: this data is from only the Food Distribution program and Transfers in response to disasters).

The text below highlights trends of key main safety net interventions in coverage and equity:

•	   Coverage of BEAM fell steadily in recent years. From 2011 to 2015, beneficiaries of BEAM
     in primary school dropped from 537, 594 to 118,408, and in secondary school from 198,220 to
     78,925. Though the coverage of BEAM has been high—reaching 80 percent of primary school
     students in 2013—the program suffers from significant errors of exclusion. In 2011, 42 percent
     of students identified as needy by communities did not receive BEAM financing. The formula
     of allocating BEAM resources does not reflect poverty incidence in schools, which suggests
     the equity of transfers has not been optimal. The GoZ has funded the BEAM secondary school
     component, but has faced challenges in the past four years in disbursing required resources to
     cover all targeted children. Of $16 million budgeted in 2014 for the secondary school children,
     only $7million was disbursed and spent towards the programme, to clear previous arrears.

•	   Since 2013, the Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Program has been scaled, reaching about
     260,000 beneficiaries in 2015. The rigorous targeting mechanisms incorporated in HSCT have
     been a key to ensuring that the program is reaching intended beneficiaries (see next section).



     19
                                                                                         Social Protection


       However, the HSCT has experienced funding challenges, and has been scaled back to cover 112,
       790 beneficiaries. To date, the HSCT has had the sharpest pro-poor incidence among all social
       safety nets programs, and has emerged as a priority program for Government and development
       partners in a reform agenda.

•	     The WFP’s Seasonal Targeted Assistance Program has played an important role in promoting
       food security in rural areas, reaching about 1.2 million beneficiaries in 2014. Although
       coverage of the STAP fell in 2015, the WFP is expected to continue assistance in this area and
       provide additional support to respond to the El Nino crisis. The WFP also provides support on a
       smaller scale for public works and nutrition, and previously for school feeding programs.

•	     Designed to target small holder farmers, the Agricultural Inputs Support Program reported
       about 1.6 million beneficiaries at its peak in 2014, but coverage fell to 300,000 in 2015. In
       recent years, concerns have been expressed about corruption and inadequate transparency in
       targeting benefits under this program. From 2016, Government will shift from this programme
       to a “Command Agriculture” approach, whereby inputs will be distributed only to small holder
       farmers with identified capacity to produce for their own consumption, and for the national
       strategic reserve.

Available evidence suggests that despite high expenditure, the vast majority of the working
age population does not have access to social insurance. Table 8 summarizes the uneven coverage
of pensions among different population groups. Most social protection expenditure is devoted to
just 1.6 percent of the population, who have higher incomes. Among this population group, benefits
are perceived as inadequate. The NSSA has higher coverage, yet excludes the informal sector. The
informal sector comprises 84 percent of the labor force, which implies a strong equity concern
going forward.

As it evolved, Zimbabwe’s social protection system has trended away from international best
practice, and is no longer appropriate for addressing current challenges. Social protection in
Zimbabwe is molded by government financed programs, including fee waivers for health and education
(e.g., BEAM and AMTO), the Small Holder Farm Inputs Support Scheme, and the Civil Service Pension
Fund. Though such interventions are common and fundamental in other countries, their higher scale
and dominance in Zimbabwe does not appear appropriate. Moreover, authorities may find the best
practices of other countries informative as they embark on a new reform agenda. Key considerations
of this reform agenda are noted below.

•	     Zimbabwe is considering ways to reform its “in-kind” support programs, including fee
       waivers and agricultural inputs. Criticisms have been leveled at Fee Waiver schemes in health
       and education for highly excluding the poor and making irregular payments to service providers.


                                                                                                    20
Social Protection


      In short, the GoZ has struggled to identify the most deserving beneficiaries and achieve a balance
      between required fee payments and compensation for institutions and service providers—in
      contrast to successful models in countries such as Indonesia and Thailand. As authorities consider
      options for further review of its in-kind support programs, such as BEAM and AMTO, the experiences
      of South Africa and Uganda may be informative. Both countries chose to eliminate fee waivers
      after realizing that fees and waivers improved neither service quality nor access among the poor
      (Grosh et al, 2008). Uganda and South Africa replaced user fees and fee waivers with free access
      to services, which proved costly and placed pressure on service providers. A more realistic option
      for Zimbabwe might be targeted cash transfers to improve the poor’s access to services. There is
      a fine line between a fee waiver and a conditional cash transfer (CCT): fee waivers and vouchers
      reimburse households and/or service providers for actual expenditures, while CCTs provide
      additional resources to encourage households to use health or education facilities. Similarly,
      authorities have recognized shortcomings in the Small Holder Farm Input Support Scheme, and
      efforts are underway to scale down this program yet improve its targeting.

•	    Zimbabwe must reform the social insurance system to ensure it meets the needs of
      Zimbabwe’s economy and population. The previous discussion highlighted the social insurance
      system’s highly unsustainable financing for the CSPF and high exclusion of the informal sector.
      Zimbabwe has a young population, which favors a more integrated social insurance program as
      dependency ratios are still low. However, high death rates and emigration, especially among the
      economically active labor force, might negatively affect the social security schemes’ future revenue
      base. The effects of a declining revenue base might be felt only in the long run, when it translates
      to higher demand.

Authorities should take steps to improve the transparency and accountability of the social
protection system. Weaknesses in transparency and accountability threaten the credibility of social
protection delivery systems, and prevent programs from operating as designed. As noted, various
programs have reported poor targeting (Small holder Farmer Input Support) and exclusion errors, which
effectively reduce services for the poor (BEAM). Media coverage routinely reports on grievances. The
Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) published a report on Food Aid Cases reinforcing these
concerns (See Box 2). Major aid agencies, including the WFP and USAID, welcomed the findings of the
ZHRC, and highlighted efforts to ensure systematic monitoring and accountability of their programs.
Taken together, such factors reveal systemic challenges impeding Zimbabwe’s reform agenda. Yet
authorities could learn from global good practices to guide their reforms of social protection, such as
robust international experiences on program-level controls (e.g. audits, operational assessments) and
beneficiary-level controls (e.g. grievance redress systems, citizens committees, score cords). Among
others, authorities might consider learning from Colombia (program spot checks), Brazil (national,
state and municipal hotlines), Ethiopia (social accountability, financial transparency) and India (social
audit forums and ombudsman program).



                      Box 2: Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission Report
                                on Food Aid Distribution 2016
     Between May and August 2016, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission – an independent body
     – investigated complaints of alleged discrimination in distributing agricultural inputs and food aid
     in some areas, including Bikita East, Buhera North, Mazoe Central, Zvimba South, and Muzarabani
     North and South. The investigations found that there was “unbridled maladministration” on the
     part of some public officials, who were allegedly performing their duties partially, and with bias
     against persons of particular political affiliations.

     In all five districts covered by the investigations, community leaders, such as Village Heads,
     Headmen, Village Secretaries and District Administrators, were alleged to be biased towards
     members of their own party and against members of the opposition, whom they told openly
     that those affiliated with the opposition would never get food aid. In two districts, youths from
     the ruling party who were not even part of distribution committees were involved in distributing

  food aid and agricultural inputs. Established complaints mechanisms were ineffective to address
  reported grievances.

  Based on the facts of this report, the ZHRC made the following recommendations:

  •	   Food aid should not be distributed on partisan lines.

  •	   The Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare should strengthen its mechanisms
       for addressing complaints arising out of food aid or agricultural inputs distribution, or any
       other programme that is intended to assist vulnerable households, to ensure that there is
       equity and public confidence in the system.

  •	   The Ministry should also ensure that public officials act in their official capacity and desist
       from using political affiliations as yardsticks, and guarantee impartiality in any food aid or
       distribution of inputs, or any other programme meant to assist those in dire need.

  •	   Relevant NGOs involved in the food aid distribution should also ensure distribution in a non-
       partisan manner.

  •	   The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) should at all times act impartially in investigating criminal
       violations of human rights.

  •	   A human rights based approach should be adopted in implementing ZIM-ASSET and the
       Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2030).


The strongest evidence of program effectiveness comes from evaluations of cash transfers
programs—the only interventions subject to rigorous impact evaluation. According to such
evaluations, the HSCT increased the average consumption expenditure of recipient households by
$2.74 per month, representing about 55 percent of median expenditure (American Institutes for
Research (2014)). Increases were particularly evident in smaller households, whose expenditure
represents 82 percent of median expenditure. The HSCT also increased the number of food groups
purchased by beneficiary households—a common indicator of diet diversity. The share of recipient
households who are food secure increased significantly. Respondents reported higher scores on a
Life Satisfaction Scale (by 12 percent). Over a 12 month period, the HSCT was credited for enabling
households to strengthen resilience. Specifically, the HSCT helped increase agricultural assets (hoes,
sickles) and livestock (goats, donkeys), diversify income sources (different cropping patterns, more
non-farm enterprises), and reduce debt (improvement in credit market position). Notably, the HSCT
did not reduce exposure to shocks among smaller households. According to a simulation of the HSCT’s
impacts on the local economy (Taylor et al (2014)), the program generates a total income multiplier
of 1.73 in nominal terms—with a confidence interval of 1.42 to 2.00. In other words, each transferred
dollar has the potential to generate 1.73 dollars of income. By stimulating demand for locally supplied
goods and services, this study concluded that cash transfers have productive impacts. The study’s
findings are reinforced by findings of similar models in Kenya, Lesotho, Ghana and Zambia.

Robertson et al (2013) conducted a smaller scale evaluation on a cash pilot program, finding
positive impacts of conditional and unconditional transfers on health vaccination, school
attendance and acquisition of birth certificates. This evaluation provides further rationale for
integrating cash transfers into social protection in Zimbabwe, while recognizing more analysis is
needed on the comparative effectiveness of UCT and CCT programs. The results of this evaluation
also reconcile with emerging evidence in the region on how “conditionalities” can be helpful to realize
human development outcomes, by providing behavioral nudges to beneficiaries, such as in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Malawi (Ward et al, 2010; Evans, 2015; Baird et al, 2015). In many countries, conditional
cash transfers have been applied in a ‘soft’ manner through deliberate messaging to beneficiaries,
such as in Lesotho (Daidone et al, 2014).

The HSCT has been effective owing to its careful design features, including strong eligibility
criteria, transparent programming, and appropriate benefits. To qualify for the HSCT, households



                                                                                                  22
Social Protection


must have per capita total expenditure below the national food poverty line, and demonstrate
appropriate household labor constraints. Beneficiaries are identified through clear mechanisms,
including a household census and proxy means test. The HSCT monthly benefit ranges from US$10
for a single-person household, to a maximum of US$25 per household for a family of five.

Authorities are expected to expand the HSCT and make it a priority program promoting a
harmonized approach to social safety nets. Despite its impressive results, the HSCT remains in infancy,
and has been subject to funding shortfalls and scale-back in 2015. It will be important for authorities to
address findings of its evaluation, particularly to ensure the HSCT is better equipped to address challenges
in communications, monitoring, grievance mechanisms and harmonization (AIR, 2014).

Finally, Zimbabwe appears to lack the dynamism to adapt its social protection system to
changing economic and social conditions, which undermines its credibility. As noted, Zimbabwe
has faced recurring shocks in recent years, and in 2016 has faced its most serious drought in 35 years.
The failure of the social safety nets programs to adapt to changing needs is striking, especially now
when mechanisms should be in place to scale up and respond accordingly.


Capacity
Although Zimbabwe benefits from an educated workforce and social protection programs with
long lifespans, capacity constraints are a strong concern. This section looks briefly at institutional
capacities in overall coordination and harmonization, and considers human resource capacities based
on case studies from the HSCT.

Management of social protection is fragmented and rationalization is needed (World Bank,
2014). The Social Transfers Policy Framework and consolidation of some cash grants under the HSCT
are key steps to building a more coherent social safety net. However, responsibilities for delivering social
protection are spread thinly across government—with limited financing to build requisite capacity. The
Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare (MPSLSW) is the lead agency for social transfers and
social care services, but clear plans for administrative harmonization are not in place. Separately, the
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MPSE) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanization
and Irrigation Development (MAMID) implement their own social safety nets programs. Agencies
delivering social insurance include the National Social Security Authority (e.g., contributory retirement
and disability scheme and a workplace injury scheme), and the Ministry of the Public Service (e.g.,
civil service pensions). Each pension scheme has its own management structure, investment policies,
financial systems, monitoring systems, and requirements for actuarial valuation. Despite receiving very
limited financing, labor market programs are implemented by numerous actors: the MPSLSW, MPSE,
MYIE, Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and Cooperative Development (MSMECD), the Small
Enterprise Development Corporation, and others.

Authorities must take steps to harmonize administrative processes and structures. Programs in
Zimbabwe tend to have separate applications and targeting, payment, and information systems. Many
programs maintain their own databases and follow different reporting structures, weakening transparency
and oversight. Many district and provincial offices maintain paper-based records. A key priority is to integrate
the social registry for all MPSLSW programs. The HSCT, which is managed by the MPSLSW, has a fairly robust
management information system (MIS), recording and updating beneficiary data and accommodating add-
on case management software. However, other MPSLSW programs do not have that capacity. Without an
integrated social registry, beneficiary-level information is not readily available.

The evaluation of the HSCT revealed constraints in local capacity, which might be typical for
such programs. Interviews indicated limited capacity in the number of staff and trainings for staff to
run the HSCT at each level (AIR, 2014). Additionally, staff did not appear to fully understand the roles
of counterparts at other levels, meaning that much work is relegated to headquarters (HQ) instead of
staff at district or provincial levels. Deferring tasks to HQ reduces the effectiveness of overall system
management, targeting, and addressing beneficiary needs – issues that staff mentioned affect scale-
up. Overall, staff would benefit from a clearer understanding of how their role supports the overall
functioning of the HSCT as delineated in the Operations Manual, and from periodic refresher courses
to review tasks and address issues.

    4            CONCLUSIONS & PRIORITY OPTIONS

Zimbabwe stands at a crossroads in developing and reforming its social protection system.
While Zimbabwe’s social protection system was once renowned for its comprehensive set of programs
to meet the needs of its population, the legacy of economic crisis and recurrent emergencies have
taken a heavy toll.

The social protection system is financially unsustainable. Programs have not been pursued in a
balanced manner with other aspects of government expenditure and development partner dissipating.
Public service pensions make up almost 70 percent of social protection financing, and expenditure on
social safety nets has dropped dramatically amid tight budget constraints.

Current programs suffer from poor coverage and equity weaknesses. Social safety nets programs
tend to cover a small share of the poor, with benefits subject to unpredictability and exclusion errors.
Social insurance provisions are focused on the formal sector, excluding about 84 percent of the labor force.

Despite the long lifespans of a range of programs in Zimbabwe, evidence on program impacts and
effectiveness is very thin. Operational experiences from the vast majority of programs have not been
adequately assessed. Rigorous impact evaluations have been applied on cash transfer interventions,
including the HSCT, and show encouraging results.

Management of social protection is fragmented and further rationalization is needed. The limited
funding disbursed to respective ministries has been spread thinly across programs. The absence of
an effective coordination mechanism for social protection programming has resulted in significant
duplication and overlaps.

The system lacks dynamism and flexibility. Program interventions have failed to evolve in response
to economic crisis and recurrent emergencies. A notable shortcoming of social safety nets programs
has been their inability to scale up to respond to transitory food insecurity. The GoZ still implements the
same number of programs from the early 1990s, despite a marked drop in government revenue and
a huge decline in the Gross Domestic Product. Of particular concern are weaknesses in transparency
and accountability, which threaten the credibility of social protection delivery systems, and prevent
programs from operating as designed.

Zimbabwe faces a complex reform agenda, especially given the tight fiscal space that social
protection programs now operate within. There are four priority areas where attention should
be devoted:

1.	 Consolidation of disparate safety net interventions around a core set of programs, based on clear
    guiding principles.
2.	 A stronger focus on equity, identifying and building on strategies that are pro-poor and meet both
    chronic and transitory needs.
3.	 Simplifying institutional capacities to improve the delivery of social protection including less
    program fragmentation and harmonized administrative processes.
4.	 Reform of the pension system, aligned to the public administration reform strategy for the overall
    civil sector wage bill.




                                                                                                     24
Social Protection


Based on the above priorities, the following short and longer term actions might be considered:

Short Term Actions

        1.	 Prioritizing interventions. The current scenario where funding is spread thinly across
            too many programmes is highly unsustainable and ineffective. Given current economic
            challenges, it is important that government make a deliberate effort to prioritize high
            impact social protection interventions to be funded from the Exchequer.

        2.	 Maintaining progress under the HSCT: The HSCT shows the strongest potential to expand
            and be featured as the basic social safety nets platform in Zimbabwe. The strongest evidence
            of program effectiveness comes from evaluations of cash transfers programs, including
            the HSCT. An immediate priority should focus on restoring the number of beneficiary
            households in the HSCT to 51,134 (in the 19 districts).

        3.	 Reviewing social insurance programs: The review highlights the unsustainable nature
            of social insurance expenditure across the three main pensions programs. A complete
            assessment of social insurance reform options is beyond the scope of this analysis, but
            given the large financing commitments involved, further analysis would be helpful, for
            example to determine the scope for revisiting basic design parameters of core programs.
            This analysis needs to be calibrated in line with the overall public administrative reform
            of the civil service wage bill.

        4.	 Engaging with Development Partners: Development partner financing for social safety
            nets has been following a downward trend since 2010, decreasing from approximately
            84 percent to 59 percent of overall expenditure between 2010 and 2015. Development
            partners have been reluctant to fully finance programs without corresponding financial
            commitments from Government. It is also likely that development partner resources have
            shifted somewhat from social safety nets to humanitarian requirements, including the
            current El Nino. There is a need to engage development partners around the short term
            positioning of social protection, with a view to achieving buy-in for the long term reform
            agenda. Given the tight fiscal space, engagement of the international community remains
            a priority.

        5.	 Strengthening Transparency and Accountability Mechanisms: Current weaknesses
            in transparency and accountability threaten the credibility of social protection delivery
            systems and prevent programs from operating as designed. There is an urgent need to
            demonstrate that interventions are being monitored and safeguarded for their intended
            purposes. Even in the short term, programs can ensure the effective implementation of
            program-level controls (e.g. audits, operational assessments) and consider what beneficiary-
            level controls may be introduced or strengthened (e.g., grievance redress systems, citizens
            committees, scorecards). There is considerable international experience that can inform
            such efforts, including interventions in Brazil, Ethiopia and India.

Longer Term Actions

        1.	 Revising overall objectives and program mix: At the core of the longer term reform
            agenda is the prioritization of different objectives and core target groups. The review
            highlights the overall risk and vulnerability context in with social protection programs
            now in operation in Zimbabwe. The most pressing challenges seem to face children,
            underemployed youth and those facing transitory food insecurity. The current set of
            social protection programs attempt to address an array of problems, through an array of
            different programs with declining financial support. It is unclear how the National Social
            Protection policy will remedy this, even if operationalized. Greater selectivity is required
            to ensure a more refined program mix. Central to these decisions will be the future phase
            out of support for fee waivers, and agricultural input schemes.

        2.	 Follow up on Expanding the HSCT. The agreement to make HSCT the main social safety
            net platform will require expanding it to new districts, which in turn will require increasing


   25
                                                                                Social Protection


    the number of beneficiary households to about 200,000 using current targeting criteria at
    an estimated annual cost of US$40,000,000. Due to the rigorous targeting requirements,
    the expansion would need to be phased in over four to five years (adding about 30,000
    to 40,000 households every year). During the same period 10,000 to 12,000 households
    will need to be recertified.

3.	 Rationalizing institutional coordination and support for social protection: Management
    of social protection is fragmented and further rationalization is needed. The Social Transfers
    Policy Framework and the consolidation of some cash grants under the HSCT are important
    steps in the direction of building a more coherent social safety net system. However,
    responsibilities for the delivery of social protection are spread thinly across government,
    with limited financing to support capacity requirements. As policymakers consider the
    desirable set of objectives and program mix to frame social protection, a key part of this
    discussion should feature the institutional coordination mechanisms that will support
    such efforts.

4.	 Harmonizing data and information management: Programs have separate applications,
    targeting, payment, and information systems. A key priority is harmonizing data and
    information management arrangements, in the form of a single social registry for all
    MPSLSW programs. The absence of a single social registry means that beneficiary-level
    information is not readily available. Data weaknesses reduce transparency and oversight.
    In 2015, the MPSLSW with financial assistance from the World Bank started work on a
    harmonized MIS system. This is a good initiative, which urgently needs to be supported
    and finalized to enhance reporting and monitoring of programs. A key challenge in this
    review was the lack of systematized and available information, which is reflected in the lack
    of evaluative evidence to assess program effectiveness and results. As Zimbabwe enters
    a new chapter of reform, the promotion of evidence and sharing of information will be
    critical to assess program implementation, take corrective actions, and mobilize support
    across different stakeholder groups. A robust monitoring and evaluation framework will
    need to be put in place.

5.	 Longer term follow up on the pension reform agenda. The pension reform agenda is a
    longer term issue, and actions arising from immediate assessments and consultations will
    need to be operationalized, in line with overall public wage bill reform initiatives.

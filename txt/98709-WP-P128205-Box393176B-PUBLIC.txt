                  Employment and job creation
                   Labor market assessment 2007-2011

                                                  Summary

      1. Improving employment opportunities is critical to improving social and economic
         outcomes in FYR Macedonia. Although more than 60,000 jobs have been created since
         2007, employment rates remain among the lowest in Europe, and approximately 30
         percent of the active population is unemployed. Most jobs are low-earning and there has
         not been structural change towards higher productivity jobs. Some groups in the
         population are also particularly excluded. There are recent indications that the effects of
         the global economic crisis may continue to dampen economic growth in Macedonia,
         which will bring additional pressures to labor market challenges.
      2. This note forms part of a broader engagement between the World Bank and the
         Government of FYR Macedonia on how to foster more and better jobs and make sure
         that more marginalized groups – women, low earners, skilled and unskilled youth, for
         example - can participate and benefit from those jobs. It focuses on providing updated
         labor market diagnostics based on the Labor Force Surveys between 2007 and 2011. The
         findings will be used as a basis for further policy analysis. Three main conclusions emerge
         from the diagnostics:
           Whereas employment has increased, many of the new jobs are low productivity-
            offering few possibilities for earnings growth- or in the public sector. The global
            economic crisis, which began to be felt in 2009, has not resulted in a further increase in
            unemployment1; however, labor productivity has fallen, informal employment has
            grown, and wages have stalled for low earners, contributing to increasing inequality.
            Between 2007 and 2011, GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent, masking high volatility
            with growth in 2007 and 2008, a drop in 2009, and a very modest recovery in 2010 and
            beyond. Employment creation patterns, however, are partly disconnected from growth
            trends. In the same period, two out of three jobs were created in the informal sector,
            much of it in lower earning occupations in agriculture and retail trade with few
            opportunities for positive earnings dynamics. The remaining new jobs were largely
            created in the public sector where, while wages are high and growing fast, fiscal
            sustainability is a concern.
           Employment and employability challenges are different across the population, and
            tailored policy responses are needed. On the one hand, there is a divide across age

    In fact, the most recent numbers show quarterly unemployment rates just below 30 percent.

                                                                                                    2
      groups. Those aged 45 and above have lower levels of skills and are less adaptable in a
      changing economic environment; they are often long-term unemployed. Youth have
      higher access to education, but many still drop out early and are confined to informal
      sector work. Those with higher education have access to better jobs but, in the face of
      the expansion in tertiary education, face more difficulties in finding adequate
      employment, resulting in increasing rates of unemployment for this group. Beyond age
      differences, certain groups remain particularly marginalized in FYR Macedonia’s labor
      markets. In particular women, specific ethnic groups, rural inhabitants and those living
      in the eastern parts of FYR Macedonia, have very low chances of finding jobs.
   The analysis points to four policy areas that can help foster employment and earnings
    in Macedonia:
               a. Strengthening the overall investment climate to foster labor demand in
                  the formal sector – for large and small firms, and start-ups. Overall,
                  investment levels remain comparatively low, and foreign direct
                  investment has so far been concentrated in a few sectors, with limited
                  employment impact. While many reforms have been undertaken, there
                  may be remaining pockets of rigidity that could be particularly binding for
                  firms with high-growth/high-employment potential. There is also a
                  question of the extent to which employment and wage growth in the
                  public sector hamper private sector job creation.
               b. There may be a need to review disincentives for workers to work,
                  especially in formal private sector, and for both low-wage earners and
                  highly educated youth. Tax and benefit systems can influence these
                  incentives. For example, estimates suggest that for an unemployed
                  person taking up low paid work, the average effective tax rate – including
                  lost benefits - is high. Highly educated youth, on the other hand, may be
                  queuing for jobs in the public sector.
               c. Possessing the right skills, or knowing how to acquire them, is critical to
                  becoming competitive in a globally integrated world. In FYR Macedonia,
                  firms reaching international markets and higher technology firms find
                  skills find lack of skills – in particular work place skills – an obstacle to
                  doing business. Efforts to provide quality education, to keep youth in
                  school, and to encourage life-long learning, form part of a national skills
                  development strategy.
               d. Labor market institutions, including labor market regulations and active
                  labor market policies, need to better serve vulnerable or disadvantaged
                  groups and foster productivity.


3. These policy areas are going to be further explored as part of the work program on
   employment and job creation in Macedonia. In particular, follow-up analysis will focus
   on identifying the extent to which constraints in these areas-and possibly additional

                                                                                             3
ones- play a role in: (i) explaining poor overall labor market outcomes in Macedonia; and
(ii) how do these constraints lead to particularly poor labor market outcomes among
young and older workers, women, ethnic minorities and people in lagging regions.
Finally, the work program seeks to propose specific measures that can help address
these labor market challenges as part of a concrete employment strategy and action
plan.

      1. Introduction

      4. In the years after the 2001 political crisis, employment and income prospects stalled in
         FYR Macedonia. Labor market opportunities did not improve between 2000 and 2006.
         After the political and economic instabilities surrounding the civil unrest in 2001, FYR
         Macedonia experienced steadily increasing economic growth rates between 2001 and
         2006, mostly driven by manufacturing industries and services where respectively 25 and
         50 percent of the employed labor force is working. Although job creation picked up, new
         jobs did not result in improved income opportunities, however. Whereas more people
         held a job in 2006 than in 2004, most of them had taken up work in agriculture, many as
         unpaid family workers. Most of those working did not improve their income prospects
         and as a result, poverty did not fall.2
      5. Since 2006, conditions for job creation have changed, and an updated view of labor
         market developments is warranted. On the one hand, economic growth has become
         more volatile, increasing in 2007-2008, falling in 2009, and recovering moderately since
         then. On the other hand, FYR Macedonia has implemented significant reforms in the
         business environment in recent years to help increase labor demand in the formal sector
         and improve conditions for smaller enterprises.
      6. Economic growth rates increased further during 2007 and 2008, to 6.1 and 5.0 percent
         respectively, but since 2009, have fallen back in response to the global recession and
         remain vulnerable to external conditions (Figure 1a). In 2007 and 2008, economic
         growth was driven largely by domestic private domestic consumption, and to a lesser
         extent investment and exports growth. As the crisis hit, private consumption as well as
         investment fell (Annex, Figure A 1a). On the production side, the services sector – public
         and private – has been the main driver of economic growth in recent years. Value added
         in manufacturing industries – a major employer in FYR Macedonia – has been vulnerable
         to swings in external demand and as such has fluctuated significantly between years,
         while the more capital intensive non-manufacturing industry, and especially
         construction, has contributed more to economic growth as of 2009, while employment
         has stagnated or been reduced (Annex, Figure A 1b). FYR Macedonia is considered to
         have met the crisis with sound macroeconomic management,3 and economic growth has
         returned albeit to modest levels. However, a worsening in external conditions, and in
         particular stifled demand in Europe, poses significant threats to sustained recovery.
      7. FYR Macedonia’s reform efforts have paid off in an improved business climate. The
         Doing Business scores (Figure 1b) show that Macedonia’s overall business climate in
         2012 was considerably closer to the best performer (scores at 75%) than in 2005 (scores
         at under 60 percent of best performer). Most progress has been made in areas like
         starting a business, dealing with construction permits, credit and investor protection,
         while there has been less improvement in, for example, resolving insolvency or trade

                                                                                                 5
         facilitation. The country has also undertaken important reforms directly in labor markets
         including, lessening restrictions on temporary contracts, reductions in income tax and in
         social contributions and the delinking unemployment registration and health insurance.
         The level of education in the population has also continued to increase steadily and the
         share of adults (15-64) with secondary education or more grew from 45 to 49 percent
         between 2007 and 2011. All of these changes are expected to impact labor market
         developments.

  8. Increasing job opportunities and raising earnings and productivity remain critical
     challenges in Macedonia. As this note shows, only 44.6 percent of adults aged 15-64
     holds a job (formal or informal) and many jobs do not provide income opportunities that
     are sufficient to measurably increase living standards. Overall, the structure of
     employment has not changed significantly since 2007: one in five workers still works in
     agriculture. The main message emanating from this labor market assessment for 2007-
     2011 is that there is continued need to focus policy on creating better job opportunities
     overall, on increasing the employability of the population, and reaping the full potential
     of the work force by including disadvantaged groups:
               Macedonia has seen some job creation before and during the crisis , but mostly in
                informal jobs, predominantly in agriculture and (retail) trade, where productivity and
                earnings are low, or in the public sector, which in turn raises questions regarding fiscal
                sustainability. With two out of three jobs created in informal sector, labor demand in
                higher productivity and formal private sector thus remains limited.
               As in many of the former communist countries, there is a generational divide in labor
                market challenges: the older generation, with lower levels of skills and skills largely
                built for a different kind of economic system, is inactive, long-term unemployed or
                confined to low productivity work; the younger generation has mostly acquired more
                formal education but is facing difficulties in entering the labor market.

         Across all ages, some groups remain more excluded than others, especially women,
          ethnic minorities and those living in lagging regions, and particularly where these
          characteristics intersect. Since their challenges in terms of accessing jobs differ –
          across generations, gender, skills, and location – they need tailored policy responses
          spanning a wide range of areas tackling the multiplicity of employability barriers they
          face.
    9. The diagnostics below are based primarily on data from labor force survey from 2007-
       2011.4 These data thus include a period of comparatively high economic growth (2007-
       2008) followed by the economic crisis, whose impacts began to be felt more strongly as
       of 2009.
    10. The remainder of this note is organized as follows. Section two describes labor market
        developments since 2007 and the conditions prevailing in 2011. Subsequent sections
        address the remaining challenges and key policy options. The third section thus focuses
        on raising productivity – critical to national economic development and to ensure
        sustainable increases in earnings over time in Macedonia. The fourth section discusses
        the generational divide in terms of challenges in labor market opportunities for the
        younger versus older generations. The fifth section looks at workers that are particularly
        disadvantaged in the labor market with a particular focus on women. The sixth section
        concludes with the policy levers that may help Macedonia move forward on the jobs
        agenda.

  There is much discussion on the measurement of labor market indicators, especially unemployment, in
Macedonia. Part of the discussion is related to differences in the data source used (LFS versus unemployment
registry) and another part to issues of interpretation of what constitutes a job in Macedonia. For this note, the
team relies on primarily analysis from the labor force survey, which captures both formal and informal
employment, and is the internationally accepted tool for measuring unemployment. The unemployment rate is
estimated at 32 percent for 2011 with the LFS. The unemployment rate calculated using the registry of
unemployed produces a similar rate, although the number has decreased significantly in recent months partly due
to stricter enforcement of active search prerequisites. Cross-tabulations of the LFS data show that almost three
quarters of the registered unemployed are also unemployed according to the ILO definition, while the rest is either
informally employed (15 percent) or inactive (11 percent). However, one fifth of those unemployed in the LFS do
not register as unemployed. This means that while the unemployment rate according to the LFS and the one
obtained from the unemployment registry are of similar magnitudes, this is the consequence of errors of exclusion
and inclusion that pretty much cancel each other. In the future, as the unemployment registry is further
streamlined, it will be particularly important to focus on the LFS measure of unemployment. Beyond the data
sources used, there is still a question on whether survey respondents in Macedonia report all types of
employment, even if casual or informal. Calculations with the most recent time-use survey in Macedonia, which
possibly captures better whether individuals carry out any type of economic activity, yields an unemployment rate
of approximately 32 percent—that is, very similar to the one from the LFS. The team has also started a qualitative
survey that will, among other things, try to better understand how people understand LFS questions and whether
it fails or not to capture employment. All in all, it is clear that labor market attachment is a continuum in
Macedonia, with flows from unemployment to inactivity and informality being quite common, and with
employment masking significant under-employment. The existing evidence suggests that, even if the actual open
unemployment rate is not exactly 32 percent is most likely still extremely high and not too far from this number.

    2. Labor market developments 2007-2011

    11. Nearly 60,000 jobs were created in net terms between 2007 and 2011, resulting in an
        increase in employment rates and a reduction in unemployment. 5 The share of
        employed persons in the adult population increased from 41.2 to 44.6 percent, while
        unemployment rates fell from 36 percent in 2007 to 32.7 percent in 2009, and continued
        to fall (albeit less) to 32 percent in 2011 (Figure 1a).
    12. Most jobs of the net jobs created were in agriculture (self-employment), trade
        (especially retail) and the public sector. Sixty percent of the net jobs created since 2007
        were in these sectors: 27.1 percent in agriculture, 13 percent in retail trade and 19.7
        percent in the public sector (Figure 2b). These amount to two different sources of job
        creation – low skill, low productivity agriculture and retail trade (also with productivity
        below average)6; and public sector hiring, especially for the tertiary employed, which
        raises questions about fiscal sustainability and potential crowding out of private sector
        job creation.
    13. Half of all new jobs went to the tertiary educated . Although they make up less than one
        quarter of the total employed labor force in Macedonia, the tertiary educated accounted
        for 51 percent of all net jobs created in the period 2007-2011. Many of these jobs went
        to the young tertiary educated (age group 25-34), although older workers, just before
        retirement, also increased their share of employment. All this reinforces the impression
        of a dual job creation process whereby some of the tertiary educated have been taking
        up jobs in the public sector, and some tertiary together with less skilled workers have
        been left to find jobs or create their own sources of living in the informal sector,
        especially agriculture and informal trade. Nonetheless, the tertiary educated were the
        only group that saw an increase in unemployment rates (Table A 3), reflecting an
        expansion in tertiary education that is not been fully absorbed by the Macedonian labor
        market.

  Jobs are created and destroyed. We refer here to net job creation to indicate that this is jobs created minus jobs
destroyed.

  Structural transformation analysis indicates that these sectors are below-average productivity in Macedonia.
Indeed, on average, the sectors that expanded in terms of employment between 1997 and 2009 were not the
most productive sectors.

14. The global economic crisis, which reached Macedonia in 2009, has affected labor
    markets less through open unemployment and more through productivity losses and a
    shift into more jobs with lower quality. In comparison with other countries in the ECA
    region, the global recession has so far had a smaller impact on unemployment and labor
    market participation in Macedonia (Figure A1). While GDP fell in 2009 and grew at less
    than 2 percent in 2010, the economic crisis has not yet resulted in large lay-offs (on a net
    basis) relative to the shock. As seen in Figure 2b above, some 16,000 additional jobs
    were in fact created in 2010 and 2011, in spite of the worsening economic climate.
15. As a result, unemployment has not increased markedly during the global crisis.
    Quarterly data from the ILO show a limited rise around the end of 2009, when the crisis
    began to be felt, but this was subsequently reversed. Between the first quarter of 2011
    and the second quarter of 2012 (most recent data), unemployment rates increased
    modestly from 30.8 to 31.2 percent (Figure 3a). However, panel data also shows that the
    tendency for the unemployed as well as the informally employed to drop out of the labor
    market increased during the crisis (Figure 3b). If the economic crisis deepens,
    unemployment rates may rise more decisively – or more low productivity jobs could be
    created.

    16. Labor productivity, in contrast, has fallen in response to the crisis, and is yet to recover
       fully. As there was no adjustment through job losses and unemployment, the negative
       output shock registered in 2009 and 2010 resulted in a marked fall in GDP per worker of
       about 5 percent. Although labor productivity has since been increasing, it has not yet
       recovered to the 2007 levels (Figure 4a).
    17. Informal employment increased markedly in response to the crisis.7 While unpaid labor
        did not surge in the wake of the crisis, the share of informally employed increased from
        28 to 32 percent between 2007 and 2011 (Figure 4b). Informal employment in
        agriculture and retail trade, which is mostly informal, thus accounted for a significant
        share – over 40 percent – of net jobs created in this period. The shift into more informal
        forms of employment suggests that Macedonia’s generally poor labor market prospects,
        compounded by the effect of the crisis, may have led Macedonian workers to take up
        employment where they can find one. While many in the informal sector earn as much
        as those in the formal sector, the informal sector generally offers lower wages (Figure
        4c).

 Informal employment is defined as workers who are employed in unregistered businesses, who are without
social security (specifically without pension insurance fund) or who are unpaid family workers.

18. The gender gap in employment rates remains largely unchanged. As of 2011, 52 percent
    of all men aged 15-64 were employed, compared to 37 percent of all women (Annex,
    Table A4). As discussed in detail in Gamberoni and Posadas (2013), also part of this labor
    market assessment, the gender employment gap stems mostly from the very low labor
    force participation of women, especially among those with lower levels of formal
    education.
19. The formal private non-agricultural sector is not creating sufficient jobs for the
    Macedonian population. There is no transformation of labor markets in favor of higher
    skilled private sector jobs. Net job creation in 2007-2011 did not improve the situation.
    Most job creation was informal, in agriculture and trade, or in public sector (Figure 5a).
    This phenomenon is partly but not solely an outcome of the economic crisis, as
    informality and low quality job creation was on the rise even before 2009. In 2011,
    agriculture continued to absorb one in five employed persons, informality is rising and
    affects one in three workers, one in ten workers is an unpaid family worker, and one in
    ten is only temporarily employed.
20. Limited access to employment and poor earnings prospects remain key problems for
    many groups. Most of the new jobs were for those with tertiary education, but many of
    them took up jobs in lower skill sectors as well. Macedonia is still an outlier in terms of

                                                                                                                                                                                         11
          low access to employment (Figure 5b). As will be discussed below, beyond overall poor
          labor market outcomes, the exceptionally low participation rates of women in some
          areas, high youth unemployment and inactivity rates and low participation and earnings
          for older workers point to the difficult situation.

    3. The remaining challenges: An agenda for action

  21. In spite of some important achievements (improvements in the business climate, higher
      growth until the crisis, broad economic reforms, including in the labor market),
      Macedonia is faced with continued difficulties in the labor market. There are key
      challenges on the labor demand and labor supply side. On the demand side, Macedonia
      needs many more private sector productive jobs that can pay better. On the supply side,
      more needs to be done to open up employment opportunities for the entire population,
      including more vulnerable or disadvantage groups, and particularly among young and
      older workers.


Challenge #1: Promoting sustainable, higher productivity, higher paying jobs
  22. Raising labor productivity is important to sustain competitiveness and earnings
      increases in parallel. Growth in output per worker is important to support increases in
      workers’ earnings together with international competitiveness. Labor productivity can
      increase through a restructuring of the labor market across sectors (for example, workers
      shift out of low productivity agriculture into higher productivity jobs in the non-
      agricultural sectors), through productivity increases within sectors (workers shift from
      low productivity to higher productivity firms or become more productive within the
      same firms), or both. Policy actions are needed to stimulate the creation of higher


                                                                                                                                  12
          productivity jobs, to prepare workers with skills so they can access such jobs, and also to
          increase productivity also in the low productivity sectors, where most workers are likely
          to remain within the foreseeable future.
      23. Workers have not been moving into higher productivity sectors in Macedonia. The
          employment structure in Macedonia has remained relatively static. Agricultural
          employment – where labor productivity is lowest in the economy - increased slightly,
          from 17 to 18 percent of total employment, while the share of industry fell from 33 to 30
          percent of employment. Overall, agriculture and public administration accounted for
          almost half of all new jobs in the period. Lack of structural change in the labor market
          effectively holds back labor productivity growth. Disaggregated analysis shows that the
          employment structure did not change in favor of higher productivity and that labor
          productivity growth was in fact muted by shifts of workers into less productive activities
          such as agriculture and low productivity services (Annex, Table A5).8
      24. Labor productivity was beginning to catch up with that of European peers before the
          crisis, but convergence has slowed down. GDP per person employed increased up until
          the onset of the economic crisis. Since the recession did not result in large lay-offs, at
          least on a net basis, employment was protected from the shock. Instead, labor markets
          adjusted through labor productivity which dropped in 2009. In spite of a modest
          recovery in 2010 and 2011, labor productivity remains comparatively low in Macedonia,
          at sixty percent of the EU27 average (Figure 6a).
      25. Wages have continued to increase, however. As the economic crisis did not affect
          employment numbers, labor markets might have adjusted to output shocks through a
          reduction in earnings. However, median wages increased instead (Figure 6b)– indicating
          a loss in competitiveness over time (private sector) and issues of fiscal sustainability and
          incentives systems (public sector).

26. Inequality in overall earnings also increased. Median earnings increased most
    significantly in higher earning jobs, such as the finance sectors, and in the public sector.
    However, earnings remained more static for lower earning categories such as those
    employed in agriculture, trade or manufacturing (Figure 7a). Median wages are now fifty
    percent higher in public administration than in manufacturing, and growing significantly
    faster. These trends are also consistent with the pattern of an increase in “distress work?
    in low earning occupations, as additional inflows of workers without better opportunities
    may have been depressing overall earnings. Additional analysis shows that returns to
    education also have increased more for the tertiary educated than for less skilled
    workers, further emphasizing the divergence between higher earning and lower earning
    groups (Figure 7b).

              more generous additional pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits and more job security in
              the public sector. As seen in Figures 8a and 8b, the wage gap has grown further in recent
              years as a result of the very significant increase in public sector wages.
          28. The relatively high levels and recent growth in public sector wages raise several
              questions. First, whether Macedonia’s public finances can sustain public wage increases
              at a time when the country is facing economic difficulties and the future looks uncertain.
              Second and related, whether wage increases should be a priority at a time when other
              forms of government spending to stimulate both demand and supply may be needed to
              avoid further recession and for stimulating long-term growth. Finally, such high wage
              increases in combination with public hiring, may be raising reservations wages- especially
              for the young and educated. In fact, the public-private earnings gap is higher for younger
              workers at the early stages of their careers than for older workers – that is, experience
              pays off relatively more in the private than the public sector or more productive workers
              move to the private sector after some experience in government (Figures 8a and b). This
              is particularly the case for women, who enjoy substantially higher wages and more equal
              pay with men in the public than in the private sector. Taken together with the expansion
              in public employment and the increase in unemployment rates among the tertiary
              employed, this begs the overall questions of whether (i) public wages have become a
              disincentive for younger and more educated workers to take up a job in the private
              sector; and (ii) whether the public sector is further crowding out the private sector by
              pushing wage growth above that of labor productivity and making the expansion of
              employment in the private sector simply uncompetitive.

              Figure 8: Public wages have increased much more than private wages and are overall
                          considerably higher – especially for the young and educated

                 29. Low labor productivity and lack of dynamism in the private sector is still a major
                     problem in Macedonia. Workers are not shifting into sectors with higher productivity,
                     and public sector hiring appears to have taken on the responsibility to absorb more of
                     the tertiary educated – which may further distort incentives to accept less paid work in
                     the private sector and encourage unemployment and queuing among the tertiary
                     educated. Increasing labor demand in sectors with higher productivity and earnings is,
                     therefore, necessary to improve labor market conditions.
                 30. Investment levels (domestic and foreign) need to increase to sustain higher growth
                     rates. Notwithstanding improvements in the business climate, investment levels in FYR
                     Macedonia remain at around 20 percent of GDP which is low in relation to comparator
                     countries. The Macedonian economy has succeeded in attracting more foreign direct
                     investment, but is still lagging behind other countries such as Albania, Bulgaria and
                     Serbia (Annex, Figure A 2 a and b).
                 31. Boosting labor demand is a key issue. Past experiences suggest that higher growth is an
                     important but not sufficient condition for the creation of more and more productive
                     jobs. Beyond fostering investment, it will be vital to consider how to ensure that firms
                     have the incentives to respond to stimulus with hiring, or that entrepreneurship, firm
                     start-up and viability of high-growth firms are supported.


               Challenge #2: Providing employment opportunities for the younger
               generation
                 32. Labor market opportunities and vulnerability to shocks differ between generations –
                     most significantly between those born into transition, and those who entered labor
                     markets before the transition. There is a generational divide in endowments especially in
                     level and kind of skills. Other studies of transition countries show that different cohorts
                     have different views on the opportunities and value offered by the market economy




                                                                                                                                                                                                16
          system.9 In Macedonia, the youngest (15-24) and the older (45+) generations are less
          likely to be active and employed, but also proved more vulnerable to the economic crisis,
          showing a much higher propensity than the age group 25-44 to drop out of the labor
          market as conditions worsened in 2009 and 2010.
      33. A multifaceted approach is needed to address generational differences in labor market
          challenges. Youth- both those with less education, and those with higher levels of
          education – need help to access jobs that provide useful work experience, sufficient pay,
          and potential for earnings mobility in the future. Older generations, stuck with different,
          often lower and less adaptable skills, similarly need help to improve their opportunities
          on the labor market.
      34. Youth is a heterogeneous group with some less educated, working in the informal
          sector, and some more educated, disproportionately affected by unemployment. They
          confront different challenges and constraints. For the youngest labor market entrants,
          lack of skills and opportunities to gain work experience, means few good jobs are
          available. For young women, in addition, social norms and lack of flexible work
          arrangements, means that childbearing keeps them early out of the labor force.10 For
          those with tertiary education, problems of relevance and quality of education, low labor
          demand in the private sector, and high reservation wages, slow down labor market
          insertion.
      35. Youth unemployment rates remain exceptionally high in Macedonia . Affecting more
          than half (56 percent) of the active population aged 15-24, it is 24 percentage points
          higher than the adult unemployment rate. Macedonia’s youth unemployment problem is
          an outlier in the regional context. While unemployment rates are highest among the very
          youngest (ages 15-19), this group only accounts for four percent of the total number of
          unemployed – most are still in school at this age. In contrast, those aged 20-29 account
          for one third of all unemployed (with the age group 30-34 accounting for another 13
          percent). The rapid increase in the number of unemployed after age 20 is the result of
          inflows of more educated youth among the unemployed. These groups are likely to face
          different challenges.
      36. The youngest labor market entrants (as well as the oldest workers) are
          overrepresented in informal work, as a result of lack of other opportunities. Less
          educated youth enter the labor market earlier than those who go on to university. Most
          of them remain unemployed, and those that find employed predominantly do so in the
          informal sector (Figure 9a). In fact, three out of four of employed youth with less than
          secondary education are in the informal sector. However, informal work is not
          necessarily a transitional phase to more productive and formal jobs, especially when
          conditions worsen as during the economic crisis. Since experience in the informal sector
          may be less valuable for the formal sector, or the experience is difficult to formalize – for
          example through trade certification – it may be difficult to move later to formal

          to drop out of the labor force compared as they were between 2008 and 2009. Their
          propensity to drop out of the labor market was also nearly four times as high as workers
          aged 25-44.
     37. More than one out of four youth is neither working nor studying. There is little
         evidence that labor force dropouts are re-absorbed into the education systems. About 25
         percent of those aged 15-24 are neither working nor studying in Macedonia. The share is
         higher than in other South Eastern European countries like Bulgaria or Romania (Figure
         9b).

     38. Unemployment rates of educated youth are increasing. Meanwhile, the potential
         supply of highly educated workers has continued to increase: driven partly by an increase
         in education among younger generations, the share of tertiary educated in the working
         age population(15-64) increased by four percentage points between 2007 and 2011 and
         by 2011, half of the working age population in Macedonia had finished at least secondary
         education. Those with tertiary education are the only group to have seen an increase in
         unemployment rates since 2007, although they remain considerably lower than
         unemployment rates for those with secondary or lower levels of education.
     39. At the same time, most new jobs in expanding sectors12 have been going to the
         younger and more educated generation. Between 2007 and 2011, one in three new jobs
         (net) went to somebody aged between 25 and 34, although they make up only one fifth
         of the working age population.


11
   Transition matrices, not presented here but available from the authors, show that moving from informal into
formal employment can be difficult in Macedonia (compared with, for example, in Serbia). Workers in the informal
sector are also disproportionately likely to move into inactivity.
12
   Expanding sectors is defined here as sectors which have above-average labor productivity in the country and
which also have been growing in terms of employment in a sustained manner (between 1997 and 2009).

                                                                                                                                                   18
40. Together with rising returns to tertiary education, including among youth, this suggests
    a segmented market even among educated youth: some with good prospects and some
    with very poor ones. Several potential factors may cause such segmentation. One is a
    limited number of well-paid jobs, notably in the public sector, that are rationed among
    job seekers. Another is variation in the quality of education - including the provision of
    workplace and people skills - that is not reflected in years of education completed.
41. As discussed above, public administration has been increasing employment and has
    particularly absorbed the educated youth 25+ group. Educated youth have been taking
    up a relatively high share of new, high-paying, jobs, many of them in the public
    administration. The dominance of public administration hiring for this group in
    combination with the wage premium (at younger ages) for working in the public sector,
    may in fact be discouraging educated youth from looking for a job in the private sector or
    finding self-employment.
42. Meanwhile, the private sector finds difficulties in recruiting the right competences. A
   recent World Bank labor demand study showed that Macedonian firms find many young
   workers lacking essential skills, despite formal education. In particular, firms emphasize
   lack of workplace skills, such as team work, discipline and organizational capabilities
   (World Bank, 2010) over more technical skills. This is in line with other research which
   suggests that such non-cognitive or socio-emotional skills are at least as important as
   cognitive skills in determining as well academic success as socio-economic success over
   life time (Heckman, 2008). Critically, recent interventions have shown that such non-
   cognitive abilities can actually be developed and encouraged, beyond the very first years
   of a person’s life.
43. In conclusion, young school drop outs have few options in Macedonia today; they are
    unemployed, inactive, or stuck in low productivity jobs. Those that can and do get a
    higher education still have trouble finding suitable employment, while at the same time,
    local companies face difficulties in identifying skilled workers among youth. Educated
    youth can benefit from a school system that is more geared towards providing the
    “right? skills for employment and productivity rather than just diplomas and that build
    broad skills that can be easily transferable across occupations and sectors. In addition,
    youth could benefit from more targeted assistance in identifying job opportunities, and
    signaling their competencies to potential employers. Early school drop-outs, which show
    up in unemployment statistics for 15-24 year olds, in high rates of informality, and low
    activity rates, need assistance in returning to the education system and finding other
    training opportunities to continue to build skills that can enhance their value on the
    labor market. The young generation thus faces challenges in both the area of skills
    development, and in accessing jobs:
   Building labor market relevant skills development systems. The case of Macedonia as
    well as the international experience suggests that formal education systems often are
    disconnected from labor market needs, that they lack focus on broad work place skills
    and practical application of learning, and that students are either unaware of, or lack
    incentives to choose, vocations that may have higher employment and earnings

                                                                                           19
         possibilities. At the same time, returns to education have been increasing. Curriculum
         reform and improving information and labor market feed-back, including career
         counseling, together with a stronger involvement of the private sector in some of the
         skills development, may go some way towards reducing these mismatches.13
        Help school drop-outs re-enter the education system. While more youth stay longer in
         education than before, those who drop out early face dire work prospects, most likely
         with little earnings mobility over time. Means of avoiding drop-outs in the first place, e.g.
         by providing more information on returns to education, and of providing these students
         with “second chances? to re-enter the education system, or to find suitable vocational
         training, could play an important role.
        Improving labor market information and incentives systems . More work is needed to
         understand the extent of labor market mismatches and information gaps in Macedonia.
         Although low overall labor demand is the key issue, problems may be compounded if
         students and workers cannot signal competencies, or if there is a lack of interface
         between employers and employees. More demand for labor and improved labor market
         information will not be sufficient, however, if the incentives systems are not compatible
         with formal work. For example, the high and growing wages paid in and the expansion of
         employment in the public sector is likely to raise reservation wages for the educated; the
         tax system, discuss below, on the other hand, penalizes low-wage earners who are often
         youth.


Challenge #3: Helping the older generation get into work and remain working
longer
     44. Macedonia’s population is aging and there is and will be a need to prolong the
         productive working life of workers. The old-age dependency rate is projected to
         increase: in 2010, the ratio of old age persons (65+) over working age (20-64) was still
         less than 0.2, but by 2030, the ratio is expected to have increased to 0.3 and further to
         0.5 by 2050, according to UN population data. In the absence of a well-functioning public
         or private safety net systems for those of old age, lack of access to employment may
         mean significant reductions in welfare and high vulnerability for the elderly. With more
         appropriate and wide covering safety nets, however, early retirement is not fiscally
         sustainable. The implication is that workers need to remain active longer. Aging
         populations also raise issues of how to maintain productivity over the extended working
         life, both in terms of continued skills retraining and upgrading, and in terms of health.
     45. Older generations differ from younger generations in skills and labor market prospects.
         People above 45 years of age are less educated and most entered the labor market
         before the transition to market economy began in the early 1990s. Hence, their skills set
         – both from school and from on-the-job training – and their flexibility to adapt to new

  Further work under this TA on skills measurement and institutional diagnoses in the education sector will help in
further pinning down specific interventions that can be helpful in this area.

                                                                                                                20
      labor market challenges differs from that of more recent cohorts. Many are long-term
      unemployed, with more than 90 percent of the unemployed in this group, being
      unemployed for over a year and mostly for over four years. They have been
      disproportionally excluded from net job creation in the period 2007-2011, especially in
      expanding sectors. The differences to younger cohorts are most acute for workers above
      55 years of age.
46. Older workers are more likely to be out of the labor market all together. Labor force
    participation rates for those older than 45 years old are lower than for younger
    generations (82 percent for those aged 25 – 44 versus 63 percent for those aged 45 –
    64). The differences are more important for women than for men. For the age group
    above 55 years of age and below 64, participation in labor market drops significantly
    compared to others: only two out of three men in this age group and less than one in
    three women, are still active in the labor market.
47. Those that work are confined to less productive jobs and are less able to move out of
    low earning traps than younger workers. Those aged above 55 that are employed are
    more likely than other groups, except the very youngest, to work informally, with lower
    earnings and without job security (Figure 10a). Transition analysis shows that their labor
    market mobility (from not working to working for pay, or from low earning to higher
    earning jobs), is lower than for younger age groups.
48. Older workers are more vulnerable in times of crisis. Workers aged 45 or above, as the
    youngest ones, were particularly vulnerable when the crisis set in. Those in the 45+ age
    group who were unemployed in 2010 were twice as likely as prime-age workers to leave
    the labor force, and less likely to get a job; they were also three times more likely to drop
    out than they had been between 2008 and 2009 (Figure 10b).

49. The main challenge with older workers is upgrading their skills to become active job
    seekers or self-employed, to prolong their productive working lives and to make a

                                                                                                                                                     21
          gradual transition out of the labor force over time. For many, however, the flexibility
          and capacity to be completely retrained for a new type of economic system, especially if
          long-term unemployed, must be considered limited. Thus, they face three particular
          challenges:
         Fostering entrepreneurship and job search among those with recent work experience
          and skills that can be upgraded, and providing special assistance for the long term
          inactive or unemployed. Older workers with some, albeit limited, work experience may
          with some support be able to tap into this to create their own firms. Promoting activities
          that address critical constraints to firm creation (including business skills and credit, but
          also rules and institutions that govern firms’ bankruptcy procedures ), and incentive
          systems that encourage formal work rather than unemployment or informal activities,
          are likely to be important. However, this approach is unlikely to succeed for those that
          have very weak labor market attachment. For this group, policy decisions are particularly
          difficult: There may be a role for industrial policy to identify sectors – for example, in the
          manufacturing sector – where the older generation’s skill-set can be valuable and
          upgraded without high transaction costs but with employment being effectively
          subsidized. However, the cost of this approach would need to be carefully weighed
          against the social and economic costs of other options such as safety net dependence
          and inactivity.
         Devising skills development strategies that address older workers’ constraints. This
          may include programs that offer training/retraining in market relevant skills. It may also
          include programs that help firms invest in continued skills building of their workers, on-
          the-job and through shorter training opportunities, including for older workers.
          Importantly, these retraining programs would need to be adapted to the needs and
          changes in the learning process that take place through the life-cycle.
         Encouraging flexible work arrangements, including part time work, for those that wish
          to reduce their work load but need to remain active to some extent.


Challenge #4: Getting Women and Disadvantaged Groups into Work
      50. While finding employment is difficult for a majority of Macedonians, there are
          significant inequalities in labor markets – women, certain ethnic groups, and certain
          areas are disfavored, especially when these characteristics are intertwined. Women have
          less access to labor markets in the first place: they are less likely to be active but
          nonetheless face the same unemployment rates as men, meaning that their employment
          rates are about 15 percentage points lower than those of men. Moreover, employed
          women earn less on their jobs than men—even after accounting for differences in
          education, age, location, sector and occupation, although inequalities have been reduced
          over time14.



14
     The gender analysis draws on Gamberoni and Posadas (2013), also part of this labor market assessment.

                                                                                                             22
   51. Half of all adult women in Macedonia are not active in the labor market and the gap
       with men is high by international standards. Partly, Macedonia’s low employment rates
       are explained by the low participation of women. Almost three quarters of adult men are
       active in the labor market, which is about the same share as in as other countries in
       Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA). However, only about one in two women in
       Macedonia are active, compared to an average of about 60 percent in ECA.
   52. The participation of women varies dramatically depending on education, age, and
       ethnic group. The least educated, the youngest and the very oldest women are the least
       likely to participate in labor markets (Figures 11a and 11b), possibly reflecting partly the
       impact of family and childcare responsibilities. In fact, women with tertiary education are
       just as likely as men to be active (91 percent). The gap to male participation is highest for

   53. Women are constrained by family obligations. While men reportedly stay out of the
       labor force to study or to retire early, women are more likely to be bound to the home
       by essential household and child and elderly care chores that are difficult to combine


                                                                                                                                                                                                 23
        with market work if there is are no affordable child and elderly care services, few options
        for flexible work arrangements or very traditional social norms. Married women,
        especially with younger children, spend between 5 and 6 times as much time on
        domestic activities as men with the same family situation. Almost half of all women
        report to be inactive because of family reasons, compared to only a few percent of men.
        The role of household chores and family is mirrored, for example, in comparatively low
        enrollment in pre-school child care, with gross enrolment rates for the 3.6 age group at
        25 percent.
     54. Much of the gender gap in labor force participation is driven by differences across
         regions and ethnic groups. Data from 2006 show that while the gender gap is
         comparatively small in Southern and Western parts (Strumica, Bitola, and Shtip), it is
         exceptionally high in Northern and Eastern areas. In Tetovo (where many ethnic
         Albanians live), less than 20 percent of women are active in the labor market, resulting in
         a gap to men of over 50 percentage points.
     55. Different groups face different constraints and incentives in participating, however. For
         example, both inactive women and men cite lack of access to networks as a reason for
         not looking for employment (World Bank, 2009). However, while women from Serbian
         and Macedonian ethnic groups point to age and marital status, ethnic Albanian women
         emphasize more significantly the restrictive role of traditional norms with regards to
         female employment. The same norms may also reduce girls’ access to education as their
         future pay-off is not expected to be high. Highly educated women from these groups
         may also look for public sector work exclusively, with guaranteed benefits and what is
         considered more appropriate working conditions.15
     56. Once they work outside the home, there are also significant gender differences in
         employment choices/ options. Although both men and women are most likely to be in
         wage employment than in any other form of work, there are gender differences. One in
         six employed women is still an unpaid family worker, less than one in ten is self-
         employed, compared to more than one in four men. On the other hand, women are less
         likely to be in the informal sector, although the differences are smaller for older workers.
         Women are more concentrated in manufacturing and in social sectors while men are in
         trade and construction. This means that women and men are likely to be affected
         differently by shocks. The recent decline of the industrial sector is likely to have affected
         women more, while the slowdown in construction is more likely to have affected men.
     57. Part of the earning gaps between men and women, among ethnic groups, and among
         regions are due to differences in their characteristics, but part of it remains
         unexplained. The gender earnings gap has fallen from 18 percent in 2006 to 10 percent
         in 2011. If the influence of ethnicity, education, and different job characteristics are
         accounted for, the gap narrows but does not disappear. The remainder of the earnings
         gap is given by differences in returns to those characteristics. For example, the industries
         women work in do not, in general, pay worse (the opposite, in fact). But within those
15
   Ongoing qualitative work on gender, labor markets and economic mobility in Macedonia will help shed more
light into the barriers, and also opportunities, to increase female employability.

                                                                                                        24
    industries, women are paid less perhaps because they are in less well paid occupations,
    or because of discriminatory practices in wage setting. Although there are differences in
    educational attainment between different groups, employment outcomes are also
    affected by local opportunities. Regression analysis across these groups also leaves part
    of the different gaps unexplained.
58. Differences in employment outcomes across regions have increased over time,
    suggesting a potential role for increased internal labor mobility . In 2010,
    unemployment rates reached 63 percent in the northeast, compared to 32 percent for
    the country as a whole, which points to very limited labor mobility. Although more work
    is needed to understand the reasons behind this, the overall poor labor market prospects
    in Macedonia (even in relatively “better? performing regions) intertwined with the
    concentration of some ethnic groups in certain regions are likely to play an important
    role. This is one area where data constraints have limited a more in-depth analysis.
59. These groups with poorer labor market outcomes need to be included and accorded
    special attention in labor market policy interventions. More inclusive labor markets are
    not only good for social cohesion, but it is also good economics: good for overall
    productivity and living standards. The following areas deserve attention:
   What is the role of labor market institutions? Macedonian labor laws, for example,
    provide for long maternity leave, limited working time/shifts for women, and lower
    retirement ages for women. While intended to protect women’s rights, it may be
    important to understand the unintended effects that these regulations can have on
    female employment.
   What is the role of tax and benefit incentives and other determinants of reservation
    wages? Reservation wages may be higher than the market wage due to tax and public
    safety net systems that disproportionately tax low-wage, part-time and second-earners;
    private safety nets in the form of subsistence farming or remittances can also be
    important, as also the public sector discussed earlier.
   What role does the lack of affordable child and elderly care services and flexible work
    arrangements play in determining labor market inequalities? Beyond labor regulations
    and tax and benefit systems, women and disadvantaged groups appear to face additional
    barriers related to lack of complementary services and work environments that are
    suited to the different needs and preferences of non-male prime age workers. Judging
    from focus group responses, for example, the lack of pre-school options and elderly care
    affect female labor force participation as well as women’s lower access to further
    training, in Macedonia, but cultural constraints and different views on household
    responsibilities may also be binding. Revisiting the rules, institutions and incentives
    governing part-time, home-based or seasonal work, for example, can also be relevant.
   What constrains labor market mobility for certain groups? As mentioned above, this is
    one area where further work is needed; what is clear, however, is that there is room for
    increased geographic mobility from lagging to leading regions. The international
    evidence suggests that constraints to internal labor mobility span from the functioning of

                                                                                           25
    the housing and rental markets and the depth of the credit and mortgage markets to
    issues related to language, skills, infrastructure, industrial and regional policy, networks
    and information asymmetries.
   Critically, updated and disaggregated labor market information will be necessary to
    understand and address these constraints. Evidence-based policy making requires
    timely information. Existing data suggests, for example, that the extent and form of job
    challenges vary significantly across ethnicity and regions and that analysis based on
    national averages may in fact be misleading. Collecting and actively using labor market
    data representative of these groups to inform policy remains a challenge. Similarly,
    improving data collection on wages is important. Finally, quantitative data collection
    efforts need to be complemented with regular qualitative work that provides
    information on issues difficult to assess through quantitative instruments.


4. What can policy do? An initial discussion

60. What policy levers are available to address the considerable challenge of providing
    more and better employment opportunities to the entire population in Macedonia?
    There is still room for significant improvements in employment rates and access to
    income opportunities. Business climate reforms have moved ahead in some areas, but
    less so in others. The population is becoming more educated, but at the same time,
    unemployment rates for tertiary educated have increased, while firms report difficulties
    in finding qualified workers. This suggests both skills and incentives can be an issue in
    slow employment creation. Four main areas for further analysis and policy development
    emanate from the analysis (
61. Figure 1212):
   How to provide an investment climate that fosters job creation in the private sector,
    especially among firms with high-growth and high-employment potential;
   How to increase incentives to work and to hire workers, especially through the tax and
    benefits systems;
   How to improve overall human capital and promote access to life-long learning for all
    groups;
   How to make labor market institutions, including labor market regulations and active
    labor market policies, better serve vulnerable or disadvantaged groups and foster
    productivity?
62. In addition, to ensure competitiveness, growth and improved employment outcomes,
    moving the structure of production and employment towards higher value added and
    higher productivity activities is critical. However, such a transition will take time, and not
    all workers will be equipped with the right skills, or will not be able to move to job
    creating areas and sectors. For the short- to medium term, much of the employed


                                                                                               26
   population will continue to depend on low productivity activities. Ways of improving
   their situation – for example by looking at how to increase agricultural productivity, or
   addressing constraints for micro-firms and own account workers in the informal sector,
   will be necessary from both an economic, inequality and poverty reduction perspective.
63. Improving data collection is a transversal theme. As discussed above, the marked
    difference in labor market conditions across different ethnic groups and regions evident
    in earlier labor market data – and a well-known feature of today’s labor markets – also
    emphasize the need to continue collecting labor force survey data that can allow for
    analysis along regional and ethnic dimensions.

64. The remainder of the work program focuses on four different areas for further analysis.
    The general labor market assessment presented in this note points to a series of possible
    constraints to job creation, employment and productivity growth. These will focus on
    both supply and demand issues, and will be explored more in depth over the coming
    months.
65. What constraints do firms face to hiring workers, especially those that could have
    above average labor productivity and employment growth and that could offer job
    creation and better income opportunities? Labor demand is, in part, a function of a
    favorable investment climate, including stable macroeconomic and political situation,

                                                                                              27
             financial systems and rule of law. Enterprise surveys show that competition with the
             informal sector and access to finance are key obstacles to (manufacturing) firms (Figure
             13a). Although the skills of the workforce are not a critical concern by comparison, there
             is still evidence of some labor market inefficiencies, beyond lack of labor demand. For
             example, a relatively high share of Macedonian firms report difficulties in recruiting
             workers at the same time as over thirty percent of the active population is unemployed
             (Figure 13b).

     66. Further analysis will focus on understanding the characteristics of firms in Macedonia,
         which ones are creating jobs and which ones are leading in terms of labor productivity,
         what their constraints are, and what the constraints to entrepreneurship and productive
         self-employment are. This analysis will also need to look at the different skills needs that
         different sectors present, with a view to making labor market opportunities inclusive
         across age and other individual characteristics.
     67. How can skills be broadened and increased? Technological and organizational change
         and innovation call for new types of skills, and the ability to change skills sets in response
         to changes. This is especially true for firms with international linkages and those closer to
         the technological frontier (Figure 14). Education and training systems need to be
         responsive to these changing skills requirements, and perhaps more importantly build
         the cognitive and non-cognitive skills that facilitate adaptability over the working life.

68. There is still not enough known about the kind of skills that are available – the survey
    quoted above suggested that lack of non-cognitive skills was a problem –what the skills
    mismatches are, or on how to encourage labor market relevant skills development in
    school, at work, and in non-formal or informal systems. Getting a better sense of what is
    the distribution of cognitive, non-cognitive, technical skills in different population
    groups, how do people usually acquire these skills, and which are the skills that are best
    rewarded in the labor market is critical. A skills measurement survey among households
    and employers in underway in Macedonia.
69. What role do tax and benefit systems play in discouraging labor hiring or job seeking?
    In spite of labor taxation reforms, remaining institutions may still undermine incentives
    to seek employment. Disincentives to leave social assistance or unemployment support
    and actively seek employment appear quite significant. The additional gain from taking
    up work is much reduced when taxes and benefits lost are taken into account, especially
    for low-wage earners (Figures 15a and b). Reforms to the reference wage that set a
    minimum social contribution for earners below half of the average wage can be
    explored. Further analysis will consider whether there are particular disincentives
    created by social assistance, unemployment benefits and labor taxation (especially for
    low wage, part-time and second earners), and how particular groups are affected by
    taxation and benefits. Labor market diagnostics also suggest the public sector is playing a
    potentially important role in discouraging private sector employment.

   70. What labor market institutions and policies could favor or disfavor work creation in
       Macedonia? Many reforms have been undertaken to lessen rigidity of labor markets. It is
       now time to evaluate what their impact has been, and what pockets of rigidity might
       remain, to both wage employment and self-employment. In the same vein, Macedonia
       also has implemented different sets of active labor market interventions to encourage
       job creation, also for vulnerable groups. What can be learnt from these experiences as
       well as those from other countries? Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation
       frameworks of these policies will be central to improving their effectiveness.

II. Methodology
In February-April 2014, 465 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Peru were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the Prime
Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or
implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations;
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 197
stakeholders participated in the survey (42% response rate).
Some respondents received a copy of the questionnaire via email and returned it accordingly.
Others received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Peru; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Peru; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing in Peru.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Peru: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Peru is headed in
   the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Peru, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
   Peru, WBG staff preparedness to help Peru solve its development challenges, WBG’s local
   presence, WBG’s capacity building in Peru, their agreement with various statements

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Peru, in which sectoral areas the
   WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also asked to
   respond to a few questions about capacity building and whether they believe the World Bank
   Group should have more or less local presence.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Peru, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Peru’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the importance
   for the WBG to be involved in thirty one development areas, and the WBG’s level of
   effectiveness across these areas, such as education, public sector governance/reform, water
   and sanitation, and transport.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the WBG reports, including which of them are the most
   useful, whether they raised substantive new information, and whether they provided them
   with useful information in terms of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Peru: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Peru, and which services the Bank
   should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has moved to the right
   direction, and the future role international development cooperation should play in Peru.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Peru, which WBG agencies they work with, whether IFC and the Bank work well
   together, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from consultants/contractors working on WBG projects
        were combined with those from PMUs, respondents from bilateral agencies were
        combined with those from multilateral agencies; respondents from the financial
        sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
        Respondents from private foundations and NGOs were combined into “CSO.? Few
        respondents from the local governments, the judiciary branch, and other organizations
        were included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the office of a
        parliamentarian, CBOs, trade unions, or faith-based groups.

Ways of Capacity Building Support

       Respondents from CSOs gave the highest ratings for the extent to which Peru would
        benefit, if capacity building were to support “groups outside government to help them
        more effectively engage and participate in development efforts,? whereas respondents
        from bilateral/multilateral agencies and the Office of President/Prime Minister/Ministers
        gave significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks gave the highest
        ratings for the extent to which Peru would benefit, if capacity building were to support
        “the private sector, related to institutional and policy change,? whereas respondents from
        bilateral/multilateral agencies gave significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar ratings for the extent to
        which Peru would benefit, if capacity building were to support all four areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Peru, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Peru. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Peru, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth.

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement with
        that “the World Bank Group supports Peru’s efforts to reduce social exclusion,? “the
        World Bank Group is an organization that does not represent a particular ideological
        perspective in Peru,? “the World Bank Group is an organization that is not overly
        influenced by any particular country,? “the World Bank Group respects the positions,
        views, ad demands of the government of Peru,? and that “the World Bank Group listens
        and takes into account your views.? For the most part, respondents from the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks and independent government institutions tended to
        have the highest levels of agreement, whereas respondents from CSOs and
        bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with all of the statements above.
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with WBG tended to have significantly
        higher levels of agreement with the two indicator statements that “overall the WBG
        currently plays a relevant role in development in Peru,? “the WBG’s work is aligned with
        what I consider the development priorities for Peru,? compared to respondents who do
        not professionally collaborate/work with WBG.

       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s
        collaboration with other donors and development partners as an effective development
        partner compared to respondents from the FY ’03 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for two of WBG’s
        qualities as an effective development partner. They are the WBG’s “collaboration with
        civil society,? and “the speed in which it gets things accomplished on the ground.? For
        the most part, respondents from independent government institutions tended to give the
        highest ratings, whereas respondents from bilateral/ multilateral agencies tended to give
        significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details).
       Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar ratings for all the
        qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for many of these
        indicator qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner. Respondents who
        professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly higher ratings than those
        who do not. These qualities include:

Abstract

This paper estimates the volume of informal trade between Algeria and Mali and analyzes its
determinants and mechanisms, using a multi-pronged methodology. First, we discuss how subsidy
policies and the legal framework create incentives for informal trade across the Sahara. Second, we
provide evidence of the importance of informal trade, drawing on satellite images and surveys with
informal traders in Mali and Algeria. We estimate that the weekly turnover of informal trade fell
from approximately US$ 2 million in 2011 to US$ 0.74 million in 2014, but continues to play a crucial
role in the economies of northern Mali and southern Algeria. Profit margins of 20-30% on informal
trade contribute to explaining the relative prosperity of northern Mali. We also show that official
trade statistics are meaningless in this context, as they capture less than 3% of total trade. Finally,
we provide qualitative evidence on informal trade actors and mechanisms for the most frequently
traded products.

Introduction

Informal trade appears to be essential to survival of the Saharan region. According to most sources,
the economy of northern Mali is dependent on its relations with southern Algeria. However, the
Algerian-Malian border, which is more than 1,300 kilometers long, has been officially closed since
January 2013.

This study seeks to evaluate informal trade between Algeria and Mali and its impact on economic
development and governance in northern Mali, because even if the border possesses a cartographic,
administrative, and economic reality, familial and tribal links continue, making this region an
environment particularly conducive to cross-border trade. This study was based on interviews during
the spring 2014 in the sub-region, satellite pictures taken in March 2014 and analysis of trade
statistics and other official statistics.




                                                 2
In this study, informal trade is defined as the flow of goods not reported or inadequately reported to
customs authorities. Thus it encompasses two practices: first, the trade in goods through border
posts for which false statements are made about the types or quantities of goods and, second, the
smuggling of goods (i.e., when goods are passed unknown to customs authorities through or outside
of border posts).2

Because the statistics on seizures by security services provide only a partial view of these practices,
we began by seeking to identify the relevant products; to understand the economic, geographic, and
social circuits that carry them; and to gain insight into the strategies of actors operating on both
sides of the borders. To this end, we conducted interviews with different population groups:
economic agents, administrative managers, and local traders practicing barter or smuggling.

As a first step, we collected information from institutional actors on the supply modes of the
subsidized products in the region of Tamanrasset in southern Algeria.3 This first step allowed us to
identify the links in the distribution network and the quantities traded in the region.

These figures were then crosschecked with the information gathered from the interviews conducted
with those practicing formal and informal4 cross-border trade in Algeria and Mali in order to
understand the networks, the commodity prices, and margins. The information gathered from the
interviews on smuggling was then compared with official statistics.

This approach allowed us to understand fairly accurately the organization of the major cross-border
flows.

The official statistics presented a puzzle: according to the Algerian authorities, Algeria showed a
trade surplus with Mali, and, according to Malian authorities, Mali showed a trade surplus with
Algeria. In addition, it appeared that there was no correspondence between the Malian export flows
to Algeria reported by the Malian authorities and the import flows from Mali reported by the
Algerian authorities.

This puzzle is explained by the fact that official statistics are extremely partial. Based on cross-checks
of different sources relying on the estimated volumes, products, and destinations used in different
regions of the world (see Raballand and Mjekiqi 2010; Kaminski and Mitra et al. 2012; Ayadi et al.
2014), the weekly turnover of trade in Mali in 2014 has been estimated at about US$0.74 million,5
and thus Malian imports can be estimated conservatively at approximately $30 million a year.6 This
amount is about two-thirds lower than in 2011, the peak of trade between Mali and Algeria. In 2011
imports were estimated at more than $85 million from Algeria to Mali, with 120 trucks crossing the

  This study does not deal with products whose import is illegal in Mali (weapons and drugs because collecting
information and data on those products is even more difficult).

  This area is somewhat more involved in trading with Niger than with Mali, but smuggling practices are similar
throughout southern Algeria.

involvement in informal trade.

  Estimations are based on 40 weeks because trade is very low from July to September.

border each week7. However, Algerians officially declared $1.02 million in exports and Malians $1.89
million in imports in 2011, representing 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, of the estimated
volume of informal trade. Today, the margins are about 20 percent (as opposed to 30 percent in
2011).

Informal trade is very important in supplying northern Mali and allowing regions in the north to
benefit from prices lower than if supplies came from the south of the country. This situation could
contribute to explain why the poverty level is so low in northern Mali, especially in Kidal. Informal
trade is also one of the main activities in terms of employment, in particular in the extreme north of
the country.

Economically, even without considering the Algerian subsidies on transport and goods, it is
understandable that Kidal, and even Gao, gravitate toward Algeria because transit times are
between seven and eight days to Algiers as opposed to at least 17 days to Dakar (Senegal) or via the
southern road to Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire) or Tema (Ghana)see table 1. Moreover, the cost of
shipping transport is much lower at ports in North Africa than those in West Africa.

Almost all of the products sold in northern Mali are those subsidized in Algeria pasta products,
flour, and semolina products but also fuels (see figure 1). In spite of the official closure of the
Algerian border in January 2013, informal trade flows remain significant.

The three main border crossing points between Algeria and Mali are Bordj Badji Mokhtar in Mali,
which has been somewhat superseded since 2012 by Tinzawaten and Timiaouine in Algeria (see map
1). In Bordj Badji Mokhtar, goods are kept in storage before being sent on small trucks or 4×4s to In
Khalil, where they are reloaded into new trucks. Fuel is not an ordinary product, and smuggling is
carried out by a limited number of operators because Algerian authorities are quite firm in this
matter.

Since 2011, roads have changed, and some are temporarily being used more than others because of
the security situation. One of the major changes is the replacement in Mali of the hub In Khalil in
favor of Tal Handak. Tal Handak is called “mini In Khalil” because of the extremely challenging
security situation that has prevailed in In Khalil since the beginning of 2013. The Gao region is
supplied directly from Bordj Badji Mokhtar through In Khalil, without passing through the city of
Kidal.

Informal trade has positive and negative impact on northern Mali: in spite of its positive economic
and social impacts, it strengthens the economic integration between northern Mali and Algeria and
thus generates resentment of the government of Mali in Bamako. In addition, because of the
corruptive effects of informal trade on institutions such as customs or the army, it undermines the
presence of the Malian state in the north.

From a national point of view, the revenue potential from these flows remains marginal (at most $25
million), and, apart from a few products, consumption of the volumes reaching the south of the
country is low.

Meanwhile, Mali’s economic dependence on Algeria creates an extreme vulnerability for northern
Mali. The Malian state is thus in an awkward position because it is economically legitimate for the
north to be largely rooted in Algeria, but that situation reinforces, by means of corruption, the
weakness of the Malian state. Thus a fully repressive policy is not possible. A laissez-faire policy is
not an option as well because the trade margins are an estimated $10–15 million at a minimum (not
to mention weapons or drug trafficking). Allowing smugglers to operate would undermine the
integrity of state institutions (whether they be customs, the army, or even the political authorities).




                                                    6
Because of the economic and political importance of Algeria to northern Mali and the current issues
of instability, it is important that Malian and Algerian authorities hold discussions on informal trade
between the two countries. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the different smuggling
routes and potentially neglect the revenue loss aspect and better control the smuggling of illicit
goods.

This paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the regulatory context and the role
played by the Algerian subsidies. It is followed by our analysis of official statistics and satellite images
demonstrating that the closure of the border is not so effective. We then estimate the volume of the
informal trade in 2011 and 2014 and describe the organization of the main supply chains. The next
section highlights the social impact of informal trade as well as its impact in terms of governance and
at the macroeconomic level. The last section identifies some possible approaches to improvement.


Border regulation in Algeria and the issue of subsidies in southern
Algeria

The wilayas (provinces) in southern Algeria, including Tamanrasset, have a double subsidy system: a
system of compensation for transport costs is applied exclusively to these provinces and a system of
subsidizing the prices of widely consumed products is applied to the entire Algerian territory.

Because of the potential impact of subsidies from neighboring countries, Algeria put in place a barter
system in 1994 to regulate trade flows.

Finally, in January 2013, following Islamists’ takeover of northern Mali and the subsequent French
military intervention, the border with Mali was officially closed.


Algeria’s compensation fund for transport costs
The compensation system for transport costs consists of reimbursement of the costs arising from the
supply and distribution of general consumer goods at the level of the wilayas in the southern regions
(Tamanrasset, Illizi, Adrar, Tindouf, Ouargla, Bechar, El Beidh, El Oued, Ghardaia, and Naama). This
program is governed by the Executive Decree of July 10, 2007.8 Reimbursement covers both
transport among wilayas and transport within wilayas. This scheme is intended to provide general
consumer goods for people living in remote areas in southern Algeria.

The reimbursement system is calculated on the following basis: amount of compensation per
operation = distance (km) × weight (tons) × DA 3 (Algerian dinars). For example, a company
transporting a load of 40 tons from Tamanrasset to Alger (a distance officially estimated at 1,945
kilometers) would be entitled to reimbursement of DA 233,400. However, according to interviewees,

the real price of transportation is DA 180,000, which means that there is a significant profit for the
transporter, who has an incentive to transport goods between both cities. In 2013 DA 979,309,333
(or approximately $12.5 million) was budgeted for this program. Nearly a quarter of that amount
was earmarked for the Tamanrasset wilaya.

The importance of consumer subsidies in Algeria
In Algeria, the main subsidized products are the following:

       Normal semolina: DA 900 per 25 kilograms
       Superior quality semolina: DA 1,000 per 25 kilograms
       Milk: DA 25 per liter
       Flour: DA 2,000 per 100 kilograms (bakers), DA 2,080 per 100 kilograms (retailers), DA 2,180
        per 100 kilograms (consumers)
       Sugar: between DA 90 and DA 95 per kilogram
       Oil: DA 600 per 50 liters, DA 250 per 2 liters, DA 125 per 1 liter
       Cement: price of cement is not defined but high profit margins are fixed to DA 40 per 25
        kilograms (wholesalers) and DA 80 per 25 kilograms (retailers).

The budget allocation for subsidized products is not based on a study of actual consumption needs.
Algeria’s directorate of trade, unlike Naftal (the principal public company selling fuels for domestic
consumption in Algeria), does not control the distribution of these products. It intervenes only to
process the reimbursement of transport costs and to check the declared information. Each
wholesaler legally registered and not considered a smuggler is entitled to claim this refund,
whatever the number of transactions and the amount of products shipped. When the refunds
requested exceed the allocated budget, the outstanding amounts are rolled over to the following
year. Until 2013, this process generated a cumulated debt of more than DA 1.8 billion that the
directorate of trade gradually wrote off through the compensation fund (nearly $25 million).9

Fuel is very heavily subsidized in Algeria. Throughout the country, regular gasoline sells for DA 21.20
($.27) per liter, super for DA 23 ($.29) per liter, and diesel for DA 13.70 ($.17) per liter. The selling
price in Mali was over $1.4 per liter in 2012.

In border localities, each identified operator is limited in the quantities of subsidized products that
can be traded in these regions. But this scheme does not limit number of traders who are able to
register for this activity, and thus it does not limit the threshold for allocations in border areas.

The directorate of trade gives the names of the traders, their tax identification numbers, and their
authorized quantities per product to the customs services that are in charge of issuing upon request
customs clearance. This process facilitates the control of movements of subsidized products and
makes available data on the annual allocations in these regions. Semolina, flour, and pasta are the

 A project currently being studied would streamline the process and limit reimbursements up to the annual
available budgets, but its implementation appears to be difficult. Algerians consider the system of
compensation of transport costs to be a right, and any effort to change it could spark a strong social reaction.

consumer products most subsidized, with more than 2,000 tons for Tinzawaten and In Guezzam.
Both localities also receive 4,000 tons of cement.

A review of the lists of traders authorized to supply border localities also reveals that some tribes
control these two sectors (food products and construction materials). In Tinzawaten, one tribal
group represents 7 out of the 42 operators authorized to supply this locality with construction
materials (16 percent of this activity), and presents 6 out of the 67 operators authorized to supply
food products (or nearly 8 percent of this activity). Some family members are also in the barter
trade.

Border control on the Algerian side
The border between Algeria and Mali is 1,376 kilometers long. Surveillance of the southern Algerian
border is difficult because the population density is very low, particularly in the far south. Algeria’s
border with Niger is 956 kilometers. These borders cover a Saharan region crossed by tracks used by
traders.

The conflict that has prevailed in northern Mali since January 2012 has upset the trade balances
between Algeria and Mali. Algeria officially closed its southern border in January 2013 to prevent
any incursions from Islamists who allegedly fled Mali after the 2012 French military intervention. In
addition, on July 14, 2013, Algeria’s Council of Ministers adopted measures to limit fuel smuggling at
borders because of its scale across the country. In addition to their operational provisions, the
adopted measures, still in force, were intended to control the distribution of fuel at gas stations by
mandating the following:

        Instigating controls by police services of all gas stations, including those inside the country,
        Implementing a reporting system to identify suspicious vehicles repeatedly passing the
         border,
        Controlling allocations of fuel to fellah (farmers),
        Banning the allocation at gas stations of fuel to people with tanks and containers.

The sub-region has agreements on border management: an Algerian-Nigerien border committee and
an Algerian-Malian joint commission on security.

Implementation of Organization of African Unity (OAU) resolutions enabled the conclusion, without
any major difficulty, of the agreement on Algeria’s demarcation border with Niger on January 5,
1983,10 and with Mali on May 8, 1983.11 The Algerian-Malian joint commission on security is an
administrative and executive entity created by Algeria and Mali to oversee the different aspects of

cooperation in terms of security in the border regions, but it convenes only once every three years
and therefore is virtually nonexistent.12

This supranational cooperation is supplemented by control and surveillance on the Algerian side.
The adopted security strategy heavily relies on the control and surveillance of the territory by both
the military and police.

Within the framework of its modernization program (2007–10), Algerian customs has undertaken
extensive recruitment, adding more than 20,000 customs officers in 2012 and maintaining its level of
recruitment in order to conduct surveillance in the southern regions. This system was reinforced by
opening land border posts for control of people and goods.13 Twenty-six customs stations are spread
across the borders (8 posts at the border in the east, 14 in the south, and 4 in the west), and
surveillance posts exclusively oversee surveillance of border areas.

These measures are legally supported by the adoption of a specific law reinforcing sanctions against
all forms of smuggling. 14 These sanctions are warranted against serious forms of smuggling
(weapons, drugs, etc.), but they seem disproportionate for the traffic of consumer products
intended to supply isolated localities in the Sahara. The prescribed penalties are 10–20 years in
prison, a fine equivalent to 10 times the cumulated value of the goods, means of transport and
penalties (Article 12). This repressive policy, which was originally intended to be dissuasive, could
reverse the risk/benefit ratio and shift the orientation of smugglers toward more profitable forms of
trafficking.


Regulation by barter trade and exchange controls
Several trade agreements have been signed between Algeria and Mali15 and between Algeria and
Niger.16 The suspension in Algeria of the international transit regime since the beginning of the
1990s marked the end of the supply of Mali and Niger through Algerian ports.

The institutional response of the Algerian state was essentially based on border security, regulation,
and control of the barter trade that remains operational (only with Niger). However, twice a month
the Algerian authorities open the borders for the supply of local populations through barter trade.

The inconvertibility of the Algerian dinar introduced shortly after the country’s independence has
forced operators to trade in the form of barter: the proceeds from the sale of a product allows the
purchase of another one. Sectors operating per group of products have therefore been created:
dates–agricultural products, salt–livestock, construction materials–products from Nigerian industry,
and so forth (Grégoire 1998).

Barter trade has been established via a unilateral Algerian regulation.17 It is a system set up by
Algerian authorities (Ministry of Trade) to try to “normalize” one “legitimate” practice based on the
traditional trade ties between Algeria and West Africa dating from long before the colonial period
and the constitution of the Algerian state. Officially, the barter trade has been falling since 2011,
from $3.4 million in 2011 to $700,000 in 2013.

In the order of 1994, the main text regulating barter trade stresses in its two first sections the
exceptional nature of barter trade. 18 This system tries to regulate barter trade strictly while
providing local administrative authorities with wide power of management and control. Under this
same system, a balance between import and export values within the framework of barter trade
must be strictly observed; the proceeds from the sale of Malian and Nigerien goods can only be
allocated to the purchase of Algerian goods included in the list and the amount of purchased goods
for export must not be higher than declared on entry (article 8). The order of 1994 set out the list of
goods admitted under the barter on a tax and duties suspension basis. The geographical space was
set to the terrestrial boundaries of the wilayas of Adrar, Tamanrasset, and Illizi. The order of 1999
extended the boundaries to the wilayas in Tindouf.19 The Algerian products authorized for barter are

government of the Republic of Niger signed in Algiers on March 16, 1998 (OJ No. 78 December 20, 2000, p.
12); Presidential Decree No. 2000-423 of December 17, 2000, on the ratification of the agreement between
the government of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and the government of the Republic of Niger
on international road transport of goods, passengers, and transit, signed in Algiers on March 16, 1998 (OJ No.
78 of December 20, 2000, p. 14).

   Section 128 of the Finance Act 1994 and the Decree Inter. of December 14, 1994, setting out the
arrangements for exercising the barter trade with Niger and Mali (OJ No. 7 of February 15, 1995, p. 30) and
repealing the decree of April 5, 1991, fixing the conditions and terms of import and export of goods under the
barter trade border with Mali (OJ No. 29 of June 12, 1991, p. 914). In addition to this regulation, several
decrees were added regulating the fair of Assehar in Tamanrasset. According to an official of the Ministry of
Commerce, Algeria invited Malians and Nigeriens to conclude an international agreement between the three
statesa legal form more appropriate to regulating cross-border trade. Neither country accepted this
proposal. As members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) they cannot, because of
this status, unilaterally agree to preferential trade agreements outside of this economic area.
18
   “The barter trade is exceptional in nature and is intended to facilitate the supply of the only people who
reside in the wilaya of Adrar, Illizi of Tamaneghasset and Tindouf ,” says article 2 of the Decree Inter. of
December 14, 1994, laying down the procedures for the exercise of cross-border trade barter with Niger and
Mali, amended by Decree Inter. of April 12, 1999 (OJ No. 35 of May 19, 1999, p. 13).

with Niger and Mali (OJ No. 35 of May 19, 1999, p. 13).

common dates; frezza dates, to the exclusion of other varieties of deglet nour dates; domestic salt;
household objects made of plastic, aluminum, cast iron, iron, and steel; blankets; and local crafts,
excluding wool rugs. The authorized products from Mali and Niger are livestock, henna, green tea,
spices, turban fabric, Tarri fabric, mil, rancid butter for local consumption, dried vegetables, rice, and
mango. Since the closure of the borders, only dried dates are allowed for export.

To exercise barter trade, a trader must, under the order of 1994, seek inclusion on Algeria’s trade
register as a wholesaler and possess storage infrastructure and a means of transporting goods,
owned or rented (article 4)a formality not required in the regulation of 1991. This measure has
created a monopoly of Algerian traders in the wholesale cross-border trade, thereby forcing Malians
and Nigeriens to go through these Algerian intermediaries (Scheele 2011).

Procedures relating to barter trade are largely decentralized. Pursuant to the order of 1994, the wali
(prefect) has wide discretionary power, depending on the local situation, and he sets the quantities
of goods authorized for import (article 3, para. 2). Once a year, he also sets the list of wholesalers
responsible for conducting border barter trade (article 5). He may also decide to withdraw
permission from traders who are operating for a third party or are not complying with the
commercial, customs, or tax law in force or who have not carried out import or export operations
during the year (article 6). Local trade, customs, and tax services are responsible for fixing price
ranges and periodically evaluating the conditions for the implementation of activity (article 12).

To ensure a strict trade balance, customs services maintain a tracking sheet of the transactions of
each trader. At the end of the year, each operator who has not complied with this balance of
payments is invited to perform the following year commercial operations that address the gap under
penalty of registration suspension.


    Weaknesses and imbalance of official trade

To get an overview of trade between Algeria and Mali, and identify the most traded goods, we
analyzed official statistics in the COMTRADE database, based on customs declarations of both
countries.

According to official statistics, trade between Algeria and Mali is extremely low.
When analyzing official statistics, it seemed that there was an enigma because according to Algerian
authorities, Algeria had a trade surplus with Mali and by the Malian authorities, Mali had a trade
surplus with Algeria.

According to Algerian official statistics, barter trade increased from $1.46 million in 2000 to over $6
million in 2010 in imports and from $742,000 in 2000 to over $5 million in 2010 in exports (for Niger
and Mali).

There appeared to be no correspondence between the flow of Malian exports to Algeria reported by
the Malian authorities and the flow of imports from reported by the Algerian authorities Mali.
COMTRADE, however, finds that figures differ. The available trade data between Algeria and Mali


                                                   12
are fluctuating and not reliable20. The transaction values recorded by the two countries are very
different: Malian authorities recorded imports of over $1.89 million in 2011, whereas Algerian
authorities recorded a total value of only $1.02 million for the same year. Similarly, Malian
authorities recorded exports of more than $11.5 million in 2011, whereas Algerian authorities
recorded a value of only $0.10 million in imports for the same year.

declarations by COMTRADE.

In 2007 Malian authorities recorded the entry of 13 different types of goods, whereas the Algerian
authorities recorded the export of 141 different types of goods for the same year (see table 3). As
for Malian exports to Algeria, there is a low flow of registered trade, except for the year 2011 when
42 types of exports were recorded on the Malian side, whereas Algeria recorded receiving only 4
imports from Mali (see table 3).

  Where correspondence does exist between the exported goods reported by Algerian authorities and
  Malian imports, some wide disparities may be evident. Dates, for example, represent the largest
  volume of business, with an import value in 2011 of over $947,000 or approximately nine times the
  export value, $107,840. However, the main discrepancies in trade in 2011 can be found for mineral
  water and the equipment needed to purify water21. The trade gap is more than 120 times the import
  value of mineral water and 880 times the import value of purification equipment.22 According to
  Algerian authorities, in five years out of six the most commonly exported goods are medical needles
  and other organic materials (HS6 294200), followed by water purification machines, salt, and
  vegetable oils (HS 151590 and 151790).23

  Table 4 lists two Algerian goods that are consumed in Mali: couscous and dates. The Malian
  authorities record volumes and import values for these goods that exceed the values provided by
  their Algerian counterparts. Algeria is largely the main supplier of dates to Mali, which can be
  explained by the regulation of barter trade, as described in a previous section.

  According to Malian authorities, Malian exports are dominated by fruit exports, guava and mango,
  which, with a value of more than $2 million in 2011, had the highest export value between 2007 and
  2012. According to Algerian authorities, cotton (HS 520100) was the main Malian export over the
  study period, with a value of $2.5 million in 2012.

  In the official trade statistics, the fuel trade has extremely low values. Algerians declare that gasoline
  exports (HS 271000) amounted to $14,238 in 2007 and $7,105 in 2010. Malians declare that gasoline
  imports (HS 271000) amounted to $19,064 in 2011 and gas imports (HS 271129) amounted to $623
  in 2008. No exports of cigarettes from Algeria are recorded. Annex C reveals Malian imports of
  cigarettes and gasoline in the official statistics as well as their total value and tonnage.

       The reality: Smuggling, a normality in northern Mali
In spite of the border closure, smuggling continues between Algeria and Mali (although volumes
have fallen sharply since 2011). The explanation lies in the fact that the economic integration of
northern Mali and Algeria is economically rational.

The evidence produced by satellite images

To examine the presence of informal trade routes across the border, we commissioned a set of
satellite images. The images were taken in March 2014, with a resolution of 50 cm and are 100%
cloud free. As trucks and cars leave marks in dry terrain, the images bear witness of the transport
activity around the border.

A sophisticated algorithm was used to identify informal roads on satellite images24. A first
automated data extraction of road traces was followed by a manual process (roads digitization and
importance qualification) to extract alternative roads from the large dataset. This manual process
helps to connect roads, close gaps generated by the automated process and remove some false road
segments that were identified along geological or topological edges.

Informal roads were classified as minor or major, based on the visible depth of the traces and the
number of parallel/adjacent traces clustered together (images 1 and 2). As a rule of thumb, when
several traces (8 or more) were visible and organized in a cluster (as shown on the following
example), the road was classified in the “major” category. In some areas, when the trace was very
deep (roads used several times by different vehicles), the road was also classified as major
(otherwise they were classified as minor).

The satellite maps indicate intense trading activity around the Algeria-Mali border, despite its
official closure. Maps 1 and 2 display major (red) and minor (green) off roads and the official roads
(black dotted lines) around the border towns of Bordj Badji Mokhtar and In Khalil. Both major and
minor roads are numerous. Over a distance of 2 kilometers, there are at least 3 major routes (in red)
over the border going/from Bordj Badji Mokhtar.

     For more details on the methodology, see annex D.

Maps 2 and 3 show the many roads that exist beyond the “official” roads (the black line in the
middle of the image is the border between Algeria and Mali). Over a distance of 2 kilometers, at
least three major routes (in red) cross the border near Bordj Badji Mokhtar.

Therefore, despite official closure of the border, several trucks or cars are likely to go through the
border every day in the vicinity of Bordj Badji Mokhtar.

Estimating the volume of informal trade
Northern Mali largely lives on informal trade, described as smuggling, which is largely permitted for
all products with the exception of fuel and illegal products such as weapons and drugs. The only
trade authorized between Algeria and Mali is that in dates. All other trade is defined as smuggling by
Algerians. Almost all of the consumer products in northern Mali are from Algeria, in particular in the
Kidal region. However, the Timbuktu region also imports products from Mauritania (sugar and
carpets) and from Niger (smuggled gasoline). A significant part of smuggled products are shipped to
Bamako, especially flour, pasta, oil, and appliances.

In this section, we estimate the annual turnover in informal trade, focusing on flows into Mali. This
estimation of volumes (and profits) necessarily has a margin of error because of a lack of available
data. Our calculation is based on statements by traders and customs officers who were interviewed
on the number of vehicles crossing the border per week in 2011 and 2014, their destination, and
their selling price in different cities. Averages were then calculated, giving more weight to
interviewees who were considered the most reliable and the most involved in the trade. Based on
interviews on the means of transport, assumptions were made on unit tonnage and overloads. It
was thus possible to calculate the turnover per product per city per week and per year.

According to the interviews, 180 trucks per week in “normal time”that is, in 2011crossed the
Algerian-Malian border. The distribution of trade flow between the cities and the category of trucks
used was as follows: Timbuktu, 20 trucks (10 tons only); Kidal, 35 trucks (20 tons at 70 percent); Gao,
35 trucks (20 tons at 70 percent); Bamako, 30 trucks (mainly 20 tons); and Niger and Nigeria, 60
trucks (40 tons at 80 percent).

The breakdown per good is as follows: 35 trucks of flour, 30 trucks of pasta, 25 trucks of semolina,
20 trucks of other staple products (oil, drinks, sugar, and milk powder), 30 trucks of fuel, 30 trucks of
dates, 5 trucks of appliances, and 5 trucks of other products.

Given the unit volume, the goods traded between Algeria and Mali represented a weekly volume of
4,640 tons: 750 tons for the Kidal region, 930 tons for the Gao region, 200 tons for the Timbuktu
region, 770 tons for Bamako, and 1,990 tons for Niger and Nigeria. Because trucks can be
overloaded, 25 percent should be added to the average (a 10-ton truck will carry up to 13 tons).

The total informal trade between Algeria and Mali in 2011 was estimated at over $85 million but
declined to less than $30 million in Mali in 2014 (see the details of the calculation in box 1). This
revenue has therefore fallen by about two-thirds since 2011, the peak of trade between Algeria and
Mali.

Official statistics seem totally inadequate because in 2011 Algerians officially reported $1.02 million
in Malian exports and Malians reported $1.89 million in imports the same year, representing 1.2
percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, of the estimated volume of informal trade.

If we include informal trade to Niger and Nigeria, informal trade volume amounted to over $150
million.

Box 1 Detailed Estimations of Revenue from Smuggling to Mali in 2011 and 2014

Informations from interviews (weekly figures):
- Number of trucks : 180 (2011), 40 (2014).

Breakdown of trucks : 2011 : Timbuktu : 20 trucks (10-ton only) ; Kidal: 35 trucks (70% 20-ton, 10% 10-ton,
15% 30-ton and 5% 40-ton) ; Gao: 35 trucks (70% 20-ton and 30% 40-ton) ; Bamako: 30 trucks (20-ton) ; Niger
and Nigeria : 60 trucks (80% 40-ton).
= total tonnage 4600t (2650 tons for Mali).

- Breakdown of goods :
2011 : 35 trucks of flour, 30 trucks of pasta, 25 trucks of semolina, 20 trucks of other food products (oil, drinks,
sugar, milk powder, etc.), 30 trucks of fuel, 30 trucks of date, 5 trucks of appliances and 5 trucks of other
products.

2014 : 14 trucks of flour, 10 trucks of pasta, 4 trucks of semolina, 5 trucks of fuel, 3 trucks of sugar, 1 truck of
milk powder, 1 truck of appliances and 2 trucks of other products.

- Decrease of trade volumes and inflation between 2011 and 2014 (as indicated below).
- Exchange rate: 506 CFAF per $1 in 2011 and 480 CFAF in 2014.
- Seasonality : trade is really low from July to September, therefore, estimates are based on 40 weeks.

Computations for 2011 (table 5):
- From the number of trucks/breakdown per product, we compute turnover per product per city (columns 1-
5).
- The sum of imports from various cities gives the total quantity per product (column 6).
- For each product, we multiply tonnage per price for each city and have turnover (column 8).
- Columns 7 and 9 exclude goods to Niger and Nigeria.



These estimations appear to be relatively low when compared with those for countries with weak
governance where the same type of estimation was undertaken and therefore those estimates are
probably conservative. In regional comparison, informal imports are lower in Mali ($70 per capita in
2011) in Tunisia ($120) and Nigeria ($250)25.

Decrease in flows since 2011
The smuggling market has been significantly disrupted since 2012 and the rebellion in northern Mali.
Informal trade in northern Mali underwent a multifaceted crisis: a decrease in demand because of
the outflow of refugees and displaced people out of Mali beginning in 2012; a decrease in supplies
because traders fled to Mauritania or Niger, or were displaced in Bamako; growing insecurity about
the commercial routes that discourages some traders still living in northern Mali; and finally the
closure of the Algerian border, which has drastically reduced trade volumes since early 2013.

Some products are now traded at very low volumes, starting with diesel and gasoline. Both are
subject to vigorous control by the Algerian security services, leading to inflation. This control is also
applied to semolina, leading to shortages in the three northern regions. The closure of the Algerian
border has had the direct effect of diverting all trucks shipping datesthe only authorized product
to be exported to Algeriatoward the Niger border.

The trade flows evident as of early 2014 can in no way be compared with those recorded in a time of
peace. The drop in turnover has been estimated at 67 percent (for details, see table 6). The closure
of the Algerian border caused a substantial increase in prices, which did not necessarily lead to
higher margins from merchants in northern Mali. The recorded inflation was the impact of a
decrease in supply and in particular an increase in prices at the Algerian border. The main
commercial consequence of this situation was the reduction of market opportunities for products
from northern Mali.

Some products turn out to be uncompetitive in Bamako, such as milk powder, which is now cheaper
in Bamako (CFAF 35,500 per carton) than in Timbuktu (CFAF 50,000 per carton). Other products that
have undergone significant inflation in the north have seen their prices stagnate or even decline in
Bamako. A ton of flour now costs CFAF 450,000 in Bamako because it has been subject to inflation of
30 percent in the three northern regions since 2011. A ton of sugar is now traded at CFAF 500,000,
increasing by 25 percent in the three northern regions. The diversification of supplies in southern
Mali has led to a trend of price stability and prevents the trading of products from the Algerian

contraband. Products that continue to be shipped in small quantities in the north and south are
mainly flour, pasta, sugar, and other products such as oil and appliances.


     Smuggling supply chains: How they work

The modus operandi of smugglers is different according to the type of traffic considered. For food
staples or consumer goods, smuggling is conducted openly by truck by day, with the exception of
fuel which requires more caution by smugglers because of the firmness of the Algerian authorities
about this product.

Between 15 and 20 percent of goods smuggled from Algeria end up in the south of Gao and in
Douentza, Mopti, and the southern part of Mali. A significant portion of flour imported from Algeria
supplies bakeries in Bamako, Niamey, and Tahoua in Mali and Agadez in northern Niger. The
majority of imported pasta makes its way to the Nigerien market, as well as the majority of dates
imported to Mali that ultimately reach the south of Mali toward Senegal and Guinea. In Mali, all
goods continue their journey until at least Mopti and Douentza. As noted, some products, such as
pasta, flour, semolina, and appliances, are even transported to Bamako. However, fuel stops at
Douentza and will sometimes be smuggled into Burkina Faso. The existence of a road linking In Khalil
to Tahoua and Agadez in Niger may be surprising given that In Guezzam, at the Algeria-Niger border,
is a commercial hub that more directly supplies northern Niger from Algeria. It turns out that, even
though the In Khalil-Taouha/Agadez road is longer and more costly than the Niger road via In
Guezzam and Assamaka, goods are more easily shipped fraudulently on the Malian side according to
smugglers.

The network structure differs across sectors. In the area of food products, the networks are widely
family-based because of the family relationships on both sides of the border. The trust that
characterizes these relationships is reflected in the hawala payment mode.26

For cigarettes, drugs, and fuel, the situation is different. Payment is made in cash or by bank transfer
(for cigarettes), and recruitment within sectors is carried out on an individual basis, even if the heads
of sectors in Mali and Algeria have a family relationship.

The main products exported (smuggled) from Algeria to Mali are food (dates, flour, pasta, semolina,
and milk powder) and gasoline, followed by consumer goods (appliances). In export volume, these
products exceed the volume of Malian imports, which mainly consist of livestock products (sheep
and camels) and bazin (traditional fabric), as well as Chinese green tea and cigarettes. Most of the
trucks returning to Algeria from Mali are loaded with livestock collected along the route to Algeria.

  The hawala system is an informal money transfer system within a network based on trust and honor among
money brokers located in different countries. The advantage is that it is not necessary to actually move money,
especially in a difficult security environment, and one can limit taxes.

Traders often import several types of cargoes including fuel barrels. It is estimated that 90 percent of
supplies are preordered, a growing trend since the introduction of mobile and satellite phone to the
“professional” structure of networks.

Smuggling food products
On the Malian side, the town of In Khalil27 is still the main trading hub in northern of Mali, where a
large portion of the goods is centralized.

The smuggling of flour dominates fraud in this area probably because of its high margins. Pasta,
semolina, and oil are also among the most traded products, whereas milk is often marketed only
because of the prospect of getting a “passe-avant” (a circulation license of goods subject to duties
and taxes) in Adrar or Tamanrasset (however, this arrangement is no longer profitable). Using a
passe-avant, a trader can ship subsidized goods (that will partly be sold in Mali or Niger) into the
Algerian territory.

Fuel smuggling from Algeria
Fuel smuggling is popular in the region because of the availability of fuel and its low selling price in
Algeria. The smuggling routes have been adjusted to modes of supply and established control
systems.

From the town of Tamanrasset, the latest control measures led to a change in the patterns of fuel
smuggling. The controls at gas stations forced smugglers to collect and store fuel at their places of
residence. This contraband is concentrated in a neighborhood in the north of Tamanrasset largely
controlled by a family. These family members also participate in the barter trade and trade of
consumer goods.

The fuel quantities seized by the security services in the entire region of Tamanrasset seem quite
modest compared with the quantities actually exported via smuggling. Seizures in 2013 represented
only 10 percent of smuggled fuel from one locality of In Guezzam (according to estimates).

The wilaya of Tamanrasset has 14 gas stations, including two in Tinzawaten 9 kilometers from the
border with Mali and a Naftal station, which has a monopoly on the distribution of fuel and
petroleum derivatives.

Petrol is allocated to stations as requested. Supply quantities are not limited, and no study of the
real needs in fuel consumption has apparently been conducted at the level of the wilaya in
Tamanrasset. Only localities near the borders (In Guezzam and Tinzawaten) are subject to a
restricted allocation. The monthly quantities of authorized fuel in these areas are determined by the
wali and transported from Tamanrasset under escort of the gendarmerie.28

   The city is a storage and transit site, mostly controlled by the Touareg Idnan related to the National
Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and by the Berabiches Arabs from the region of Timbuktu. Tal
Handak is currently controlled by the MNLA and is mainly held by traders Kunta and Ifoghas.
28
   The currently authorized quantities for Tinzawaten are one convoy per month and three tanks of gasoline
and six of diesel for four petrol stations.


                                                   23
Convoys (of contraband)29 are typically composed of groups of 8–20 all-terrain vehicles belonging to
different people. This modus operandi allows an owner to spread the risks by shipping only part of
his "fleet" per operation, thereby limiting his vulnerability to possible interception by the customs
services. This also creates a kind of community of interest and thus reduces the risk of competition
and denunciations.

The most significant profits are made at the level of the two most structured parts of the network:
gas stations (main sites for supplies) and organized networks of cross-border transport.

Cement smuggling
This traffic is rapidly expanding to Niger as indicated by the statistics of customs services; quantities
of cement seized by the security services increased from 6.7 tons in 2011 to 26.35 tons in 2012 and
to more than to 200 tons in 2013. In Mali, quantities are imported on an irregular basis, according to
the growth of orders, but seem to remain modest. In Kidal, the price of a 50-kilogram bag is CFAF
6,500, or CFAF 2.6 million for the quantity required to fill a 20-ton truck. This trade probably
accompanies the process of Sahelian urbanization. This is particularly true for the Niger-Nigeria-
Benin borders (Walther, Tenikue, and Kuepié 2012).

Malian exports of bazin fabric
Bazin fabric is a valued commodity in Algeria, particularly in the south among the Malian and
Nigerien communities established in Tamanrasset and Adrar. Manufactured in Germany, this fabric
is exported from Mali to Algeria and is an extremely profitable sector. However, it is difficult to
estimate how much of this fabric is exported because of the weak structure of the sector, which
relies largely on individual entrepreneurs.

Transport is usually by car, with each car carrying 5–6 packages of 125 bazins on average, or 690
boubous (robes) per car. Second-quality bazin is sold for CFAF 36,000 per piece in Bamako (up to
CFAF 80,000 per piece for Yara bazins), and about DA 20,000 per piece (or more than CFAF 120,000
per piece) in Tamanrasset. Each bazin represents a profit of CFAF 87,000 ($180) or a profit per car of
CFAF 60 million ($125,000) for a turnover of CFAF 83 million ($173,000) or a profit rate of 72
percent, from which the transport cost must be deducted. No customs duty applies to the exports
from Mali. However, because of the prevailing insecurity in northern Mali, cargoes are divided into
several cars or are sent through Niger via transport companies. Although it is difficult to estimate the
volumes exported to Algeria, it is thought that five carloads of the value just described are shipped
each week for a weekly turnover of CFAF 415 million (about $860,000), totaling several tens of
millions of dollars each year.

Cigarette smuggling in decline
Cigarette smuggling is a typical example of the adaptation of cross-border fraud to economic
developments. It was an important fraud movement in the 1990s to Algeria, but since then cigarette
smuggling has dramatically declined since 2005 and the manufacturing of foreign brands (under

  The term convoy is used by both smugglers and customs to designate an operation of fraudulent routing of
products to import or export.

license) by STAEM.30 Entering Africa through the port of Cotonou in Benin, cigarettes were driven by
truck to the border towns of Assamakka in Niger and Boughassa in Mali, where they were legally
sold and then transported into Algerian territory via light four-wheel-drive-type vehicles. The
merchandise was then conveyed to Ouargla, which was the point of distribution across the territory.
Routes of cigarette smuggling followed a defined path: Boughassa, Bordj Badji Mokhtar, Moulay
Lahcen, Amguid, and then the same corridor: Faidjat and then Bordj Omar Idris and Ouargla.

Cigarette smuggling was structured traffic, in particular controlled by the traders of the Ouargla
region who ensured its distribution to the wilayas in northern Algeria. Touareg populations were
recruited as drivers or scouts because of their knowledge of the field (they charged by the operation
DA 80,000 (about $1,000) for the driver, DA 10,000–15,000 for the “graisseur,”31 and DA 70,000 for
the scout, or about $2,000 in total.

This smuggling has gradually lost its economic appeal in Algeria since the opening of plants under
license. In 1999 a vehicle carrying 60 cartons of cigarettes could make between DA 700,000 and DA
800,000 ($10,000) in net profit. In 2004 profits decreased to DA 600,000 ($7,500) per vehicle. In
recent years, payments have been made on loan and are often unpaid because of the declining
demand for this product. The gradual decrease in profits has led smugglers to abandon this type of
traffic. The statistics on seizures of cigarettes from 2011 to 2013 (it amounted to just a few hundred
dollars in 2013) indicate the gradual disappearance of this pattern of fraud, but the situation also
might be related to the insecurity situation prevailing since 2012.

Meanwhile, the market for Marlboro cigarettes may have lessened because of the distribution of the
brand by STAEM, but that for the Greek-made American Legend cigarettes has not. Trade sources
estimate the smuggling volume from Mali to Algeria at nearly 9,000 cartons a week. The main
country of origin is Burkina Faso. The earned profits in Mali, particularly in the region of Gao, are
CFAF 200 per pack or CFAF 18 million ($37,500) per truck and a few million dollars per year.

Malian exports of livestock
Livestock is the main good exported (smuggled) by Mali to Algeria, and overall represents the third
largest export revenue for Mali after gold and cotton. However, livestock exports are mainly
intended for West Africa. The three northern regions are home to 20 percent of the Malian herd of
bovines (1.8 million head), 48 percent of the herd of small ruminants (11.3 million sheep and 15.7
million of goats), as well as herds of camels.

Trucks transporting livestock to Mali usually return to Algeria loaded with cattle. Traders gather
livestock in the camps they pass on the way back to the Algerian border, especially in the regions of
Gao and Kidal (the Timbuktu region has a smaller herd). Certain periods, starting with the weeks

   Provisions of the Finance Act of 2001 opened the tobacco market to foreign investors. STAEM, an Emirati
consortium of Arab investors, was approved by the Ministry of Finance as a manufacturer of tobacco. This
company, a joint venture established in 2002 with the National Society of Tobacco and Matches (SNTA), holds
49 percent of the shares. STAEM is officially authorized to import and distribute, during an intermediate phase,
branded cigarettes to be manufactured locally. The increase in the local production has affected cigarette
smuggling.

before Tabaski (religious holiday), are advantageous for the export of livestock because they are
peaks of consumption. The exported livestock are mainly sheep, as well as camels and bovines.
Trade sources estimate that 50 percent of the trucks from Algeria are backloaded with cattle, not
always full, which makes it difficult to quantify the volume. The majority of these flows is not
recorded by Malian customs.

In spite of these limits, it is possible to estimate the volumes in 2011. On a weekly basis, 90 trucks
were loaded with cattle. An average load consisted of about 40 cattle, with an average price of CFAF
150,000 (minus CFAF 8,000 for transport costs). On this basis, the turnover per truck could be
estimated at CFAF 5.7 million (over $11,000) or over CFAF 510 million weekly for northern Mali (or
over $1 million.


The impact of informal trade on development

This section presents the social impact of informal trade in terms of margins, job creation,
governance, and impact on purchasing power. It then briefly describes the weak macroeconomic
impact of informal trade.

Social impact
Estimating the trade margins
How much profit is generated locally by informal trade?32 To estimate the margins, one needs to
know the volumes traded for each of the routes (the number of trucks and the average tonnage per
truck), the price of each product in each city, and, to estimate the volume traded for each product,
the cost of transport and the tariffs paid.

Several conclusions can be drawn in light of data collected for 2011:
    All of the goods traded in northern Mali (transit or final destination) generated a weekly
        margin of CFAF 603,100,000 (approx. $1.2 million), with an average margin of 31 percent.
    The margin rate is higher when the goods are intended for Bamako (43 percent), Niger (30
        percent), or West Africa. This explains why traders value northern Mali as a transit area.
    For intra-northeast Mali exchanges, Timbuktu (32.1 percent) and Gao (25.17 percent) turn
        out to be more profitable than Kidal (15.5 percent), which probably explains the role played
        by traders in Kidal in the distribution in Mali and the lower purchasing power in Kidal.
    Pasta, flour, and dates are the main goods traded, the most profitable of which is flour, with
        a margin of 42 percent, before appliances, dates, and gasoline.

According to traders and transporters, the average transport costs from Bordj Badji Mokhtar are
CFAF 27,000 ($56) per ton for Kidal, CFAF 41,000 ($85) per ton for Gao, CFAF 54,000 ($112) per ton
for Timbuktu, CFAF 90,000 ($187) per ton for Bamako, and CFAF 100,000 ($208) per ton for Tahoua
and Agadez.

margins by sector for each city (see table 7).

In 2014 the rate margins have fallen in the north (22 percent), but have been halved for the south of
Mali and Niger (19 percent). The weekly margins in 2014 account for CFAF 134.703 million, for a
margin of 20.5 percent against 29 percent in 2011. An overall decrease of 78 percent in margins was
observed in 2014 compared with the margins in 2011 (CFAF 603.1 million), or more than $18 million
annually.

Impact of informal trade on employment, purchasing power, and regional gross domestic
product
In terms of job creation, 1,500 traders in food products are operating in Tamanrasset and more than
900 in Adrar (Adrar’s population is nearly 400,000). In southern Algeria, no more than 100 traders
are smuggling fuel to Mali (and to Niger) because this sector is much riskier now that Algerian
authorities are focusing on fuel smuggling. Therefore, it is an economic activity in Algeria intended
for a minority, which is perhaps explained by the incurred risk.

Mali directly benefits from subsidy policies established by the Algerian authorities for certain
products. This explains in part the access of the residents of northern Mali to products that cost less
than those in Bamako. Kidal benefits even more because its prices are quite similar to those found in
Algeria. In terms of fuel, customs clearance of fuel is authorized only in Bamako, which allows the
region up to Douentza to benefit from Algerian fuel prices.

Kidal is largely economically integrated with Algeria through smuggling. Figure 2 compares the prices
of sugar, milk, couscous, refrigerators, flat screen TVs, and cement in four Malian cities to those in
Kidal. Except for the prices of cement and milk in Bamako, Kidal is the least expensive city for all
products. Apart from flat screen TVs, Gao and Timbuktu are often more expensive than Bamako and
Mopti, which can be explained by the transport costs in relation to the Algerian border (or in relation
to Bamako).

Both Kidal (and Gao) appear to largely benefit from informal trade. Using the margins of informal
trade per city, one can calculate a proxy of value added to the regional gross domestic product
(GDP). In 2011 this ratio was about 5 percent for Kidal and Gao and about 1 percent for Bamako and
Timbuktu (figure 3).

Impact on governance
The negative impact of informal trade on governance is important. And yet it is difficult to identify a
causal link between smuggling and weak institutions because the two go hand in hand: smuggling is
possible because the controlling institutions are weak, but smuggling also helps to keep them weak
to the extent that a collusive system is established.

Governance issues in Algeria
The first (sensitive) question to be asked is how can informal trade continue to grow when
confronted with the massive presence of the agents of the Algerian state.

About 30 economic operators (all of Algerian nationality) are authorized annually to operate barter
trade. A review of the lists of the last three years reveals that they have not changed significantly
despite the changes, over the same period, of officials at the wilaya level and in the direction of
trade and customs. This confirms that, except in cases of fraud duly recorded, the administrative
authorities do not undertake real monitoring of licenses. The trading system is largely set up and
controlled by local populations.

A review of the lists also reveals that in the trade in widely consumed products, some tribes such as
the Touadj 33 are overrepresented among the licensed operators in barter trade. Indeed, six
operators are from the same family and control 36 percent of the total exports volume. The Touadj


33
     This is a tribe called by Tuareg Dag Taoudji.


                                                             30
tribe is also on the list of authorized dealers to supply the border localities and may also smuggle
fuel.

The export of dates through barter trade also enables operators to circumvent the strict foreign
exchange regulation in Algeria. According to interviews, margins from date exports are converted at
the currency exchange offices in Niger and then transferred either by Western Union or by hawala
system to Dubai, thereby fueling the international informal trade. This system is especially used in
informal trade operations with importers in northern and eastern Algeria.

Despite the system set up by Algeria, the fight against fraud continues to lag: for example, 6,312
smuggling cases were discovered in 2011 on the Algerian territory, but only 3 percent were at
Tamanrasset and 8 percent over the three southern regions (Tamanrasset, Illizi, and Bechar). The
value of goods seized in the Tamanrasset region accounted for 4.34 percent of the total value of
seizures at the national level.34

Links with the weak governance in northern Mali
Since the mid-2000s, efforts have been made to reaffirm the customs presence in northern Mali, in
particular in Timbuktu. Before the crisis of 2012, a customs station operated in In Khalil, where it
collected tariffs and duties. Customs agreed on a fixed price according to the goods transported, but
it was more or less symbolic for each truck entering Mali on the condition that the truck not
continue its journey south. If it did not comply, duties increased and the driver of the truck had to
make an import declaration.35 This factor explains the weakness of the official import data because
to a great extent, imports from Algeria to the north were not reported.

According to several customs sources in Mali, 60 percent of the flows escape customs control.
Quantities reported to the customs are generally 40–50 percent less than the actual flows.
Moreover, trucks are usually overloaded by 20–30 percent. Thus goods are declared for about 20
percent of their actual value. On average, customs offices in the north have been collecting about
$1–1.5 million, which means that the goods were probably cleared for about 5–10 percent of their
value (for an average tariff rate of 20–25 percent).36

Today the situation seems to have deteriorated even more since only a few tens of thousands of
dollars are collected at the border (less than 1 percent of the value), and there are no longer any
customs offices in northern Mali, largely because of the rebellion in January 2012. Malian customs
officials struggle to win against smuggling actors who are increasingly more organized and who have
little difficulty in rendering customs offices inoperative. Customs offices are slowly reestablishing

34
   As opposed to 15.3 percent at the regional customs in Tlemcen (on the border with Morocco) and nearly 11
percent for the regional customs in Tébessa (Border Zone East).
35
   For a 10-ton truck coming from Bordj Badji Mokhtar, paid duties in 2014 were about CFAF 75,000 ($156) in
Kidal, CFAF 120,000 ($250) in Gao, CFAF 140,000 ($290) in Timbuktu, and CFAF 400,000 ($830) in Bamako, as
in northern Niger. These figures are averages, knowing that many traders are paying duties sometimes more
modest because of the corruption within customs, or even sometimes are fully exempt from customs duties by
circumventing customs offices.
36
   According to the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), customs duties at the Malian
border (in percentage of the value of goods) are 20 percent for dates, couscous, pasta, and cigarettes and 10
percent for gasoline (for ordinary car) and car tires.


                                                     31
themselves in Timbuktu and Gao, but there are only a few agents in these two cities, and they are
unable to travel in the region. In Kidal, there is no custom presence.

Mali has some similarities with Algeria because trader networks in Mali control the main trade
sectors. It is not uncommon for mayors, deputies, or presidents of the regional chambers of
commerce, or their counterparts, to be involved in these sectors.37 It is therefore good for trade in
northern of Mali but erodes the legitimacy of these representatives elected by the population.

Moreover, repression is all the more difficult because trader networks, which control flows, are
decentralized (Walther 2014). Also, when a cargo is halted or a trader is neutralized, it is possible for
another member of the network to replace the trader and to continue the traffic.

Finally, smuggling networks are targeted by laundering networks because some drug traffickers seek
to diversify their activities using smuggling routes of staples as a screen or financing new traders
with money derived from drugs or retailers as a loan. Lacher (2012) explains that the line between
smugglers and drug traffickers is sometimes blurred.

Weak macroeconomic impact
Mali has incurred a low revenue loss from smuggling. Moreover, based on an average rate of 20
percent of the value of goods (a higher rate than the reality), the potential revenue would be about
$6 million now (versus less than $20 million in 2011). In addition, the volume of informal imports
represented less than 3 percent of total imports (official) of Mali in 2011.


Conclusions and recommendations
In the Sahel as in other parts of the world, borders are a fertile ground for informal trade, especially
in a desert area. Walther (2009) refers to a "mobile space"that is, circulation is the most
appropriate method of managing uncertainty for the Sahelian life.

For Algeria
Algeria should revise its regulations on barter trade with Mali because this policy seems to benefit a
very small number of actors, and it has not countered smuggling. Furthermore, given its very
restrictive nature, it creates incentives for corruption of those institutions in the south of the country
responsible for control such as customs or the army.

In addition, the subsidy policy in place for the south should be reviewed because the compensation
fund for transport and the generous subsidies for flour and fuel encourage smuggling and generate a
fairly significant cost to the Algerian state. We estimate that the minimum cost of the loss for the
Algerian state was about $45 million in 2011 and less than $10 million now.38

Because of the potential security impact of smuggling, it is important to re-engage the dialogue with
Mali (it appears that official bilateral meetings take place only every three years).

37
   Walther (2009) showed that traders were heavily represented in the National Assembly of Niger.
38
   Most of this cost comes from the subsidy of gasoline. Forty-two million liters are subsidized to about $1 per
liter, whereas subsidies are at very low levels for milk.


                                                      32
For Mali
A fully repressive policy against smuggling does not appear to be possible since customs seem to be
mostly circumvented along the Algerian border and probably does not have the possibility to
implement a repressive policy. Moreover, such a policy would have a negative impact on the well-
being of northern populations.

However, a laissez-faire policy is also not an option because the margins of this trade allow
smugglers to render the institutions (customs, military and political authorities) in northern Mali
inefficient and collusive. At the same time, some sort of control is important – primarily to avoid
further instability and violence if weapons and drug could enter the Malian territory.

Instead of having controls at borders with customs border-posts, controls should probably be less
carried out with a revenue angle but with a focus on increasing security. The control framework
should rely on intelligence sources in cities/market cities instead of being focused at borders. For
centuries, in desert regions, controls have been taken place in cities where goods are traded and not
in the desert where roads can be created/recreated anywhere (as seen on satellite pictures).
Therefore, the “traditional” way of controlling the border is ineffective in this area.

Finally, it will important to initiate joint discussions with Algeria to find an adequate cross-country
solution, especially for the most sensitive trafficking (drugs and weapons).

Short Presentation on the Method of Mirror Statistics

The following analysis is based on the work of Fisman and Wei (2009), Jean and Mitaritonna (2010),
Nitsch (2012), and Raballand et al. (2013) on the approach to informal trade through official trade
data.39 They propose using the difference between the measurements reported by the authorities of
the importing and exporting countries for the same trade flow in order to obtain an initial
assessment of informal trade (the so-called method of mirror statistics). In principle, there is a
minimum difference between the reported values on both sides of a border because exports are
valued f.o.b. (i.e., without freight and insurance), and imports are valued c.i.f. (i.e., shipping and
insurance costs are included). The difference can be amplified by classification errors, problems of
time, exchange rates, etc.40 However, Bhagwati (1967) noted that over 30 percent of the difference
between reported imports and exports, “classic" explanations are no longer satisfactory. Beyond this
threshold, presumption of undervaluation or overvaluation of imports or exports would be
preferred.

The difference is calculated on the following basis for a given year and a given pair of countries:

K corresponds here to a category of goods defined at level 6 of the Harmonized System (HS)
classification, Revision 2.




39
     This approach is old and dates from the late 1960s with Bhagwati (1967), but it is now experiencing a revival.

Algorithm Used to Identify Roads on Satellite Images

The algorithm used can be summarized as follows:

      Smooth image to reduce pixel size to 75 centimeters, judged as optimal.
      Apply Gaussian pyramid to reduce processing time
      Apply anisotropic gradient to smooth image but keep irregular edges.
      Apply Sobel filter to sharpen image edges (first-degree derivative).
      Apply anisotropic gradient again.
      Thresholding: Set to 0 all pixels with values below mean.
      Apply adaptive threshold method.
      Remove all objects (= block contiguous white pixels) below 100-pixel size.
      Compute eccentricity of bounding ellipse for all objects and keep only objects with
       eccentricity greater than 0.7 (to identify objects that are elongatedthat is, road segments).
      Skeletonize image to keep only the trace.
      Apply a Hough line transform to find lines (applied several times with different parameter
       values).
      Keep only sets of lines that are parallel and close (distance interval is width of a truck).

Calculating Margins for Flour and Pasta in Various Cities


Flour
A 10-ton truck connecting Bordj Badji Mokhtar to Kidal earns a margin of CFAF 750,000 (CFAF
600,000 + 25 percent overload) from which is deducted a transport cost of CFAF 270,000 and about
CFAF 75,000 in customs duties, for a net margin of CFAF 405,000. The weekly margin is therefore
CFAF 4.333 million with an annual turnover of CFAF 24.61 million (18 percent margin).

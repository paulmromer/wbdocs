Financial inclusion – defined here as the share of individuals with access to quality formal
financial services including credit, savings, and insurance services –is increasingly recognized as
an important contributor to global development. From a macro-economic perspective, access to
finance has been proven to be positively correlated to economic growth and to reduced
inequalities. For low-income individuals and households, it is critical for improving household
welfare by promoting productive investment and helping manage economic shocks.

Similar to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and beyond, the
demand for financial services is largely present in Iraq. Recent data reveals a significant gap
between Iraqi citizens who saved or borrowed formally and those who did so informally.
Similarly, while Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) constitute the majority
of enterprises in Iraq, only a small fraction reports having received a loan from a conventional
bank.

Over the past few years, Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in Iraq have emerged as credible
sources of financing for low-income households and entrepreneurs, both underserved by
conventional banks. Microfinance services in Iraq, however, are still nascent and far from
meeting their full potential. Similar to many countries in the MENA region, MFIs in Iraq were
set up as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supported by a steady influx of donor funding.
While these NGOs were initially able to grow through donor support, they are now struggling to
meet increasing client demand as donor resources have dwindled, preventing them from making
the necessary investments in capital and infrastructure to meet growing client demand.

Many countries address this funding challenge by allowing institutions to provide financial
services as companies or banks, helping them raise capital, provide new services, and increase
their outreach in a sustainable manner. A similar path could be envisioned in Iraq, but is
currently obstructed by regulatory hurdles. This diagnostic report aims to present and assess the
current microfinance landscape in Iraq, including the legal and regulatory framework,
recommend policy improvements to enhance the sustainability and operating environment for
MFIs and their clients. This report argues that the current legal and regulatory environment for
microfinance in Iraq hinders the growth and sustainability of the sector and furthermore
advocates several short and medium term policy recommendations to enhance the overall
operating environment for MFIs, the sustainability of the sector, and impact for clients.

Overview of the Legal and Regulatory Framework Governing Microfinance in Iraq

The microfinance sector falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of multiple laws and supervisors,
each spanning varying degrees of control over the sector. NGO MFIs are registered by the NGO
Directorate under the NGO Law of 2010, which defines them as entities that engage in non-profit
activities. A separate NGO Law was approved by the Iraqi Kurdistan Region’s Parliament in
2011. Although NGO MFIs are registered with the NGO Directorate under the NGO Law, the
Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) arguably has the authority to regulate and supervise them as financial
institutions and may be better suited to do so. An additional challenge is the lack of a level
playing field due to different rules that apply to Iraqi NGOs, Kurdistan NGOs, and SME Finance

                                               -1-
Companies. There are also a number of laws aimed at supporting small businesses in Iraq that
impact microfinance development. In 2012, the parliament passed the ‘Support of Small Income-
Generating Project Law’, which provided a vehicle for the government to provide interest-free
loans as well as tax exemptions to small businesses with no more than 10 employees. Similarly,
the CBI issued the SME Finance Company Ordinance of 2010 explicitly allowing commercial
companies (SME Finance Companies) to engage in lending activities for SMEs, which can
include micro-enterprises. However, SME Finance Companies are not permitted to collect
deposits. Despite this Ordinance, no companies have to date been created. While some NGO
MFIs have expressed interest in establishing such companies, they have not been allowed to do
so.

Additional challenges in the regulatory environment include the lack of regulations and clear
guidance on (i) consumer protection; (ii) credit information sharing, (iii) leasing and secured
transactions (iv) and loan recovery. In sum:

      There are no consumer protection regulations for financial services in Iraq. While banks
       and financial institutions are subject to bank secrecy and privacy provisions under the
       banking law, the NGO law does not contain any similar provisions. The twelve NGO
       MFIs have signed a code of conduct pledging commitment to consumer protection, but
       the code is not enforceable and depends on the goodwill and social responsibility of the
       NGO MFIs.
      In addition, only licensed banks are permitted to participate in the CBI’s credit registry,
       which has a threshold of 25 million Iraqi Dinars (the equivalent of US$ 21,255). There is
       no effective credit information sharing system in place for other financial institutions,
       including NGO MFIs.
      There seem to be very limited understanding of secured transactions from both public and
       private sector stakeholders, and the existing legal framework is not conducive to the
       development of this form of finance. However, according to some practitioners (e.g. Iraq
       Company for Bank Guarantees), some finance institutions would be willing to use
       various movables as collateral, provided there is the appropriate legal framework in
       place.
      There are no specific regulations for loan recovery that would assist banks, financial
       institutions and NGOs from avoiding the lengthy court system to enforce loan contracts.

Finally, the lack of funding represents a serious obstacle hindering the growth of Iraqi MFIs.
Although most MFIs have historically relied on grants, there have been no new grants to the
sector since September 2012. Other sources of funding are limited. NGOs cannot raise equity or
take deposits. Despite the absence of restrictions on fund transfers into and out of Iraq,
international microfinance investors are not active in the country, with the exception of OPIC.
There appear to be few local investors or banks willing to lend to MFIs. Furthermore, different
interpretations exist regarding the nature of profitable activities NGOs are allowed to pursue.
Consistent with similar legislation in other countries, the intent of this provision is typically
meant to prevent profit distribution, not to prohibit NGOs from pursing profitable activities for
sustainability and growth purposes.

One of the possible solutions to attract funding is through the transformation of the NGO MFIs’
microfinance services to for-profit institutions. Global experience demonstrates that

                                              -2-
transformation is critical in order to access broader funding sources and to offer additional
services such as deposits and transfers that may be outside of the legal purview of an NGO.
There is currently a lack of clarity regarding how an NGO MFI can transform its microfinance
services to either an SME Finance Company or another for-profit company. The NGO law as
written does not prohibit an NGO from selling its loan portfolio to a company in exchange for
shares or money, provided that proceeds of the sale are used in accordance with the NGO’s
mission and that no personal gain is accrued from the sale by the NGO’s members/founders and
employees.

Key Recommendations

While the microfinance sector in Iraq has contributed to economic development by offering low-
income individuals access to quality financial services not offered by conventional financial
institutions, more households could be reached and better financial services could be provided if
key bottlenecks impending the sector’s growth were lifted. The current legal framework is
favorable to the development of the Iraqi microfinance sector if the provisions of the law are
interpreted according to international practices.

Short-Term Recommendations

   Clarify permitted and prohibited activities under the NGO Law.

   Determine the appropriate government agency to regulate and supervise NGO MFIs. It is
    recommended that the CBI supervise and regulate NGO MFIs. The central bank may be
    better placed to understand linkages between different financial institutions and ensure that
    prudential and non-prudential rules are evenly applied to all financial service providers.

   Clarify the legal process through which transformation of NGO MFIs can take place and
    develop appropriate circulars providing guidance on the transformation process.

   Amend the SME Finance Companies Ordinance by, inter alia, reviewing capital requirements
    and limitations on debt (currently set at 300% of capital) and restrictions on local and foreign
    donations.

Medium-Term Recommendations

   Conduct a demand study to assess current demand among the poor and low-income
    populations for financial services (savings, credit, payments, transfers, and insurance).

   Adopt financial consumer protection rules and apply them to all financial service providers.

   Establish a comprehensive credit information sharing system. A well-run credit bureau can
    provide financial institutions with an inexpensive means of assessing the creditworthiness of
    borrowers and can bring down the cost of lending in the sector.

   Encourage bank downscaling, particularly with respect to banks using agents


                                                -3-
    (e.g., individuals, legal entities).

   The role of the government in the microfinance sector should shift from being a funding
    provider to a facilitator through gradually eliminating direct funding schemes that provide
    below-market or interest-free loans. Such government intervention creates market distortion
    due to unfair competition.

   Permit MFIs to be agents of insurance companies.

   Establish a fast track process for loan recovery. Summary procedures should be introduced in
    cases of simple contract enforcement/debt collection.

   Adopt the appropriate legal framework for leasing and secured transactions. Financial leasing
    and the use of various movable collateral can greatly increase private sector access to credit
    in Iraq and reduce its cost.

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      A well-functioning and inclusive financial sector is critical for efficient resource
allocation leading to increased productivity, greater investment, higher overall levels of
economic growth, and lower inequality. This is particularly critical in Iraq, where years of
political instability and violence have impeded the development of a robust private sector. More
specifically, financial inclusion – defined here as the proportion of individuals with access to
quality formal financial services including credit, savings, and insurance services – is critical for
improving household welfare by spurring economic activity and helping the low-income manage
economic shocks. All this explains why microfinance has, in recent years, become an important
development mechanism at the global level.

2.      However, microfinance services in Iraq are still nascent and far from meeting their full
potential. This diagnostic report aims to present the microfinance landscape in Iraq, its legal and
regulatory framework, and potential policy improvements to enhance the operating environment.
It aims to inform public and private sector stakeholders on the regulations and laws affecting the
development and strategic direction of the microfinance sector. The policy recommendations
presented here are designed to address factors preventing greater growth and outreach, with the
goal of promoting inclusive financial sector development in Iraq.

II. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK, FINANCIAL SECTOR, AND MSMES IN IRAQ

A. Macroeconomic Framework

3.     Iraq’s economic and financial performance continues to be largely dependent on the
performance of the oil sector. Revenues from oil account for about two-thirds of Iraq’s GDP and
for almost all export and fiscal revenues. Government oil revenues accounted for 60.3% of GDP
in 2010, and the share of crude oil export revenues in total revenues was 90.4%.

B. Financial sector1

4.      Although the banking sector accounts for more than 75% of the assets of the Iraqi
financial system, it remains small. The 2012 World Bank report indicates that the banking sector
has total assets of US$ 61 billion (IQD 71 trillion).2 This amounts to an asset to GDP ratio of
73%, which is significantly lower than the ratio for the MENA region of 130%.3 Domestic credit

  The following discussion of the banking sector relies on the 2012 World Bank document: “Republic of Iraq:
Financial Sector Review.?
2
  The official figure is IQD 329 trillion (US$ 282 billion), equivalent to 318% of GDP. The World Bank report
indicates that this larger figure includes large exchange rate valuation losses on the banks’ balance sheets.
3
  In turn, the ratio for the region is low when compared with other regions. Of the EU-15 (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom), the ratios ranged from 164% (Italy) to 1,619% (Luxembourg) with the next two highest
countries being Ireland (625%) and the United Kingdom (521%). (Figures – which are for June 2011 – are based on
the European Central Bank and national central banks and the IMF World Economic Outlook Database, as presented
in an October 2012 Policy Paper).


                                                     -5-
to the private sector only amounted to 6.2% of GDP in 20124 – lower than every country
(according to the World Bank data) except Yemen. For comparison, domestic credit to the
private sector is 92.2% in Lebanon, 72.4% in Jordan, 29.7% in Egypt. As a corollary, banks are
very liquid; foreign assets and deposits at the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) amount to 63% of
assets. The banking sector is dominated by seven State-owned banks holding, in the aggregate,
86% of bank assets and 69% of credits. There are 47 private banks registered with the CBI, 15 of
which have foreign participation, and nine of which are Islamic. These banks are small and their
loans are primarily short-term loans for wholesale and retail trade.

5.      The remaining segments of the Iraqi financial system are underdeveloped. Iraq’s stock
market is nascent, with a total market of around US$ 3 billion (IQD 3.5 trillion).5 The same
applies to the size of the insurance market, for which no precise data is available. No data is
available for the Postal Saving Fund, Exchange Companies, Financial Transfer Companies, or
other NBFIs, except for the MFIs. Notwithstanding a 2010 CBI Ordinance establishing a new
type of NBFI – the SME Finance Company – there are no such companies operating today.

C. MSMEs and Access to Finance

6.      The number, size and distribution of the Iraqi MSME sector are difficult to measure due
to the lack of available information. A 2005 ILO estimate put the total number of registered
SMEs with 3 or more employees at 622,000, self-employed entrepreneurs at 719,000, and
estimated one million unregistered MSMEs. Data on the size distribution of firms and their
contribution to GDP and employment is not captured in official statistics.

7.     According to a 2010 USAID survey, access to finance, especially for working capital or
operational costs, is the most limiting constraint for MSME development, ahead of both security
and energy shortages.6 A USAID project team estimated that fewer than 5% of SMEs in the
formal sector have ever received a bank loan.7 This is largely due to the loan terms, which are
not appealing to MSMEs: the repayment terms are too short and the collateral requirements
exceed the loan amounts.8 Further exacerbating the problem, bankers experience in lending to
MSMEs and general technical skills in analyzing credit risk and conducting cash-flow analysis.

  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS. According to the website, “Domestic credit to private
sector refers to financial resources provided to the private sector, such as through loans, purchases of non-equity
securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable, that establish a claim for repayment.?
5
  The Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX), founded in 2004 with 15 companies listing their shares, already compares well
with other regional exchanges in terms of the number of listed companies. The banking sector is the largest on the
stock market, which also lists industrial, agricultural, and insurance firms. The total market value of shares listed on
the exchange is around US$3 billion and the daily trade volume averages from US$2 million to US$3 million
(USAID 2011).

III. THE MICROFINANCE LANDSCAPE IN IRAQ9

8.      Government programs. In 2007, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA)
started providing loans. Pursuant to a 2012 law that established an IQD 150 billion fund (US$
129 million) for loans ranging from IQD 5 to 20 million (US$ 4,300-17,000), it is currently
implementing a new SME loan program.

9.      Non-governmental organization microfinance institutions (NGO MFIs).The Iraqi
microfinance sector started in 2003, under the impulse of the USAID-Izdihar program, later
followed by USAID-Tijara, both being instrumental in funding and scaling-up NGO MFIs. MFIs
offerings have thus far been limited to microcredit and, to a much lesser extent, basic micro-
insurance services. As of December 2012, their cumulative outstanding portfolio totaled
US$ 150 million (IQD 174.6 billion), equivalent to 0.25% of the banking sector’s assets.

10.     The Iraqi microfinance sector remains one of the smallest and least developed in the
MENA region in terms of penetration as a percentage of the overall population. However, it has
grown to become a noticeable part of the microfinance industry in the MENA region due to its
portfolio size (as opposed to outreach), which is a product of the relatively high average loan size
(US$ 1,500) and the large and growing population (33 million, with a fertility rate of 4.6 children
per woman).

11.     Microcredit in Iraq is typically segmented into three product types based on the loan size:
up to US$ 500 reaching the very poor, US$500-5,000 reaching micro-enterprises, and US$5,000-
25,000 reaching small enterprises. In comparison to bank loans, NGO MFIs provide much
quicker loan processing (within days) and generally do not require onerous collateral
requirements. Most NGO MFIs accept guarantors or use solidarity groups as a form of social
collateral.

A. Demand for Microfinance

12.     There is limited information on the demand for microfinance products and services in
Iraq including credit, savings, insurance, payments, or transfers. Market potential has never been
precisely addressed, but untapped demand is likely to be sufficiently large given the 7.36 million
poor (22% of the population), out of which 2.5 million are economically active (8% of the
population).

13.     While there is no household survey data that captures the demand and/or usage of
financial services, Iraq was part of the 2011 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex)
Survey10, which measured how people in 148 countries – including the poor, women, and rural
residents – save, borrow, make payments and manage risk. The results of the survey confirm the
findings of smaller surveys, i.e. that access to financial services for households and
microenterprises is very low in Iraq, both by regional and income group standards. According to
Global Findex, in 2011, only 10.6% of households of the adult population in Iraq had access to
an account at a formal financial institution, the third lowest level in the MENA region, and
significantly below the regional average (17.7%) and income group average (57.2%).

14.     Access to formal financial services is even more limited for certain segments of the
population, particularly for women and people in rural areas. An estimated 7.5% of female adults
in Iraq had access to an account at a formal financial institution (compared to13.5% of male
adults), which is well below the regional and income group average. A similar gap can be
observed between rural and urban areas: only 7.6% of rural households had access to an account
compared to 12.2% in urban areas.

upper middle income countries (Graph 2).

16.     A similar pattern is observed when it comes to borrowing. While 54% of adult Iraqis
reported to having borrowed over the period prior to the survey – higher than the regional and
income group average (Table 2) -- less than 15% of borrowed credit came from a formal
financial institution. Informal sources of credit such as family, friends, store owners and
employers are a more important source of financing to Iraqi adults than in other MENA and/or
upper middle income countries (Table 2).

17.    These findings indicate that there is a significant demand for financial services in Iraq –
both on the savings and credit side – that remains unmet by the formal financial sector.

B. Supply of Microfinance
Microcredit
18.     As noted above, bank credit in Iraq is low in general and non-existent at the micro level.
As of October 2012, MoLSA reported 73,323 loans disbursed at subsidized rates (0%-2%) over
2007-2009, but there is no available information on its current outstanding clients. Aside from
MoLSA, the only providers of credit at the micro level are the NGO MFIs. As of December
2012, 12 MFIs were serving 98,766 active clients (1.3% of the poor population; 21% of which
were women), throughout Iraq’s 18 provinces. All MFIs lend in United States dollars and leave
the foreign exchange risk to the client.11

19.     Similar to their regional peers, Iraqi MFIs can be divided in two categories: the large and
fastest-growing MFIs, showing strong portfolio quality and profitability; and the smaller MFIs,
witnessing much lower growth rates and poorer portfolio quality and sustainability. As such, the
Iraqi microcredit industry is relatively concentrated and championed by international NGOs or
their local affiliates. The largest two MFIs, CHF and Al Thiqa, manage 56% of the portfolio and
44% of the clients. This figure goes up to 71% of the portfolio and 66% of the clients for the top
four institutions. It should be noted that in order to benefit from a grant made available only to
NGOs registered in Kurdistan, CHF and Relief International have supported the setup of legally
independent institutions under the Kurdistan NGO law (respectively, Amalkom and Izdiharuna;
while both initially shared part of the supporting NGO offices, only Amalkom currently
maintains sharing agreements with CHF).

20.     Despite the difficult operating environment, Iraqi MFIs have maintained a good, although
deteriorating, portfolio quality. Non-performing loans over 30 days (NPL 30) reached 2.7% as of
December 2012, more than double their June 2012 level of 1.2%, which already represented an
increase of nearly two times from the December 2010 level of 0.7%. MFIs with fraud or
governance issues bear the highest risk (NPL 30 above the median reported to the MIX Market
of 3%-4%; above 10% for some MFIs) but the increase has impacted the entire industry. 12 At the
aggregated level, operating costs were significantly cut over the years, evidencing economies of
scale, and sustainability levels have been positive since 2009. Performance still varies
significantly from one MFI to another, regardless of size, origin, or area of operations. Portfolio
yields range from 20% to 40% over 2011-2012.

21.     The sector has experienced growth over the past years, as is often the case of young
microfinance industries. However, year-on-year growth rates in both outstanding portfolio and
number of clients are declining: +48% and +52%, respectively, in 2009; +17% and +14%,
respectively, in 2012, with a steeper decline witnessed over the second half of 2012 and 2013.
Lack of funds is one of the main reasons behind this decline and will be a major growth
constraint going forward. Although most MFIs have historically relied on grants, there have been
no new grants since September 2012. Other sources of funds are limited. NGOs cannot raise
equity or take deposits. Despite the absence of restrictions on fund transfers into and out of Iraq,

11
     The FX rate has been stable over 2010-2013 with some minor fluctuations.
12
     Write-offs are not available, which makes it difficult to analyze the industry credit risk as a whole.

international microfinance investors are not active in the country, with the exception of OPIC.13
Furthermore, there appear to be no local investors or banks willing to lend to MFIs, though few
MFIs have approached banks to obtain a loan (one MFI reported being offered an interest rate of
15% that was deemed too high). NGOs are not legally prohibited from borrowing, but local
banks are reluctant to lend in the absence of legally liable owners and of customary collateral.

22.      The Iraq Microfinance Network (IMFN) was formally registered in April 2012 as an
independent NGO. It represents all 12 NGO MFIs and is the industry body in charge of
strengthening the sector through coordination, training, advocacy, and research. It aims at
facilitating the dialogue between microfinance stakeholders in the country, lobbying for more
favorable policies, and collecting industry data. Every year, it publishes a report analyzing the
state of the microfinance industry in Iraq and organizes a national conference gathering local and
international partners. It also delivers training workshops to its members.

Insurance
24.     Insurance is virtually non-existent in Iraq, with the overall supply to end clients limited to
basic car insurance services.

25.    According to IMFN, there have been some attempts to provide micro-insurance services,
but no viable product has emerged so far due in part to a lack of understanding of the needs of
poor and low-income customers and to a general lack of understanding of insurance practices. In
2012, Relief International and Izdiharuna bought a credit life insurance policy from a Lebanese-
based insurance company, Commercial Insurance, but the contract is still pending renewal.

26.     In the light of increasing credit risk, some MFIs have sought guarantees for their loan
portfolio. Al Aman contracted the National Insurance Company, a local company, but later
discontinued the contract. Other MFIs, including Al Bashaer, tried to close a deal with the Iraqi
Company for Bank Guarantees, a company set up by USAID, but have so far not been satisfied
by the offer.

Payments and Transfers
27.     Data was not available on payments and transfers. To date, no work has been done on any
kind of payment service (e.g. mobile phone-based, cards) for low-income consumers.

IV. LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MICROFINANCE SERVICES IN IRAQ

A. The basic laws governing financial institutions

28.     The laws and regulations of primary relevance to Microfinance in Iraq include: 1) the
Central Bank Law, 2) the Banking Law and the prudential regulations adopted thereunder, 3) the
Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law, 4) the Insurance Law, 5) the NGO Law, 6)
the Iraqi Kurdistan Region NGO Law of 2011, 7) the Council of Ministers Instruction (#6 from
2010) on implementation of the NGO law and 8) the SME Finance Companies Ordinance.

The Central Bank Law and the Banking Law
29.    The CBI was established as an independent monetary policy regulator14 and is
responsible for promoting a competitive, stable and market led financial system. Under the
Central Bank Law and the Banking Law, the CBI is responsible for licensing, regulating, and



14
  The CBI was established under the Central Bank Law of 1976 which was repealed and replaced by the Central
Bank Law of 2004.


                                                   - 12 -
supervising banks as well as lending companies.15 The Central Bank Law also provides that “the
CBI may take whatever action it deems necessary to regulate and supervise lending companies,
microfinance companies, and any other non-bank financial institutions not otherwise regulated
under Iraqi law? (Article 4).16 Although NGO MFIs are registered under the NGO Law, the CBI
arguably has the right to regulate them as financial institutions.

30.    The Central Bank Law also gives the CBI responsibility over the national payment
system and payment service providers.

The Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law
31.     In 2012, the Parliament passed the Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law.
Besides giving interest free loans with the maximum limit of IQD 20 million for each loan (US$
17,000), the law also aims to create jobs, reduce unemployment, build capacity, and simplify the
registration procedures of small projects.17 The law created a Fund with a capital of IQD 150
billion (US$ 129million) paid by the government, and exempts all small projects created under
this law from income tax and government fees.18

The Insurance Law
32.      The Insurance Law was approved in 2005 and aims at regulating and supervising the
insurance sector to enable it to grow and develop to create a free, secure and transparent market
in the country. The law clearly states that insurance services can only be provided by entities
licensed by the insurance regulatory authority, Al-Diwan. Insurance companies are required to
notify Al-Diwan before opening, closing or relocating branches. All insurance companies are
subject to a set of requirements including minimum capital (set by regulation), “fit and proper?
requirements for the management, auditing and reporting requirements to guarantee the safety
and soundness of these entities. According to the law and in order to protect insurance policy
holders, all insurance companies must deposit an amount, as approved by the head of Al-Diwan,
in a licensed Iraqi bank as a guarantee for the payment of any future claims and liabilities.

33.     Insurance agents are subject to separate licensing requirements and procedures under a
special instruction. An agent acting on behalf of insurance companies must be licensed by the
regulator. NGO MFIs are not permitted to act as an agent of an insurance company. With respect
to credit life insurance, an NGO MFI has a contractual relationship with the insurance company
but is not an agent.



15
   It is unclear whether the CBI could regulate the NGOs under the current laws. Resolution of this issue would
require a discussion between the NGO Directorate and the CBI.
16
   The CBI has a separate department for each type of institution that it regulates and supervises. According to the
2011 World Bank Iraq Financial Sector Review report, at that time, the CBI supervised over 40 banks and over
1,750 other financial institutions, including MFIs, exchange bureaus, money transmission services, investment
companies.
17
   The Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law defined a “small project? as an income -generating project
with no more than 10 employees.

   Article 15 of Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law.

The NGO Law of 2010, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region NGO Law of 2011 and the Council of
Ministers Instruction #6 of 2010
34.     A new NGO law (n°12) was approved in March 2010. It allows the registration of both
national and international NGOs under the supervisory umbrella of the NGO Directorate. There
is no explicit reference to NGOs operating as MFIs (and there is no prohibition, as the previous
law implied).19 Under the new law, NGOs previously registered are required to undertake a new
registration and to conform to all the new rules and requirements.20 The law sets forth procedures
for the registration of NGOs21, but the process is often cited as burdensome and time-consuming.
The law places more emphasis than the former law on good governance and transparency rules
and requirements. These include yearly financial report to the NGO Directorate including a
detailed description of the sources of the NGO’s funds and financial transactions, program report
of the NGO’s activities including a briefing on the projects implemented by NGO during the
year and annual audit by the approved auditor. There are currently about 1,800 registered NGOs
in Iraq. The law does not specify a usury rate, but some MFIs report pressures to charge a
maximum flat rate of 15% per annum, inclusive of all fees.

35.     The Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved a separate NGO Law in 2011. NGOs
registered under the Iraqi Kurdistan Region NGO law are allowed to operate only in the
Kurdistan region and are exempted from taxes and customs duties. NGO MFIs registered under
the Iraqi NGO Law are permitted to operate in the Kurdistan region; however, they are required
to pay all taxes, VAT and custom duties (and therefore theoretically operate in Kurdistan at a
financial disadvantage in terms of post-tax income) although, in fact, they do not pay taxes as
there are no implementing regulations stipulating tax rates.

36.     In 2010, the Council of Ministers adopted Instruction #6 on implementation of the NGO
law. It provides that "NGOs are prohibited from practicing ... commercial businesses ." (Article
8)

The SME Finance Companies Ordinance of 2010

37.    By adopting this Ordinance, CBI explicitly allowed commercial companies (SME
Finance Companies) to engage in lending activities for SMEs. SME Finance Companies are not
permitted to engage in deposit-taking. There is no definition of “SME? in the Ordinance, nor has
any definition been issued by the CBI or any other government authority.

38.    Although it was originally drafted to address both micro and SME issues, the final
version addresses only SME Finance Companies, though the instructions include references to
MFIs. The SME Ordinance includes some key requirements:



19
   In fact, there is no legal provision (in the NGO Law or any other law) that defines the term microloan or
“microfinance institution.?
20
   As of June2013, Relief International had not yet received its registration under the new law.
21
   These include: (1) the minimum qualifications and number of the founding members, (2) no minimum capital
required and (3) offices can be opened in all Iraqi provinces.


                                                   - 14 -
        A relatively high minimum capital requirement: two billion IQD or the equivalent of
         US$ 1.7 million for a joint stock company (JSC) and one billion IQD or the equivalent of
         US$ 860,000for an LLC;22
        Board members must be residents of Iraq, which may be problematic for foreign
         investors;
        Companies should get the approval from CBI to open, close, relocate, or merge branches;
        Companies should get the approval from CBI to determine the minimum and maximum
         amount of credit offered to their clients;
        All loans should be to SMEs projects (i.e. for business purposes only);
        Companies are not allowed to borrow from local or foreign banks more than 300% of
         their capital;
        Companies are allowed to issue bonds up to only 50% of its capital;
        Companies should ask for the approval of the “relevant authorities? (not defined in the
         Ordinance or elsewhere) before accepting any local or foreign donations;
        All loans should only be given to Iraqi citizens and legal entities;
        There are provisioning requirements to be determined by CBI;
        The regulation uses the term “concessionary interest rates? but does not specify if CBI
         will set any caps on interest rates; the instructions state “interest rates must be calculated
         according to international best practices to cover operational and financial costs?; and
        Reporting requirements to the CBI include: financial resources, loan portfolio, interest
         rates, loan purpose, credit methodology, required guarantees, and statement of amounts
         allocated to the provisions required.

B. Non-prudential regulation, licensing, and oversight

Permitted Activities

39.     Licensed banks are permitted to engage in all banking activities as defined by the
Banking Law, including accepting deposits from the public and mobilizing these deposits
according to the rules set by the CBI, buying and selling foreign currencies, providing clearing,
settlement and transfer services. Although banks may engage in micro-lending, there are no
specific regulations with respect to such activities and, at this time, banks do not engage in
micro-lending. Banks are prohibited from engaging in certain specified activities, including
insurance underwriting and re-insurance, except on a temporary basis to satisfy a claim.

40.    SME Finance Companies are allowed to engage in lending activities to SMEs, which can
include micro-enterprises.

41.  There is no explicit legal requirement to obtain permission to lend under the Iraqi law.23
NGO MFIs, SME Finance Companies and banks are currently the only entities that engage in


22
   The Companies Act currently sets the minimum capital of a JSC at IQD 2 million (US$ 1,700), the minimum
capital of an LLC at IQD 1 million (US$ 850), and all other companies at IQD 50,000 (US$ 42). The Banking law
states a minimum capital requirement of IQD 10 billion (US$ 8.5 million), which the CBI recently increased to IQD
150 billion (US$ 127 million).


                                                     - 15 -
lending activities. The NGO law does not prohibit NGO MFIs from engaging in lending
activities as long as there is no direct or indirect distribution of profits to their members.


                                         Box 1: Microfinance in Yemen

In 2009 Yemen created a new tier of deposit-taking financial institutions by adopting the
Microfinance Banks Law. The law does not set any restrictions on foreign investments or
participations and sets minimum capital requirements for the establishment of a microfinance
bank at YER 500 million or about US$ 2.3 million, making it very accessible. There are
currently two licensed microfinance banks in Yemen. However, the political climate has made it
difficult to attract foreign investors. Microfinance banks fall under the supervision of the Central
Bank of Yemen who adopted specific prudential rules to suit the special nature of microfinance
(e.g., limitations on transactions with related parties, the prohibition of insider lending, liquidity
and capital adequacy ratios, provisioning requirements and credit risk management).


Consumer protection
42.     Banks and financial institutions (including finance companies under the SME Ordinance)
are also subject to bank secrecy and privacy provisions of the Banking Law and Central Bank
directives. However, there is no separate consumer protection regulation for financial services in
Iraq.

43.    In August 2010, the twelve NGO MFIs operating in Iraq’s 18 provinces signed a Code of
Conduct and Ethics which is currently being updated. The code states that MFIs have to “uphold
core values such as high quality financial services, transparency, respect for religion, fair lending
and collection practices, privacy of client information and integration of social values into
business decision making.?24 This code is not enforceable and depends solely on the MFIs
goodwill as it has no legal basis, notably in case of breach. The NGO law does not contain any
provisions similar to the bank secrecy and privacy provisions applicable to banks.

Credit reporting

Only licensed banks are permitted to participate in the CBI’s credit registry (they are also
required to participate), which has a threshold of 25 million Iraqi Dinars (the equivalent of
US$ 21,255). There is no effective credit information sharing system in place for other financial
institutions, including NGO MFIs. The Banking law allows banks to create credit information

23
   Both the Banking Law and Central Bank Law differentiate between two terms, the first is “Banking Business?,
defined by both laws as accepting deposits from the public and using these deposits to grant credit, and the second is
“Banking Activities? as stated in Article (27) of the Banking Law and included credit activities. Furthermore,
Article (3) of the Banking Law prohibited any person from engaging i n any “Banking Business? without obtaining a
license from CBI, which means that credit activities is not included in the prohibited activities, as stipulated in
Article (3), and should not be treated as a “Banking Business? thus do not require the license of CBI. Moreover,
Article (3/2/a) of the Banking Law excluded persons who fund credit from non-refundable capital subscriptions or
credit received from financial.

agencies that collect and share information concerning the financial affairs of customers (existing
and prospective) with banks (and only banks). Credit information about a person that is held by
such an agency or bureau may be furnished only to a bank that has a current or prospective
customer relationship with the subject of the information. When sharing any credit information,
banks must at all times abide with the rules adopted by the CBI pursuant to the Banking Law.25
Today there is no such private credit bureau operating in Iraq.According to the CBI, SME
Finance Companies may be allowed in the future to participate in the CBI’s credit information
system.

44.     The only source of credit information for MFIs was a blacklist system (no longer
operating) established on the Iraqi Microfinance Knowledge Portal, giving authorized users the
possibility to manage and search a database of blacklisted borrowers.26 The system was intended
to serve MFIs’ needs to identify delinquent and defaulting clients, although the total or defaulted
loan amount was not stored in the database and there was no mechanism for clients to access
information on them, file a complaint on inaccurate or outdated data, or correct it.

Limitations on ownership, management, and capital structure

45.     According to the Iraqi laws,27 except with respect to banks, there are no limitations on
foreign ownership of commercial companies in Iraq. Non-Iraqis are allowed to (i) possess, use,
and dispose of their investment, (ii) manage or participate in managing a business entity, (iii)
transfer their rights and obligations, and (iv) transfer dividends, profits and investment proceeds
to their home country.28 There are some restrictions on foreign investment in the banking sector.
Foreign individuals and entities are allowed to own a maximum of 10% of a licensed bank in
Iraq. These limitations do not apply to licensed foreign banks who are allowed to participate in
licensed Iraqi banks if they are, among other conditions, supervised by the national regulatory
and supervisory authority of their home country.29 Foreign banks are allowed to open branches
and representative offices in Iraq.30 There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of NBFIs31
and according to CBI’s SME Finance Companies Ordinance there are no restrictions on foreign
investment. Moreover, the NGO law allows foreign NGOs to operate in Iraq after acquiring the
proper license.

   Paragraph 2 of Article 39 of the Banking Law No. 94 of 2004.
26
   According to IMFN, the service was not useful due to limited data upload, notably because many MFIs work in
areas with little competition.

   Article (12) of the Companies Law of 1997 stated: “ A juridical or natural person, foreign or domestic, has the
right to acquire membership in the companies stipulated in this law as founder, shareholder, or partner, unless such
person is banned from such membership under the law, or due to a decision issued by a competent court or
authorized governmental body.? Ministerial Instruction No. 196 dated March 15, 2004 and Ministerial Instruction
No. 149 dated February 29, 2004stressed that in more details.

Governance

46.     The Banking Law sets minimum “fit and proper? requirements for the board members of
a licensed bank, including a requirement for the majority of members to have strong banking
experience, and full and complete disclosure of interests that would constitute a conflict of
interest. All banks are required to abide by the minimum governance rules and requirements
stipulated by the CBIs prudential regulations. The law also required setting reliable internal and
external auditing procedures.

47.    The SME Finance Companies Ordinance sets some minimum requirements for board
members, to ensure the companies are managed according to the law and CBIs instructions. All
board members must be “fit and proper? and enjoy good reputation, cannot sit on the board of
another Iraqi company or bank, and must reside in Iraq. The board must include at least three
members with banking, financial or legal expertise and a university degree. Moreover, the
governor of the CBI has the right to supervise the qualifications of the companies’ o fficers
according to a set of rules to be adopted by the CBI.

48.     The NGO Law sets some basic governance requirements, mainly to avoid any conflicts of
interests by requiring members to avoid and disclose any conflict of interest. The MFIs’ Code of
Ethics and Conduct includes governance provisions that refer to board members (i.e. that they
have a good and sound reputation and that the majority of an MFI’s directives are independent
and/or duly elected representatives of the community that the MFI serves), transparency in the
maintenance of books and accounts, and reporting with respect to compliance with the Code of
Ethics and Conduct. For local NGOs, 25% of the Board members may be foreign but any Board
member must be resident or have a one-year visa. For foreign NGOs, there is no such restriction.

Secured transactions

49.     The banking system is heavily collateralized, and in a predominant number of cases, real
estate is the preferred type of collateral, with motor vehicles sometimes used as collateral as
well. Other types of movable properties, such as equipment/machinery, accounts receivable, and
inventory are not used to secure payment obligations.

50.    There seem to be very limited understanding of secured transactions from both public and
private sector stakeholders, and the existing legal framework is not conducive to the
development of this form of finance. However, according to some practitioners (e.g. Iraq
Company for Bank Guarantees), some finance institutions would be willing to use various
movables as collateral, provided there is the appropriate legal framework in place.

Loan recovery framework
51.      There are no specific regulations for loan recovery that would assist banks, financial
institutions and NGOs from avoiding the lengthy court system to enforce loan contracts.
According to the World Bank publication “Doing Business 2014?, Iraq ranks 142 out of 189 in
contract enforcement, compared to the MENA average rank of 118.32

Financial crime/AML/CFT
52.     The CBI is authorized to take any action it considers necessary to counter money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.33 External auditors need to certify whether or not
adequate measures have been taken by banks to prevent money laundering or the financing of
terrorism. Other financial service providers (e.g., money transfer offices and exchange bureaus)
are also under the supervision of the CBI.

53.    The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2004 applies to all transactions above US$ 10,000
(above the range of microloans but within that of SME loans). According to the World Bank
Financial Sector Review (Sept. 2011), a revised draft law provides that the CBI will establish an
Anti-Money Laundering Bureau, but there has been no change to the status of the draft law to
date.

54.     Iraq was subject to a FATF-MENA AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation in 2012. It was
classified under the “High-risk and non-cooperative Jurisdictions? in June 2013.

Tax treatment of microfinance
55.    NGO MFIs formed under the Iraq NGO law are subject to tax under the current laws but
have not been asked to pay taxes to date. NGOs formed under the Kurdistan law are exempt from
tax. Additional information on tax treatment (e.g. whether special deductions permitted for banks
and other finance companies – if any – are permitted to be deducted by NGO MFIs) is
unavailable.

C. Prudential Regulation

56.     Typically, prudential regulation is applied to banks and other deposit-taking institutions
but not to lending-only institutions as they use only their own capital and borrowed funds rather
than public deposits.34 However, some regulators do apply prudential regulations (although
perhaps a limited range) to credit only institutions. This may be advisable if the institutions are
sufficiently large in terms of total loan portfolio and number of clients. In Iraq, there are no
deposit-taking microfinance institutions, but the CBI has applied certain prudential regulations to
SME Finance Companies (initial minimum capital requirement, debt to equity limitations,
provisioning, reporting). There are no prudential regulations applicable to NGO MFIs.

Capital adequacy
57.    The CBI has set a minimum risk weighted capital adequacy ratio for banks of 12% based
on consolidated financial statements that include all branches inside and outside Iraq and
subsidiaries. There is no specified risk-weighting for microloans.




33
  Article 4(2) of the Law on the Central Bank of Iraq.
34
  The owners or founders, grantors and lenders of these non-depositary institutions are presumed to monitor the
activities and ensure that the funds are not being subject to undue risk of loss.

58.     As noted above, SME Finance Companies are subject to certain debt to equity
requirements: total borrowings from local or foreign banks may not exceed 300% of capital and
issued bonds may not exceed 50% of capital.

Unsecured lending limits and loan-loss provisions
59.     Based on the CBI’s prudential regulation,35 loans are classified quantitatively, in terms of
time overdue, and qualitatively, based on the client’s cash flow compared to the loan/installment
amount, the availability and accuracy of needed information about the client’s business and
financial capabilities, the reputation and experience of the client’s management team and the
accuracy of the true market value of guarantees. There is, however, no specific instruction
regarding provisioning for microloans. Performance on these indicators determines the loan
classification which is based on five categories: “good?, requiring no provisions; “average?,
overdue more than 30, but less than 90 days, and other criteria, requiring no provisions; “below
average?, overdue more than 90 but less than 180 days, requiring 20% provisions; “doubtful?,
requiring a provision of 50%, and “bad?, requiring a 100% provision. The regulations did not yet
set limits on unsecured lending.36

60.    The above requirements apply to banks only and not to NBFIs (e.g. SME Finance
Companies). The SME Finance Companies Ordinance states that provisioning requirements for
SME Finance Companies shall be determined by the CBI. There was no information available to
determine if the CBI issued any requirements.

Liquidity and Foreign exchange risk
61.     Banks are required to adopt adequate and reliable policies and procedures to control
liquidity, foreign exchange, and other risks. Banks must report their liquidity forecasts to the CBI
on a daily basis and make sure that the minimum ratio between assets and liabilities, in all
currencies, maturing within a week is according to the ratio set by the CBI.

62.    SME Finance Companies are only allowed to extend loans in IQD. The law does not set
any requirements for liquidity and foreign exchange risks.

Loan documentation
63.     Banks are required to keep all documents related to clients and their transactions for a
minimum period of seven years.37 Banks are allowed to electronically archive any documents
after getting the approval of the CBI to ensure of the reliability of the archiving system. The
SME Finance Companies Ordinance does not state any minimum loan documentation
requirements with the exception of having a clear loan contract that discloses the “true interest
rate? (not defined) for the client.

   The Implementing Regulations of the Banking Law No. 94 of 2004, issued by the CBI on January 2011.

   According to the SEEP Framework, when not imposed by the regulator, allowance rates are based on the
historical analysis of loan loss rates. They vary according to the loans past due by age: 0%-10% for 1-30 days; 0%-
30% for 31-60 days; 0%-50% for 61-90 days; 25%-75% for 91-180 days; 75%-100% for 181-365 days and over.

Maximum loan amount
64.    A bank may not extend loan(s) exceeding 15% to 20% of its capital to any person,
including related parties. There is no such limitation for SME Finance Companies.

Branching requirements
65.    Both banks and SME Finance Companies are required to gain prior approval of the CBI
before opening, closing or changing the location of any branch.

Agents and outsourcing
66.    There are no provisions in the Banking Law on banks’ use of agents or outsourcing.
There are no provisions on agents or outsourcing in the SME Finance Companies Ordinance.

Reporting
67.     Under the Banking Law, the CBI has the authority to require banks and their subsidiaries
to provide all such information as the CBI may request. Banks are required to submit their
annual consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Banks must periodically submit to
the CBI statements showing assets and liabilities, foreign currency exposures, reserve position,
liquid assets, large exposures, credit to related parties and information on deposits, credit lines,
credit plans, and off-balance sheet commitments.

68.     As stated above, SME Finance Companies must file reports with the CBI on: financial
resources, loan portfolio, interest rates, loan purpose, credit methodology, required guarantees,
and statement of amounts allocated to the provisions required.

Reserves against deposits
69.     According to the CBI’s Reserve Requirement Regulation, “a bank shall maintain reserves
in the form of current accounts with the CBI in Dinar and foreign currencies during the reserve
maintenance period so that the average of the amount of eligible current account balances at the
end of each banking day over the month and the average of the Iraqi Dinar vault cash balances
collected by the commercial bank during the maintenance period month equals the reserve
requirement for that period.

Insider lending
70.     Banks must have the pre-approvals of its Board, as well as the CBI for insider lending.
Insider lending is defined as credit to managers and key officers, board members, their relatives
(up to second degree), and related companies. The aggregate total of these credits is limited to 15
% of the bank’s capital.

71.     According to the SME Finance Companies Ordinance, licensed companies are not
allowed to extend loans to any board member, director, officer or any member of the board of
any of its subsidiaries.

D. NGO Transformations

72.     There is currently a lack of regulatory clarity regarding how an NGO MFI can legally
“transform? its operating model into an SME Finance Company or other for-profit company.38
The current law does not prohibit an NGO from selling its loan portfolio provided that (i) the
NGO uses the proceeds in its permitted activities and according to its mission and (ii) there is no
direct or indirect distribution of profits by the NGO to its members, founders or employees. The
same analysis would apply to the transfer by the NGO of its portfolio to an SME Finance
Company in exchange for shares. Notwithstanding this, according to at least one MFI, the NGO
Directorate takes the position that local NGO MFIs are not permitted to transfer assets to a
company in exchange for assets of equivalent value or for shares. This is appears to be based on
a misunderstanding of the law, which prohibits NGOs from engaging in commercial activities for
the purpose of distributing funds to its members or in order to avoid taxes. Therefore, if neither
of these two conditions applies, then the NGO arguably should not, under current applicable
Iraqi law, be prohibited to engage in such activities.


                    Box 2: Arab countries that explicitly allow MFI transformation

     1. Tunisia. The Microfinance Law of 2011 which allows both NGOs and companies to
        engage in microfinance (Article 2) also allows NGO-MFIs to own shares in/establish
        microfinance companies (Article 26).

     2. Palestine. The Microfinance Regulation of 2011 that allows for-profit and non-profit
        companies to engage in microfinance (Article 4 paragraph 2) also allows non-profit MFIs
        to own shares in/establish for-profit companies (Articles 31 & 32).

     3. Morocco. The 2013 amendment of the Microfinance Law allows NGO MFIs to own part
        or all the shares of microfinance companies (Article 1)

     Notes:
     1. Both Lebanon and Jordan allowed transformations of NGO MFIs without enacting a
        legislation that explicitly allows such transactions.
     2. The latest version of the Egyptian draft Microfinance Law of February 2014, expected to
        be approved soon, which allows both NGOs and companies to engage in microfinance,
        also allows NGO MFIs to own shares in/establish microfinance companies (Article 3).




38
  The legal form of an NBFI has several advantages over the non-profit NGO form, including (i) the ability to
provide a variety of financial services beyond credit (with the exception of mobilizing deposits from the public); (ii)
unrestricted access to both domestic and foreign funding whether through debt or equity, (iii) the ability to distribute
profits, thereby attracting private investment, and (iv) fewer restrictions in foreign participation.


                                                         - 22 -
73.     One oft-cited concern about the provision of microfinance services by for-profit entities
versus non-profit entities is the perceived increased risk of mission drift. The concern is that the
transformed MFI would shift its their focus from a public benefit purpose to instead serve the
private interests of its owners, which may diverge from their original social mandate and be more
profit driven. NGO MFIs can strongly influence the orientation of the new entity by retaining an
ownership interest to ensure that it continues to serve its original social mission (e.g., serving the
poor). Even if the new entity decides to open its capital to new investors, it can continue to
preserve its mission by ensuring that the interests of the new investors are aligned with its
mission (e.g. through socially responsible investors).

E. Oversight and Supervision of Non-Depository MFIs

74.    Since 2010, the CBI is responsible for supervising and regulating SME Finance
Companies according to the SME Finance Companies Ordinance of 2010. The NGO Directorate
has the authority m to oversee NGOs, including NGO MFIs. However, for reasons described
above, the CBI arguably has the authority under the Central Bank Law to regulate and supervise
NGO MFIs as financial institutions.

75.     Although there are arguments against having a prudential regulator (such as the CBI)
regulate and supervise non-depositary financial institutions – in some cases, it is preferable if the
alternative is a non-financial regulator that is unfamiliar with financial institutions, their
operations, management and risks.

76.     The NGO Directorate in Iraq has a limited understanding of MFI operations. It has not
adopted special regulations for NGO MFIs and their financial activities. In fact, it has tried to
impose (and in some cases, successfully impose) certain requirements on NGO MFIs that are not
specified in the law, including prohibiting transfers of funds outside the country to repay a loan,
requesting NGO MFIs to abide by an interest rate cap set by the NGO Directorate, and
preventing NGO MFIs from selling assets to a for-profit institution. With proper training and
capacity building to understand the special nature of microfinance, the CBI is well placed to act
as the regulator and supervisor of MFIs given its role as financial sector supervisor. The CBI has
the mandate to regulate and supervise financial institutions, which could include NGO MFIs.
This would ensure a coherent and unified oversight over the same activities that are provided by
financial institutions licensed by the CBI, and would allow a better support for NGO MFIs that
seek to improve their governance and risk-management, paving the way for a possible
transformation.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEVELOPING MICROFINANCE IN IRAQ

Set forth below are short and medium term recommendations that aim to enhance the overall
regulatory framework and operating environment for MFIs in Iraq. Overall, the current legal
framework is conducive to the development of the Iraqi microfinance sector if the provisions of
the law are interpreted according to international practices. Several recommendations address
what appear to be misconceptions or ambiguities of applicable laws.




                                                - 23 -
A. Short Term Recommendations

1.      Based on international practices in interpreting the current laws and regulations, clarify
the permitted and prohibited activities stated in the NGO law. Article (1) of the NGO law defines
the NGO as an entity that is engaged in non-profit activities and Article (6) of the instructions
states “it is not permissible for a non-governmental organization to engage in a profitable or
political activity?. The legislation’s intention is arguably to prevent profit distribution rather than
prohibiting NGOs from pursing profitable activities for sustainability and growth purposes.

2.   Harmonize rules applicable to NGO MFIs (Iraqi and Kurd) and SME Finance
Companies, including:
      Disclosure: NGO MFIs should be required to file reports similar to SME Finance
     Companies;
      Loan provisioning: currently the CBI has not yet set the requirements for SME
     Finance Companies and there are no requirements applicable to NGO MFIs; and
      Governance requirements: as with the boards of banks and SME Finance Companies,
     an MFI board should be required to include at least three members with banking,
     financial or legal expertise and a university degree.
3.      Determine the appropriate government agency to regulate and supervise NGO MFIs. If
possible under Iraqi law, it would be advisable to place the NGO MFIs under the supervision of
the CBI. A number of countries have placed all financial service providers, including NGO
MFIs, under the regulatory and supervisory authority of a central bank or NBFI regulator. There
are a number of potential benefits of such an arrangement including a level playing field and
clear rules of the game that are designed and applied consistently for institutions that provide the
same services. In addition, the central bank may also be better placed to understand linkages
between different financial institutions and monitor non-prudential regulations (e.g., proper
disclosure of interest rates and fees to clients, consumer protection, etc.).

4.      In the case of Iraq, the central bank seems to be the best placed regulator and supervisor
of MFIs given its role as financial sector supervisor. In addition to the benefits of unified
oversight over the same activities, the CBI would be in a better position to advise NGO MFIs
that seek to improve their governance and risk-management, paving the way for a possible
transformation into a finance company or even Microfinance bank. If it is not possible for the
CBI to regulate and supervise the NGO MFIs, then there needs to be strong coordination
between the CBI and the NGO Directorate. The CBI may want to establish a dedicated unit
focusing on the microcredit sector as their characteristics and oversight requires a very different
approach than conventional commercial banks.

5.    Amend the SME Finance Companies Ordinance. The Ordinance opened the doors for
commercial lending by NBFIs, however, after three years there are still no licensed finance
companies. Certain provisions could be amended in order to stimulate the growth of these
companies:

        Setting a high initial minimum capital requirement is a means to avoid overburdening
       the supervisory capacity of CBI. However, NBFIs such as SME Finance Companies are

                                                 - 24 -
         not deposit-taking institutions and therefore should typically not require prudential
         regulation and supervision, which are more onerous for both the regulator and the
         regulated institutions. If the SME Finance Companies were numerous and large enough
         to be of systemic significance, then there might be an argument for imposing certain
         prudential requirements. Instead of setting high minimum capital requirements, the
         regulator can adopt, among other options, “fit and proper? requirements on the
         shareholders, board members and executives of these companies to control the quality of
         these new entrants.
          The same rationale applies to the limitations on bank debt (currently set at 300% of
         capital) and bonds (50% of capital), which can hinder growth. It is recommended to
         remove such limitations and let the lenders determine whether an SME finance company
         can take on the debt burden.
          Restrictions on local and foreign donations also hinder growth. There is no clear
         rationale for requiring government approval prior to accepting a donation.
          Branch opening, closing and relocation are key elements to any successful finance
         endeavor. The prior approval requirement of new branches cab help “direct? branch
         openings towards underserved segments. However, restrictions on closing branches often
         result in populations being unserved because financial institutions do not wish to risk
         being trapped in unprofitable locations.
          Fewer restrictions on foreign participation would help in attracting foreign investment
         and expertise thus advance growth and development. According to the SME Finance
         Ordinance, there are direct restrictions (e.g. limitations on ownership) and indirect
         restrictions (e.g., limitations on the citizenship or the place of residence of board
         members).

6.     Expedite re-registration procedures for registered NGOs and the registration procedures
for new NGOs. This does not require an amendment to the NGO Law.

7.     Define “microloan?, “SME?, and other relevant terms in the relevant laws to avoid
regulatory arbitrage that could be linked to serving the MSME segment.

B. Medium Term Recommendations

1.     Conduct a demand study to assess current demand among the poor and low-income
population for a variety of services including credit, savings, payments and transfers, and
insurance.

2.       Clarify the legal process on how an NGO-MFI can “transform? into (i.e. transfer its
activities) an SME Finance Company or other for-profit company.39 The current state of the law
does not prohibit an NGO from selling its loan portfolio or exchanging its assets provided that (i)

39
  The legal form of an NBFI has several advantages over the non-profit NGO form, including (i) the ability to
provide a variety of financial services beyond credit (with the exception of mobilizing deposits from the public); (ii)
unrestricted access to both domestic and foreign funding whether through debt or equity, (iii) the ability to distribute
profits, thereby attracting private investment, and (iv) fewer restrictions in foreign participation.


                                                         - 25 -
the NGO uses the proceeds in its permitted activities and according to its mission and (ii) there is
no direct or indirect distribution of profits by the NGO to its members. The same analysis would
apply to the transfer by the NGO of its portfolio to an SME Finance Company in exchange for
shares. The important issue is to ensure that the exchange is for the true value of the portfolio
and any other assets it might transfer if the market value is not apparent. All relevant supervisory
and regulatory authorities, including the NGO Directorate, the Companies’ Registrar and CBI,
must coordinate together to create a clear path for transformation. Allowing existing Iraqi
microfinance providers (NGO MFIs) to take advantage of the NBFI category of companies
would create a level playing field among credit providers and assist these entities to develop and
grow. In general, the focus should be on rules to protect consumers, enforce transparency and
reporting requirements in regulating and supervising NBFIs.

3.     Adopt financial consumer protection rules and have them apply to all financial services
providers. Such rules should include basic measures regarding disclosure (e.g., simple format for
terms of loan, standard format for pricing of products, ability to compare across products,
information about FX risk for clients), transparency and reporting, fairness, and recourse. The
NGO Directorate’s attempt to apply a supra-legal usury requirement should be discouraged given
the lack of success that usury rates typically have in reducing excessive interest rates and the
negative impact that such rates often have on outreach to the poor.

4.      Establish a comprehensive credit information sharing system, which is typically very
helpful in bringing down the costs associated with lending. A well run and accurate credit bureau
(housed in the CBI) can provide financial institutions with an inexpensive means of assessing the
creditworthiness of many potential new borrowers. This can reduce associated risks for both
MSMEs and lenders and thus reduce the risk of over-indebtedness40 and loan delinquency. By
applying a zero threshold in the current credit information system at CBI and permitting NGO
MFIs to participate (which presumably would be possible if they were to be regulated by the
CBI), the system will be useful for all financial institutions and not only banks. The participation
of all financial institutions, including NGO MFIs, in the sharing system will also reduce the
credit information gap.41 In the interim, it would be useful to have a better developed information
sharing system among the MFIs managed by the Iraq Microfinance Network or an IT company.
In addition to an improved public credit registry, credit information could be further enhanced
through the establishment of private credit bureaus. These often provide additional value-added
services like credit scores that help banks to better assess the creditworthiness of individuals and
firms and ultimately enhance their access to financing.

5.       Encourage bank downscaling. The banking regulations should clearly permit banks to use
agents and should set forth who can act as agents (e.g., individuals, legal entities) and what
activities agents may engage in (e.g., AML/CFT compliance, deposits and withdrawals). The
regulations should also specify the provisioning for microloans (which should same provisioning
for all microloans, regardless of what type of institutions is making the loans). Finally, the
regulations should have appropriate risk-weighting of microloans.

40
   To avoid client over-indebtedness through multiple loans, some jurisdictions require obtaining a client’s credit
report prior to granting a loan.
41
   Article 51 of the Banking Law gives the CBI the authority to include any entity in the Credit Information System.


                                                       - 26 -
6.      Shift the role of the government from direct funding provider to facilitator or wholesale
funder. Direct government funding schemes that make below-market or interest-free loans – such
as the interest-free loans made pursuant to the Support of Small Income-Generating Projects Law
– have low repayment rates and are inefficient in solving the finance gaps in the society.
Moreover, such government intervention creates market distortion due to the unfair competition
with the private sector. Historical evidence has shown that governmental subsidized lending
programs were usually associated with high default levels, absorbing large amounts of public
funds and harmed the development of sustainable lenders without achieving the desired results.42
A better alternative would be for the government to act as a facilitator or to provide wholesale
funding to banks and other financial institutions that are more capable of managing loan
portfolios and of reaching the targeted segments of the population.

7.     Permit MFIs to be agents of insurance companies (with appropriate safeguards).

8.      Establish a fast track process for loan recovery. Comprehensive court reform, to increase
the capacity of courts to dispose of cases in a timely manner, may not be achievable in the short
or medium term. However, greater use should be made of computerized case management and
the capacity of the execution department within the court system should be increased. More
broadly, summary procedures should be introduced in cases of simple contract enforcement/debt
collection, either alone or as part of a specialized commercial court system.

9.      Adopt the appropriate legal framework for leasing and secured transactions, as the
existing one is not conducive to the development of this form of finance. Financial leasing and
the use of various movables as collateral can greatly increase private sector access to credit in
Iraq and reduce its cost. An appropriate legal framework would allow these new mechanisms to
expand and would make sure the is a level playing field for all financial institutions especially in
regards to tax treatment; therefore, reform should include both the enactment of laws on financial
leasing and on secured transactions as well as the development of a movable collateral registry to
publicize lenders’ security interests in movable assets and to establish their priority in these
assets.

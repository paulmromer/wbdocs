Summary report


Executive Summary
Overview
The Provincial Master Plan for Water Supply and Sanitation in Quang Nam Province for the
period up to year 2030 (the Quang Nam WSS Master Plan) was developed in response to a
request from Quang Nam Provincial Peoples Committee (Quang Nam PPC) and the Ministry of
Construction (MOC). Its formulation was conceived as a pilot for implementation of the new
Construction Law (Law No. 50/2014/QH13 approved by National Assembly in 2014 and
effective from January 1, 2015.

The Plan is a supplement to the Quang Nam Provincial Construction Master Plan for the
period 2020-2030 approved by Quang Nam PPC in 2014.

The objectives of the Plan are twofold:

To improve the effectiveness and sustainability of water supply and sanitation investments in
Quang Nam province

To gain experience that could be replicated in other provinces of Vietnam through guidance
developed by MOC as requested by the new Construction Law. Both Quang Nam PPC and MOC
have expressed their strong commitment to this new type of master plan.

Scope of the Master Plan
The Plan covers all urban, sub-urban and rural residential areas of the province plus industrial
zones. Its development was based on a new concept of planning, including the integration of
water resources management; not being constrained by administrative boundaries and
urban/rural distinctions; sound institutional and financial arrangements for effective and
sustainable service delivery; and realistic action planning for the implementation of a long
term master plan.

Approach and Methodology
A study for development of the Master Plan was undertaken from April 2015-March 2016 and
involved extensive consultation with stakeholders at provincial and central levels. Collection,
review of the existing documents/ information and a small household survey were conducted
in the first stage of the study during April-May 2015. A workshop for consultation with
provincial related departments and localities on the existing status of WSS services of the
province was held in early June 2015. Based on the confirmed existing status, different
technical alternatives for further detailed study were developed and then presented on a
consultative workshop with presence of representatives of provincial departments and MOC
in late of July 2015. The most feasible alternatives that incorporated comments from the
consultative workshop were presented in the Planning Tasks which was submitted to Quang
Nam PPC for formal review and approval. The Planning Tasks have been approved by Quang
Nam PPC by it decision Number 97/QD-UBND dated January 12, 2016 and formed a legal basis
for further review and approval of the Master Plan. In compliance with the approved Planning
Task, the Master Plan was developed and its draft was presented on another consultative
workshop with central ministries, provincial departments and localities in late February. The
full set of final draft Master Plan that includes full report, summary report, drawings, strategic

environmental assessment, and a draft regulation on implementation of the Master Plan were
submitted to Quang Nam PPC for its formal review and approval in late March 2016.

Existing water supply and sanitation services
Quang Nam has relatively high rates of access to water, with 55% of the urban population
having access to clean piped water and 93% of the rural population having access to hygienic
non-piped water. Service levels are, however, low; many urban households have an
intermittent supply and many rural households experience seasonal shortages.

Urban water supply is provided by Quang Nam Water Supply and Drainage Company (WSDC)
which manages 84% of production capacity with services areas in main cities and towns, and
Quang Nam URENCO, which manages 16% with services areas in few small district towns.
Water supply in industrial and economic zones is provided by the infrastructure developers
while in rural areas it is mostly developed by Quang Nam PCERWASS then operated by local
communities. In the past years, hundreds of small water supply schemes in rural areas were
invested from the National Target Program for Rural Environment, Water Supply and
Sanitation (NTP), but many of them have stopped operation due to incomplete investment
and improper operation and maintenance. In the same time, the urban water supply systems
could not expand service to unserved rural areas though there was a surplus in their capacity
due to urban/rural classification. In urban areas, while the Quang Nam WSDC was benefited
by providing service in relatively better of areas of major cities and towns, the Quang Nam
URENCO was struggling with providing service in poor small towns and thus could not improve
the service quality and coverage. There was also notable weakness in ensuring quality of the
clean water and level of the service due to limited financial and technical resources of Quang
Nam URENCO and communities.

Urban drainage networks are under-developed and poorly designed and maintained, leading
to frequent floods during the rainy season. While management of the drainage systems in
Tam Ky and Hoi An is assigned to the URENCOs, there is no arrangement for maintaining
drains in other towns. These constraints plus the impact of climate changes mean that
flooding in towns and cities is likely to become worse.

Wastewater management is also inadequate. Construction of the first wastewater treatment
plants in Tam Ky and Hoi An cities began only recently. Currently, only the core city areas
have sewerage and this consists of combined systems that carry both stormwater and
wastewater. Most wastewater is discharged to receiving water bodies untreated. Institutional
responsibility for the maintenance of sewers is poorly defined.

Impacts of climate change
A MONRE study in 2011 forecast a rise of sea level by 13cm, a rise of average annual
temperature by 0.64 - 0.83oC and a rise rainfall by 1.4% by year 2030. Changes in rainfall
pattern may exacerbate flooding problems in the rainy season, droughts in the dry season and
saline intrusion into river systems.

Components of the Master Plan
The planning horizon is up to 2030, i.e. 15 years, in accordance with existing policy and
regulatory provisions.

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

Water balance calculations for the Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system and water reservoirs
indicate that by year 2030, there would be deficits in water resources in amount of about 305
million cubic meter a year to cover both agricultural irrigation and water supply service. Thus
appropriate planning of water use and protecting the water resources became essential. In
addition, for water supply, there were also challenges in ensuring water quality and providing
an adequate level of service.

Water supply service zoning. Instead of dividing the water supply services on the basis of
urban/rural classifications or the economic development orientation only in the current
master plans, it is proposed to re-organize service provision on the basis of four zones which
take into account available water resources. Zone 1 includes Hoi An city, Dien Ban and Dai Loc
districts located next to Da Nang city, which are characterized by tourism and urban
development. Zone 2 includes Duy Xuyen, Que Son and Thang Binh district and is mostly rural
and agricultural. Zone 3 includes Tam Ky city, Nui Thanh and Phu Ninh districts and is
commercial and industrial in character. Zone 4 includes nine mountainous districts where the
main economic activities are forestry and agriculture.

There is limited ground water in Quang Nam but surface water is abundant. The main source
for Zone 1 will be Vu Gia River and its tributaries while for Zone 2 it will be the Thu Bon River.
For Zone 3, the main source will be Phu Ninh reservoir and Zone 4 will rely on small rivers and
streams.

Technical options. In Zones 1-3, the water treatment plants will be developed taking in
account sustainability of water sources and economic scale. Starting from year 2020, the
current small scale water treatment plants serving isolated small areas will be gradually
converting to booster pumping stations and the large water treatment plants with adequate
water sources will be expanded to become main sources of supplying treated water. The
transmission and distribution network, which will serve both urban and rural populations, will
be developed in three phases. In the first phase up to year 2020, the network will be solely
associated with the designated water treatment plant with focusing on increase of coverage.
In the second phase during year 2020-2025, the network will be extended to connect water
treatment plants in each zone to form multi source water supply system to improve security
of the service. In the third phase after year 2025, the networks of different zones will
eventually be connected to form a single network which will allow further improving security
of the service and more optimizing operation of the system. Isolated and mountainous rural
residential areas will, as now, be served by small schemes, most of them with no treatment
plant and distribution network (decentralized supply).

Storm water drainage. Development of the drainage network will be based on an integrated
urban drainage concept. This involves intercepting extreme storm water using retention lakes
or reservoirs and forests; land reclamation; construction of drains to divert water to rivers and
the sea; and non-construction measures such as developing flood early warning systems,
increasing water absorbing capacity of soil and ground greening for reducing runoff. Since the
receiving bodies for storm water are rivers of the Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system, which is also
the main water supply source, the discharge of storm water must be strictly controlled. It will
therefore be important gradually to switch from combined to separate storm water and
sewerage systems.

Summary report

Wastewater management. Wastewater generated in industrial zones will be collected and
treated by the site developers. For domestic wastewater management, the same zoning
system will be used as for water supply. Wastewater management involves the collection,
treatment discharge of wastewater plus the removal and treatment of sludge from septic
tanks.

For treatment, a combination of centralized and decentralized treatment facilities is proposed
for larger and smaller urban centres respectively. Septic tank sludge will be managed either
by collection and safe disposal at solid waste dumping sites or treatment at centralized
wastewater treatment plants.

Institutional arrangements
Quang Nam PPC currently has overall responsibility both for the delivery of water supply and
sanitation services and for regulation. In addition to the PPC-owned utilities, there are also
some private service providers which deliver water supply service in industrial and rural areas.
In the Master Plan, it is suggested that the PPC should step back from service provision and
focus more on its regulatory role. The PPC is also advised to strengthen it regulatory function
by issuing some decisions and regulations to assign the service areas to different service
providers, to manage use and protection of water resources, to regulate regional and
interregional WSS services, to impose wastewater tariff and to improve accountabilities of
service providers by entering service agreement with them. The capacity of provincial
departments supporting PPC should also need to be strengthened though technical
assistances for effective coordination in implementation of the Master Plan, monitoring the
compliance of service quality, accountability of service providers.

In addition, the existing utilities should be reformed to support an increase in service coverage
and quality. Since Quang Nam Water Supply and Drainage Joint Stock Company (WSDC) is
already delivering the services in major urban areas, it is sensible to assign the responsibility
of delivering all networked water supply services, and for wastewater management, to this
utility. Private sector participation should be encouraged for the delivery of water supply
services in isolated areas such as industrial zones; the production of treated water; and
wastewater treatment.

Drainage systems should, as now, be managed by local URENCOs.

To ensure that public and private service providers perform to a satisfactory standard, they
should be subject to formal service contracts with the PPC.

Financing investments and service delivery
The total finance required for the period 2016 to 2030 is estimated at VND 13,366 billion (US$
607 million) based on 2015 prices, of which VND 9,533 billion (US$ 433 million) is for water
supply, VND 3,755 billion (US$ 171 million) for drainage and wastewater and VND 78 billion
(US$ 3 million) for technical assistance and capacity building. The required finance could
come from ODA; the state budget including transfers from central government; provincial
infrastructure bonds or loans; and private sector investment. Experience shows that public
finance could only cover at most 20% of the required funding, hence private sector
particpation may be the only way forward. For mobilizing private finance, the province should
develop a clear and attractive mechanism and regulations that could bring private sector to
income generating services such as water supply and wastewater collection and treatment. To

Summary report

ensure service sustainability, the province should also adopt a roadmap for tariff increases
which will enable recovery not only of operation and maintenance costs osts but also
investment costs. Any subsidy that will need to be provided to assist the poor in accessing the
services should be explicitly stated in the tariff structure.

A cost benenit analysis was conducted to assess the economic impacts of the investments
proposed in the Master Plan. Potential economic benefits included reduction of losses that
relates to floods, unadequate water supply and poor wastewater services and income
increase of the province’s state budget due to development of trade, industry and tourism.
The calculation showed that Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) would be 15.50% for
period of 2016-2020, 14.97% for period of 2020-2025 and 14.54% for period of 2025-2030;
the benefit/cost ratio would be 1.59, 1.52 and 1.47 for the same periods respectivelly.

Replicability and policy advice
The planning process identified a strong case for amending the existing Decrees on Production
and Supply Water in Urban and Industrial Areas; Management of Drainage Service in Urban
and Industrial Areas; and Implementation of Law of Planning so as to avoid the adoption of
separate water supply and drainage plans. MOC should also issue a circular guiding the
provinces in developing a comprehensive provincial water supply and sanitation master plan
covering water supply and sanitation in both urban and rural areas.

Summary report


Chapter 1: Overview
    1.1 Quang Nam province at glance

Quang Nam province is located on the central coast of Vietnam. It has two cities: Tam Ky and
Hoi An and 16 rural districts, with a total urban population of around 280,000 (2013). It is
bordered by Da Nang city to the north, Quang Ngai province to the south and Kon Tum
province to the west.

The population of the province is 1.435 million, of which 22% was classified as poor in 2013,
based on government criteria. It is one of a number of provinces that require annual budget
support from central government; this amounted to about 30% of total provincial expenditure
in 2014. In the last few years there has been some progress in in socio-economic
development with rapid urbanization in the northern part (Dien Nam – Dien Ngoc urban area)
and industrialization in the south (Chu Lai economic zone). It is expected that by 2017 the
province will balance its revenue and expenditure and may contribute to the central
government budget from 2018.

The province has very diverse terrain with high mountains in the west and low-lying coastal
plains in the east, while it is hilly in the middle. The Vu Gia-Thu Bon River system, the biggest
in the central region, covers almost all of the province as well as Da Nang city and part of Kon
Tum province.




Figure 1.1. Map of Quang Nam province and its administrative subsidiaries

Quang Nam is in the tropical region where the climates of the north and south overlap, and
experiences two discrete seasons: rainy from August to December and dry from January to
July. Rainfall is highest from October to December, ranging from 356 to 1,075 mm. The lowest
rainfall is in February, when it ranges from 0 to 5.2mm.

Summary report




    1.2 Status of water supply and sanitation services

            1.2.1 Water supply
Water supply services are organized into three components: urban, rural and
industrial/economic zones. Urban water supply is mostly piped with house connections while
rural services are mostly small non-piped schemes provided via commune administrations.
Water for industrial and economic zones is provided as part of general infrastructure
development. The Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system is the main water supply source, and ground
water supplies are limited. In recent years, however, with increasing development of
hydropower plants upstream, river flow has reduced and the water level has gone down,
which may in time affect drinking water supply. Another source for water supply is reservoirs
that were originally built for irrigation purposes.

Institutionally, urban water supply is provided by two utilities: Quang Nam Water Supply and
Drainage Joint Stock Company (Quang Nam WSDC), which operates nine systems in major
cities and towns, and Quang Nam Urban Environment Joint Stock Company (Quang Nam
URENCO), which has six in small towns. Rural water supply investments are mostly made
under National Target Program for Rural Environment, Water Supply and Sanitation (NTP)
implemented by Quang Nam PCERWASS; the schemes are then operated by local
communities. Since Quang Nam WSDC is assigned for service provision in large cities and
towns, where the consumption is relatively high and there is a large number of commercial
customers, it can easily applies progressing block tariff system to generate profits from the
service. However, it is not the case with URENCO as it provides service in small towns with low
consumption and almost poor domestic customers. Currently URENCO cannot make any profit
from providing the service and so it cannot expand the coverage nor increase quality of the
service. The similar situation is happening with rural water supply schemes where the local
communities cannot properly maintain the service due to their inadequate capacity both
technically and financially. Many rural water supply schemes stope operation shortly after
construction. In the last few years, Quang Nam PPC already asked Quang Nam WSDC to take
over operation of some rural water supply schemes.

Operational water treatment plants in the province are listed in Annex 1; their locations are
presented in Figure 1.2 below

Summary report




Figure 1.2: Location of existing water treatment plants

            1.2.2 Drainage
Urban drainage systems are under-developed, and low drainage combined with heavy
seasonal rains cause periodic flooding. Flood damage accounted for 18-20% of the provincial
GDP in 2008 (DPI). While drainage systems are mostly associated with the urban road
network, they are normally managed by the respective city/town URENCO in cities and large
towns. URENCOs are insufficiently resourced both institutionally and financially, and this
contributes to poor maintenance of the infrastructure. In small towns, if there is any drainage,
it is under maintenance from town’s PCs. Each town’s PC has a department similarly with
URENCO, but in smaller size, that is responsible for different urban infrastructure within the
town. Due to limitation of human resources, technical and financial capacity, maintenance of
drainage system in these small towns are normally neglected. In rural areas, formal drainages
do not exist, thus there is no formal institutional arrangement for service.

            1.2.3 Wastewater management
While the wastewater generated in industrial and economic zones is normally collected and
treated by the site developers, for other urban areas the provincial government has only
recently made investments in wastewater management, including the construction of
wastewater treatment plants serving Tam Ky and Hoi An. The Tam Ky wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP) has a design capacity of 8,000m3/day and is expected to be operational by the
end of 2016, when it will serve roughly 60% of the city population. The Hoi An WWTP has a
design capacity of 6,750m3/day and will be in operation in 2017, serving about 50% of the city
population. Drainage networks in these cities have had combined sewerage overflow (CSO)
chambers and interceptors added at the point of discharging stormwater to the environment,
to divert wastewater to the treatment plants.

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

The combined stormwater and wastewater systems used in these cities can give rise to bad
odor and on occasion wastewater overflows into the streets. A further concern is that,
because nearly all residential properties have septic tanks (or something similar), the bulk of
the solids generated remain at household level and need to be removed periodically – yet no
public de-sludging service is available and unofficial services are unregulated. The presence of
septic tanks also means that, unless households make new direct connections from toilets to
sewers, any new WWTPs will be under-utilized and unable to operate efficiently because the
wastewater reaching them is very dilute.

Institutional arrangements for wastewater management are fragmented and not fully
effective. In particular, while Quang Nam URENCO is responsible for management of the
drainage network in Tam Ky city, this includes WWTP; in Hoi An city the Quang Nam WSDC is
only responsible for WWTP and Hoi An URENCO remains be responsible for the drainage
network. Separating utilities responsible for WWTPs from utilities responsible for the
networks creates poor coordination in delivering the service and discourages increasing house
connections to the sewers. There is no formal setup for fecal sludge management in the
province, though some private vendors are providing desludging service to households based
on request. The province has no information about these private vendors and thus there is no
control on the service provided.

    1.3 Impacts of climate change

Being located in the coastal area of central Vietnam, Quang Nam is particularly vulnerable to
the effects of climate change. A study by MONRE forecast an increase in average annual
temperature of 0.64 - 0.83oC from 2010 to 2030. Annual rainfall would also increase by 1.4%
over the same period and the sea level would rise by 13cm. These impacts could change
water use patterns and hydrological conditions and increase the frequency and magnitude of
floods and salinity intrusion; see Figures 1.3 and 1.4 below. It would expect that more severe
floods might occur in Hoi An and Tam Ky cities, Dien Ban, Dai Loc and Nui Thanh districts. It
would be also more salinity intrusion occurred at downstream of Vu Gia - Thu Bon Rivers
which will affect the water sources for water supply systems in Dien Ban, Dai Loc, Hoi An, Dien
Nam and Thang Binh districts.

Summary report

     1.4 Existing WSS master plans and investment programs

In recent years, Quang Nam provincial government has come to recognize the importance of
long term planning for the development of water supply and sanitation services and the PPC
has approved several master plans including the following:

1.   Provincial Construction Master Plan for the period up to year 2030
2.   Construction Master Plan for Eastern Region for the period up to year 2020
3.   Construction Master Plan for Western Region for the period up to year 2020
4.   Master Plan for Urban Water Supply for the period up to year 2020
5.   Master Plan for Rural Water Supply for the period up to year 2020.

These plans, at one side can only provide guidance to service development for relatively short
period which is not in compliance with the long term orientation of province’s development,
and at another side only provide direction on technical issues and crucially do not deal with
the institutional, financial and operational aspects of service provision. The main water and
sanitation-related content of the plans is summarized in Annexes 2-4.

The province is now implementing several investment programs under these plans; see Annex
5.


Chapter 2: Key Provisions
     2.1 Planning concept

The planning tasks that formulates the planning objectives, scopes, approach and
methodology were approved by Quang Nam PPC by its decision No. 97/QD-UBND dated
January 12, 2016 and included the following components:

Objectives
1. To improve the effectiveness and sustainability of WSS investments in Quang Nam
province.

2. To gain experience that could be applied in other provinces via guidance developed by MOC
as requested by the new Construction Law.

Scope
Water supply, drainage and wastewater management for the entire province including urban
and rural areas plus industrial and economic zones.

Planning horizon
2016 to 2030

Approach
This plan is consistent with the Socio-economic Development Master Plan and Provincial
Construction Master Plan. It will encourage and enable sustainable service provision taking
into account the impacts of climate change, based on the effective use of water resources and
efficient investments across urban and rural areas and administrative boundaries.




Page | 15
Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

The plan will also provide direction and guidance for strengthening institutional and financial
arrangements for investment and service delivery.

A number of master plans have already been adopted for the period up to 2020, thus for the
period up to year 2020 the new master plan will simply resolve inconsistencies in them
without making any major changes. It will instead focus on the development of services for
the period beyond 2020 and up to 2030.

Methodology for development of the Master Plan
A study for development of the Master Plan took was undertaken from April 2015-March
2016. It involved a review of documentation; supplementary technical and socio-economic
surveys during April – June 2015; extensive consultation with stakeholders at provincial and
central levels; and the generation of options during July – December 2015. A formal
consultative workshop on the draft of the Master Plan was held in late February 2016 with
representatives from cities/ districts, provincial departments /agencies and ministries.
Comments received from the workshop were incorporated in the final draft of the Master
Plan. The developing of this Master Plan is characterized as a participatory process where
different views and opinions of different stakeholders from central, provincial and district
levels were collected, reviewed and reflected. In addition, technical options were considered
and evaluated not only from technical perspectives, but they were also examined from
institutional and financial perspectives to ensure the selected would be the most optimized
and feasible.

While this Master Plan was a pilot of a new concept of planning for which there was no
existing regulation and guidance from the central ministries, the proposed innovations were
introduced at a level and in a form that would not cause serious concerns of province in
compliance with the existing regulation and guidance during its review and approval.
However, lessons learnt from this pilot will need to be taken and furtherly reviewed by MOC
in revising existing or developing of new regulation and guidance on WSS master planning.

    2.2 Water Supply

            2.2.1       Water resources
Water balance calculations (see Annex 6) indicate that by 2030, the agricultural demand for
water would be some 756,093 million cubic meters per year (99.97% of total demand) while
the industrial and domestic demand would be roughly 221 million cubic meter per year (just
0.03% of the total). This would result in a supply deficit in the region of 305 million cubic
meter, and shortages would be most acute from April to July (the dry season). Proposed
remedial measures include ensuring the proper functioning of upstream hydropower plants in
compliance with the approved river operational procedures that maintains the required
minimum flows; reducing irrigation consumption, for example through changes in agricultural
practices; and reducing industrial and domestic consumption. When shortages occur, priority
should be given to domestic water supply.

            2.2.2 Zoning of water supply services
The Urban Water Supply Master Plan for the period up to year 2020 established three water
supply zones: southern (zone 1), central (zone 2) and the remainder (zone 3). The Provincial
Construction Master Plan for the period up to 2030 also established three zones but on a


Page | 16
Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

different basis: the northern corridor, central corridor and southern corridor. While the Urban
Water Supply Master Plan focused on providing services within administrative boundaries of
urban setups (cities, towns and small towns) without looking in to availability of water
resources or economy of scales that leaded to scattering the investments, the Provincial
Construction Master Plan just focused on dividing the service to the nearby river as assigned
water sources without taking in account the differences in socio-economic development as
well as topographical conditions, especial ally for the southern corridor, for western part of its
there no water source at all. So these zonings were defined primarily on the basis of projected
socio-economic status rather than availability of water resources and efficiency of water
supply systems. The inconsistency in zoning the service led to a multiplicity of orientations
and guidance being issued for service development in some locations while others were
totally neglected. The tendency of using nearest water sources for water supply without
taking in account their stability and sustainability led to situation in which several water
supply systems were not functional as designed due to lacks of water sources.

Taking in account all the related factors including geological and hydrological conditions, plus
orientations for development presented in urban and socio-economic development master
plans, it is now proposed that provincial water supply services be divided into four zones:
three along the eastern coast and one for the western mountainous part of the province. The
proposed zoning could be at one side adequately responding to the planned socio-economic
development and urbanization, and at other side ensuring appropriateness of using water
resources. This proposed zoning the service appears most appropriate – at least for the time
of this Master Plan in effect. i.e. until year 2030 and it might need to be revisited for next
circle of master planning. The proposed zones would be:

Zone 1 (northern) covering Hoi An city, Dien Ban and Dai Loc districts where tourism and
urban development are planned. The proposed water sources are middle sections of Vu Gia
river.

Zone 2 (central) covering Duy Xuyen, Que Son and Thang Binh districts where land is reserved
for urban development. The proposed water sources are middle section of Thu Bon River.

Zone 3 (southern) covering Tam Ky city, Nui Thanh and Phu Ninh districts where industrial
development is planned. The proposed water sources are Phu Ninh reservoir.

Zone 4 covering all remaining districts including North Tra My, Tien Phuoc, South Tra My,
Phuoc Son, Hiep Duc, Nong Son, Nam Giang, Dong Giang and Tay Giang districts. These
locations are reserved for agriculture and forestry. The proposed water sources are upstream
of Vu Gia and Thu Bon rivers and their tributaries.

A comparison of existing and proposed zoning systems is presented in figure 2.1

The proposed zoning of the service can – at one side – focus on availability of the water
resources with river basin perspective, and – at another side – accommodate the different
patterns of socio-economic development in different regions of the province without rigid
separation                     urban/                      rural                   setups.

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

            2.2.3 Water demand
Based on government norms, it is projected that consumption of domestic water by 2030 will
range from 60 liter/capita/day in rural areas to 120 liter/capita/day for the cities of Tam Ky
and Hoi An. However, taking into consideration the availability of alternative water sources in
rural areas and reduced urban consumption resulting from water scarcity, plans should
assume that consumption is 10 liter/capita/day lower for urban users and 20 liter/capita/day
lower for rural users.

While the total provincial population is not expected to grow very much in the next ten to
fifteen years, rapid urbanization and industrialization will shift the balance between urban and
rural residents dramatically. Currently some 24% of the 1.435 million population is urban, but
this is set to reach 45% by 2013 and 57% by 2030.

Industrial demand for water supply is estimated to be roughly 30m3/day per hectare.

In addition to the above, the calculation of water demand takes in account losses and rush
hour coefficients based on design standards.

Taking all of these factors into account, Annex 7 sets out the projected water demand over
the period up to 2030. From this calculation, the water demand appeared to be dramatically
increased during the period 2016-2020 as results from increase of service coverage as well as
rapid urbanization and industrialization in the province. Increase in domestic water demand is
to cover the remained 30% of current urban population and about a half of million currently
rural population, but will be urban population by year 2030, that doesn’t have access to piped
water supply service.

            2.2.4 Treatment technologies
Surface water taken directly from Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system typically has high turbidity
during the rainy season and is subject to fecal contamination, hence standard treatment
technology based on pre-sedimentation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection appears
appropriate. Surface water taken from reservoirs has lower turbidity, hence pre-
sedimentation may not be necessary. Proposed treatment technologies are summarized in
Figures 2.2 and 2.3.

Figure 2.3: Treatment technology for surface water from reservoirs

            2.2.5 Configuration of water supply systems
For the period up to 2020, the priority will be to improve service provision in underserved
urban areas through a combination of new investments and the augmentation of existing
schemes. In this period, the independent water supply systems that includes treatment plants
and their associated network will serve independent service areas designated to each system,
but without distinct separation between urban and rural areas. The water supply for
industrial zones will remain independent from domestic supply and a majority of rural
population will still use decentralized water supply service, meaning non-piped water supply.

From 2020 to 2025, however, distribution networks will be extended beyond their assigned
service areas and interconnected with others. The small scale water treatment plants in each
zone will be gradually operation at reduced capacity and the larger water treatment plants
will step in as major water sources of the service. Using of more than one water treatment
plant in a water supply system in large scale will increase the reliability and quality of the
service as well as efficiency of operation. In rural areas, using of decentralized water supply
service will be gradually reduced with more peoples using piped water supply service.

From 2025 to 2030, the distribution network will be expanded over the assigned zone and
interconnected with the network in other zones. There will be only large water treatment
plants with sustainable and reliable water sources remaining operational while small scale
water treatment plants will be phased out and used as booster pumping stations. Using of the
network with multiple water treatment plants of large scale will improve the level of the
service, efficiency of operation at economic scale.

Proposed treatment plants and distribution networks for each period are presented in
Annexes 8, 9 and 10.

    2.3 Storm water drainage

For the western mountainous and hilly parts of the province, it appears that natural drainage
in combination with roadside stormwater will be adequate for the planning horizon. The
investment priority will be to improve drainage in low-lying coastal areas prone to flooding.

The coastal part of the province comprises four drainage basins: Dien Ban, Hoi An, Tam Ky and
Nui Thanh-Chu Lai. The main drainage axes for Dien Ban and Hoi An are Vu Gia – Thu Bon
rivers while for Tam Ky and Nui Thanh-Chu Lai they are the Truong Giang-Tam Ky-Ban Thach
rivers. Proposed measures include protection low-lying land via partial land reclamation and
construction of dykes; rehabilitation and expansion of existing drainage networks; increasing

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

retention capacity within cities and towns via the construction of retention lakes and ponds;
and improved operation of upstream reservoirs so as to reduce river water during heavy
storms. In addition, a flood early warning system should be introduced

The main drainage directions are presented in Annex 11. Proposed land elevations for urban
flood protection are listed in Annex 12.

The quality of stormwater discharged to the rivers will need to be monitored closely to avoid
pollution and contamination. In addition the drainage system will gradually be reconfigured so
as to keep storm water and wastewater separate.

    2.4 Wastewater management

            2.4.1 Zoning and wastewater generation
The same four zones are proposed for wastewater as for water supply. Estimated wastewater
generation is presented in Annexes 13 - 15.

            2.4.2 Wastewater collection and treatment
Wastewater generated in industrial zones will be collected and treated by the producers prior
to discharge, as per current regulations. Technology selection and capacity will be tailored to
the needs of specific sites. To ensure the quality of the treated wastewater discharged, a
monitoring system should be established.

The proposed capacity and locations of industrial wastewater treatment plants are presented
in Figure 2.4




Figure 2.4: Industrial wastewater treatment plans

Page | 21
Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

Up to 2020, sewerage networks in the major urban centres will be expanded and improved
through enhancements to existing combined systems.              Amongst other things, the
improvements will include the construction of additional combined sewerage overflow (CSO)
chambers and interceptors to avoid the need for large scale excavation in densely populated
areas for construction of new separated sewers. From 2020, however, the focus will be on
developing separate systems and these will become dominant by 2025. Separate systems will
also be provided for smaller towns and new urban areas. The precondition for using
combined systems is that households must construct a preliminary treatment facility -
normally a septic tank - in their house to pretreat wastewater before it discharges into drains.
Septic tanks will become unnecessary once separate systems are in place.

Wastewater treatment facilities will be a combination of centralized treatment plants for large
urban centres and decentralized facilities for small towns and rural residential areas, and in
the case of using combined system, also onsite household septic tanks. Up to 2025, the
technology needed will be relatively simple as the wastewater discharged from septic tanks is
dilute and has a relatively weak biological load. Beyond 2025, when separate systems are in
place, the wastewater will be more concentrated (so long as households bypass their septic
tanks and make direct connections to sewers) and comprehensive treatment will be required.

Details of proposed treatment facilities presented in Annex 16 and locations are indicated in
Figure 2.5.




Figure 2.5: Locations of proposed wastewater treatment plants




Page | 22
Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

For agricultural wastewater, small-scale facilities employing simple anaerobic treatment
(baffled anaerobic tanks followed by biological filters or wetland) will be sufficient. Facilities
will be constructed where the greatest volume of wastewater is generated.

            2.4.3 Sludge collection and treatment
At present there is no official de-sludging service for septic tanks and the few existing
wastewater treatment plants do not have sludge treatment facilities. The management of
fecal sludge therefore faces two key challenges: firstly to introduce de-sludging and removal
services that householders will use, and secondly to provide adequate sludge treatment
facilities, in appropriate locations. Estimated sludge generation is presented in Annex 17.

Beyond 2020, the proposed new and improved wastewater treatment plans will have the
capacity to treat septic sludge, and the treated product could then be disposed of at landfills.
A list of proposed sites where treated sludge can be disposed of is provided in Annex 18.

With the anticipated phasing out of septic tanks from 2025 onwards, the volume of sludge
generated at household level will gradually reduce, though the volume generated from
wastewater treatment plants will increase significantly. However, to encourage households
in stopping use of onsite septic tanks and moving to direct connection to sewers, strong
political support and publicity; obligations and/or financial incentives; and maybe technical
support will need to be required.


Chapter 3. Institutional arrangements
     3.1 Sector management

The Quang Nam PPC has legal responsibility for the provision of water supply and sanitation
services in the province. Its mandate includes:

1.   Issuing necessary regulations and decisions.
2.   Assigning service areas to service providers.
3.   Approving operational and investment plans.
4.   Setting tariffs and (where necessary) subsidies.
5.   Coordinating the roles of provincial departments and local governments in implementing
     approved master plans.

Currently the Quang Nam PPC is owning fully or partly the service providing utilities. It causes
a situation of conflict of interests between regulatory functions and business orientation. Thus
it advises the PPC to step back from service provision and focus on regulatory function. To
strengthen regulatory functions, it is recommended that the PPC issues new regulations on
water resources management, regional water supply, drainage and wastewater management
(including regulations for household septic tanks, house connections and sludge management)
and wastewater service tariffs. In addition, the PPC should also need to enter into service
agreements with the designated service providers as regulated by the current Government’s
regulations. Once the service agreements will be signed, PPCs should enforce their
implementation.

Under the PPC, DOC is responsible for urban water supply, drainage and wastewater; DARD is
responsible for rural water supply and sanitation; DPI is responsible for planning financial

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

resources for investments; DOF is responsible for providing the financial resources for
investments and appraising the tariff; DONRE is responsible for water resources management
and discharge standards to environment; and DOH is responsible for water supply standards.
The new Master Plan will create some challenges to the current practices of these
departments. Such challengers include working in broader setups (urban/rural and
regional/interregional), integrated approach (water/drainage/wastewater) or new service
(wastewater service). While the essential mandates of these agencies will remain unchanged,
for effectively implementing the Master Plan, capacity of these departments will need to be
strengthened under proposed technical assistances, specifically in following aspects:

    (i)     compliance and consistency of investment plan with the approved Master Plan;
    (ii)    coordination of investment plans from different ministries, public and private
            sectors;
    (iii)   compliance of the service quality with the standards;
    (iv)    accountability of service providers with their customers; and
    (v)     effective implementation of regulations and decisions.

     3.2 Service delivery

To ensure the quality and sustainability of service provision, institutional arrangements for
service delivery need to be streamlined and a higher degree of professionalism developed
within the lead organizations. In particular, while water production could be effectively
handled by multiple government and/or private sector organizations, management of the
distribution network should be assigned to a single agency to enable economies of scale and
facilitate cross-subsidies between parts of the service which generate more or less revenue.
Since the bulk of water supply services are already provided by Quang Nam WSDC, it is
proposed to make this entity fully and solely responsible for the provision of piped water
supply services in the province. Quang Nam WSDC can take over the systems in small towns
that are currently operated by Quang Nam URENCO and small rural water supply schemes
through the transferring the state capital invested by Quang Nam PPC in those systems to
Quang Nam WSDC as an increase of PPC’s share in the chatter capital of Quang Nam WSDC.

The management and operation of wastewater services, once separate systems are in place,
will also require a high degree of professionalism. Given that water supply and wastewater
management are closely related in terms of technical demands, the customer base and
revenue generation via water bills, it is proposed that this, too, be assigned to the Quang Nam
WSDC. The rural sanitation will remain with DARD. The current capacity of WSDC in terms of
technical, human and financial will need to be strengthened to be adequately responding to
the new assigned responsibilities.

Drainage is closely associated with management of the road network, hence this service
should be managed by local government through URENCOs. So long as combined stormwater
/ wastewater systems are in use, the URENCOs should be responsible managing the drainage
network, with Quang Nam WSDC responsible for interceptors, wastewater treatment plants,
and sludge collection and treatment. The capacity of Quang Nam URENCO will need to be
improved as currently the company is lacking experienced staff and adequate equipment.

Private sector participation in the delivery of water supply and sanitation services is set to
increase. To ensure stability of the service, it will be more appropriate to give private

Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

contractors responsibility for service delivery in relatively isolated areas (such as industrial
zones) or to focus on water production and wastewater treatment. To incentivize
participation of private sector, Quang Nam PPC is advised to issue a clear and transparent
policy on supports provided such as site clearance, reducing taxes etc. applied in these
investments.

Chapter 4. Strategic environmental assessment
     4.1 Impact assessment

In Tables 4.1 and 4.2, potential environmental impacts are assessed against two scenarios:
water and sanitation services with and without the proposed master plan.

Table 4.1: Environmental impacts without master plan

No    Impacts to            Type of impacts
1     Land                  Land acquisition for construction of new facilities for WSS services
                            including WTP, WWTPs, pumping stations, pipeline and sewers
                            would cause negative consequences such as losing tenure of land,
                            productivity and interrupting business.
2     Water                 Growth in water demand will exceed supply. Water shortages might
                            cause instability in the social life and stagnation of economic growth.
                            Flooding would happen more frequently due to urban development
                            and especially under the impacts of climate change.
                            The discharge of untreated wastewater directly to the environment
                            would cause water pollution (basin of rivers such as Vu Gia - Thu
                            Bon, Truong Giang - Tam Ky and other rivers in the area).
                            Climate change would also exacerbate saline intrusion which would
                            affect water sources, especially the downstream sections of Vu Gia –
                            Thu Bon river system. Increased rainfall and changes in the rainfall
                            pattern might create more floods and inundation in the coastal
                            regions. In addition, prolonged droughts in the dry season could
                            cause more water shortage in dry season.
3     Ecosystem             Discharge of untreated wastewater to the river systems would cause
                            water pollution, which would affect the flora and fauna in the rivers
                            and water bodies.
                            Implementation of a number of existing plans and investment
                            projects without due attention to water resource management could
                            have negative impacts on the ecosystem in project areas.
                            Indiscriminate exploitation of water resources could seriously affect
                            their sustainability.
4     Public health         The use of untreated water could spread disease. Uncontrolled
                            dumping of septic sludge to environment would cause transmission
                            of pollutants and diseases across the areas.
5     Air                   Transportation of untreated wastewater in open drains would cause
                            unpleasant odors due to stagnation of wastewater while periodic
                            inundation would cause pathogenic wastewater to spill over into the

    4.2 Mitigation measures

To address the negative impacts identified above, a number of measures are proposed. These
will be embedded in the process of investment planning, preparation and implementation.

On the planning and preparation of investments, the following are proposed:

1. Impacts of climate change will be properly taken in account in detailed planning works.
2. All wastewater discharged from industrial / economic zones and industrial clusters will be
   treated to meet relevant standards.
3. Integrated water resources management will be implemented to address increased
   competition for water use between different sectors.
4. Regulations will be introduced for the protection of water resources, control and
   monitoring of wastewater discharges, and the management of septage and wastewater
   generally.
5. Application of advanced technology that will help to reduce greenhouse effects, while
   minimizing land acquisition.

On the implementation of new investments:

6. Existing Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOPs) will be used to address any negative
   impacts from the construction and operation of water and sanitation infrastructure. The
   relevant ECOPS cover controls on the generation of dust, noise, vibration, wastewater,
   chemicals, excavated soil and construction materials.
7. Reduce the disruption of vegetative cover and ecological resources.
8. Improve road safety and safety at work.
9. Encourage community participation in the monitoring of environmental and social
   compliance.

Summary report


Chapter 5. Financing and Cost Benefit Analysis
     5.1 Investment cost

The projected investment cost of the master plan is VND 13,366 billion (US$ 607 million)
based on 2015 prices. Of this, VND 9,533 billion (US$ 433 million) is for water supply, VND
3,755 billion (US$ 171 million) is for drainage and wastewater management and VND 78 billion
(US$ 3 million) is for technical assistance and capacity building. Further details are provided in
Annexes 17-19

     5.2 Financing models

The investment cost of implementing the master plan is huge and far exceeds the capacity of
the provincial budget. Instead, financing could come from ODA (multilateral and bilateral
development partners), transfers from central government, provincial infrastructure bonds or
loans, and/or the private sector.

In recent years, public financing (including ODA) was able to contribute at most 20% of the
required funds. ODA and state funding will therefore be used primarily for investments in
public infrastructure that does not generate revenue, such as water storage capacity and
drainage; provincial bonds or loans will be used for the development of services that do
generate income (water supply); and the private sector will be encouraged to finance the
investment of major income generating infrastructure such as wastewater treatment plants
and to participate in the provision and maintenance of water supply and wastewater
collection and treatment services, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of service
provison. The province will need to set out clear roadmaps for increasing tariffs to ensure
that revenue generated recovers full operational costs and a part of financial costs. While the
WSS services are considred as public services and access to them may be a dificulty for some
groups of population with low income, the PPC is advised to develope a transparent
mechanism to provide targeted subsidies that could help service providers in overcoming the
financial dificulties of provisioning the services to those groups of population. Those subsidies
could be in the form of direct payment of difefrence between service costs and service tariff
or grants to utilities for new investments. The support from PPC may also in the form of
providing guaranttee for utilities in accessing the commercial loan or exempting taxes.

     5.3 Cost benefit analysis

A rought cost benefit analysis (CBA) shows that the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)
would be 15.50% for period of 2016-2020, 14.97% for period of 2020-2025 and 14.54% for
period of 2025-2030; the benefit/cost ratio would be 1.59, 1.52 and 1.47 for the same periods
respectivelly.

For the purpose of conducting CBA, the following factors were considered:

    (i)     Reduced floods:




Page | 29
Quang Nam Provincial WSS Master Plan
Summary report

   -     The level of reduced losses due to reduced floods is VND 10.791m (US$ 607) annualy
         per households (source: Vietnam Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Project -
         2013).
   - The number of households benefited from reduced floods resulted from investments
         proposed in the Master Plan is 31,990 for the period up to year 2020; 31,990 for the
         period up to year 2025 and 45,727 for the period up to year 2030.
   (ii)      Improved sanitation
   - The level of reduced losses due to improved wastewater service is VND 116,674 (US$
         5.33) annualy per capita. From which VND 74,645 (US$ 3.41) comes from reduced
         poluttion to water sources, VND 30,865 (US$ 1.41) comes from reduced air and soil
         polution and VMD 11,164 (US$ 0.51) comes from reduced expenses relating to living
         opportunities (Economic Sanitation Initiative - WSP’s study, 2012).
   - The number of population benefited from improved wastewater service resulted from
         investments proposed in the Master Plan is 703,800 for the period up to year 2020;
         703,800 for the period up to year 2025 and 1,006,000 for the period up to year 2030.
   (iii)     Health care related expenses
   - Teh level of reduced losses due to better health conditions resulted from investments
         proposed in the Master Plan is VND 68,297 (US$ 3.12) annualy per capita (Economic
         Sanitation Initiative - WSP’s study, 2012)
   - The number of population benefited from better WSS services is 407,010 for the
         period up to year 2020; 487,740 for the period up to year 2025 and 1,055,240 for the
         period up to year 2030.
   (iv)      The contribution of improved WSS services in to increase of provincial gross
             domestic products (GDP) accounts for one percent from the everage increase as
             of 11 percents annually for the period 2013-2015.

Chapter 7. Recommendations and policy advice

To implement this Master Plan successfully, following actions are recommended:

To Quang Nam PPC:

   -   Approval of the Master Plan before June 2016
   -   Enter to service agreements with WSS service providers by end of 2016
   -   Issuance of a regulation on drainage and sewerage management that includes fecal
       sludge management in 2017
   -   Issuance of provincial policy of providing subsidies to WSS service in 2018

To MOC:

An important lesson from the development of this plan is that the current government
requirement to formulate separate plans for water supply and for drainage is not appropriate.
The existing Decree on Production and Distribution of Clean Water in Urban and Industrial Areas
(Decree 117/2007/ND-CP and Decree 124/2012/ND-CP) and Decree on Management of Drainage
in Urban and Industrial Areas (Decree 80/2015/ND-CP), both made under the Construction Law,
should therefore be revised. MOC is also advised to amend the existing ministerial circular on
implementation of the Construction Law and provide detailed guidance to provinces on the
formulation of master plans similar to this one. To address the above, MOC through its
Administration of Technical Infrastructure (ATI) may need further support and assistance from
development partners that includes the World Bank.

Annex 6: Water sources and water balance
The main water sources for Quang Nam province are surface water of Vu Gia – Thu Bon river
system for the northern and central parts and from Phu Ninh reservoir for the southern part
of province. Ground water resources are fairly limited: approximately 430,000m3/day
according to a study by the General Department of Geology, Ministry of Industry and Trade
and of unreliable quality.

For planning purposes a water balance calculation was undertaken based on the flows in the
Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system and reservoir capacity and the various demands: including
hydropower generation, irrigation and aquaculture, industry and domestic water supply. The
calculation started from the operating procedures for reservoirs for hydropower generation
on Vu Gia – Thu Bon river systems that were approved by Prime Minister in May 2015. The
flow conditions at downstream main check points of Vu Gia – Thu Bon river system under the
approve procedures are presented in Table 6.1.

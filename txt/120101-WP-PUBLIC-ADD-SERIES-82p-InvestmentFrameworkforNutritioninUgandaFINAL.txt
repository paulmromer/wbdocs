Abstract: This paper builds on global experience and Uganda‚Äôs specific context to estimate costs,
benefits, and cost-effectiveness of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the
selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The
paper considers both relevant ‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions, largely delivered through the
health sector, and multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-sensitive‚Äù interventions, delivered through other sectors
such as agriculture, education, and water and sanitation. We estimate that the costs and benefits
of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all regions of Uganda would require a yearly
public investment of $68 million. The expected benefits are enormous: annually over 8,000 lives
would be saved, while at least 375,000 DALYs and 8,700 cases of stunting among children under
five would be averted. Economic productivity could potentially increase by $280 million annually
over the productive lives of the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 18
percent. However, because it is unlikely that the Government of Uganda or its partners will be
able to find the $68 million necessary to reach full coverage, we also consider scale-up scenarios
based on considerations of their potential for impact, burden of stunting, resource requirements,
and implementation capacity. The most cost-effective scenario considered would provide a subset
of key interventions in regions with the highest rates of stunting and would cost between $19 and
$60 million, depending on how many regions are covered. We then identify and cost five nutrition-
sensitive interventions relevant to Uganda for which there is both evidence of positive impact on
nutrition outcomes and some cost information. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-
specific interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly
cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition in Uganda.


Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, nutrition-sensitive interventions, cost-effectiveness of
nutrition interventions, Uganda, nutrition financing.

Aflatoxins are a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds, especially Aspergillus
flavus, which contaminate stored food supplies such as animal feed, maize, and peanuts.
Research shows that human consumption of high levels of aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis
(Kuniholm et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). It is widely understood
that there is a relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, but this relationship has
not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature (Abt Associates 2014; Unnevehr
and Grace 2013).

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the
benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed
in monetary terms. The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized
by implementing a project versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio,
the better the investment. A general rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its cost,
the project is a good investment.

Biocontrol (also called biological control) is the use of an invasive agent to reduce pest or mold
population below a desired level. Aflatoxins can be reduced through biocontrol; the most effective
method involves a single application of a product (such as aflasafe‚Ñ¢) that contains strains unique
to the specific country or location.

Biofortification is the breeding of crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done either
through conventional selective breeding or through genetic engineering.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country
human capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions
(World Bank 2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and
community volunteers to improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany
program implementation or, when possible, precede program implementation. In this costing
analysis we allocate 9 percent of total programmatic costs to capacity development for program
delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an
intervention against its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits
of an intervention and estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net
present value. Net benefits are the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of
the intervention. The net present value is defined mathematically as:
                                                                     Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á
                                                                                 Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
         Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±Å Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ù Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£ = ÔøΩ                  ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0
                                                                              (1 + Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
                                                                  Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=1

where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is net cash inflows, Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0 is the initial investment, the index Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is the time period, and Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü is the
discount rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that
the present value of cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost of
financing). Interventions with net present values that are at least as high as alternative
interventions provide greater benefits than interventions with net present values equal to or lower
than alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis can also be expressed in terms of the
benefit-cost ratio.

                                                                                                       viii
Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify
interventions that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis
requires two components: the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention‚Äôs
impact, such as the number of lives saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:

                                                                                                                Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ú Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions
with the same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the
most cost-effective intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due to
a health condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of life
lost from a disease (YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD). DALYs
count the gains from both mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature death are
prevented) and morbidity (how many years or parts of years of life lost due to disability are
prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a metric that is recognized and understood by
external audiences such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases relative to the overall burden
of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data, DALYs allow for
estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in different
countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash
flows. The concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is
worth more than the same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential.
A higher discount rate reflects higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in
capital. A higher discount rate may also reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows
equal to zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of
return equals or exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates
of return than alternatives tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes
into estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to
project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part
of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.

Monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for program
delivery are all elements of cost-effective and efficient program implementation. Monitoring
involves checking progress against plans through the systematic and routine collection of
information from projects and programs in order to learn from experience to improve practices
and activities in the future, to ensure internal and external accountability of the resources used
and the results obtained, and to make informed decisions on the future of the intervention.
Monitoring is a periodically recurring task. Evaluation is the assessing, as systematically and
objectively as possible, of a completed project or intervention (or a phase of an ongoing project).
Operations research aims to inform the program designers about ways to deliver interventions

                                                                                                                                         ix
more effectively and efficiently. Technical support entails ensuring that training, support, and
maintenance for the physical elements of the intervention are available. In this costing exercise
we allocate 2 percent of total intervention costs for monitoring and evaluation, operations
research, and technical support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect impact on nutrition and are
delivered through sectors other than health such as the agriculture, education, and water,
sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops, conditional cash
transfers, and water and sanitation infrastructure improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate determinants of child
nutrition, such as adequate food and nutrition intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and
treating disease. Examples include community nutrition programs, micronutrient
supplementation, and deworming.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables
change. It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of
the intervention, and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of the
variable on the outcome.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is an indicator of chronic
undernutrition and is the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is
measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child is
considered stunted with a height-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age. It is used as a composite
indicator to reflect both acute and chronic undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between
them. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a
child is considered underweight with a weight-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is an indicator of acute
undernutrition and the result of more recent food deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of
Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below). A child with a weight-for-height Z-
score of ‚àí2 or lower is considered wasted.


A Z-score or standard deviation score is a calculation used to explain deviations from an
established norm. It is calculated with the following formula:

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The overall objective of this report is to support the Government of Uganda in developing a costed
scale-up plan for nutrition. It builds on the recently developed the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan
(UNAP) by costing the interventions proposed therein. The goal is for this analysis to serve as an
input into the strategic multisectoral plan to fight malnutrition currently in development. The
executive summary is written for policy makers; it highlights the study‚Äôs main findings and
discusses their implications for nutrition policy in Uganda. The paper itself is more technical in
nature and is written for planners and programmers. The analysis is expected to bring evidence
of potential for impact and allocative efficiency into nutrition programming in Uganda.

One-third of Ugandan children under the age of five were chronically undernourished in 2011 as
measured by stunting. Although this represents steady improvement from 39 percent in 2000,
Uganda still compares unfavorably with neighbor and peer countries, suggesting that better
nutritional outcomes can be expected even without improving incomes. Micronutrient deficiencies
(hidden hunger) are also prevalent, with vitamin A deficiency and anemia rates particularly high
among young children and women.

Malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to increased mortality rates, increased
illness, and longer-term effects on cognitive abilities. These effects produce irreversible losses to
human capital that contribute to later losses in economic productivity. Undernutrition is
responsible for about 60 percent of under-five child mortality and at least one-fourth of maternal
mortality in Uganda (FANTA-2 2010). Children who have been malnourished early in life are more
likely to experience cognitive deficiencies and poor schooling outcomes. In the longer term,
stunting results in a loss of 10 to 17 percent in wages earned over a lifetime. In Uganda the
combined effects of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies were estimated to cost $899 million,
or about 5.6 percent of the country‚Äôs GDP, in 2009 (COHA 2012).

At the same time, high-impact nutrition interventions are consistently identified as being among
the most cost-effective development actions, with a huge potential to contribute to the World Bank
Group‚Äôs twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Cost-benefit analysis
shows that nutrition interventions are highly effective (Hoddinott et al. 2013; World Bank 2010). It
is estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs GDP by 3 to 11 percent annually
(Horton and Steckel 2013). Stunted children are less likely to attend school, more likely to drop
out, and less likely to be able to learn when in school, thereby compromising future human capital
and national productivity. On the other hand, investments in early nutrition lock in human capital
for life and help drive future productivity and growth. Evidence also shows that these early
investments in nutrition have the potential to boost wage rates by 5 to 50 percent, supercharge
the demographic, make children 33 percent more likely to escape poverty in the future, and
address gender inequities.

The costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest, especially when compared with the
potential benefits. At a global level, the cost of scaling up key nutrition interventions across 68
high-burden countries is estimated at $10.3 billion per annum (World Bank 2010). These
investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million children, save at least
1.1 million lives, avert 30 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and reduce the number of
stunted children by about 30 million worldwide (World Bank 2010).

This report builds on global estimates to identify costs and benefits of key nutrition programs in
Uganda and is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions and

                                                 xi
scenarios for scaling these up. The report uses the costing framework established by Scaling Up
Nutrition: What Will It Cost? (World Bank 2010) as a starting point, and applies this framework to
the country-specific context of Uganda. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of
lives saved, DALYs averted, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will
make the case for nutrition stronger and aid in priority-setting by identifying the most cost-effective
packages of interventions in situations where financial and human resources are constrained.

We first estimate the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all
regions of Uganda. 1 We refer to this as full coverage and estimate that it would require an annual
public investment of $68 million. The expected benefits are enormous: over 8,000 lives would be
saved annually, while at least 375,000 DALYs and 211,000 cases of stunting among children
under five would be averted. This investment of $68 million also has the potential to increase
economic productivity by $280 million annually over the productive lives of the beneficiaries and
to yield an impressive internal rate of return on the investment of 18 percent.

Given resource constraints, however, few countries are able to effectively scale-up all 10 nutrition-
specific interventions to full national coverage immediately. We therefore consider three potential
scale-up scenarios, based on considerations of burden of stunting, potential for impact, costs,
and capacity for implementation in Uganda:

      ‚Ä¢   Scenario 1: Scale up by region
      ‚Ä¢   Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
      ‚Ä¢   Scenario 3: Scale up by region and intervention

When considered in terms of resource requirements and cost-effectiveness (cost per benefit unit),
three scenarios stand out as equally cost-effective and the choice between them will depend on
the amount of resources available for nutrition interventions (see Box 1). The first would scale up
nationwide all interventions except the public provision of complementary food for the prevention
of moderate acute malnutrition; this scenario would require an annual public investment of $60
million. The second requires fewer resources ($45 million) and would provide the same set of
cost-effective interventions in the seven regions where stunting rates are higher than 30 percent.
The third would require even fewer resources ($19 million) and would target only the three regions
with stunting rates above 40 percent.




1   The 10 nutrition-specific interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A
       supplementation, therapeutic zinc supplement with oral rehydration solution, micronutrient powders,
       deworming, iron-folic acid supplementation for pregnant women, iron fortification of staples, salt
       iodization for the general population, public provision of complementary food for prevention of
       moderate acute malnutrition, and community-based management of severe acute malnutrition in
       children.

Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full
coverage in one year, we consider the
                                                Box 1: Three Cost-Effective Scale-Up

required over five years range from $54 to
                                                If full coverage is not immediately feasible,
$168 million. These total five-year costs

Although every attempt has been made to             ‚Ä¢ 2,700 lives saved
use real programming costs for these                ‚Ä¢ cost per life year saved = $182
estimates, the costs presented here are
likely to be slight overestimates, while the  *Life years adjusted for disability (DALYs)
benefits are likely to be underestimated.
In many cases, actual program costs will
be lower than estimated because these programs can be added to existing ones. Program
experience shows that the incremental costs of adding to an existing program are lower than the
cost of starting an entirely new program because existing implementation arrangements can be
used, thereby minimizing costs for staffing, operations, and training. The estimate of costs
presented here is therefore high because it does not account for expected economies of scale.
With respect to the benefits of these programs, estimates are likely to be underestimates of the
true benefits because the LiST tool we use has limitations, making it possible to estimate the full
benefits of only some of the interventions that are proposed to be scaled up.
This analysis takes an innovative approach to nutrition costing by not only estimating the costs
and benefits of nutrition-specific interventions, but also exploring costs for selected nutrition-

                                                 xiii
sensitive interventions implemented outside of the health sector. While recognizing that the
evidence base for the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions is less conclusive than the
evidence for nutrition-specific interventions, we consider four nutrition-sensitive interventions in
other sectors that have shown some potential for improving nutrition outcomes. These include the
biofortification of vitamin A‚Äìrich orange sweet potatoes and aflatoxin control in maize. Although
interventions to promote the cultivation of iron-rich beans are underway in Uganda and show
tremendous potential, we were not able to include this intervention in our analysis. In the
education sector, school-based deworming and school-based promotion of good hygiene are
considered. The estimated costs we report must be considered rough approximations because
there are significant limitations in the available data and in the methodological approaches. In
addition, we were not able to estimate the benefits of these interventions because of data and
methodological shortcomings, although we do report benefits calculated by others. Overall, more
robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions are needed to inform future scale-up priorities.

These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate list of
nutrition-sensitive approaches that, taken together, represent a highly cost-effective approach to
reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in Uganda. Some nutrition-specific and nutrition-
sensitive (e.g. Feed the Future) activities are currently being implemented in Uganda by the
Government, donors, and partners, yet they are not carried out at scale and not always in
alignment with the National Nutrition Action Plan. Many of these efforts are still at the pilot phase
and lack the coordination and funds needed for maximum scale-up to achieve optimal nutrition
outcomes. Critical next steps for the Government of Uganda and its partners are to develop a
road map of key actions to pursue, to identify milestones to be reached in addressing
undernutrition in the country, and to implement a business plan to mobilize funds to scale up the
high-impact intervention package identified in this report.

                                       COUNTRY CONTEXT

Uganda is a large, landlocked East African country with great economic and human potential,
although currently about one-quarter of Ugandans live in poverty. Its 36.4 million inhabitants are
distributed across a land area of 241,038 square kilometers. The southern part of the country
borders Lake Victoria and the climate is equatorial (see Appendix 1 for a map of Uganda and its
regions). Uganda gained its independence from Great Britain in 1962; since then it has suffered
a lengthy civil war that has caused tens of thousands of casualties and displaced more than a
million people. The Ugandan economy is dependent mainly on coffee, tea, and other agricultural
exports, although it also possesses large mineral deposits (copper and cobalt), crude oil, and
natural gas. Between 2003 and 2011 the economy grew at over 6 percent per year, although the
growth rate in 2012 was only 3.4 percent. The GDP per capita of $696 in 2014 (World Bank
2014b) does not reflect the poor living conditions for most. Uganda ranked 164th out of 187
countries on the Human Development Index in 2013 (UNDP 2015).


                        HEALTH AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN UGANDA

Overall, the health status of Ugandans has been improving in recent years, although the civil
conflict and other factors have slowed improvements. Life expectancy was 58 years in 2012, up
from 49 in 2001. Under-five mortality was 69 per 1,000 live births in 2012, down from 140 in 2001.
The infant mortality rate was 45 per 1,000 live births in 2012, having dropped from 85 in 2001
(World Bank 2014b). Figure 1 shows that child mortality declined by over 6 percent in Uganda
between 2005 and 2010, a rate that surpassed many of its neighbors.

Nevertheless, one-third of Ugandan children under the age of five were chronically
undernourished in 2011 as measured by stunting (Figure 2). 2 Although this is still a high rate of
stunting, it represents steady improvement from 39 percent in 2000. The share of children who
were underweight also declined from 23 percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2011. Wasting, which
represents acute or recent short-term malnutrition, remained virtually unchanged during the same
period. Although gains have been made, Uganda still compares unfavorably with neighbor and
peer countries, suggesting that better nutritional outcomes can be expected even without
improving incomes (Figure 3).

2   The analysis in this report was completed before the 2016 Uganda DHS was undertaken. As of the final
       revisions of this report, the preliminary results for the 2016 survey had become available (See
       http://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-PR80-Preliminary-Reports-Key-Indicators-
       Reports.cfm). These preliminary findings show that national rate of stunting in Uganda was 29 percent
       in 2016, for wasting was 4 percent and underweight was 11 percent. 53 percent of children under 5
       were anemic in 2016 and 32 percent of women aged 15-49 percent were anemic.

There is considerable geographic variation in the prevalence of stunting and poverty, although
the patterns are different (Figure 4). Malnutrition rates are highest in the Karamoja, Western, and
Southwest regions, which all have stunting rates over 40 percent. Poverty rates are also highest
in Karamoja, where over 75 percent of people live in poverty. But poverty rates are relatively lower
in in Western and Southwestern provinces. The West Nile and Central 2 regions have stunting
rates over 35 percent. But poverty rates are relatively lowere there. Conversely, poverty rates
are high (approximately 40 percent) in the North and West Nile regions, whereas stunting rates
are relatively lower there.

Although income and malnutrition are related in Uganda, other factors‚Äîsuch as feeding
practices‚Äîalso influence malnutrition. The prevalence of stunting in the poorest households is
three times the prevalence in the richest households (Figure 5). Stunting prevalence among
households in the poorest quintile is almost twice as high as that for households in richest quintile.
However, even among households in the richest quintile, 21 percent of children are stunted. This
highlights the fact that undernutrition is not limited to impoverished households, underscoring the
importance of effectively communicating the need for optimal child feeding and caregiving
practices.

Although not visible to the naked eye, vitamin and mineral deficiencies (hidden hunger) remain
pervasive in Uganda. About half of all children under five and about one-fifth of women of
childbearing age were anemic in 2011; this represents a significant improvement from 2006
(Figure 6). Twenty percent of preschool-aged children and 19 percent of pregnant women were
deficient in vitamin A in 2006 (DHS 2006). 3 Vitamin A deficiency is well documented as a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality among children: it increases the severity of infections; slows
recovery from illness; and, in extreme cases, causes blindness and death (Fawzi et al. 1993;
Sommers, Katz, and Tarwotjo 1984; Sommers and West 1996). Nationally almost all children (99
percent) live in households that use iodized salt (DHS 2011).




3   It is not possible to compare 2001 and 2006 results for vitamin A deficiency because the methodology
            changed between the two surveys. The results on vitamin A deficiency from the 2011 DHS are
            not reported because they are not considered reliable. Heavy rains during and after data
            collection are thought to have compromised the quality of the data samples (DHS 2011).

Another health burden in Uganda is the presence of high levels of aflatoxins‚Äînaturally occurring
carcinogenic byproducts of common fungi on crops‚Äîin maize and groundnuts. An article
reviewing recent research on aflatoxin prevalence in Uganda finds that the majority of maize and
groundnut samples test positive for aflatoxins and that prevalence levels often exceed the
WHO/FDA safety threshold of 20 parts per billion (Kaaya and Warren 2005). Another study of
mean aflatoxin levels in a variety of groundnut forms in markets finds mean levels well above 20
parts per billion (Kaaya, Eigel, and Harris 2006). Consumption of high levels of aflatoxin can lead
to growth impairment in children (Khlangwiset 2011) as well as liver cirrhosis (Kuniholm et al.
2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). It is widely understood that there is a
relationship between aflatoxin exposure and stunting, but this has not been quantified in the
published literature (Abt Associates 2014; Unnevehr and Grace 2013).

Parasitic intestinal worms also pose a significant nutritional problem in Uganda. A national
prevalence study conducted between 1998 and 2005 finds that 55 percent of school-aged children
in Uganda were infected with at least one species of intestinal worm. Most prevalent was
hookworm, and there was little variation by region in prevalence of hookworms (Kabatereine et
al. 2005). In the short term, parasitic worm infections can cause anemia and increase morbidity,
undernutrition, and the impairment of mental and physical development (Hotez et al. 2008). In the
long term, infected children are estimated to have an average IQ loss of 3.75 points per child and
they earn less as adults (43 percent less) than those who grow up free of worms (Bleakley 2007).

Deworming programs have recently expanded coverage in response to the problem: the number
of children receiving deworming medication increased dramatically between 2006 and 2011. In
2011, half of all children aged 6 to 59 months had received deworming medication in the previous
6 months, although there was significant regional variation with Karamoja, Kampala, and Western
regions having the highest rates, as shown in Figure 7 (DHS 2006, 2011). There are no figures
on what proportion of school-aged children receive deworming medication, although intestinal
parasite infections tend to be most prevalent and intense in this cohort (Bundy 2011).

                                                     THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN NUTRITION

Undernutrition is an underlying cause of approximately half of the deaths of children under five
and one-fifth of maternal deaths in developing countries. The joint effect of suboptimum
breastfeeding and fetal growth restriction in the neonatal period alone contributes 1.3 million
deaths or 19 percent of all deaths of children under five (Black et al. 2013). Undernourished
children are more likely to die from illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, pneumonia, malaria, and
HIV/AIDS. Child and maternal malnutrition accounts for over 10 percent of all disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) in Uganda. This is the second biggest risk factor affecting DALYs in Uganda
(after unsafe sex) (IHME 2010).

Those malnourished children who survive face long-lasting health and schooling consequences,
including cognitive deficits and poorer schooling outcomes. Children with impaired cognitive skills
have lower school enrollment, attendance, and graduation, which in turn results in lower
productivity, earnings, and economic well-being. Stunted children lose 0.7 grades of schooling
and are more likely to drop out of school. An adequate intake of micronutrients‚Äîparticularly iron,
vitamin A, iodine, and zinc‚Äîis critical for growth and cognitive development. Iodine- deficient
children lose on average 13 IQ points, and iron deficiency anemia reduces performance on tests
by 8 IQ points, making these children less educable and less productive in the long run (World
Bank 2006). Behrman et al. (2009) show improved schooling and test scores from
supplementation in early childhood.


                                                                         7
Malnutrition costs developing countries billions of dollars in lost revenue through reduced
economic productivity, particularly through lower wages, lower physical and mental capabilities,
and more days away from work as a result of illness. The Cost of Hunger in Uganda study
estimated the annual cost of child malnutrition at $899 or about 5.6 percent of Uganda‚Äôs GDP in
2009 (COHA 2012). At the individual level, childhood stunting is estimated to reduce a person‚Äôs
potential lifetime earnings by at least 10 percent (World Bank 2006). Other studies have shown
that a 1 percent loss in adult height results in a 2 to 2.4 percent loss in productivity (Caulfield et
al. 2004; Strauss and Thomas 1998). In addition, micronutrient deficiencies in childhood and
adulthood have tremendous economic cost for both individuals and countries. Childhood anemia
alone is associated with a 2.5 percent drop in adult wages. Anemia in adults has been estimated
to be equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP; this estimate goes up to 3.4 percent when including the
secondary effects of retarded cognitive development in children (Horton 1999). Horton and Ross
(2003) estimate that eliminating iron-deficiency anemia would result in a 5 to 17 percent increase
in adult productivity. Micronutrient deficiencies in Uganda collectively add up to an estimated loss
of over $145 million in GDP every year (World Bank 2011). The economic costs of undernutrition
have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable in the developing world. A recent analysis
estimates these losses at up to 11 percent of GDP in Africa and Asia each year (Horton and
Steckel 2013)‚Äîequivalent to about $149 billion of productivity losses.

Investing in early childhood nutrition interventions has the potential to supercharge the potential
demographic dividend in Uganda. The term demographic dividend refers to the growth in a
country‚Äôs economy that results from certain changes in the age structure, leading to a youth bulge
and reduced dependency ratios in the population. This dividend is more likely to be realized if
these cohorts are better nourished and productive. By increasing investment in human capital as
fertility rates decline, Uganda could potentially harness its demographic dividend.

Because most of the detrimental effects of malnutrition that occur in the first 1,000 days of a child‚Äôs
life are essentially irreversible, the window of opportunity for preventing malnutrition is the first
1,000 days, until the child is two years of age. After that age, most actions are too little, too late,
and too expensive (Black et al. 2008, 2013; World Bank 2006). Figure 8 shows that the rates of
return from nutrition investments are highest for programs targeting the earliest years, since these
investments build a foundation for future learning and productivity, prevent irreversible losses,
and lock in human capital for life (Heckman and Masterov 2004).

        Note: Age refers to the child‚Äôs age from birth, depicted in years for infancy and preschool, then in
        aggregate for school age and adulthood.



Malnutrition and poverty are interrelated and exacerbate each other. A recent study (Hoddinott et
al. 2011) concludes that individuals who are not stunted at 36 months are one-third less likely to
live in poor households as adults. Poverty increases the risk of malnutrition by lowering poor
households‚Äô purchasing power, reducing access to basic health services, and exposing these
households to unhealthy environments, thereby compromising food intakes (both quality and
quantity) and increasing infections. Poor households are also more likely to have frequent
pregnancies, larger family sizes with high dependency ratios, more infections, and increased
health care costs. Conversely, malnutrition causes poor health status, poor cognitive
development, and less schooling, resulting in poor human capital and long-term productivity
losses. However, as Figure 5 shows, while child stunting rates are highest among the poorest
four quintiles in Uganda, even among the richest quintile more than 20 percent children are
stunted. As discussed above, this suggests that factors other than income (informational
asymmetries, feeding and child-care practices, and so on) influence nutritional status.

Nutrition interventions are consistently identified as cost-effective development actions, and the
costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. The global benefit-cost ratio of micronutrient
powders for children is 37 to 1; of deworming it is 6 to 1; of iron fortification of staples it is 8 to 1;
and of salt iodization it is 30 to 1 (World Bank 2010).

A recent World Bank study estimates that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs GDP by
at least 3 percent annually (World Bank 2010). The same study estimates these costs at $10.3
billion per annum globally, to be financed through domestic public and private sector and donor
resources. These investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million
children, save at least 1.1 million lives, avert at least 30 million DALYs, and reduce the number of
stunted children by about 30 million worldwide. Bhutta et al. (2013) come up with similar
estimates. In another study, Hoddinott, Rosegrant, and Torero (2012) estimate that, for just $100


                                                     9
per child, interventions including micronutrient provision, public provision of complementary food
for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, treatments for worms and diarrheal diseases,
and behavior change programs could reduce chronic undernutrition by 36 percent in developing
countries. Clearly there is huge potential pay-off for dedicating more resources to the scale-up of
evidence-based, cost-effective nutrition interventions.



                   A MULTISECTORAL APPROACH FOR IMPROVING NUTRITION

The determinants of malnutrition are multisectoral. Therefore, to successfully and sustainably
improve nutrition outcomes, a multisectoral approach is needed. At a proximate level, access to
food, health, hygiene, and adequate child-care practices is key to reducing malnutrition. At a more
distal level, poverty, women‚Äôs status, and other social factors play important roles. It has been
demonstrated that direct actions taken to address the proximate determinants of malnutrition can
be enhanced by action on some of the more distal levels. For example, programs supporting
improved infant and young child feeding practices will be more effective if they are complemented
with programs to address gender issues by reducing women‚Äôs workloads, thus allowing women
more time for child care. Similarly, conditional cash transfer programs that target the poor, if
designed appropriately, have the potential not just to address poverty but also to increase demand
for nutrition services and good nutrition behaviors.

Although the health sector is key to delivering nutrition-specific interventions to the poor (such as
vitamin A supplementation and deworming), multisectoral nutrition-sensitive actions through the
agriculture sector as well as through social protection, water and sanitation, and poverty reduction
programs have the potential to strengthen nutritional outcomes in several ways (Box 2). Examples
of these include (1) improving the context in which the nutrition-specific interventions are
delivered‚Äîfor example, through investment in food systems, empowerment of women, and
equitable education; (2) integrating nutrition considerations into programs in other sectors as
delivery platforms (such as conditional cash transfer programs) that will potentially increase the
scale and coverage of nutrition-specific interventions; and (3) increasing policy coherence through
government-wide attention to policies or strategies and trade-offs, which may have positive or
unintended negative consequences for nutrition. The synergy with other sectors is critical to
breaking the cycle of malnutrition and sustaining the gains from direct nutrition-specific
interventions (World Bank 2013b).

Guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions is currently very limited for at least two
reasons. First, evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive interventions with respect to
nutritional outcomes is limited. Second, compared with nutrition-specific interventions, estimating
and attributing the costs of nutrition-sensitive interventions is quite complex since these
interventions have multiple objectives and improved nutrition outcomes is only one of them.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the availability of costing information is crucial to assess the
cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This series of papers on costing nutrition interventions
makes a first-ever attempt to address these issues.

evidence of the positive impact on nutrition
outcomes, and for which there is some cost               Nutrition-specific interventions address
information.     First,   we    consider     two         the immediate determinants of child nutrition,
interventions delivered through the agriculture          such as adequate food and nutrition intake,
sector: biofortification of orange sweet                 feeding and caregiving practices, and
potatoes and aflatoxin reduction through                 treating disease. Examples include:
biocontrol. We then consider two interventions
delivered through the education sector:                   ‚Ä¢ Community nutrition programs
school-based deworming and school-based                   ‚Ä¢ Micronutrient (e.g., vitamin A)
promotion of good hygiene. Other potential                  supplementation
nutrition-sensitive interventions, not included           ‚Ä¢ Deworming
in this analysis due to data limitations, are the
reduction of women‚Äôs workloads through                   Nutrition-sensitive interventions are
appropriate technologies in agriculture and              delivered through the agriculture; education;
water and sanitation programs that reduce the            and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors
exposure to infections and childhood diseases,           and have the potential to have an impact on
among others.                                            nutrition outcomes more indirectly than
                                                         nutrition-specific interventions. Examples
Uganda would be a strong candidate for                   include:
scaling up the biofortification of orange sweet
potatoes: sweet potato is a staple in the               ‚Ä¢ Biofortification (e.g., vitamin A‚Äìrich sweet
Ugandan diet and a pilot program in Uganda                potato or cassava)
shows        extremely      promising      results.     ‚Ä¢ Conditional cash transfers
Biofortification uses plant breeding techniques
                                                        ‚Ä¢ Water and sanitation sector infrastructure
to enhance the micronutrient content of staple
foods. In the case of Uganda, this involves               improvements
introducing varieties of orange sweet potatoes
selected to thrive in Uganda and promoting the
substitution of these orange sweet potatoes, which are high in vitamin A, for white and yellow
sweet potatoes, which are traditionally eaten in Uganda and have an extremely low vitamin
content. This intervention is designed to complement vitamin A supplementation by reaching
subsistence farmers. Forty-five percent of farmers in Uganda grow sweet potatoes for both
consumption and sale (HarvestPlus 2012). Evaluation of the orange sweet potato biofortification
program in Uganda shows high farmer adoption, a significant increase in vitamin A intake, and
improvement of child vitamin A status (Arimond et al. 2011; Hotz et al. 2012b). An ex-ante cost
study of biofortification in 14 countries suggests that the costs per DALY averted fall in the highly
cost-effective category, particularly in South Asia and Africa (Meenakshi et al. 2010). A recent
study by HarvestPlus that ranks countries according to their suitability for investment in
biofortification interventions identifies Uganda as being among those countries most likely to
benefit from biofortification of the orange sweet potato (Asare-Marfo et al. 2013). Uganda is also
identified as a top country to benefit from vitamin A maize, high-iron beans, and high-iron pearl
millet (Asare-Marfo et al. 2013), although these are not costed in this report due to lack of country-
specific data. In particular, interventions to promote the cultivation of iron-rich beans are underway
in Uganda and show tremendous potential. As data on costs of these interventions becomes
available, it will be important to consider their cost-effectiveness.

Uganda has high rates aflatoxin exposure (COMESA 2014). Aflatoxin is a poison naturally
produced by strains of fungus that occur in maize, groundnuts and other common crops produced
and eaten in Uganda. It is widely understood that there is a relationship between aflatoxin

                                                    11
exposure and child stunting, albeit the evidence base for this relationship is more tentative and it
has not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt
Associates 2014). However, links with liver cancer are well established: consuming high levels of
aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer in adults (Kuniholm et al. 2008; Abt
Associates 2014).

Reduction of aflatoxins in maize is possible through multiple means, the most promising of which
are biocontrol and improved storage and handling. Biocontrol of aflatoxins has the potential to
reduce aflatoxins in maize and groundnuts by at least 80 to 90 percent (Bandyopadhyay and
Cotty 2013). Field testing of biocontrol products in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal,
although not formally published, is producing extremely positive results. The method involves a
single application of a biocontrol product containing strains unique to a given country. The
development of a biocontrol product for Uganda is expected to begin soon (COMESSA 2014).
Improved storage and handling is another option which shows potential in trials in other countries
(IFPRI 2012). In Mali, promising pre- and post-harvest interventions for groundnuts have been
analyzed, including the use of improved seed varieties, better granaries, and practices such as
hand sorting and drying on wooden mats (World Bank 2015).

School-based deworming has been proven to be an efficient and cost-effective intervention to
address health and nutrition outcomes, with a cost per DALY saved estimated at $4.55 (J-PAL
2012). Delivering deworming tablets through schools is inexpensive because it uses existing
infrastructure and delivery platforms in schools and community links with teachers. Teachers need
only minimal training to safely administer the tablets, so their workloads are not significantly
increased. The delivery costs of school-based deworming in schools are about $0.04 per
treatment (Guyatt 2003), yet the benefits are enormous. Bi-annual deworming significantly
boosted school attendance and reduced self-reported illness and anemia, while providing modest
gains in height-for-age Z-scores in Kenya (J-PAL 2012). Evidence from India also suggests that
deworming has the potential to reduce cases of childhood stunting and underweight (Awasthi et
al. 2013). In the long term, deworming improves self-reported health, increases total schooling
years, and increases earnings by 20 percent (Baird et al. 2011).

Improved hygiene behaviors through the promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior
would decrease the risk of stunting in one in three children. Correct handwashing at critical times
can reduce the severity of diarrhea by 42 to 47 percent, lower the incidence of diarrhea in children
by 53 percent, and reduce the incidence of acute respiratory infections by 44 percent (World Bank
2013b). A recent campaign promoting handwashing with soap in primary schools in China,
Colombia, and Egypt demonstrates significant reduction in absenteeism related to diarrhea and
respiratory illness (UNICEF 2012b). A study in Brazil shows a relationship between the effects of
early childhood diarrhea on later school readiness and school performance, revealing the
potential long-term human and economic costs of early childhood diarrhea (Lorntz et al. 2006).

The effectiveness of promoting good hygiene behavior in schools is demonstrated by the long-
term impact and broad effect of good hygiene on communities. Schools are ideal settings for
hygiene education, where children can learn and sustain lifelong proper hygiene practices through
peer-to-peer teaching, classroom sessions with focused training materials, and role-playing or
interactive songs. A study on the long-term effect of a hygiene education program for both adults
and children finds that hygiene behaviors are sustained beyond the end of an intervention. The
study also finds that educated students can influence family members by sharing this information,
which may in turn affect behavior change at the community level (Bolt and Cairncross 2004).

At the same time, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions‚Äîwhich provide improved
water sources, hygienic latrines, and behavior change communication programs‚Äîcan help to
reduce the incidence of diarrhea and child mortality. The World Bank argues that the reduction in
diarrhea from improved WASH ultimately depends on both the quality of existing WASH
infrastructure and on child mortality levels in the country (Gunther and Fink 2011). Given the high
levels of child mortality in Uganda and the poor quality of its current infrastructure, it follows that
WASH interventions could have a significant impact. A recent study by Chase and Ngure (2016)
reviews the ways in which WASH has an impact on nutrition outcomes and suggests specific
ways WASH have an improved effect on nutrition outcomes. In studying the potential benefits of
scaling up WASH interventions in Uganda, the Department for International Development (DFID)
cites estimates that these programs could reduce diarrhea-related DALYs by 39 percent and save
an average of $7.50 per person per year in reduced health care costs (DFID 2012). Additionally,
DFID claims that by reducing the time that households, and women in particular, spend gathering
water, WASH interventions could save an average of 1.5 hours per household per day (DFID
2012).


        GOVERNMENT AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MALNUTRITION IN UGANDA

The Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP) is Uganda‚Äôs framework for scaling up multisectoral
efforts to establish a strong nutrition foundation for Uganda‚Äôs development. UNAP‚Äôs goal is to
focus public resources and national efforts to bring about sharp improvements in nutrition among
young children and women of reproductive age by scaling up the implementation of a package of
proven and cost-effective interventions. One of the resources leveraged under UNAP is the World
Bank-supervised Uganda Multisectoral Food Security and Nutrition Project which is partially
financed with a grant from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The
project supports smallholder households to increase production and consumption of
micronutrient-rich foods and increase utilization of community-based nutrition services. The
project is delivered through the agriculture, education, and health sectors.

In Uganda, donors and nongovernmental organizations support most nutrition interventions other
than wages and administration (FANTA-2 2010). The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) acts as the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Donor Convener and is the lead
agency for the U.S. Government‚Äôs global hunger and food security initiative, Feed the Future.
Several Feed the Future-funded nutrition projects are being implemented by nongovernmental
organizations in Uganda, including the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA)-III,
Strengthening Partnerships and Results in Nutrition Globally (SPRING), and Production for
Improved Nutrition (PIN). FANTA-III focuses on capacity building, system strengthening and
implementation and evaluation of nutrition programs, while SPRING is working to expand
fortification of cooking oil to over 90 percent of the market, through technical assistance to support
and implement national-level activities and policies related to food fortification and other
micronutrient initiatives. The PIN initiative supports local production of ready-to-use therapeutic
foods (RUTF) and fortified complementary foods for infants and young children. Other donors
contributing to nutrition activities in Uganda include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program, and the
World Health Organization (WHO).

         PART II ‚Äì COSTED SCALE-UP SCENARIOS: RATIONALE,
                   OBJECTIVES, AND METHODOLOGY
The overall objective of this research is to support the Government of Uganda in developing a
costed scale-up plan that furthers the operationalization of the recently released Uganda National
Action Plan (UNAP). These efforts will provide the Government of Uganda with the tools needed
to leverage adequate resources from its domestic budgets, as well as from development partners,
in support of the costed scale-up plan. Within this context, the objectives of this analysis are as
follows:

   ‚Ä¢   To estimate scale-up costs in Uganda for a set of well-proven nutrition-specific
       interventions that have the potential to be scaled up through tested delivery mechanisms
   ‚Ä¢   To conduct a basic economic analysis to calculate the potential benefits and cost-
       effectiveness associated with the proposed scale-up
   ‚Ä¢   To propose a series of scenarios for a costed scale-up plan that rolls out this package of
       nutrition-specific interventions in phases, based on considerations of impact, geography,
       implementation capacity, and costs
   ‚Ä¢   To explore initial costs for a limited number of nutrition-sensitive interventions through the
       agriculture, education, and water and sanitation sectors

Although the economic arguments for increasing investments in nutrition are sound, one of the
first questions raised by key decision makers in any country is ‚ÄúHow much will it cost?‚Äù In 2010
the World Bank spearheaded a study called Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? to answer
that question at the global level. The analysis estimates the level of global financing required to
scale up 10 evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions in 36 countries that account for 90
percent of the world‚Äôs stunting burden and 32 smaller countries that also have a high prevalence
of undernutrition. The results of the study highlight the global financing gap, underscore the
importance of investing in nutrition at the global level, and lay out a methodology for estimating
the costs of nutrition-specific interventions. However, these global estimates do not capture the
nuances and context in each country, nor are these estimates contextualized to every individual
country‚Äôs policy and capacity setting or its fiscal constraints. This report builds on the early work
to address this gap and contextualize the cost estimates for Uganda.

The multisectoral approach requires nutrition-sensitive approaches or interventions that can be
delivered through other sectors. As discussed above, globally there is currently very limited
guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions. Therefore this present report provides an
exploratory analysis to be used primarily to engage other sectors in planning for improved
nutritional outcomes. This initial exercise will contribute to a broader discussion about
methodological and other issues for costing nutrition-sensitive interventions, and will thereby
encourage the formulation of standard definitions, methodologies, and guidance for costing these
interventions in the future.

              SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTIONS

The costed scale-up plan is presented in two sections. The first section presents estimated costs
and benefits for the set of 10 nutrition-specific interventions that have strong evidence of impact
and were included in the World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010) and are primarily
delivered through the health sector. These interventions and the associated target population and
current coverage for each intervention are specified in Table 1.

The nutrition-specific interventions considered are a modified package of the interventions
included in the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to the
Ugandan context. These 10 interventions are based on current scientific evidence, and there is
general consensus from the global community about the impact of these interventions. Some
interventions‚Äîsuch as deworming and iron-fortification of staple foods‚Äîthat were included in the
2008 Lancet series but no longer listed in the 2013 Lancet series are included here because they
remain relevant to Uganda. Others‚Äîsuch as calcium supplementation for women and
prophylactic zinc supplementation‚Äîare excluded because delivery mechanisms are not available
in client countries, including Uganda, and/or there are no clear WHO protocols or guidelines for
large-scale programming. In other cases, there are limited capacities for scaling up the
interventions. Only those nutrition-specific interventions that are relevant to the Ugandan context
and that have strong evidence of effectiveness, a WHO protocol, and a feasible delivery
mechanism for scale-up are included in the proposed scale-up package below. As this evidence
base grows, other interventions can be added over time.

The analysis in the following section focuses on nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant
to the Ugandan context and that have the potential to have an impact on nutrition outcomes. A
description of these interventions, associated target populations, and responsible sectors are
listed in Table 2. As discussed above, the evidence base for nutrition-sensitive interventions is
not as strong as it is for nutrition-specific interventions. Therefore these estimates are exploratory
and are limited to six potential interventions relevant to the Ugandan context that can be scaled
up and have potential for impact on nutrition outcomes. Additional interventions were not included
in these initial estimates because their impact on nutrition is yet to be clearly documented (Masset
et al. 2011; Ruel et al. 2013; World Bank 2013b), because this is an exploratory instead of an
exhaustive effort, or because they were not considered relevant to the needs of Uganda.
Furthermore, cost attribution is complex because these nutrition-sensitive interventions are
designed for multiple purposes.

ESTIMATION OF TARGET POPULATION SIZES, CURRENT COVERAGE LEVELS, AND UNIT COSTS

Target population estimates are presented in Appendix 2. These estimates are based on
projections from the 2010 Census that used 2.84 percent as the annual population growth rate.
The prevalence of child stunting (height-for-age Z-score <‚Äì2), underweight (weight-for-age Z-
score <‚Äì2), and severe wasting (weight-for-height Z-score <‚Äì3) among children under five years
of age in each region were obtained from the 2011 Uganda DHS.

Data on current coverage levels was obtained from various sources. To avoid underestimating
costs, current coverage levels for multiple micronutrient powders, iron fortification of staple foods,


                                                 17
and public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate malnutrition were set
to 0 percent either because the intervention was not being implemented and coverage was very
minimal, or because current reliable coverage data were not available. Programmatic data on the
coverage of breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion was provided by UNICEF. The
treatment of severe acute malnutrition was assumed to be negligible. Coverage data on vitamin
A supplements, deworming, zinc supplements, iron-folic acid supplementation, and salt iodization
were obtained from the 2011 Uganda DHS.

The unit costs and delivery platforms for the nutrition-specific interventions and nutrition-sensitive
interventions are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Whenever possible, the unit costs of the
nutrition-specific interventions were estimated using programmatic data provided by UNAP or
UNICEF. The only exception is the unit cost for breastfeeding and complementary feeding
promotion, which comes from a similar costing exercise in Kenya. A complete index of data
sources and relevant assumptions for each intervention can be found in Appendix 3.

For the nutrition-sensitive interventions in the agriculture sector, the unit costs and the delivery
platforms are listed in Table 4. The unit costs for the biofortification of orange sweet potatoes are
based on the HarvestPlus research project implemented in Uganda in 2007‚Äì09 (HarvestPlus
2012). That project reports actual and ‚Äúreduced‚Äù average and marginal unit costs. Average costs
include the fixed costs of overall management of implementation. Marginal costs represent the
additional cost of increasing the number of extension workers and target households under the
overall management structure of the size of that project. The ‚Äúreduced‚Äù costs represent a more
realistic or real-world setting, rather than a research project. The reduced cost estimates are $26
for average costs and $10 for marginal costs. These are the costs used here, divided by three to
arrive at an annualized unit cost. 4 In scaling up throughout Uganda one could expect the unit cost
to be similar to the average cost at the beginning and closer to the marginal cost after initial
implementation. Also, the unit cost does not include research and development (R&D) or adaptive
breeding activities, since these phases were already completed. Two sources of unit costs are
used. First, a per hectare unit cost for biocontrol comes from the International Institute for Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria (Bandyopadhyay 2013) and is considered a best approximation of
costs for Uganda. This cost estimate includes material and distribution costs. A second
approximation is cost per 90 kg. bag of maize from Kenya (IFPRI 2012). The cost for storage in
plastic containers also comes from the same study in Kenya (IFPRI 2012).

Unit costs for interventions in the education sector come from both Ugandan and international
sources. The unit cost for school-based deworming is based on analysis by Kabatereine et al.
(2005) and is between $0.063 and $0.105 for four districts in Uganda. We use the average across
the four districts of $0.09. The unit cost of $2 per student for school-based promotion of good
hygiene is obtained from the UNICEF report (2012b) on WASH in schools. This includes the cost
of capacity building, monitoring, advocacy, and social mobilization, but does not include the cost
of providing washing facilities in schools. For school-based feedings in Uganda, the unit cost of
$40 per student is derived from programs in The Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, and Malawi as reported
in World Bank 2013a.

                                             ESTIMATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS

The program experience methodology employed in the Scaling Up Nutrition report (World Bank
2010) is used for calculating the cost of scaling up in Uganda. This approach generates unit cost
data that capture all aspects of service delivery, including the costs of commodities, transportation
and storage, personnel, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, relevant overhead,
wastage, and so on for each intervention from actual programs that are already in operation in
Uganda, and considers the context in which they are delivered. Another commonly used method
is the ingredients approach, in which selected activities are bundled into appropriate delivery
packages (such as the number of visits to a health center; see Bhutta et al. 2013, for example).
Although the program experience approach tends to yield cost estimates that are higher than the
ingredients approach, the estimates more accurately reflect real programmatic experience,
including inefficiencies in service delivery. It should be noted, however, that the calculated costs
are reported in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social resource
requirements, which account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by beneficiaries
accessing the services.

We calculate the annual public investment required to scale up the interventions as follows:

           Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

where:

           Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage 5
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions

Appendix 4 describes the methodology in detail.

The expected benefits from scaling up nutrition interventions are calculated in terms of (1) DALYs
averted, (2) number of lives saved, (3) cases of childhood stunting averted, and (4) increased
program coverage. To calculate the number of DALYs averted, we use the method employed by
Black et al. (2008) to estimate the averted morbidity and mortality from scaling up different
nutrition interventions. The method uses population attributable fractions (PAF) based on the
comparative risk assessment project (Ezzati et al. 2002; Ezzati et al. 2004) to estimate the burden
of infectious diseases attributable to different forms of undernutrition using most recent Global
Burden of Disease Study (IHME 2010). DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor
age-weighted, in line with the methodology used in the Global Burden of Disease Study and the
WHO Global Health Estimates (2012). Appendix 5 describes the methodology for estimating
DALYs. The projected number of lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted are
calculated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and changes in the prevalence of under-five stunting. This
analysis includes all ten interventions to calculate the number DALYs averted. However, because
of the methodological limitations of the LiST tool, the calculation for the number of lives saved is


5   Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for community-
        based treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent.

based on only six of the ten interventions, 6 and cases of childhood stunting averted is based on
only four of the ten. 7 As such, our estimates are likely to underestimate the number of lives saved
and cases of childhood stunting averted. Appendix 6 describes the methodology for the LiST
estimates.

The measures for the cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions are calculated in terms
of cost per DALY averted, cost per life saved, and cost per case of stunting averted. Estimates of
benefits were combined with information on costs to produce the cost-effectiveness measures for
each intervention as well as for the overall package of interventions. The evaluation of the cost-
effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs averted is based on the categorization used by WHO-
CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective): 8 an intervention is considered to be
‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù if the range for the cost per DALY averted is less than GDP per capita; 9 it is
considered to be ‚Äúcost-effective‚Äù if it is between one and three times GDP per capita; and it is
considered ‚Äúnot cost-effective‚Äù if it exceeds three times GDP per capita (WHO 2014).

The cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to
nutrition-specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value for the impact on mortality and
morbidity of a five-year scale-up plan, we use estimates of the number of lives saved and the
reduction in stunting prevalence produced by the LiST tool. Following established practice, a life
year saved is valued as equivalent to gross national income (GNI) per capita; this is considered
to be a conservative measure because it accounts for only the economic and not the social value
of a year of life. In order to estimate the value of the reduction in stunting, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which values a year of life lived without stunting
based on the assumption that stunted individuals lose an average of 66 percent of lifetime
earnings. Future benefits are then age-adjusted and discounted at three potential discount rates
(3, 5, and 7 percent) in order to arrive at their present value. The present value of future benefits
is then compared with the annual public investment required, which allows us to estimate the net
present value (NPV) and internal rate of return of the investment. A detailed explanation of the
benefit estimation methodology can be found in Appendix 7.

The annual increase in economic productivity attributable to each package of interventions is
calculated based on the same estimates of future benefits. Although these benefits occur only
once beneficiaries have reached productive age, we assume that they serve as an approximation
of the present value of economic productivity lost each year as a result of mortality and morbidity
that would otherwise be prevented by scaling up nutrition interventions. Values presented are
taken from a year in which all beneficiaries have reached productive age.

The approach for estimating the potential costs and benefits of nutrition-sensitive interventions
differs from the methodology used for nutrition-specific interventions. Similar to nutrition- specific

6   The six interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A supplementation,
       therapeutic zinc supplementation with oral rehydration salts, iron-folic acid supplementation, the public
       provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, and community-
       based management of severe acute malnutrition.
7   The four interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A supplementation,
       iron-folic acid supplementation, and the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of

interventions, the total cost for scaling up the interventions is calculated by multiplying the unit
cost by the target population (either country unit costs for Uganda or Africa regional unit costs are
used, depending on availability). However, since most nutrition-sensitive interventions have
multiple objectives, it is not always feasible to attribute the nutrition-related benefits to the overall
costs of the interventions. Because these constraints limit the accuracy of cost-effectiveness
estimates, we instead rely on secondary sources and published literature when available, with
cost-effectiveness presented in terms of cost per DALY averted.


                    SCENARIOS FOR SCALING UP NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS

When estimating the costs and benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions, we begin with
estimates for scaling all 10 interventions to full national coverage, followed by estimates for
various scale-up scenarios. The full coverage estimates can be considered the medium-term
policy goal for the Government of Uganda. However, resource constraints will likely limit the
government‚Äôs ability to achieve full national coverage in the short-term. Therefore we also propose
several scenarios for prioritizing the scale-up of nutrition interventions over the short-term time
frame of five years:

    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 1: Prioritize scale up by region
    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 2: Prioritize scale up by intervention
    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 3: Prioritize scale up by region and by intervention

Within each of the above scenarios, we consider multiple variations and analyze their cost-
effectiveness in terms of cost per DALY averted, cost per life saved, and cost per case of
childhood stunting averted. After our initial analysis, we present the most attractive scale-up
scenarios and discuss them in more detail.

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for
community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to
be 80 percent. This definition is consistent with the methodology used in World Bank‚Äôs Scaling
Up Nutrition report (2010), and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment
programs have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

   PART III ‚Äì RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS
                 TOTAL COST, EXPECTED BENEFITS, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS

The total additional public investment required to scale up 10 nutrition-specific interventions from
current coverage levels to full coverage nationwide in Uganda is estimated to be $68 million
annually (Table 5). This cost includes the additional cost of scaling up all 10 interventions across
the entire country from current levels ($87 million per year), plus additional resources for capacity
development for program delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and
technical support for program delivery (together estimated at $10 million). Of this total amount,
part of the costs for iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and
complementary food would be covered by private households with incomes above the poverty
line, resulting in an annual financing gap of $68 million required to reach full national scale.

The expected benefits from scaling up these 10 nutrition-specific interventions to full national
coverage are enormous (Table 6). More than 375,000 DALYs would be averted and over 8,000
lives would be saved annually, while more than 211,000 cases of stunting among children under
five would be averted. Program coverage is assumed to increase to cover the following

a. DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor age-weighted, in line with the methodology used
in the IMHE‚Äôs 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study and the WHO Global Health Estimates 2012. For more
information on the methodology used to calculate DALYs averted, see Appendix 5.
b. DALY estimates for iron-folic acid supplementation are calculated for DALYs averted among pregnant
women. They do not include the DALYs averted among children born to mothers who received these
supplements.
c. The total of the interventions implemented simultaneously does not equal to the sum of the individual
interventions. This is because some interventions affect nutrition outcomes via similar pathways, causing
their combined impact to be different than the individual sums.


For the package as a whole, we estimate the total cost per DALY averted at $232, the total cost
per life saved at $9,996, and the total cost per case of child stunting averted at $411 (Table 7).
Variation in cost among the interventions is high and, as a result, some interventions have a lower
estimated cost per DALY averted ($19 for vitamin A supplementation), whereas others have much
higher costs ($663 for the public provision of complementary food). Overall, these cost estimates

                                                    26
translate into an increase in annual public resource requirements of $8.28 per child, which is well
under the cost of $30 per child found in the global costing exercise (World Bank 2010).

All of the 10 nutrition-specific interventions are very cost-effective according to the WHO-CHOICE
criteria (WHO 2014)‚Äîthat is, less than three times the GDP per capita of $696 (World Bank
2014b). However, the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate
acute malnutrition has a relatively higher cost per DALY averted ($663) than the other
interventions. Therefore, in a country such as Uganda, where fiscal and capacity constraints will
limit scale-up, certain expensive interventions‚Äîsuch as the public provision of complementary
food‚Äîmay be a lower priority. Furthermore, issues of governance, accountability, and supply
logistics will all put pressure on the cost and complicate the scale-up of the public provision of
complementary food.

Scenario 1: Scaling Up by Region
Table 8 shows the estimated costs and benefits of scaling up the 10 nutrition-specific interventions
according to the burden of stunting in each region. Stunting rates exceed 40 percent in the three
highest-burden regions (Karamoja, Southwest, and Western). The four middle-burden regions
have stunting rates between 30 and 39 percent (Central 1, Central 2, East Central, and West Nile)
and the three lowest-burden regions (Eastern, Kampala, and North) have stunting rates less than
30 percent.

To scale up interventions in the highest- and middle-burden regions would require an annual
public investment of $51 million. This scenario would avert 282,000 DALYs and save over 6,600
lives. It would also increase program coverage as follows:

    ‚Ä¢   The families of 0.6 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
        nutrition programs for growth promotion
    ‚Ä¢   0.7 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
        vitamin A supplementation
    ‚Ä¢   1.2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
        diarrhea management
    ‚Ä¢   0.4 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
        multiple micronutrient powders

   ‚Ä¢   71,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal care
   ‚Ä¢   6 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
   ‚Ä¢   0.04 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
   ‚Ä¢   17,700 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
       community-based management practices
   ‚Ä¢   50,000 children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive a small amount of nutrient-dense
       complementary food (~250 kilocalories/day) for the prevention or treatment of moderate
       malnutrition

Scenario 2: Scaling Up by Intervention
Scenario 2 considers prioritizing the scale-up by intervention according to cost-effectiveness. The
proposed plan for a step-wise scale-up by intervention is summarized below and illustrated in
Figure 9.

   ‚Ä¢   Step 1 focuses on a package of micronutrient and deworming interventions that can be
       scaled up quickly, either with existing capacities or with modest investment in capacity
       building for community nutrition programs and national campaigns. The cost of scaling up
       all micronutrient and deworming interventions and breastfeeding and complementary
       feeding promotion to full national coverage and 30 percent of community-based
       management of severe acute malnutrition is $53 million. An additional $6 million for
       capacity development for program delivery as well as for monitoring and evaluation,
       operations research, and technical support brings the total cost of Step 1 to $59 million.
       Once the costs covered by households above the poverty line ($10 million) are deducted,
       the total public investment required for Step 1 is estimated at $49 million.
   ‚Ä¢   Step 2 includes the costs of reaching the remaining 50 percent of community-based
       management of acute malnutrition programming to attain 80 percent national coverage.
       The estimated cost of this scale-up is $10 million. We include an additional $1 million for
       capacity development for program delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations
       research, and technical support for program delivery, which brings the total public
       investment required for Step 2 to $11 million.
   ‚Ä¢   Step 3 scales up the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of
       moderate malnutrition to full national coverage. This intervention requires an investment
       of $25 million in addition to the $3 million needed for capacity development for program
       delivery and for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for
       program delivery. Households above the poverty line are expected to contribute $19
       million, leaving a total public investment required of $8 million.

       Figure 9. Scenario 2: Step-Wise Scale-Up by Intervention




       Note: There is no household contribution for Step 2 interventions.



The public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition
(Step 3) is assigned the lowest priority for the following reasons: (1) the 2013 Lancet nutrition
series concluded that there are no additional benefits to the public provision of complementary
food beyond those provided by dietary counseling and education; (2) at $663 per DALY averted,
the cost-effectiveness of the public provision of complementary food is less attractive than that of
the other proposed interventions; and (3) governance, accountability, supply-chain, and logistics
are key challenges associated with large-scale food distribution and are not inconsequential in a
country the size of Uganda. Under these circumstances, rapid scale-up is neither feasible nor
recommended.

The preferred scale-up scenario (Scenario 2) would be to scale up Step 1 and Step 2
interventions, requiring an annual public investment of $60 million (Table 9). This scenario would
avert over 337,000 DALYs and save at least 8,100 lives. It would also provide the following
program benefits:

                                                  30
    ‚Ä¢   The families of 3.5 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
        nutrition programs for growth promotion
    ‚Ä¢   3.3 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
        vitamin A supplementation
    ‚Ä¢   7.2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
        diarrhea management
    ‚Ä¢   2.3 million children 6‚Äì23 months would receive vitamins and minerals through multiple
        micronutrient powders
    ‚Ä¢   3.3 million children 12‚Äì59 months of age would receive deworming medication
    ‚Ä¢   0.4 million pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal
        care
    ‚Ä¢   36 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
    ‚Ä¢   0.3 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
    ‚Ä¢   219,690 children 6‚Äì59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
        community-based management practices

Under Scenario 3 we consider two variations. Scenario 3a would scale up Step 1 and Step 2
interventions in regions with stunting rates above 30 percent (highest- and middle-burden
regions), 10 requiring an annual public investment of $45 million. This scenario would avert over
253,000 DALYs and almost 6,200 lives (Table 11) and provide the following program benefits:

      ‚Ä¢   The families of 0.6 million children 0‚Äì59 months of age would be reached by community
          nutrition programs for growth promotion
      ‚Ä¢   0.7 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
          vitamin A supplementation
      ‚Ä¢   1.2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
          diarrhea management
      ‚Ä¢   0.4 million children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
          multiple micronutrient powders
      ‚Ä¢   0.5 million children 12‚Äì59 months of age would receive deworming medication
      ‚Ä¢   71,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal care
      ‚Ä¢   6.1 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
      ‚Ä¢   44,500 people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it

10   The highest-burden (> 40 percent) regions are Karamoja, Southwest, and Western. The middle-burden
       (30 to 39 percent) regions are Central, Central 1, East Central, and West Nile.

A second scenario (Scenario 3b) would scale up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions only in the three
highest-burden regions (Karamoja, Southwest, and Western), where stunting rates are higher
than 40 percent. Scenario 3b would require an annual public investment of $19 million and would
avert over 108,000 DALYs and save over 2,600 lives. Furthermore, Scenario 3b would provide

                    COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE SCALE-UP SCENARIOS

When considered in terms of cost-effectiveness (cost per life saved and DALY/case of stunting
averted), all scenarios promise significant value for money. Table 12 presents a comparison of
full scale-up and all four scenarios, shows that the three scenarios that exclude the public
provision of complementary food for the preventions of moderate acute malnutrition stand out as
the most cost-effective, with a cost per DALY averted of between $182 and $185. These three
scenarios (2, 3a, and 3b) are equally cost-effective but each has a very different total price tag:
providing nine interventions nationwide would require $60 million in annual public investment
versus $45 million for these services in the seven highest-burden regions, and only $19 million in
the three highest-burden regions. The choice between scenarios will therefore depend on how
many public resources can be mobilized for nutrition interventions.

                   ESTIMATING COSTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR SCALE UP PERIOD

Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full coverage in one year, and assuming a five-year time
frame for any potential strategic plan, we consider the costs of a gradual scale-up over five years
for each scenario. Scenarios 3a and 3b require fewer resources over five years than the other
scenarios. Interventions are assumed to scale from current coverage as follows: 20 percent of
coverage in Year 1, 40 percent in Year 2, 60 percent in Year 3, 80 percent in Year 4, and 100
percent in Year 5 (Table 13). For these calculations, we consider the expenditures on capacity
development for program delivery required to scale to full coverage to be a fixed cost, with some
additional funds allocated to refresher training and rehiring in the years after scale has been
reached. Thus the average annual amount spent on capacity development is allocated across the
five years rather than increasing in proportion to coverage, as is the case with the other costs.

                  ESTIMATED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS

A high burden of malnutrition negatively impacts a nation‚Äôs human capital. An investment in
improving nutrition outcomes among children in Uganda is therefore also an investment in the
country‚Äôs economic future. The two main ways in which malnutrition affects economic productivity
are increased mortality and morbidity‚Äîin other words, lives lost and years lived with a disease or
disability. For the purposes of this analysis, we estimate the potential economic benefits of scaling
up nutrition interventions in terms of lives saved (reduction in mortality) and cases of stunting
averted (reduction in morbidity). Because each life lost results in one less citizen contributing to
the nation‚Äôs economy, and because stunted children tend to earn and consume less, these impact
estimates help us to arrive at approximations of the return on investment attributable to the scale-
up of a particular package of interventions.

The economic benefits of investing in these effective nutrition interventions are tremendous (Table
14). Scaling up all 10 interventions nationwide could produce an annual increase of $280 million
in national economic productivity over the productive lives of the children affected. (Because of
methodological limitations, we were not able to calculate the increases in economic productivity
for the other scenarios.)

These estimates of economic benefits are based on a conservative methodology that does not
necessarily account for all of the potential benefits associated with improving nutrition outcomes
among Ugandan children. For example, these figures do not account for future growth in GDP
per capita, which would also be expected to increase with improved nutritional outcomes.
Furthermore, it is likely that these estimated increases in GDP would also improve equity in
Uganda because productivity among the poor would benefit the most from improved nutritional
outcomes.

Our analyses also show that these nutrition interventions are excellent economic investments
(Table 14). Because an increase in the assumed discount rate reduces the present value of future
benefits, we present the results using three possible discount rates: 3, 5, and 7 percent. The
investment would provide highly positive net present values across this range of discount rates,
indicating that it would be an excellent economic investment. In addition, this investment would
yield a highly positive internal rate of return, another indicator that it is an excellent economic
investment.

           FINANCING CURRENT AND PROPOSED NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS

The cost-effectiveness analysis presented here identifies an annual financing gap of between $19
and $51 million over five years, depending on which scenario is scaled up. This is above and
beyond the $20 million of government‚Äôs budget earmarked for the four years 2013‚Äì16 (Table 15).
The additional GAFSP funding of $37 million over the next five years is a large contribution toward
closing the gap, but additional resources will need to be mobilized to cover the additional financing
gap that we have identified in this analysis.

                          UNCERTAINTIES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Because actual unit costs may differ from our estimates, it is important to consider the effects of
both an increase and a decrease in these costs on the overall cost of the interventions. This
uncertainty is greatest for higher-cost interventions and less significant for those with lower costs.
For example, given the prevalence of information on and experience with the less-expensive
micronutrient and deworming interventions, there is a relatively high degree of certainty around
their estimated costs and financing needs. On the other hand, the costs of community nutrition
programs can vary greatly depending on their context: the intensity of community nutrition
programs for growth promotion, the number of community health workers employed, and the
amount of incentives provided all affect unit costs. Finally, there is very little information on the
costs associated with the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate
acute malnutrition. In Uganda, no delivery mechanism is available to be used as a reference for
these programs, while unit costs are highly dependent on the choice of targeting method and
other factors, such as widespread corruption and diversion of food supplies. In order to account
for these uncertainties, we perform a partial sensitivity analysis that describes the impact of
variation in unit costs while holding other variables constant. These results are presented in
Appendix 8.

To scale up the biofortification of vitamin A‚Äìrich (orange) sweet potatoes would cost
approximately $11 million for each of the four areas of Uganda, or approximately $44 million to
scale up across the whole country. We prioritize the areas based on the size of sweet potato
production and the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and stunting. Although sweet potatoes are
produced all over Uganda, production is highest in the Northern area, followed by the Eastern
area, the Western area, and the Central area (Bagama and Ilukor 2014). Vitamin A deficiency is
most severe in the Eastern area of Uganda (42 percent of children 6‚Äì59 months were deficient in
vitamin A in 2011). Stunting is most severe in the Northern and Western areas, and we therefore
propose prioritizing these two areas. This cost calculation is based on the per person marginal
cost of expanding production, as we assume that some infrastructure is already in place in
Uganda as a result of the HarvestPlus pilot project. To fortify all orange sweet potato production
in Uganda would require an investment of approximately $45 million. Birol and colleagues
estimate per DALY averted for biofortication of sweet potatoes of $4-7 (HarvestPlus 2014); this is
considered very cost effective by WHO standards and thus suggests large potential benefits from
biofortication in Uganda. Although not included in this analysis, ex-ante estimates of the cost-
effectiveness of biofortification of iron-rich beans in Honduras, Nicaragua and Northern Brazil also
show cost-effective cost per DALY averted of between $20 and $439 (Meenakshi et al. 2010).

The total cost of scaling up aflatoxin reduction through the biocontrol of maize nationwide is
estimated to be $17 million. This is based unit cost of a biocontrol product developed by IITA and
tested in Nigeria (Bandyopadhyay 2013) and Uganda maize-planting area estimates of about 1.1
million hectares in 2012 (FAOSTAT 2014). It is assumed that biocontrol will be applied to all maize
fields. 11 A study from Nigeria reports a cost per DALY averted of $43 (Khlangwiset 2011), which
is considered very cost effective. We were not able to estimate total costs of a nationwide scale-
up of improved food storage but a comparison of unit prices from Kenya (shown in Table 4)
indicates that improved food storage would be less expensive but also less effective (IFPRI 2012).
The analysis for Kenya as well as other studies suggest that successful control of aflatoxins will
require a multifaceted strategy (IFPRI 2012, COMESA 2014).


        NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED THROUGH THE EDUCATION SECTOR

The cost of scaling up school-based deworming is between $0.46 and $0.77 million as reported
by Kabatereine et al. (2005), who use actual or estimated prevalence rates for each district in
Uganda to categorize each into a prevalence category. The WHO recommends that where the
prevalence of intestinal parasites is over 50 percent, treatment should occur twice yearly. In areas
with a prevalence of 20 to 50 percent, treatment should be once a year. In areas with prevalence
below 20 percent, it is recommended that medications be available at the health facility but no
school-based treatment is needed. Using enrollment rates from the early 2000s, Kabatereine et
al. (2005) estimate that 4.7 million school-aged children would be the target for twice-yearly
treatment and 2.7 million would be the target for once-yearly treatment. Although the cost
estimates are likely to be an underestimate because they rely on enrollment rates from the early
2000s and cost data from that same period, they provide a clear indication that school-based
deworming is an attainable goal. If every primary and secondary student enrolled in 2012 were

11Most maize in Uganda is consumed by humans, but some is also consumed by livestock. We were not
able to estimate how many hectares produce maize for human consumption versus other purposes, so
we estimate the cost for implementing biocontrol on all hectares of maize production.

treated twice a year for intestinal parasites, the cost would be $1 million. This is likely to be an
overestimate because not every district would need twice-yearly treatment, but it indicates the
upper boundary of cost.

The cost of scaling up school-based promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior is
estimated to be $15 million. Although the promotion of WASH in schools normally includes
sustainable and safe water supply points, handwashing stands, and sanitation facilities, the
costing includes only the component of hygiene education. The target population is children
enrolled in primary and secondary school and the current coverage is assumed to be negligible. 12




12Under UNAP, the Ministry of Education will undertake a mapping exercise to determine the number of
schools with handwashing facilities and the state of those facilities and to identify gaps. There is also a
small budget for monitoring facilities in schools, with an annual budget for WASH of about $50,000.
However, none of this funding went toward supporting the teaching and practice of proper handwashing.

           PART V ‚Äì CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Systematic costing of highly effective nutrition interventions is important for setting priorities,
mobilizing resources, and advocating. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of
lives saved, DALYs averted, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will
make the case for investment in nutrition stronger and will aid in priority-setting by identifying the
most cost-effective packages of interventions in situations where financing is constrained. This
will potentially be a powerful evidence-based advocacy tool for policy makers‚Äîfor example, it can
assist the Ministry of Finance to make efficient budget allocations because it provides useful
evidence on what the government can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (in terms of lives saved, DALYs averted, or cases of
stunting averted) given available resources.

by limited resources and capacities. The most               ‚Ä¢   337,000 life years saved*

Although every attempt has been made to use real programming costs for these estimates, the
costs estimated here are likely to be slight overestimates, while the benefits are likely to be
underestimated, as discussed earlier. For some interventions, in particular breastfeeding
promotion and complementary feeding education, unit costs were taken sources outside Uganda
because at the time the research was conducted none were available for Uganda. An important
next step will be to estimate costs using local information. Ideally this would involve comparing
costs according to delivery platform and include consideration of how costs vary as greater
coverage rates are achieved. Another limitation of the analysis is that it does not capture
differences in costs across regions. In a large country such as Uganda, we would expect a wide
range in actual costs because they depend in part on population density, social and cultural
differences, available infrastructure, and other factors.

Even though this report focuses extensively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of
malnutrition are multisectoral, so any longer-term approach to improving nutrition outcomes must
also include nutrition-sensitive interventions. This analysis takes an innovative approach to
nutrition costing by not only estimating the costs and benefits of nutrition-specific interventions
but also considering costs of four nutrition-sensitive interventions implemented outside of the
health sector. However, the analysis presented here is only a starting point and is meant to spur
more analytical work to identify interventions that substantially improve nutritional status. As the
government continues to develop a multisectoral nutrition policy, it would be useful to consult
across sectors and ministries in order to identify other possible nutrition-sensitive interventions
that are cost-effective. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions are needed to do this.

Overall, the findings presented in this report point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific
interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a cost-effective
approach to reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in Uganda. Key next steps are for the
Government of Uganda and its partners to identify milestones in addressing undernutrition in
Uganda, to develop a road map of key actions, and to develop and implement a business plan to
mobilize funds to scale up the high-impact intervention package identified in this report.

                   APPENDIX 4: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING COSTS FOR UGANDA

The following steps lay out the methodology used to estimate costs for each intervention:

1. Describe each intervention
2. Define target populations for each intervention
3. Estimate the size of the target populations for each intervention in each province using the
   most current demographic data
4. Specify the delivery platform or channel(s) for each intervention, based on the country context
   and the accepted delivery modes
5. Identify data on the current coverage levels for each intervention in each province
6. Estimate the unit cost per beneficiary for each intervention from program experience in
   Uganda, whenever possible, and/or Africa region
7. Calculate additional costs of scaling up to full coverage by multiplying the unit cost for each
   intervention with the size of the ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù target population for each intervention by
   province. The formula for calculation is:

         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß1 (100 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß2 )

where:

         x1 = additional costs of scaling up to full coverage
         z1 = unit cost per beneficiary
         z2 = current coverage level (percentage)

8. Estimate additional resources for (1) capacity development for program delivery and (2) M&E,
    operations research, and technical support, estimated at 9 percent and 2 percent of total cost
    of interventions, respectively
9. Estimate a portion of the total cost that can be covered by private household resources. It is
    assumed that households above the poverty line could cover their own cost of iron fortification,
    multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and complementary food from private
    resources
10. Calculate the annual public investment required to scale up these interventions to full
    coverage using the following formula:

         Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

   where:

         Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions


Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which is set to 80 percent. This is consistent with World

                                                  48
Bank (2010) methods and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs
have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

              APPENDIX 5: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING DALYS FOR UGANDA

The following steps were undertaken to estimate the impact in DALYs averted of implementing
the various nutrition interventions:

   1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
      targeted cause
   2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD due to each cause-risk factor combination for the target
      population
   3. Calculate the DALYs averted under current or counterfactual coverage scenario
   4. Calculate the DALYs averted under the proposed intervention coverage scenario
   5. Calculate the net DALYs averted by the proposed intervention

1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
targeted cause
To estimate the effectiveness of the interventions, key articles by Black et al. (2013) and Bhutta
et al. (2013) in the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition were first consulted.
Additional literature searches for the latest evidence were conducted in the Pubmed online
database and the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Effectiveness
figures that were reported as statistically significant were extracted and used for the calculations.

2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD
The WHO‚Äôs 2012 Global Health Estimates (GHE 2012) data tables provide country-specific YLL
and YLD rates for each cause of death or disease (WHO 2012). GHE 2012 morbidity and mortality
estimates were used in combination with country-specific population attributable fractions (PAF)
from the Global Burden of Disease (IHME 2010). This assumes that the risk factor impacts on
morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between the two estimates.

To calculate the rate of morbidity and mortality from a cause due to a specific risk factor, the first
step is to calculate the PAF for the cause-risk factor combination. The PAF was extracted from
the country-specific risk factor attribution table from the 2010 GBD data. This was done separately
for YLL and YLD. In the second step, the country-specific YLLs and YLDs for the target
population‚Äîin most cases children under five years old‚Äîwere extracted from the GHE 2012
estimates. To calculate the YLL rate, the country-specific YLL is multiplied by the YLL PAF and
then by 100,000. The final figure is divided by country-specific population of interest (usually
children under five) to get the rate. The same final steps are followed to calculate the YLD,
although instead multiplying country-specific YLDs by the YLD PAF. The population estimate for
the rate calculation was extracted from GHE 2012.

         YLL per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLL * YLL_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_ population
         YLD per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLD * YLD_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_population

where:

         U-5_population = the population of children under five




                                                 50
3. Calculate counterfactual DALYs averted
To calculate the DALYs averted if current intervention coverage were maintained, the following
formula was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
             * intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
              * intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_current = YLL + YLD

4. Calculate total DALYs averted under intervention coverage
To calculate the potential DALYs averted under the intervention coverage, a similar formula as
above was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage
             * intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage
             * intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_intervention = YLL+YLD

5. Calculate net DALYs averted
The potential net DALYs averted by the intervention is:

       DALYs averted = DALY_intervention - DALY_current

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is a part of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum
policy modeling system. These tools include DemProj for creating demographic projections; AIM
to model and incorporate the impact of HIV/AIDS on demographic projections and child survival
interventions; and FamPlan for incorporating changing fertility into the demographic projection.
LiST is used to project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal

Once the demographic and health data have been updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for
each intervention is introduced into LiST. LiST either can use a sequential method to calculate
the impact of individual interventions or can calculate the simultaneous impact of a set of
interventions implemented at the same time. The second, simultaneous method is likely to yield

                                                 52
slightly lower estimates because interventions may have overlapping benefits. In this analysis we
present the both the individual/sequential results of the individual interventions for full coverage
(with totals calculated using the simultaneous method) and the simultaneous impact in the various
scale-up scenarios.

Note on Estimates of Cases of Stunting Averted
In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual
investment in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, we use LiST to model changes in the
prevalence of stunting over five years, during which the interventions are projected to have
reached 100 percent of the target population. Next, we model changes in the prevalence of
stunting over five years with no scale-up of the interventions. We then take the difference between
the estimated stunting prevalence in Year 5 with the scale up and the prevalence in Year 5 absent
the scale-up, and multiply this percentage point difference by the total population of children under
five years of age.

Our reason for using stunting prevalence in Year 5 relates to the assumptions built into the LiST
model, which assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next time
period. As a result, stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-up,
before dropping precipitously until Year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. We
assume that continuing investments in maintaining scale after Year 5 will serve to maintain the
gains in stunting prevalence reduction, and therefore we present this reduction as a benefit
attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five-
year scale-up plan, we model this scale-up directly in LiST and use the annual results over five
years in our cost-benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate
portrayal of the direct benefits attributable to a five-year scale up plan, and it does not assume
that the scale will necessarily be maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.

                  APPENDIX 7: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the best methodology for monetizing the
value of a life saved. In this analysis, we focus solely on the economic value of a life year, which
we measure as equal to GNI per capita. Other studies attempt to estimate the social value of a
life year as well as its economic value; because we do not, we acknowledge that our results
underestimate the true value of a life year saved.

Still, valuing years of life saved alone does not account for the economic benefits of reduced
morbidity, which include the long-term, nonlethal impacts of malnutrition on individuals. Although
there are a number of long-term impacts of nutritional deficiencies, we choose to focus on stunting
because of the availability of country-specific impact estimates produced by the LiST tool. 13

In order to estimate the economic value of a case of childhood stunting averted, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), who begin by assuming that stunted individuals lose
an average of 66 percent of lifetime earnings, based on direct estimates of the impact of stunting
in early life on later life outcomes found in Hoddinott et al. (2011). 14 This estimate for the effects
of stunting on future consumption is used as a proxy for the effect of stunting on lifetime earnings.
Additionally, Hoddinott et al. (2013) account for uncertainty by assuming that only 90 percent of
the total gains will be realized, which we also include in our calculations. However, unlike those
authors, we adjust our calculations to reflect the country‚Äôs labor force participation rate.

For both lives saved and cases of stunting averted, the benefits of a five-year scale-up plan are
attributed to a group of children that is assumed to enter the labor force at age 15 and exit the
labor force at age 59, which is equivalent to life expectancy at birth in Zambia. Benefits from both
stunting and lives saved are then multiplied by a lifetime discount factor (LDF) in order to obtain
the present value of benefits incurred during the expected years of productivity (years between
the age of entry into and exit from the workforce). The LDF is derived from three potential discount
rates (3 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent), an adjustment for age at the time of investment (for
simplicity, we assume an average age of two years for all children), and the years of lifetime
productivity expected. The LDF represents the years of productivity that are ‚Äúcounted‚Äù in the
calculation, discounted back to their present value in the year in which the investment in nutrition
is made. Because we assume an average age of two years for all beneficiaries, we use an LDF
that assumes that these children will enter the labor force 13 years from the time of investment.
Importantly, given the time frame considered under this analysis, we do not attempt to account
for projected growth in the country‚Äôs GDP and per capita incomes. This downward bias contributes
to the conservative nature of our estimates.

The following equations are used to estimate (1) the economic value of lives saved (reduced
mortality) and (2) increased future productivity (reduced morbidity):



      1. Present value of reduced mortality = (lives saved attributable to intervention scale-up)

13   It should be noted that because stunting is just one of many long-term consequences of poor nutrition,
         actual economic benefits of improving nutrition may be much higher than estimated here.
14   Hoddinott et al. (2011) provided direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life
       outcomes, which found that an individual stunted at age 36 months had, on average, 66 percent
       lower per capita consumption over his or her productive life.

             *(GNI per capita) * LDF

   2. Present value of reduced morbidity = (cases of child stunting averted)
          * (coefficient of a deficit) * (percent of income actually realized) * (GNI per capita)
          * (LDF)

where:

   ‚Ä¢     Lives saved attributable to the intervention scale-up are estimated using the LiST tool.
   ‚Ä¢     Cases of child stunting averted are calculated by subtracting the projected under-five
         stunting prevalence (%) after the interventions are scaled up calculated by LiST from the
         projected stunting prevalence under a scenario with no scale up and multiplying it by the
         total under-five population.
   ‚Ä¢     The coefficient of deficit is equal to the reduction in lifetime earnings attributable to
         stunting.
   ‚Ä¢     The lifetime discount factor (LDF) is used to discount future benefits to their value at the
         time of investment. It is derived from a discount rate, age at the time of investment and
         the estimated age of entry and exit into the workforce. The equation used to calculate the
         LDF is:



                             Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á
                                            1

                            Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=13



         where:

         LDF = the lifetime discount factor
            r = is the discount rate
            t = the time period since the initial investment in scaling up the interventions (we
            assume that children are 2 years old at the time of investment and enter the labor force
            at 15 years old, which is reflected in the starting value for t)
            T = the last time period before individuals exit the labor force (we assume individuals
            are out of the workforce at life expectancy at birth)


Note, the beginning time period t and ending period T is adjusted for each cohort based on the
year of investment. For example, the first cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period
t=13 and exit at time T, the second cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=14
and exit at time T+1, and so forth.

Finally, the annual addition to economic productivity is measured by taking the total economic
benefits for the year in which all beneficiaries of the initial one-year investment have reached
productive age. These benefits are not discounted back to their present value, as they are
considered the annual opportunity cost of not investing in scaling up nutrition interventions. It
should be noted that these benefits are derived from a progressive, five-year scale-up plan, and
therefore subsequent investments that maintain the target scale will increase the total annual
benefits as new beneficiaries are reached.

This paper builds on global experience and Uganda‚Äôs specific context to estimate costs, benefits, and cost-
effectiveness of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective
interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The paper considers both relevant ‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù
interventions, largely delivered through the health sector, and multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-sensitive‚Äù interventions,
delivered through other sectors such as agriculture, education, and water and sanitation. We estimate that the
costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all regions of Uganda would require a
yearly public investment of $68 million. The expected benefits are enormous: annually over 8,000 lives would
be saved, while at least 375,000 DALYs and 8,700 cases of stunting among children under five would be averted.
Economic productivity could potentially increase by $280 million annually over the productive lives of the
beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 18 percent. However, because it is unlikely that the
Government of Uganda or its partners will be able to find the $68 million necessary to reach full coverage, we
also consider scale-up scenarios based on considerations of their potential for impact, burden of stunting,
resource requirements, and implementation capacity. The most cost-effective scenario considered would
provide a subset of key interventions in regions with the highest rates of stunting and would cost between $19
and $60 million, depending on how many regions are covered. We then identify and cost five nutrition-sensitive
interventions relevant to Uganda for which there is both evidence of positive impact on nutrition outcomes and
some cost information. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate
list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition
in Uganda.

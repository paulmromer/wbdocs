EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      As the second largest African oil producer, Angola had unsustainable government
expenditures in effect until 2014 due to the drop in international oil prices. The Government
responded with a comprehensive reform program including the gradual elimination of most fuel
subsidies and an extension of the social protection program Cartão Kikuia.

2.      This report analyzes the impact of those reforms on poverty using micro-level simulations
based on the most recent household consumption survey IBEP (2008). First, household data is
projected to 2015 incorporating changes in population numbers as reported by the Population Census
2014. Second, the impact of the subsidy reforms is estimated by applying the price changes due to the
reform to household budgets. Third, the extension of the Cartão Kikuia program is simulated as a cash
transfer by adjusting budgets of targeted households with the non-cash benefit from Cartão Kikuia.


Fuel Subsidy Reform
3.      Better-off households consume the bulk of fuel products. The top 40 percent wealthiest
households are responsible for almost 90 percent of total expenditures on gasoline, diesel and LPG.
Even relative to household expenditures, wealthier households spend considerably more (5 percent) on
fuel products than poor households (less than 1 percent).

4.      The benefits of the fuel subsidies disproportionally accrue to the better-off households. The
direct impact of the subsidy reform is the reduction in household consumption due to higher prices for
fuel products. The indirect impact is caused by higher prices of other goods and services due to higher
production and operation costs resulted from higher fuel expenditures faced by producers and traders.
The simulation results indicate that the indirect impact is about twice as large as the direct impact. In
total, subsidies cover almost 7.5 percent of household expenditures for the top 20 percent of
households, twice as much as that for the bottom 20 percent. Hence, better-off households benefit
more from subsidies in both absolute and relative terms.

5.      Elimination of the subsidies increases the poverty head count rate by about 2 percentage
points. The fuel subsidy reform increases poverty from 26 to 28 percent. Urban households are
considerably more affected than rural households for two reasons. First, rural households consume less

fuel products. Second, rural households cover a larger share of household consumption by own
production. Therefore, higher fuel market prices can have beneficial effects on household consumption
as they allow selling self-produced goods at higher prices.


Social Protection Expansion
6.      The Government decided to expand the existing social protection program Cartão Kikuia to
tackle the adverse impacts of the fuel subsidy reform. The Cartão Kikuia program aims to provide a
non-cash transfer for the ‘purchase’ of food products, agricultural inputs and other basic goods. It is
focused on vulnerable families, especially headed by women. The program is implemented with the help
of a card that in theory allows each beneficiary to purchase essential goods worth 10,000 kwanzas 1 in
community commercial establishments – the Kikuia Stores - in the area where the beneficiary lives.
While the original design of the program intended for monthly payments of 10,000 Kwanza, the budget
forecast is only consistent with an annual payment of the same amount.

7.        Annual transfers below 60,000 Kwanza are not effective in reducing poverty. An annual
transfer of 10,000 Kwanza translates into 0.24 USD PPP 2011 per day per household. For a family of
three, this amount only provides 2 percent of consumption needed to meet the 1.90 USD PPP poverty
line. In contrast, an annual transfer of 60,000 Kwanza contributes one quarter of consumption to reach
the poverty line. With an average poverty gap of 30 percent among the poor, this amount is not
sufficient for all poor households. Accordingly, an annual transfer of 120,000 Kwa is more effective in
reducing poverty but also has larger budget implications.

in 2016 (or 954 million USD, an equivalence of 0.7 percent of GDP). This would also reduce the poverty
gap from 8.3 percent to 3.4 percent. This model calculation assumes a perfect targeting scheme. In
reality, targeting the poor is difficult and costly. The current targeting of Cartão Kikuia is based on a
combination of categorical eligibility criteria (rural female-headed households or taking care of at least
one disabled person) and community-based household assessment. The simulation results show that
the categorical eligibility criteria do not improve targeting compared to a random selection of
households. While an assessment of the community-based targeting component is difficult because of
data limitations, the observed demographic characteristics of current beneficiaries do give evidence of a
well-functioning targeting mechanism.

9.       Learning from other successful programs like Brazil’s Bolsa Familia can improve Cartão Kikuia
towards a more robust and efficient social protection program. Bolsa Familia has been shown to be an
effective program to alleviate poverty, increase school enrollment and improve health outcomes. It has
a transparent beneficiary selection, several monitoring mechanisms and speediness in the payment. In
contrast, Cartão Kikuia suffers from severe design and implementation challenges partially due to a lack
of resources. Most beneficiaries are not able to use the full value of 10,000 Kwanzas available on the
card for a number of reasons. First, the current number of available stores is limited with most of them
available only in Luanda. Secondly, supply of products in the existing stores is reported to be low. Lastly,
technical problems in the stores sometimes cause failures in card recognition.

10.      Bolsa Familia transfers are in cash, not in kind. The Bolsa familia beneficiary can choose how to
spend the money according to their preferences and availability of local goods. The conditionalities
regarding education ensure an intergenerational transfer to reduce future poverty. Thus, the program
has a paternalistic design feature paired with a theory of interdependent preferences. In contrast, the
Cartão Kikuia program is designed based on controlling the quality and supply of provisions reducing the
freedom of choice for beneficiaries. In-kind transfers require a more complex infrastructure with close
involvement of the government in the implementation of the program. One advantage of cash transfers
is that the government does not need to get involved in the supply side of local markets. Instead, it can
focus its administrative efforts on reaching the poorest population.

11.      A more transparent targeting and its assessment would further improve Cartão Kikuia. Bolsa
Familia is well known for its clear and transparent information management feeding into the targeting.
Anyone can access the number and locations of beneficiaries and the amount spent. The selection
criteria are clear and largely communicated to the whole country through social media and
municipalities’ transmissions efforts. This is in stark contrast with the opaque design and
implementation of Cartão Kikuia, from the application of eligibility criteria to the transfer amounts and
the utilization of the transfers. Without reliable data and the knowledge of the targeted population, the
capacity of independent parties to evaluate the program and to recommend relevant changes remains
extremely limited. The upcoming household survey will be an opportunity to start collecting data for an
evaluation of Cartão Kikuia that would allow comparing beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries.

1 Introduction: The Need for Reforms

1.      Angola, as the second largest African oil producer, was hit hard by the oil price crisis triggering
fuel subsidy reforms. After its independence in 1975, the country fell into a civil conflict that lasted 27
years and ended with a peace accord in 2002. Since then, Angola became a major oil producer with
heavy fiscal reliance on oil revenues. The ongoing oil price crisis that started in 2014/5 depleted
government revenues and, thus, threatened its fiscal balance. The Government responded with a
comprehensive reform program including the reduction/elimination of fuel subsidies and an extension
of the social protection program Cartão Kikuia. This report analyzes the impact of the fuel subsidy
reforms on poverty. In addition, the extension of the social protection program as a compensatory
program is assessed with a focus on its targeting. Both analyses are based on simulations to provide
quantitative evidence. The appendix includes a detailed methodological description.


1.1     The Reform Context
2.        Angola suffers from very high rural poverty. Despite being an upper middle income country,
about 30 percent of the Angolan population was below the international poverty line in 2008. 2 In rural
areas, one in two people are living below the poverty line. Poverty of female-headed households is
about 6 percentage points lower than for male-headed households in 2008. Poverty is projected to drop
slightly in 2015 driven by a small reduction of rural poverty from 50 percent to 46 percent. The change
in poverty also reduces the gap between female-headed and male-headed households to about 2
percentage points in 2015 (Figure 1). The inequality indicator suggests a decline over time from a Gini
index of 52 in 2000 to an index of 43 in 2008. Between 2008 and 2015, the Gini coefficient only
marginally declined to 42. 3

3.       Although poverty is lower than on average in Sub Saharan Africa, literacy is only marginally
above average while infant mortality is worse than average. In 2013, Angola had a youth literacy of 73
percent compared to 71 percent in Sub Saharan Africa (in 2010). Thus, the lower poverty rate in Angola
does not translate into higher literacy. Even worse for health, Angola’s infant mortality rate of 96 per
thousand live births in 2015 is almost double the rate of 56 in Sub Saharan Africa even though poverty is
significantly lower in Angola.

based on the Population and Housing Census 2014 affects inequality.

4.     In 2014, the first Population Census since independence found a population of 25.8 million.
The population is not evenly spread over the 18 provinces, with almost one third (27 percent) living in
Luanda province. Another third of the population (37 percent) lives in rural areas (Figure 3).

5.     Forty-four percent of the population is engaged in agriculture or livestock. Around 4 percent of
the population work in the construction sector, 3 percent in the transport, 2 percent in education, 2
percent in industry and around 24 percent in others activities (Figure 4).

(Figure 5). Consequently, a fuel subsidy reform affects the population well-being since they are
dependent on the fuel market also for access to primary needs, such as electricity and transportation.

7.       Oil exports in the last 10 years accounted on average for 95 percent of Angolan exports,
generating $60.2 billion in revenues in 2014 (Figure 6). The sector is highly concentrated in terms of
trading partners with China importing nearly half of Angola’s exports (Figure 7). Diamonds are the
second largest export product in Angola. Diamond production grew swiftly until 2006, when production
volume reached 9.2 million carats. Since then, production has fluctuated between 8.2 and 9.2 million
carats. In 2015, it grew by 4 percent to 9 million carats. The country has still high potential to expand
mining since only 40 percent of the Angolan mining resources are known. Diamond exploration is being
conducted in 13 provinces and 108 new projects are available for private investors. 5

1.2     The Need for Reform
9.      Recent growth in Angola was driven by the end of the conflict and high oil prices. The Angolan
economy posted an average growth rate of 17.3 percent between 2004 and 2008. This period of high
growth rates was briefly interrupted by the 2008/9 crisis that brought oil prices down. From 2009 to
2011, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at 3.3 percent on average. Economic growth resumed its fast
pace in 2012 and 2013 with an average annual growth rate of 6 percent (Figure 10).

10.      Over the past years, the Angolan economy has shown signs of slowing down (4.8 percent in
2014; 3 percent in 2015; and 2.5 percent estimated for 2016), mostly as a result of the drop in oil
prices. The decline in international crude oil price has had a substantial impact on budget balances. The
average price for Angolan crude was $108 in 2013, declining to $96 in 2014. Prices continued to drop in
2015, which led to a revision of the Angolan Budget Law for the 2015 fiscal year. In 2015, the average oil
price was at $52, a decline of approximately 48 percent in 12 months. Prices dropped even further in
early 2016, averaging $36 in the first five months of the year. Angolan oil production has fluctuated
around 586 and 605 million bps/year from 2014 to 2016. The revenue in 2014 was $56,364 million, a
decrease of 14 percent from 2013 (Figure 11).

11.      The drop in oil prices in 2014 reduced Angola’s economic growth and halved fiscal revenues.
GDP growth for 2014 and 2015 was estimated by the government at 4.8 and 4 percent respectively. As
opposed to the 2008/9 episode, this time the impact has been stronger and longer lasting as the drop in
oil prices appear to be due to a structural shift in the oil sector led by the increasing role of
unconventional oil in the global supply mix. Oil prices are expected to remain low for a prolonged period
of time.

12.     The drop in oil prices increased prices of imports and accelerated inflation. With a reduction of
foreign exchange revenues, the exchange rate depreciated making imports more expensive. This
triggered a relapse to high inflation after Angola managed to limit price increases between 2011 and
2013. As a result, considering the whole period from 2006, prices increased by 184 percent (Figure 9).
From 2010 to 2014, goods and services, hotels and restaurants as well as furniture and domestic
maintenance contributed most to price increases.

13.      High oil revenues created an oil-dependent economy with oil revenues used for current and
capital expenditures, including price subsidies for fuel and utilities. Historically oil revenues accounted
for three quarters of government revenues on average. The economy is not diversified with oil
exploitation and refinery accounting for 90 percent of the industrial production while most consumer
goods are imported. The period of high oil prices allowed Angola to increase current and capital
expenditures while maintaining a balanced budget and low debt levels. Fuel and utility prices as well as
public transportation were heavily subsidized with the Government paying the difference between the
effective price and the administered market price. According to Fabrizio et al. (2015), transportation
sector is the most fuel-intensive sector of Angola, so its costs are especially sensitive to subsidies.

14.     Before the subsidy reform in September 2014, the level of subsidies was high. On average,
subsidies accounted for 63 percent of the real prices and varied substantially across products from 100
percent for diesel for electricity to 29 percent for Heavy Fuel (Figure 13). 6 Fuel prices in Angola were
among the lowest in the world (Figure 12). The prices of gasoline and diesel were around 58 percent
below the average prices for sub-Saharan Africa, respectively (Figure 12). The cost of fuel price subsidies
is estimated using the price gap approach. 7

 All diesel specifically consumed for electricity production is fully subsidized by the government.

15.    Besides their negative impact on fiscal balances, fuel subsidies are very costly for the economy
and create adverse incentives. Firstly, fuel subsidies crowd out growth-enhancing spending. The
Government of Angola spent in fuel subsidies the same as in education and 42 percent more than in

health (Figure 14). Secondly, fuel subsidies create incentives for smuggling. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that smuggling of subsidized products to neighboring countries, in particular the Republic of Congo and
the Democratic Republic of Congo, amounted to 10 percent of total fuel consumption. In 2013, customs
detected about 80 million liters of smuggled fuel products, which corresponds to about 2 percent of
total consumption. Lastly, fuel subsidies create incentives to over-consume, with negative effects on
traffic congestion and losses in productivity. Also, over-consumption can aggravate local pollution and
climate change.

16.     With the elimination of fuel subsidies, the Government of Angola creates fiscal space to
increase the allocation of public resources to social protection programs to alleviate poverty in the
country. The main social protection program in Angola, the Cartão Kikuia program, was launched in
2013 with approximately 60,000 beneficiaries in six provinces by the end of 2015. The second part of
this report will investigate the possible impact of an extension of the Cartão Kikuia program in terms of
beneficiaries and size of transfers on poverty.

2 Fuel Subsidy Reforms

17.      The poverty impact of fuel subsidy reforms is estimated by a micro-data simulation. This
section of the report motivates and describes the reforms and their channels of impact on poverty. A
simulation quantifies the impact by estimating the increase in prices of subsidized products due to the
reduction in the subsidy. Thus, the simulation offers a theoretical assessment of the expected change in
poverty by the subsidy reforms. The simulation does not take into account other factors influencing
prices, e.g. the depreciation of the exchange rate.


2.1             Description of Reforms
18.      Required fiscal adjustments include cuts of fuel subsidies. With the considerable reduction of
fiscal revenues due to the drop in oil prices (Figure 15), large cuts had to be made to the budget. Public
investment was reduced to its lowest levels in years and purchases of goods and services were severely
restricted to the point of generating some arrears. Fuel subsidies had to bear their share of the
adjustment. Subsidies are calculated as the difference between the production and marketing costs and
the price at the pump.

19.      Government implemented successively reductions and elimination of fuel price subsidies. The
fuel prices increased in September 2014, December 2014, April 2015, and December 2015 following the
decline in international oil prices and consequently in oil revenues (Table 1). All fuel subsidies except for
LPG and lightning oil were eliminated by December 2015. Subsidies to electric and water tariffs were
also reduced during the reform. In the end of 2015, the electric and water tariffs (unchanged for years)
increased to reduce the price subsidies and to account for the predicted expansion in the population

coverage. 8 These reforms helped to reduce budgetary expenses on price subsidies (Figure 16). Thus, the
price adjustments and the time frame outperformed the IMF recommendations from November 2014.

20.     The Government had to create and increase other taxes to proceed towards a more balanced
budget. In 2015, the Government introduced a new tax that applies to international payments for
foreign services, increased the consumer tax on fuels (that was 0 percent before) and on several other
goods (e.g. bottled water and cars). Moreover, in 2016, a banking operations tax was introduced
charging 0.1 percent of all banking transactions.

2.2      Poverty Impact
21.    Comparatively better-off households consume the bulk of fuel products. In 2015, almost 90
percent of expenditures for gasoline, diesel and LPG were made by the top 40 percent wealthiest

8The operation of water and energy companies involves intensive use of generators. Thus, the reform in fuel subsidies also rose the costs of
these companies.

households. The bottom 40 percent contributed less than ten percent to the overall spending on those
fuel products (Figure 16). 9 Clearly, fuel subsidies are regressive, since rich households consume more
fuel than the poor. Fuel products account for only a very small share (0.5 percent) of household
expenditures for poor households while wealthier households spend up to almost 5 percent on fuel
products (Figure 17). International experience shows that lower-income households may be protected
from fuel price increases by expansion of targeted social spending programs, as was the case in Gabon,
Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Mozambique. 10

22.     The indirect impact of the subsidy reform is about twice as large as the direct impact. The fuel
subsidy reform has a direct impact on fuel prices affecting household budgets. 11 In addition, the increase
in fuel prices affects production and transportation costs of other goods and consequently indirectly
increases prices of those goods as well. 12 The direct impact of the fuel subsidy reform mainly affects
wealthier households (up to 2.5 percent of household consumption) but only marginally affects the poor
(below 1 percent). The indirect impact reduces household consumption by an additional 5 and 3
percentage points for wealthier and poor households, respectively (Figure 19).

    Transportation accounts for 85 percent of indirect impacts (equivalent to a 1.9 percent decrease in household income). It heavily affects
costs of public transportation and, consequently, poor households’ budget. (Fabrizio et al., 2015)
12 Note that the public transportation is price-regulated in Angola. The simulation assumes transmission of price increases to transportation

costs.

23.     The benefits of the fuel subsidies disproportionally accrue to the better-off households. The
top 20 percent of households received almost 7.5 percent of household expenditures in subsidies. In
contrast, the bottom 20 percent only gained 3.5 percent of household expenditures. Given the larger
consumption of wealthier households, the subsidies disadvantaged poor households in relative terms.
Hence, elimination of the subsidies and replacement with an extension of a social protection program
can improve targeting the poor.

24.     Rural households are less affected by the reforms. Rural households only lose about 4.5
percent of household consumption while urban households are more dependent on markets and prices
and, thus, lose on average almost 9 percent of consumption. The main categories contributing to the
loss in welfare are food and non-alcoholic beverages as well as housing, water, electricity, fuels and
transportation (Figure 20).

25.    Elimination of the subsidies only marginally increases the poverty head count rate by 2
percentage points from 26 to 28 percent. The main impact is due to the indirect effect. Urban
households are considerably more affected than rural households for two reasons. First, rural
households consume less fuel products. Second, rural households cover a larger share of household
consumption by own production. Therefore, higher market prices are beneficial as they allow selling

subsidy reform than male-households but the total impact is considerably higher on male-headed
households (Figure 20). The poverty gap increases slightly for all type of households (Figure 22).

3 Extension of Cartão Kikuia
26.     Social protection programs can be an effective way to mitigate impacts of fuel subsidy reforms
on vulnerable households. The Government expanded the Cartão Kikuia program with the objective to
mitigate adverse effects of the fuel subsidy reform on the poor. This section provides a brief description
of the program, simulates the impact of the extension on poverty, looks into more detail in targeting
mechanisms with a focus on social accountability before making recommendations for improvement.

27.     The goals of the Cartão Kikuia program are to reduce poverty, increase nutrition among the
poor and also to increase the agricultural production among beneficiaries. As part of the federal
Angolan “Combate a Probreza” program, the Cartão Kikuia Program was started in 2013 and then
expanded to counter the adverse effect of the subsidy reform. 14 As the Government’s main social
protection program, it has been gradually expanded in both the geographical coverage – from 1 to 9
provinces - and the number of beneficiaries – from 51,000 to 90,000 in 2016 (Table 2). 15 However, the
program is far from reaching its initially targeted coverage of 200,000 beneficiaries.

28.      The program intends to target the most vulnerable parts of the population. It is mainly focused
on families living under extreme poverty and vulnerability, mostly headed by women in rural areas. It
prioritizes widows with orphans or handicapped family members, people with chronic diseases, and
former combatants. These eligibility criteria are interpreted and implemented in collaboration with local
chiefs, who determine the vulnerability of households.

29.     The Cartão Kikuia program aims to provide a non-cash transfers for the purchases of food
products, agricultural inputs and other basic goods. The program is implemented with the help of a
card that theoretically allows each beneficiary to purchase essential goods worth 10,000 Kwanzas in
community commercial establishments in the area where they live. In addition to the basic food
products, the card also includes purchases of school supplies and agricultural tools. The card is renewed
annually. The original design of the program included a professional skills component that is currently
not implemented.

30.     The Government budget for 2016 includes annual payments of 10,000 Kwanza to 90,000
beneficiaries. While the original design of the program intended for monthly payments of 10,000
Kwanza, the budget forecast is only consistent with an annual payment of the same amount (Table 2). In
addition, the benefit amount was not adjusted for inflation since 2014 despite high inflation of 40
percent from January 2014 to April 2016. In 2016, the government reduced the amount to 5,000

   The program has different initiatives such as the construction of 100 houses in the rural areas – aldeia kikuia. Selected villages are supposed
to receive health centers, childcare, schools, and stores.
15 Numbers of beneficiaries were calculated given the approximate value of annual expenditure estimated for each year and the expected value

of annual transfers: 10,000 Kwanzas.

Kwanza. However, it should be noted that only about 40,000 out of about 90,000 beneficiaries received
any benefits in the form of a voucher to purchase goods in pre-assigned stores. 16

31.     The program as well as its expansion faces severe implementation constraints due to weak
implementation capacity and a lack of resources. Access to retrieve the benefits from the program
appears difficult. Benefit access necessitates a store featuring products that can be ‘purchased’ with the
voucher card. Kikuia Stores can be run by the Government or by private investors associated with the
program. 17 Most beneficiaries are not able to use the full value of 10,000 Kwanzas available on the card
for a number of reasons. First, the current number of available stores is limited with most stores
available only in Luanda. Second, supply of products in the existing stores is reported to be low. Third,
technical problems in the stores sometimes cause failures in card recognition including due to lack of
funds.




16 Note that the simulation does not take into consideration those implementation constraints but estimates the impact on poverty if the

defined transfer is paid in full to all defined beneficiaries.
17 Intentionally, the government aims to incentivize that the store owner and workers are people from the communities, fomenting local jobs

especially for the youth.

3.1      Poverty Impact
32.     Different targeting scenarios for the expansion of the social protection program are
compared. The expansions of the social protection program Cartão Kikuia to 50,000, to 101,000 and to
140,000 beneficiaries are modeled using different annual transfer amounts and different targeting
scenarios. For the estimation of the poverty impact, the simulation simplifies by assuming cash transfers
instead of the non-cash transfer of Cartão Kikuia. 18 The simulation considers annual cash transfers in the
amounts of 5,000 Kwanza, 10,000 Kwanza, 60,000 Kwanza (or 5,000 Kwanza monthly) and 120,000
Kwanzas (or 10,000 Kwanza monthly). The amounts range from 0.12 USD PPP 2011 to 2.87 USD PPP
2011 per day per household. The following targeting scenarios are modeled:

     •      Random: This baseline scenario randomly selects new households to be integrated in the
            program without applying any eligibility or other targeting criteria. This scenario shows the
            impact of the expansion if the implemented targeting scheme fails. 19

            determined by being rural and female-headed or with at least one disabled person living in the
            household. This scenario helps to assess the benefits from using the defined eligibility criteria
            but without any additional consideration of vulnerability. This scenario covers a ‘blind’
            application of the eligibility criteria.
     •      Eligibility + Geographic: This scenario is similar to the ‘Eligibility’ scenario but restricted to the
            eight provinces that currently implement the program. This scenario adds the importance of
            choosing specific provinces for the expansion of the program.
     •      Beneficiary Distribution: This scenario utilizes the demographic distribution of current
            beneficiaries (according to sex, age and location of household head) to select new beneficiaries
            according to the same distribution. This scenario aims to reflect the current implementation of
            the targeting as good as possible given data limitations. In reality, beneficiaries are filtered
            based on eligibility criteria but further selected idiosyncratically by chiefs. This additional
            selection step can be mimicked to a certain extent by drawing according to the observed
            parameter distributions.
     •      Poverty: In this scenario, only poor households are selected into the program. This optimal
            scenario provides the best-case if the program is targeted perfectly. 20




18 The simplification allows the quantification of the poverty impact but it is not an exact estimate because prices in the shops supplying
products can be higher or lower than market prices indirectly increasing respectively decreasing the value of the transfer.
19 A worst-case scenario that the targeting scheme favors non-poor households is not simulated.
20 Note that this scenario will only target the poor independent of their poverty depth. Thus, even this targeting scheme can turn out to be not

effective especially if the purchasing power of the cash transfer is deteriorated so that beneficiary households are not lifted out of poverty
anymore.

33.      The poverty impact of Cartão Kikuia is extremely low especially for an annual transfer of
10,000 Kwanza or less. It is not surprising that a transfer of an annual amount of 10,000 Kwanza is not
sufficient to reduce poverty. The amount translates to about 0.24 USD PPP 2011 per day per household.
With an applied poverty line of 1.90 USD PPP 2011 per person, this transfer is only effective in lifting
small households close to the poverty line out of poverty. For a household with three members, this
amount only provides 2 percent of the poverty line (Figure 21).

34.     Annual transfers of 60,000 or 120,000 Kwanza can be effective in reducing poverty but must
be rolled out in large scale. An annual transfer of 60,000 or 120,000 Kwanza provides one quarter or
one half, respectively, of the poverty line necessary to lift a three-member household out of poverty.
The average poverty gap among the poor is 30 percent of the poverty line. Hence, many households
need at least a transfer of 120,000 Kwanzas to move them out of poverty.

35.      An annual transfer of 120,000 Kwanza to all 1.3 million poor households can reduce poverty
from 28 to 15 percent. The transfer would cost 954 million USD (0.7 percent of GDP), which is about half
of the estimated annual budgetary expenditures on price subsidies in 2016. This would also reduce the
poverty gap from 8.3 percent to 3.4 percent. This model calculation assumes a perfect targeting scheme.
In reality, targeting the poor is not easy and, thus, costly.

36.      Random selection of beneficiaries performs as well as targeting only eligible beneficiaries
(with or without geographic focus). Random selection of beneficiaries results in an average inclusion
error of about 72 percent given a poverty head count rate of 28 percent in 2015. Applying the eligibility
criteria of rural female-headed households or taking care of at least one disabled person in the
household does not improve targeting the poor. While rural households have a larger poverty head

count rate, female-headed households have a lower poverty head count rate than male-headed
households. Therefore, the targeting scheme does not seem to perform better than a random selection.

37.      The demographic characteristics of the current beneficiary distribution do not confirm a well-
functioning targeting mechanism. If new beneficiaries were selected according to the observed
beneficiary characteristics (with respect to sex, age and location), the poor would be targeted less often
than randomly selecting beneficiaries. While this implies that the current targeting, according to the
observed characteristics, is sub-optimal, it is also possible that unobserved characteristics (education,
health, etc.) indeed select the poor. Thus, the given evidence cannot be used to assess the
implementation of the current targeting program. The next section discusses in more detail how in
reality targeting mechanisms can be designed.


3.2        Targeting Mechanisms
38.     Finding and attending to the poorest share of the population is fundamental for efficient use
of public resources. Before delving into targeting mechanisms, the objective of targeting also needs to
be discussed. While targeting the poor will reduce monetary poverty most effectively, it can exclude
other vulnerable groups suffering from non-monetary poverty. Thus, a first discussion about targeting
must touch on the multi-dimensionality of poverty and specific vulnerable groups in the given country
context. It should also be noted that targeting the poor could come at a political cost as it implies a
transfer or redistribution from one group of the population to another. A good targeting scheme can be
expensive to implement. For example, obtaining detailed information to identify the poor has
administrative cost implications. Also, some forms of targeting can have social costs for the
beneficiaries, such as stigmatization. 21

39.      In order to select the poor into a program, targeting mechanism should avoid two main
problems: inclusion and exclusion errors. Depending on the type of information used to find the poor,
the program can suffer from under-coverage. Under-coverage or exclusion error means that poor
eligible households are not included in the program. Minimizing under-coverage comes at the cost of
including non-poor into the program, the so-called inclusion error. The inclusion error makes a program
expensive and inefficient. For example, a sub-optimal targeting scheme with an inclusion error of 40
percent would increase the costs to eradicate poverty in Angola from 436 million USD to 610 million
USD.

40.     The upcoming household survey IDREA presents an opportunity to improve targeting of the
poor for Cartão Kikuia. The program could increase the allocated amount of resources and/or develop a
more efficient targeting mechanism in order to reduce exclusion and inclusion errors (Figure 22). The
simulated demographic targeting design does not perform better than a random allocation of benefits.
In general, there are three main groups of targeting mechanisms: household assessments, categorical
targeting and self-targeting.

21   See Coady et al, 2004 for a detailed description of the costs in each targeting method.




                                                                          25
                                                                                       Angola: PSIA for Subsidy and Social Protection Reform




41.     Household assessments comprise of explicit targeting mechanisms that gather information on
each household to decide whether the applicant is eligible. It covers the popular (verified and simple)
means tests, the proxy mean tests and the community based targeting. Mostly, it requires an extensive
administrative structure to assess and process the information that will define households’ eligibility.
The current implementation of Cartão Kikuia relies on household assessments.

42.     Verified means tests compare collected information with independent sources such as
property tax records. A usual problem is that it requires the information to exist in the first place, which
is not common in developing countries partly due to informality. Simple means tests have no
independent verification of income. Sometimes, social workers are requested to verify qualitatively
households’ eligibility. The higher the quality of the information on income collected, the more
successful this mechanism can be.

43.     Proxy means tests are increasingly popular. Based on statistical analyses, each household
receives a score that is generated by taking into account the ownership of durable goods, demographic
composition of the household, and the education and occupation of adult members. 22 The information
can sometimes be verified by home visits. Besides the administrative structure to collect the data, this
method requires specialists to process the data and perform the calculation of the scorecard. In Latin
America, for example, most of the conditional cash transfer programs rely on proxy means tests – with
the exception of Bolsa Familia in Brazil.

44.      In community based targeting, people from the communities or local leaders are the ones to
define who should benefit from the program. It is based on the idea that community members can
access more accurate information on the conditions of households, taking into account local specificities
that influence the level of households’ vulnerability. The Cartão Kikiua program has a strong community-
based component with the village chiefs determining which households are eligible.

45.      In categorical targeting, all people from determined groups (age, gender, location, level of
education) are eligible. This method is explicit and straightforward since categories are mostly easy to
verify. Categories are chosen based on their correlation with poverty, as the use of the map of poverty
to define eligible locations or to define geographical quotas. Often, more than one category is combined
to define the targeted groups. In Cartão Kikuia, gender and location are part of the categorical targeting,
which is combined with the community-based component.

46.       Targeting can also be done implicitly through self-selection. This mechanism allows universal
eligibility but incentives are designed in a way that will self-select the poorest citizens into the program
while keeping the non-poor out of it. It can be achieved by increasing the subscription costs in terms of


22 The mechanism to calculate the score depends on the country. Often, a simple score card is developed that allows summing up scores with a

threshold indicating whether the household is eligible.




                                                                    26

registration time or, in the case of in-kind transfer, offering low quality products that are not attractive
to the non-poor.

47.     Overall, it is useful to design a targeting mechanism that combines various methods of
targeting in an effective and cost-efficient way. For Angola, a random targeting scheme will result in a
large inclusion error while a perfect targeting scheme can be three times more effective (Figure 21). In
international comparison of implemented programs, a study shows that targeting increases the
resources to the targeted groups on average by 25 percent compared to a random allocation of
resources. 23 The actual difference between targeting and random selection depends on the poverty
headcount of the country and the design as well as implementation of the targeting scheme. However,
badly designed or poorly implemented targeting mechanisms may not be any more effective than a
random selection or even divert transfers from the poor. Among the 81 programs evaluated in the
study, 21 programs turned out to be regressive, which means random selection would have better
allocated resources to the poor. 24 An effective combination of targeting mechanisms could include
geographic targeting (based on current poverty maps), a household selection instrument (based on a
proxy means test) and community validation or pre-selection.

48.      Targeting can be improved by incorporating monitoring mechanisms and quotas into the
design. Bolsa Familia in Brazil is an often cited example for a successfully designed and implemented
social protection program. It is based on a registry database CadÚnico. Randomly selecting families from
the database – without using any of its information, not even income - would guarantee a 55 percent
targeting level, while using information on income only increases this number to 57 percent. However,
complementary measures, e.g. geographical quotas and the quality of local mechanisms that include
and monitor the poor population in the registry database (CadÚnico), can improve targeting. Those
factors have been shown to be the main explanatory components for the high targeting level of the
program in Brazil. 25 In the wider context, these mechanisms fall under social accountability and are
discussed – given their importance – in more detail below.


3.3     Social Accountability
49.      Targeting mechanisms should be complemented by an effective social accountability
mechanism. In developing countries, collective efforts to hold governments accountable for their social
commitments are extremely important for the development of equitable societies. Social accountability
relates to initiatives that engage states and citizens to ensure high quality service delivery. Likewise, it
seeks that targeted populations, especially the poorest, are included among the beneficiaries of social
programs.

50.     Political participation can strengthen the link among the main actors providing the services,
beneficiaries and policymakers. It requires the existence of mechanisms that allow citizens to gather
information and build an evaluation of the quality of the service, as well as provide ways to give voice
the poor and disadvantaged populations to reach the policy makers and/or the providers. Political
participation in Angola is strong.

51.     Throughout the cycle of cash transfer programs, control and accountability processes are
required to minimize and manage risks, guaranteeing its effectiveness and sustainability. Transparent
information on the targeting mechanism, recertification and community councils are helpful ways to
verify whether the poorest people are receiving most of the resources. Having a monitoring system can
improve the capacity to verify the compliance with conditionalities.

52.       Grievance and complaint mechanisms as well as transparency of information are important to
increase the voice of poor people, but it is certainly not enough. It is crucial that citizens, and even
more important the beneficiaries, have direct channels to influence the service providers – along with
the freedom to do so. At local levels, governments need to ensure that beneficiaries and social
organizations have the means to organize themselves and communicate their monitoring results to
official authorities.

53.     In the case of a heterogeneous public, decentralized decisions can induce better results. The
goals of the program, the heterogeneity of the targeted population, and the profile of the government
(pro-poor or clientelist) and of the providers are important pieces of information to design an adequate
mechanism for social accountability. 26


3.4        Recommendations for Cartão Kikuia
54.     The Cartão Kikuia program and Brazil’s Bolsa Familia share most of their goals but rely on very
different methods. Bolsa Familia has shown to be an effective program to alleviate poverty and increase
school enrollment and health outcomes. It has a clear and transparent beneficiary selection, several
monitoring mechanisms and speediness in the payment. 27 Bolsa Familia can be a good benchmark for
the Angolan government to observe in order to improve its own mechanisms to reduce poverty.

55.      Bolsa Familia originated from a unification of all federal cash transfer programs. Different
programs with redundant or inconsistent targeting mechanisms can consume scarce resources and
capacity. Bolsa Familia started by combining all existing social protection efforts that were based on cash
transfers. A first start for Angola is the unification of a registry as already planned before programs are
unified.

56.     Targeting of Bolsa Familia has shown to be successful while an evaluation of Cartão Kikuia is
not available. The analysis in this report could not provide evidence on how well the Cartão Kikuia
program is targeted to reduce poverty. An independent evaluation could shed light on its effectiveness
and efficiency. The upcoming household survey will be an opportunity to start collecting data for an
evaluation that would allow comparing beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries.

57.      One main difference between Cartão Kikuia and Bolsa Familia is that Bolsa Familia transfers
are in cash, not in kind. The Bolsa familia beneficiaries can choose how to spend their money according
to their preferences and availability of local goods. The conditionalities regarding education ensures an
intergenerational transfer to reduce future poverty. Thus, the program has a paternalistic design feature
paired with a theory of interdependent preferences. 28 In contrast, the Cartão Kikuia program is based on
controlling the quality and supply of provisions, reducing the freedom of choice of the beneficiaries. In
countries like Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Zambia cash transfers to
vulnerable households proved to be an efficient tool for poverty alleviation. 29,30

58.     In-kind transfers require a more complex infrastructure that increases the demand for
Government administration and centralization. The Cartão Kikuia program is designed with the
Government playing the dominant role in its implementation. In the current context, it is questionable
whether the Government has the capacity to implement the program efficiently. The reported
shortcomings as discussed suggest that the current capacity is insufficient. The clear advantage of cash
transfers is that the Government does not need to get involved in the supply side of local markets.
Instead, it can focus its administrative efforts on reaching the poorest population.

59.      Another critical difference is the clear and transparent information management of Bolsa
Familia. Anyone can access the number and locations of the beneficiaries and the amount spent. The
criteria selection is clear and largely communicated to the whole country through social media and
municipalities’ transmissions efforts. This is in stark contrast with the opaque design and
implementation of Cartão Kikuia, including its targeting, the transfer amounts and the utilization of the
transfers. Without reliable data and the knowledge of the targeted population, the capacity of the third
parties to evaluate the program and recommend relevant changes remains extremely limited.

60.    An M&E framework would help to track the expansion of the program and create more
accountability. With the identification of the program main mechanisms and monitoring its inputs,
outputs and outcomes can increase transparency and foster accountability of the program. The M&E
framework should monitor the main inputs under the program’s control as well as external factors to
which the program is sensitive. Also the characteristics of the beneficiaries should be added to the M&E
framework and measured against a defined target (Table 3).

4 Conclusion

61.      Given Angola’s exposure, fiscal adjustments are necessary with the plunge in oil prices. The
massive loss of revenues means that the Government must exercise strong fiscal discipline. Replacing
subsidy programs with better-targeted social protection programs can create better value/protection
for less money. A good understanding of the impacts of subsidies and the distribution of their benefits is
essential to inform mitigation measures. Furthermore, an assessment of targeting mechanisms for social
protection programs helps to ensure that freed up resources are put to better use in protecting the poor
and vulnerable.

62.     The fuel subsidies in Angola only marginally affected the poor as most benefits accrued to
better-off households. Those better-off households consumed the bulk of fuels in absolute and relative
terms. Therefore, re-allocation of those resources towards a better-targeted social protection program
is useful, especially in the current context of fiscal constraints that demand efficient use of resources
while protecting the poor and vulnerable.

63.     The expansion of the Cartão Kikuia program should be accompanied by reforms of the
program to ensure effective targeting and efficient use of resources. The current program
implementation has eligibility criteria that do not improve targeting beyond random selection. A better
targeting design with transparent and clear rules would improve the program. Furthermore, the
program suffers from supply constraints to access benefits, e.g. stores are empty or not available. In-
kind programs are traditionally more difficult to implement and require larger government capacity.
Hence, re-designing the program based on direct cash transfers could help overcoming the severe
implementation challenges.

64.     The fuel subsidy reform could be used to motivate a reform of the public transportation
system. Current prices for public transportation are very different from market values (Box 1). The bus
service price is officially set at 30 Kwanza since 2005. The price is disconnected from costs and, thus, it
leads to under-provision of the service. An adjustment of prices would make public transportation
companies less dependent on government transfers, allowing them to spend the extra resources in
system maintenance and expansion. Furthermore, higher prices would encourage the expansion of
service provision reducing the current rationing of the service.

                                                  Box 1: Public Transportation Subsidy Reform

The fuel subsidy reform also affected Angola’s inefficient public transportation system. Angola's
public transport system is a strongly price-regulated system, which leads to an inefficient, low quality
and low service provision along with the emergence of illegal public transportation providers. The
inefficient, low quality and insufficient provision of public transportation is explained by low prices
that are fixed by the Government. The Government also compensates eventual operational losses of
service providers. Thus, the current state of the public transportation system is not surprising. The
fuel reform further pressured transportation costs and discouraged public transport provision.

A reform could include the introduction of a transportation card to be used as an alternative way of
payment and allow subsidies for the poor. The card could be credited with value to use for access to
buses, trains or regularized collective taxis. Targeted populations could receive a monthly credit on
this card. Thus, ideally the same card as Cartão Kikuia should be used to avoid the emergence of
multiple parallel social protection systems. The transportation card would also provide greater
revenue control by the provider and give flexibility in offering discounts or premiums to influence
traffic, e.g. in rush hours.

Non-basic modes of transportation like taxis should have non-subsidized market prices for their
service. Currently, taxis are an alternative transport service in the country with regulated prices by
the government. As soon as a basic public transportation mode is provided to the poor and vulnerable
population, other forms of public transportation can be priced at market rates. This would increase
supply of the service as well as competition ultimately leading to higher quality and prices close to
costs.

Eligibility rules for the transportation card should be clear, publicly available and utilize biometric
identification. A well-designed targeting mechanism should be used to create eligibility rules for the
transportation card – ideally jointly with a reformed Cartão Kikuia program and as part of the Social
Registry that the Government is in the process of building. The rules should be clear and publicly
available to create social accountability. Beneficiary registration should involve biometric
technology. 31 Angola suffers from multiple identity problems, e.g. there are individuals who possess
more than one identity document. This is due to the decentralized way in which birth certificates are
emitted and the fact that many records were destroyed during the civil war.

Partnerships with banks for transportation card operation and credit supply could create a more
robust system. Usage of the available ATM system can mitigate scale-up constraints on program
expansion in urban areas. In addition, transfers can be carried out in partnership with these
institutions.

The transportation card would help to reduce illegal transportation services. Beneficiaries of the
transportation card will be incentivized to use legal transportation services. To ensure a smooth
transition, a process should be created to formalize currently illegal transportation services.




31   This strategy has been implemented for public civil servants relisting and saved 3 billion Kwanzas.

6.1     Methodology
66.    Micro-level simulation is used to estimate quantitative impacts of the subsidy reforms on
poverty. The simulation uses household consumption data from the household consumption survey
IBEP 2009. Household consumption is propagated to 2015 based on real GDP per capita growth
using a distribution neutral pass-through of 0.5. Population growth is incorporated by adjusting
household weights to match the 2014 Population Census at the strata level (province and
urban/rural).

67.      The simulation distinguishes between direct and indirect impacts of the subsidy reforms on
poverty. Direct impact of the subsidy reform is simulated by adjusting household budget constraints
with the increase in fuel, electricity and utility prices due to the reduction of the subsidy. As the increase
is applied to consumption data in 2011 terms, the relative increase in the price will be applied to the
household budget. Substitution effects are considered by estimating cross substitution elasticities based
on the 12 CPI product categories. 32 The indirect impact of the subsidy reforms is estimated with the help
of an input-output table. The input-output table describes the price changes of outputs due to changes
in prices of inputs. The simulation considers the products subject to subsidy reform as inputs and
translates the indirect impact on any other consumption good. The behavioral response of households
by substitution is incorporated using the same model as for direct impact.

68.     The change in consumption is expressed as Compensating Variation, considered as the
percentage of initial consumption, to keep households with the same level of utility before the change
in prices. The model follows two assumptions: First, the households keep the same item shares of
consumption after the reform. Second, the households decrease to some extent the consumption of
goods that are more expensive for goods and increase consumption of substitute goods. The first
assumption can be expressed as:
                                                                  

                                                    ∆ln  = �  × ∆ln( )
                                                                =1

69.     The Compensating Variation for each good is equal to the price variation of the good times the
share of the good in household consumption. The total welfare loss is the sum of the losses for all
goods whose price increased. ∆ln  is the income variation to keep the household utility constant
without considering substitution effects.  is the share of consumption in each good j, considering the
total household consumption, and ∆ln( ) is the difference of log prices of in consumed products.

70.      The Compensating Variation value is probably overstated, as consumers substitute to some
extent goods with higher prices for lower priced substitutes. Substitution elasticities can be estimated
utilizing the variation of prices and consumption shares following the approach for Quadratic Almost
Ideal Demand System Estimators. The elasticities are estimated using IBEP 2008. The elasticities are then
applied in the modified equation for the Compensating Variation:

71.      The term added to the previous equation considers the direct and cross demand-price
elasticities for all the goods in the household consumption basket. Thus, it consider the possibility of
substituting the products that became more expensive.

6.2     Bolsa Familia
72.     The Bolsa Família Program (BFP) is a successful out-market, noncontributory, income
distribution initiative that started in 2003. It is the result of the unification of other cash transfers
programs: Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil (1996), Bolsa Escola (2001), Cartão Alimentação (2003),
Auxílio-Gás(2001) and Bolsa Alimentação (2001). The unification was pursued under the intent to
elevate poverty as a national issue. This notion was fundamental to support the administrative
revolution that resulted in the national and unified Bolsa Família Program 33 - under the administration
of the Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (MDS).

73.     The unification of all the federal cash transfer programs was a significant advance in the social
security system in Brazil. Before, each program had an independent administrative structure. For
example, it could be the case that one family would receive all federal benefits while another, in similar
conditions, would receive none. Or different amount of money could be paid to families in comparable
socioeconomic situation. Under the Bolsa Familia, they unified the entry criteria, the amount of benefits,
the administrative agencies and the information system.

74.      The Bolsa Família Program is not a right and it is completely dependent on the availability of
resources – the number of beneficiaries and the amount of resources are limited. Given this, annually
the government defines the goals of the program. In 2003, the program started aiming to attend to 11.2
million families. The number of families attended to each year gradually grew – reaching the targeted
number in 2006 (Table 3). In terms of the proportions of Bolsa Família , it has an impressive coverage
with a low budget. In 2015, the program attended to 14 million families and its total expenditure – R$ 27
million - was approximately half a percent of the Brazilian GDP.

75.     The innovative institutional framework surrounding the functioning of Bolsa Familia is
composed mainly by: the SENARC (National Secretariat for Citizen Incomes - MDS) and the Federal
Economic Fund (Caixa). The National Secretary for Income and Citizenship at the MDS is the main
responsible body for the program, while its implementation is under the responsibility of the states and
municipalities. The program also has the support of the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education,
both responsible for monitoring compliance with health and education conditionalities.

76.     The population entitled to the Bolsa Família Program is that living under poverty (monthly per
capita income between R$77.00 and R$154.00) and extreme poverty (up to R$77.00). These poverty
lines evolved over time. In 2004, it started using the minimum wage as reference (R$200.00) – up to
R$50.00 was considered extreme poverty and poverty from R$50-100. The values are updated based on
the price index, representing a measure of poverty that does not change conditional to economic
development. See Table 2 for a description of the actual values and the criteria used to distribute the
resources. The maximum benefit to each family according to the rules is R$259.00 monthly (Table 4).

33 The Bolsa Família Program was officially created through the Provisory Measure number 132, from October 20th 2003. It became a law in

2004 (Law number 10,836, from January 9th 2004).

77.      Families are ranked according to well defined and clear criteria: (i) priority families, (ii) low
income families, (iii) families with a high number of children under 17 years old. For the priority group,
they must be eligible under the basic income criteria but, once identified, they will receive the benefit
even if the limit number of families of that locality has been reached. The priority group is composed of
quilombola 34 and indigenous families, families with child labor, families with members formerly working
under slavery circumstances – among others.

78.      The selection and payment of the beneficiaries are conducted in an impersonal way, by the
Federal Economic Fund (Caixa) using the criteria stablished by SENARC. 35 The selection is made of the
beneficiaries in the Cadastro Unico, following the criteria defined by SENARC – geographical quotas,
income and priority list. For the payment, each family receives a debit card by mail. Then the benefits
can be collected in any Caixa’s agency (ATM spots). Besides the card, each beneficiary receives
instructions and information about the program, such as its functionality, the conditionalities
requirements and communication channels. 36

79.     The Cadastro Único (CadÚnico) is a system from which the beneficiaries are selected. It
contains detailed information especially on families living in poverty and extreme poverty. The Cadastro
contains information on the individuals – schooling levels, occupation, and income. On the households -
basic services, sanitation and electricity. The municipalities are responsible of maintaining the system
updates. To enter the system, a family can seek for an official location made available by the

80.     Thanks to the wide promotion of the program, most of the registries are not home based and
in most cases the family self-selects into the program. It is required that the responsible family head is
over 16 years old and preferably a woman. Every two years, the families and the municipalities are
together responsible for updating the information in the system. Recertification is a fundamental
condition for the continuation in the program.

81.     In order to guarantee the human capital development of the next generation, the program
requires a few conditionalities in the areas of health and education. Families are required to keep
vaccination records updated for children under 7 years old. Prenatal care is mandatory for pregnant and
lactating women. In relation to education, it is required that children up to 15 years old enroll to school
and keep attendance levels in a minimum monthly attendance of 85 percent. Adolescents of 16 and 17
years old have to be enrolled and maintain a 75 percent monthly attendance level. The MDS defines the
number of families to which monitoring compliance with the conditionalities is required. The Ministry of
Education and Ministry of Health are responsible for keeping track of these compliances.

82.     Once the families to be monitored are identified, they are considered as vulnerable families
and a package of actions is set in motion to help families to overcome the situation. Overall, the
conditionalities are more useful to keep the government accountable to the population than to take
families out of the program. In fact, keeping the registries updated is actually the most important –
families that fail to update their information every two years are automatically excluded from the
program.

83.      All these mechanisms work to reduce the dependence of the beneficiaries on local authorities
– splitting the power among the community, banking agencies and public authorities. Bolsa Família
straightened direct relationships, eliminating any intermediations that could involve political parties or
social organizations in the selection into the program or distribution of the benefits as well as the
family’s continuation or not in the program. The public availability of all databases and the

dissemination of information through radio and television maintain that the program is subjected to
public evaluation constantly.

84.     The administrative decentralization of the program contains other specific features to
guarantee accountability of all parts involved. Social Accountability Boards - equally composed of
government and civil society - seeks to monitor local authorities and guarantee that the poorest
population has access to the program. Over a quarter of the members is formed by Bolsa Familia’s
beneficiaries, implying a conflict of interest. One-fifth of the municipalities did not have a council
although this is a legal requirement of the program. Seventy-three percent of the members were
supporters of the mayors, a major indicative of political manipulation. 37

85.     The program also counts with the supervision of supreme audit agencies: CGU 38, TCU 39 and
MP . Each has its specificities, but in general they investigate particular cases, perform financial audits
    40

and guarantee the publicity of the beneficiaries list. Besides, the program has different hotlines. Caixa’s
focuses on payment and registry issues, MDS’s covers general public and managers and Senarc’s attends
to a more technical set of queries.

6.2.1 Targeting
86.     The efficacy of the BFP targeting is one of the highest: 80 percent of the resources are
allocated to the poorest 40 percent of the population. 41 The BPF ranks among the 10th best programs
out of 122 programs. 42 The targeting mechanism used in the BFP is a mix of geographical quotas and
(un)verified means test. The information on income is self-declared and it can be compared to an
independent survey also covering income, the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS).

87.     Geographical quotas are the first step in the targeting mechanism. Based on PNAD and the
Census, measures of the percentage of people living under poverty in each municipality are estimated.
Along with the fact that there is no limit number of people to be included in the CadUnico system, the
quotas give the municipality incentive to reach the poorest people in the region. However, this supposes
a good social control in the municipality level, a hypothesis that does not meet empirical validation so
far. These local criteria are flexible and municipalities could ask for a higher amount under the argument
that the locality has a larger number of potential beneficiaries. Interestingly, the national quota seems
to have been respected during all the years. 43

88.     Due to the lack of reliability of the self-declared income, the reported income impacts
targeting by 2 percentage points, contributing only 5 percent of the overall effect. Using data from

poverty line of one half of the minimum wage in 2004, the targeting of the BFP was 57 percent (Figure

89.      In 2014, 88 million people were registered in the CadÚnico system while 48 million people
were selected to benefit from Bolsa Família. However, according to the National Household Sample
Survey (PNAD) there are 20 million people living in poverty. Since Bolsa Família targeting is based on
self-reported income with poor verification mechanisms, it is likely that people are underestimating
their income in order to qualify for the benefit.

90.       A distinction between permanent (or structural) and transitory income is paramount to
interpret measures of targeting and coverage and to propose more efficient measures. A reason why
the gap between the eligible for the BFP as registered in the CadUnico and the one estimated from
PNAD (Figure 22) could be a result of the vulnerability of the family income. PNAD registers the income
in the last month before the interview- which does not capture the dynamics of family income. Using
data from a monthly survey on income (PME – Monthly Employment Survey 45), it can be estimated that
in a given month, 13 percent of the population swift from a poor to a non-poor condition. This possibility
is likely to happen since 60 percent of the adults in the beneficiated families in the BFP are not in the
formal labor sector. 46 This is added to the fact that the interval between the two BFP’s interviews is of
almost a year and by the time the person enters PNAD, that information is not comparable to the one in
the CadUnico anymore.

91.      A study of another Brazilian CCT program - Renda Melhor Program (RMP), similar to the BFP -
addresses important issues: the use of declared, current or structural income and their impact on the
improvement in targeting. The Renda Melhor program is complementary to the Bolsa Família. It seeks
to complement the per capita income up to R$100, even if the family is already a beneficiary of other
programs. It is focused only on the extremely poor families, which limits the possibilities of the new
methodology to reduce the exclusion error since it is not possible to rescue the extremely poor families
already left out of BFP. Different from BFP that uses self-declared income to define how poor the family
is, the RMP bases on proxy means test to estimate the degree of poverty of each candidate – although
the actual methodology used by the program is not clear. To learn more about the program, its income
measures and targeting effectiveness, see Barros et al, 2016.

92.      A detailed evaluation of the targeting performance of RMP was performed to compare
declared income option to the verified means test or proxy means test option. 48 A sample of families
beneficiaries of BFP and RMP were interviewed in 2012 (baseline) and 2013 (follow-up) in order to
obtain information to be compared to the CadUnico. Detailed information was obtained in relation to
family income sources. The measure of current income (verified means test) was retrieved by adding all
sources divided by the number of members in the household. Structural income (proxy means test) is
the amount of resources a family has that is less subject to transitory shocks. Barros et al (2016)
estimated a structural income using proxies (e.g. schooling years of the adult members of the family)
that were highly correlated with the structural component and were not correlated with the transitory
component. Also, consumption habits were used as proxy for the structural income such as rent,
education and health expenditures.

93.     Declared income was found to be a poor measure of the actual income, while current income
and structural income showed to be better predictors. When information on the declared income and

47 Population in Poverty was calculated as the sum of people in extreme poverty (below 70 reais per capita per month) and in Povery (below

140 reais per capita per month).

 the current income collected by the surveys were compared, it was found that the income declared in
 the cadastro was lower than the one collected in the home visits. The income variation in the cadastro is
 63 percent of the one collected in the home visits. According to the cadastro, 47 percent of the families
 have income lower than R$100, becoming eligible for the benefit. The survey, on the other hand,
 counted 31 percent of the families in that situation. The under-declaration of income increases the
 inclusion error. More worrying is the fact that the number of families in extreme poverty is higher
 among the surveyed families than in the cadastro – leading to an increase in the exclusion error. The
 results in relation to the comparison of declared income and structural income are similar to this,
 leading to similar conclusions.

 94.     As found by a different simulation study, increasing the targeting of the program would
 increase the income of poorest significantly. A study on the impact of the BFP on the income of poorest
 40 percent of the population compared to what it would be if the targeting method were changed to the
 random allocation of the resources show that the current method (quotas, cadastro and declared
 income) is three times more effective than the alternative. 49

 95.    Despite the current targeting performance of BFP, it is clear that there is room for
 improvement if more information already available in the CadUnico were used. For example, the Rede
 de Oportunidades, from Panama, is more efficient in allocating resources to the poorest 20 percent in
 the population. The main difference between the two programs is the use of proxy means test (PMT) in
 Panama’s program.

 6.2.2 Poverty Impact
 96.    Since early 2000, Brazil has changed greatly in relation to its socioeconomic outcomes. The
 country has met many of the Millennium Development Goals years in advance and the overall Human
 Development Indexes improved substantially throughout the country.

 97.      From 1999 to 2009, Bolsa Familia accounted for 16 percent of the overall decrease in the
 inequality, which is an impressive result for a program that costs less than 1 percent of a household
 total income. The decrease in the level of inequality was roughly constant until early 2000 and it started
 decreasing to less than 0.52 in 10 years. Regarding the effect attributed to BFP, the main explanation for
 these expressive results is the targeting of the program. 50

 98.     Besides inequality and poverty, studies have found positive impacts of BFP on educational,
 health and crime outcomes. A study found that BFP increased enrollment rates by 18 percentage points
 and lowered dropout rates by 1.5 percentage points among the participant children. Also, they found an
 increase in 2 percentage points in grade promotion. It also indicates the program has a higher impact

50   The other share of the decrease is credited to the increase in the labor income (59 percent) and Pensions (15 percent).

among racial minorities than whites. 51 Regarding health outcomes, the program improved health care
utilization, with positive spillovers on older siblings. 52 In relation to crime rates, evidence indicates a
reduction in crime rates caused by the reduction in inequality rather than for incapacitation from time
spent in school. 53

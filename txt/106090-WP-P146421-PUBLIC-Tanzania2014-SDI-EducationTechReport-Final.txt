EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Service Delivery Indicators provide a set of metrics for benchmarking service delivery
performance in education and health. The overall objective of the indicators is to gauge the quality
of service delivery in primary education and basic health services. The indicators enable the
identification of gaps and tracking of progress over time and across countries. It is envisaged that
the broad availability, high public awareness and a persistent focus on the indicators will mobilize
policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors and other stakeholders for action to improve the
quality of services and ultimately to improve development outcomes and social welfare.

This report presents the findings from the implementation of the Service Delivery Indicators in the
Education sector in Tanzania in 2014. Survey implementation was preceded by an extensive
consultation with Government and key stakeholders on survey design, sampling, and adaptation of
survey instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments, enumerator training, and fieldwork took
place in 2014.

Information was collected from 400 primary schools, 2,196 teachers (for skills assessment), 3,692
teachers (for absence rate) and 4,041 pupils across Tanzania. The results provide a snapshot of the
quality of service delivery and the physical environment within which services are delivered in public
primary schools. The survey provides information on (i) teacher effort; (ii) teacher knowledge and
ability; and (iii) the availability of key inputs, such as textbooks, basic teaching equipment and
infrastructure (such as sanitation or quality of lighting).




What providers do (teachers’ effort)
On average, 14 percent of teachers were found to be absent from school. Absence from classroom
was much more serious with almost half (46.5 percent) of the teachers not in the class teaching. While
in the classroom, teachers spent on average about 12 percent of time on non-teaching activities.

                                                  6
Combining the absence from school and the classroom with the time engaged in non-teaching
activities, the results indicate that pupils only had 2 hours and 47 minutes of teaching time every day
out of the allocated 5 hours 55 minutes. It is worth noting that over 80 percent of teachers were
absent with management approval, suggesting: (i) management weakness and a sub-optimal
allocation of paid staff time; (ii) absence is within the power of management to influence, and (iii)
absence may be amenable to action in the short run.

What providers know (teachers’ knowledge and ability)
The vast majority of teachers lacked the necessary academic and pedagogical skills to teach. The
average score on the mathematics and English assessment among teachers who teach either or both
subjects was 49.5 percent. Only 21.4 percent of the teachers scored at least 80 percent on these
assessments. Pupils cannot learn more from their teachers than what the teachers know, and,
therefore, teachers’ lack of technical competences severely constrained learning outcomes in
Tanzania.

What providers have (availability of key inputs)
The pupil-teacher ratio averaged 43.4 pupils per teacher, slightly below the expected norm of 45:1.
However, significant gaps existed in the availability of inputs at the frontline. Only 40.9 percent of
schools had the minimum infrastructure. Most striking was the absence of functional, improved,
accessible, private, and clean toilets. Fewer than half (47 percent) of all primary schools surveyed
had toilets (such as a ventilated improved pit latrine, etc.) meeting the standard. Only three out of
five (61 percent) of the schools had the minimum teaching materials. Despite the recent nationwide
distribution of textbooks, only 25 percent of the pupils had a mathematics or English textbook in the
classroom.

Against this background, one must also note that teachers experienced salary delays with almost
one out of three teachers (32.9 percent) claiming to have experienced such a delay at least once over
the year preceding the survey. Teachers also complained about unpaid claims with half (46.7
percent) of them reporting at least one unpaid claim, this proportion reached 70.4 percent in Dar es
Salaam. The most prevalent unpaid claim nationally was salary arrears (23.7 percent) followed by
unpaid leave (9.4 percent) and relocation allowance and hardship pay with 3.5 percent and 3.4
percent respectively.


Tanzania SDI trends and how does Tanzania compare to other countries
Between 2010 and 2014, Tanzania made significant gains in terms of smaller class sizes, better
teaching equipment, and higher teacher presence in school. As a result, the average Tanzanian
primary pupil gained 43 minutes of teaching time per day while teaching time doubled for the urban
pupils. On the other hand, teachers’ subject and pedagogical content knowledge stagnated or slightly
deteriorated.

Bearing in mind that overall performance is low, Tanzania fares relatively well among the SDI
countries in terms of inputs, effort, and knowledge. Tanzania’s schools have worse infrastructure
compared to schools in its EAC neighbors, but they fare better than Nigeria, Togo, and Mozambique.
Although only 1 in 4 (26 percent) of Tanzanian pupils used a textbook in the classroom, Tanzania
outperformed Uganda where only 6 percent of the pupils used a textbook in the classroom. In
contrast, 76 percent, 68 percent, 44 percent, and 34 percent of pupils in Togo, Mozambique, Kenya,
and Nigeria, respectively used a textbook in class.

                                                  7
When it comes to teachers’ effort, Tanzania and Kenya displayed patterns with relatively low school
absence rates (15.3 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively), but high classroom absence rates with
almost half of the teachers not found in classroom at any point in time. Mozambique and Uganda have
significantly higher absence rates for both. The three West African countries (Nigeria, Senegal, and
Togo) have much lower classroom absence rates.

Kenyan, Ugandan, and Tanzanian teachers significantly outperformed Nigerian, Togolese, and
Mozambican teachers in minimum knowledge. Tanzania where 15.6 percent of teachers are assessed
to have minimum knowledge to teach is second only to Kenya (34.8 percent), the best performer
among SDI countries. Almost no teachers in Nigeria and Togo passed the 80 percent score bar to be
considered as mastering the curriculum they teach. Tanzanian teachers’ average test scores for
English, mathematics, and pedagogy (46.6 percent) are also second only to their Kenyan counterparts
(55.6 percent). Pupils’ test scores mirror their teachers’ performance and Tanzanian pupils are
outperformed only by their Kenyan peers (49.2 percent and 69.4 percent, respectively).

    I.      INTRODUCTION 3

1.     Between May and September 2014, fourteen education teams travelled across
Tanzania to collect data for the Service Delivery Indicators (SDI). The SDI has been piloted in
Senegal and Tanzania in 2010 and lessons learned from the pilot have led to a revised SDI being rolled
out across Africa. Thus, this SDI follows a series of countries in Africa which have already
implemented a full-fledged SDI (Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Togo, and Mozambique). Tanzania is,
however, the first country to implement its second SDI which will allow for basic trend analysis. The
Tanzania SDI has been implemented in both health and education sectors. This report concerns the
education SDI.

2.     The Education SDI visited a representative sample of Tanzanian primary schools.
Following an initial consultation meeting drawing in several stakeholders, the initial SDI instruments
have been customized to fit the Tanzanian context and it was decided that the SDI would also provide
few sub-national indicators. Only public primary schools were including in this SDI.

3.      The survey was implemented by Research in Poverty Alleviation (REPOA) in close
coordination with a World Bank team. In each school, one standard four English or mathematics class
was observed. Up to 10 pupils were randomly chosen amongst standard four learners and a total of
4,041 pupils were assessed for literacy and numeracy skills. For comparison with the 2010 SDI and
other SDI countries, 2,841 pupils were tested in English. In addition, 1,200 more pupils were tested
in Kiswahili, which is the major medium for learning in Tanzania’s primary education system.
Teachers also were assessed with 2,197 of them sitting through a 1 hour 10 minute assessment on
their English, mathematics, and pedagogical skills. Finally, 3,692 teachers across grades were
randomly chosen during the first visit and their whereabouts assessed in a second unannounced visit
for estimation of teachers’ effort and the level of absence in schools and classrooms.

4.      The education service delivery indicators build on a growing body of literature on
measuring the performance of schools and specifically teachers who are arguably the most important
actors in the sector. The indicators provide a snapshot of the learning environment and key
resources which need to be in place for pupils to learn. As expenditure on teachers represents by
far the largest share of education spending in developing countries, and as several recent studies
convincingly demonstrate how changes in teacher behavior can improve learning achievement,
a strong focus is placed on the knowledge, skills and effort of teachers.

5.      Annex B presents the Service Delivery Indicators in education and a short definition of each
indicator. Below we give some more intuition for the choice of indicators, before presenting the
results and a detailed discussion of the findings in the following sections.

6.      A minimum requirement for learning is that the teachers are not absent from the school and
spend time in the class rather than somewhere else. The first two indicators ― School absence rate
and Classroom absence rate ― are direct measures of the extent to which this is the case. While
having teachers in the class is a necessary condition, however, it is not sufficient for learning to take
place. Teachers need to be involved in teaching and teachers need to have at least a minimum level
of knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and skills to transform their knowledge into

3   While not the focus of this report, the SDI surveys are also implemented in the health sector.

                                                               11
    meaningful teaching. The indicators share of teachers with minimum knowledge measures to what
    extent these skills exist across schools and the indicator time spent teaching in the class the extent
    to which teachers are exerting effort to enable learning.

    7.     Four of the indicators deal with the environment i.e. the school. The indicator availability of
    teaching resources assesses if necessary materials such as blackboard, chalk, pencils, paper are in
    place to support the teaching activities. The indicator school infrastructure measures whether
    functioning sanitation facilities exist and if there is at least minimum light in the classroom so that
    pupils can read and study. Finally, the indicators pupil‐teacher ratio and share of pupils with
    textbooks measure the average number of pupils per teacher in standard four classrooms and the
    proportion of pupils in the classroom who are using the relevant (mathematics or language)

Service delivery outcomes are determined by the relationships of accountability between
policymakers, service providers, and citizens (Figure 1, World Bank 2004). Human development
outcomes are the result of the interaction between various actors in the multi‐step service delivery
system, and depend on the characteristics and behavior of individuals and households. While delivery
of quality education is contingent foremost on what happens in classrooms, a combination of several
basic elements have to be present in order for quality services to be accessible and produced by
teachers at the frontline, which depend on the overall service delivery system and supply chain.
Adequate financing, infrastructure, human resources, material, and equipment need to be made
available, while the institutions and governance structure provide incentives for the service providers
to perform.

                                     policymakers




Service Delivery Production Function
Consider a service delivery production function, f, which maps physical inputs, x, the effort put in by the
service provider, e, as well as his/her type (or knowledge), θ, to deliver quality services into individual
level outcomes, y. The effort variable e could be thought of as multidimensional and thus include effort
(broadly defined) of other actors in the service delivery system. We can think of type as the
characteristic (knowledge) of the individuals who are selected for a specific task. Of course, as noted
above, outcomes of this production process are not just affected by the service delivery unit, but also
by the actions and behaviors of households, which we denote by ε. We can therefore write

                               y = f(x,e,θ) +ε

To assess the quality of services provided, one should ideally measure f(x,e,θ). Of course, it is notoriously
difficult to measure all the arguments that enter the production, and would involve a huge data
collection effort. A more feasible approach is therefore to focus instead on proxies of the arguments
which, to a first‐order approximation, have the largest effects.

Indicator Categories and the Selection Criteria
There are a host of data sets available in education. To a large extent, these data sets measure inputs
and outcomes/outputs in the service delivery process, mostly from a household perspective. While
providing a wealth of information, existing data sources (like Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS), Welfare Monitoring Surveys (WMS), and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey
(CWIQ)) cover only a sub‐sample of countries and are, in many cases, outdated.




                                                       13
                            Box 1. Analytical Underpinnings (cont’d)

The proposed choice of indicators takes its starting point from the recent literature on the economics
of education and service delivery, more generally. Overall, this literature stresses the importance of
provider behavior and competence in the delivery of education services (as opposed to water and
sanitation services and housing that rely on very different service delivery models). Conditional on
service providers exerting effort, there is also some evidence that the provision of physical resources
and infrastructure has important effects on the quality of service delivery.

The somewhat weak relationship between resources and outcomes documented in the literature has
been associated with deficiencies in the incentive structure of school and education systems. Indeed,
most service delivery systems in developing countries present frontline providers with a set of
incentives that negate the impact of pure resource‐based policies. Therefore, while resources alone
appear to have a limited impact on the quality of education in developing countries, it is possible inputs
are complementary to changes in incentives, so coupling improvements in both may have large and
significant impacts (see Hanushek, 2006). As noted by Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011), the fact that
budgets have not kept pace with enrollment, leading to large pupil‐teacher ratios, overstretched
physical infrastructure, and insufficient number of textbooks, etc., is problematic. However, simply
increasing the level of resources might not address the quality deficit in education without also taking
providers’ incentives into account.

SDI proposes three sets of indicators: (i) provider effort; (ii) knowledge of service providers and (iii)
availability of key infrastructure and inputs at the frontline service provider level. Providing countries
with detailed and comparable data on these important dimensions of service delivery is one of the main
innovations of the Service Delivery Indicators.

Additional considerations in the selection of indicators are (i) quantitative (to avoid problems of
perception biases that limit both cross‐country and longitudinal comparisons), (ii) ordinal in nature (to
allow within and cross‐country comparisons); (iii) robust (in the sense that the methodology used to
construct the indicators can be verified and replicated); (iv) actionable; and (v) cost effective to collect.

                      Box 2. The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Program

A significant share of public spending on education is transformed to produce good outcomes at schools.
Understanding what takes place at these frontline service provision centers is the starting point in
establishing where the relationship between public expenditure and outcomes is weak within the service
delivery chain. Knowing whether spending is translating into inputs that teachers have to work with (e.g.
textbooks in schools), or how much work effort is exerted by teachers (e.g. how likely are they to come
to work), and their competency would reveal the weak links in the service delivery chain. Reliable and
complete information on these measures is lacking, in general.

To date, there is no robust, standardized set of indicators to measure the quality of services as
experienced by the citizen in Africa. Existing indicators tend to be fragmented and focus either on final
outcomes or inputs, rather than on the underlying systems that help generate the outcomes or make use
of the inputs. In fact, no set of indicators is available for measuring constraints associated with service
delivery and the behavior of frontline providers, both of which have a direct impact on the quality of
services that citizens are able to access. Without consistent and accurate information on the quality of
services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians (the principal) to assess how service providers (the agent)
are performing and to take corrective action.

The SDI provides a set of metrics to benchmark the performance of schools in Africa. The Indicators can
be used to track progress within and across countries over time, and aim to enhance active monitoring
of service delivery to increase public accountability and good governance. Ultimately, the goal of this
effort is to help policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors, and other stakeholders enhance the
quality of services and improve development outcomes.

The perspective adopted by the Indicators is that of citizens accessing a service. The Indicators can thus
be viewed as a service delivery report card on education. However, instead of using citizens’
perceptions to assess performance, the Indicators assemble objective and quantitative information
from a survey of frontline service delivery units, using modules from the Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS), Quantitative Service Delivery Survey (QSDS), and Staff Absence Survey (SAS).

The literature points to the importance of the functioning of schools and more generally, the quality of
service delivery. The service delivery literature is, however, clear that, conditional on providers being
appropriately skilled and exerting the necessary effort, increased resource flows for health can indeed
have beneficial education outcomes.

The SDI initiative is a partnership of the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),
and the African Development Bank to develop and institutionalize the collection of a set of indicators
that would gauge the quality of service delivery within and across countries and over time. The ultimate
goal is to sharply increase accountability for service delivery across Africa, by offering important
advocacy tools for citizens, governments, and donors alike; to work toward the end goal of achieving
rapid improvements in the responsiveness and effectiveness of service delivery.

II.        METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION
The sample of the Tanzania SDI is given in Table 5. Overall, 400 primary schools were visited, 2,197
standard three, four, and five teachers were assessed on English, mathematics, and pedagogy, 3,692
teachers of all grades have been followed for absence rate (not shown in Table 5). Also, although
learning outcomes are not part of the indicators, 4,041 standard four pupils have been assessed on
language (English/Kiswahili), mathematics, and non-verbal reasoning. 4 It is crucial that the
indicators be correlated with pupil learning outcome because the SDI is geared towards capturing
the drivers of learning outcomes at the school level.

Notes: Each unit of analysis i.e. schools, teachers, or pupils has its own specific weights which are where relevant. Columns’ definitions are
as follows: (1) is sample size; (2) is share of sample; (3) is the weighted share; (4) is the distribution in the actual sample frame or
universe.



The Tanzania SDI is representative of primary schools at the national level. It is also representative
of Dar es Salaam, the main city, as well as other urban areas, and rural Tanzania. Because of a large
DFID program called EQUIP-T being implemented in four regions (Dodoma, Kigoma, Tabora and
Shinyanga), it was also decided to make these four regions as a whole a stratum. Therefore, the SDI
can report statistics on the EQUIP-T regions as well. The sampling strategy is fully explained in the
annex of this report. It is noteworthy that each entity has its own weight. Weights for schools are
therefore different from weights from pupils or teachers. For the latter weights even differ for the
analysis of absenteeism or the knowledge content analysis. The difference in weights comes from
the fact that for each unit of analysis a sample needs to be drawn.

It is also noteworthy that the Tanzania Education SDI, unlike all other SDI countries, only reports on
public schools. This is due to the near non-existence of private schools at the primary level. Indeed
there are very few private schools in the sample frame and this is also confirmed by independent
household surveys. As a matter of fact according to the 2012/13 National Panel Survey only two
percent of the children attending primary school are in the private sector.

The education service indicators build on a growing body of literature on measuring the
performance of schools and, specifically, of teachers. The Indicators provide a snapshot of the
learning environment and key resources which need to be in place for pupils to learn. As the

4 Following the Tanzania 2010 SDI results, it was decided for this round to add a Kiswahili test for the pupils. In each
school roughly three pupils were tested in Kiswahili and seven in English (to maintain comparability with other countries
and Tanzania’s previous round). Overall 1,200 Standard 4 pupils were tested in Kiswahili and 2,841 sat for the English
test.

                                                                    16
expenditure on teachers represents, by far, the largest share of education spending in developing
countries, and, as several recent studies convincingly demonstrate how changes in teacher behavior
can improve learning achievement, a strong focus is placed on the knowledge, skills and effort of
teachers. Annex B presents the Service Delivery Indicators in education and a short definition of
each indicator. The survey instrument consists of the six modules as shown in Table 6.

A minimum requirement for learning is that the teachers are not absent from the school and spend
time in the class rather than somewhere else. As shown in the definitions table in Annex B, the first
two indicators, School absence rate and Classroom absence rate, are direct measures of the extent to
which this is the case. While having teachers in the class is a necessary condition, however, it is not
sufficient for learning to take place. Teachers need to be involved in teaching and need to have at
least a minimum level of knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and skills to transform their
knowledge into meaningful teaching. The indicator Minimum knowledge measures to what extent
these skills exist across schools and the indicator Time spent teaching per day measures the extent
to which teachers are exerting effort to enable learning.

Four of the indicators deal with the environment; i.e., the school. The indicator Minimum equipment
availability assesses if necessary materials such as blackboard, chalk, pencils, and paper are in place
to support the teaching activities. The indicator Minimum infrastructure availability measures
whether functioning sanitation facilities exist and if there is at least minimum light in the classroom
so that pupils can read and study. Finally, the indicators Observed pupil‐teacher ratio and Share of
pupils with textbooks measure the average number of pupils per teacher in grade four classrooms
and the number of mathematics and language books at their disposal. Below we discuss each
indicator in more depth and provide additional information on how they are derived, how they
should be interpreted, and what they imply.

III.     RESULTS
The indicators Minimum equipment availability, Minimum infrastructure availability, Observed
pupil‐teacher ratio, and Share of pupils with textbook 5 are all constructed using data collected through
visual inspections of a Standard four classroom and the school premises in each primary school.
Below we discuss each indicator in some more detail. Table 7 summarizes the findings.


A. Availability of inputs at the school

Minimum equipment availability

Methodological Note

Minimum equipment availability is a binary indicator capturing the availability of: (i) functioning blackboard
and chalk and (ii) pens, pencils and exercise books in 4th grade classrooms. In one randomly selected 4th grade
classroom in the school the enumerator assessed if there was a functioning blackboard by looking at whether
text written on the blackboard could be read at the front and back of the classroom, and whether there was
chalk available to write on the blackboard. We considered that the classroom met the minimum requirement
of pens, pencils and exercise books if both the share of pupils with pen or pencils and the share of pupils with
exercise books were above 90%.




Of the four indicators, Minimum resource availability appears less of a constraint. In terms
of the availability of teaching resources, only six out of 10 (61.1 percent) Tanzanian primary
schools seem to possess the minimum required. The main constraint is a functioning blackboard
and the lack of light for pupils to be able to read the blackboard. Indeed, as shown in Table 7, all sub‐
indicators are close to 100 percent except “sufficient contrast to read board”. In more than one out
of four schools the standard four classroom was judged by the enumerator as not having enough
contrast to allow proper reading from a distance. Schools in the EQUIP-T regions and rural schools
in general are the hardest hit. Although lack of teaching equipment does not appear to be a binding
constraint for providing high quality teaching in most Tanzanian primary schools, lack of light is a
concern that needs to be addressed. As shown by Mott et al. (2012) lighting quality in the classroom
may significantly impact learning process and outcomes.




5 This indicator is used in lieu of Pupils per textbook which is the traditional indicator. The primary reason for this change

is that this indicator is not defined in a classroom without textbook which proved to be a regular occurrence in previous
SDI countries.

Minimum infrastructure availability

    Methodological Note

    Minimum infrastructure availability is a binary indicator capturing the availability of: (i) functioning
    toilets and (ii) classroom visibility. Functioning toilets is defined as whether toilets were functioning,
    accessible, clean and private (enclosed and with gender separation) as verified by an enumerator. To
    verify classroom visibility we randomly selected one 4th grade classroom in which the enumerator
    placed a printout on the board and checked whether it was possible to read the printout from the back
    of the classroom.

    Share of pupils with textbooks reflects the typical ratio in pupil to textbooks in a 4th grade classroom. It is
    measured as the number of pupils with the relevant textbooks (language or mathematics conditional on
    which randomly selected class is observed) in one randomly selected 4th grade class and divided by the
    number of pupils in that classroom.

    Observed pupil-teacher ratio reflects the typical ratio of pupils to teachers in a 4th grade classroom. It is
    measured as the number of pupils in one randomly selected 4th grade class at the school.




Table 7 reports the means for each sub‐indicator for Minimum infrastructure availability. For a fuller
breakdown of these results, see Table C 1. There is near universal access to toilets in Tanzania’s
primary schools and almost all of them are accessible and clean. 6 Because in many of the schools
teachers do not have separate toilets and need to share in pupils’ toilets, it is considered that pupils
enjoy no privacy in those toilets. As a result, fewer than three out of five (57 percent) of the schools
are considered as having private toilets. It is especially in rural areas as well as EQUIP-T regions that
this phenomenon is widespread. On the last sub-indicator - “visibility” – it is again in rural areas and
EQUIP-T regions that pupils will have more difficulty reading what is written on the board.

Overall, Tanzanian schools score poorly on Minimum infrastructure availability with only 41
percent of them meeting the standard. The major constraint for infrastructure is the privacy of the
toilets because they are shared with teachers especially in rural areas. Again visibility in the
classrooms is an issue for rural schools.




6For this indicator, there were a number of schools that do not, in fact, have information on cleanliness and accessibility.
The specific schools with missing information were those where teachers and pupils used the same toilets. For such
schools, a skip was inadvertently included in the Kiswahili version of the questionnaire. We considered that those schools
did not meet the privacy criterion for pupils. The toilets were, however, still considered accessible and clean by default.
The infrastructure indicator, therefore, is an overestimate of the true state of infrastructure in Tanzania’s primary
schools.

 Roughly only one out four pupils had access to an English or mathematics textbook in a
 typical standard four classroom. Table 7 provides the statistics on the share of pupils who had or
 were sharing a textbook broken down by subject area (English and mathematics). First, it is
 important to state that in 42 percent of the schools none of the pupils had a textbook during the
 lesson. In the schools in which textbooks are available every three children would have to share two
 textbooks. There is no significant difference across subjects with mathematics books being as
 prevalent as English books. There seems also to be little variation across strata with maybe the
 exception of urban areas other than Dar which have a slightly lower share of pupils with a textbook
 during class. This lack of books in the classrooms is observed even after a large distribution of
 textbooks took place recently in Tanzania and for which schools in the SDI survey acknowledge being
 beneficiaries. The reason is that often schools may have the textbooks but decide not provide them
 to pupils. In a recent study in Sierra Leone, Sabarwal et al. (2014) concludes that schools that have
 high uncertainty with respect to future transfers are more likely to store a proportion of current
 transfers (textbooks) with a view towards smoothing “consumption”. It is not clear whether this is
 what happens in Tanzanian schools but the phenomenon is worth further investigation to make sure
 books are fully and efficiently used by schools and pupils.

 The Observed pupil‐teacher ratio stand at 43 in the classrooms observed. The ratio is slightly below
 Tanzania’s recommended benchmark of 45:1. There are large and significant differences across
 strata. With close to 70 pupils, Dar es Salaam’s average standard four classroom has 27 more pupils
 than the typical standard four classroom in the nation or 60 percent more pupils. 7 Other urban
 schools also experience overcrowding of classrooms albeit to a lower extent. Interestingly, it is rural
 schools which respect the norm in terms of class size and this may be due to the recent acceleration
 of urbanization in Tanzania as shown by the recent economic update.


 7Note that this is fairly different from Uwezo’s 2012 results which found a significantly lower PTR in Dar compared to
 other regions. However, this is consistent with administrative data on school enrollments and should hold if pupil’s
 absenteeism is similar across regions. Note also that Dar schools have on average more classrooms but the difference is
 not large enough to make their class sizes smaller.

 B. Teachers effort

 There are three indicators designed to capture the effort teachers put into their job. These indicators
 are (i) School absence rate, (ii) Classroom absence rate, and (iii) Time spent teaching per day. The
 rationale behind these indicators is that the low levels of accountability and weakened incentives
 observed in many countries especially in sub-Sahara Africa have led to an upsurge of no-show for
 teachers. A classroom with no teacher is an environment where no learning is taking place. The
 indicators are computed across strata to capture the variations in these important dimensions in the
 country.

 School absence rate

Methodological Note

School absence rate is measured as the share of teachers who are absent from school at the time of an
unannounced visit. It is measured in the following way: During the first announced visit, a maximum of ten
teachers are randomly selected from the list of all teachers (excludes volunteer and part time teachers) who are
on the school roster. The whereabouts of these ten teachers are then verified in the second, unannounced, visit.
Teachers found anywhere on the school premises are marked as present.


 As shown in Table 8, the school absence rate is relatively low with one out of seven (14.3
 percent) not present at school at the time of the surprise visit. 8 Teachers in rural schools are
 equally likely to be absent from school than their urban colleagues. Absence rate is lowest in the
 EQUIP-T regions with “only” 8.3 percent of the teachers absent at any given time. Dar es Salaam’s
 public school teachers are more than twice as likely to be absent from school than teachers in EQUIP-
 T regions.

 8 The majority of the surprise visits took place during the morning with roughly 70 percent of the enumerators arriving

 before 12am (the mode of arrival is between 9-10 am). The surprise visit lasted 45 minutes on average.

 Classroom absence rate

Methodological Note

Classroom absence rate is measured as the share of teachers not in the classroom at the time of an unannounced
visit. The indicator is constructed in the same way as the school absence rate indicator, with the exception that
the numerator now is the number of teachers who are either absent from school, or present at school but absent
from the classroom.



 Even when in school, teachers may not necessarily be in the classroom teaching. To capture
 this new dimension, the indicator Absence from class is used. A teacher is considered absent from
 classroom if she is either not on the school premises or when in school, she cannot be located inside
              9
 a classroom.

 Close to two out of five (37 percent) of the teachers found in school are not in the classroom
 teaching. This brings the absenteeism from classroom to 46.5 percent nationally. This simply
 means that at any point in time, almost half of Tanzanian primary teachers are outside the classroom
 and are thus not teaching. As expenditure on teachers represents by far the largest share of
 education spending in developing countries including Tanzania, this very high absence from
 classroom clearly constitutes an important waste of time and resources with half of the time of
 teachers not utilized interacting with their pupils. Interestingly, absence from classroom does not vary
 much across regions.

 Table 9 provides information on the distribution of absence by looking at the “quartiles”. The
 salience of classroom absence and its contrast compared to school absence appears even more
 strikingly. Indeed, a large majority (64.8 percent) of schools record school absence rates below 20
 percent. However, fewer than one out of 10 schools (7.7 percent) have a classroom absence in the first
 quartile. In most schools (42.8 percent), four to six teachers out of 10 will not be in the classrooms and


 9 A small number of teachers are found teaching outside, and these are marked as present for the purposes of the

 indicator.

in a quarter of the schools more than 60 percent of the teachers are not in the classrooms. The
distribution of classroom absence is fairly similar across strata although EQUIP-T regions stand out as
shown in Figure C 1. Classroom absence is most likely a school leadership and management issue
because the majority of the teachers are in fact in the school. The recent EQUIP-T (2015) report echoes
this concern and shows that head teachers have a weak understanding and implementation of their
role and responsibilities.

Where were the teachers at the time of the unannounced visit? Figure 2 provides the answer to
that question across strata and offers yet another perspective on absence rates by showing teachers’
whereabouts during the surprise visit. Confirming Table 8 and Table 9 about half of the teachers are
teaching, some of them (0.6 percent nationally) outside the classroom. Although classroom absence
rate is at 46.7 percent, only 49 percent of the teachers were actually teaching. Indeed, a non-negligible
share (4.2 percent) of teachers was in class but attending to other matters than teaching. The “In class
but not teaching” phenomenon is more prevalent in Dar es Salaam with 8.4 percent (almost one out
of 10) of teachers in that mode – double the national average.


Finally, Table 10 shows absence rates as related to few select teachers’ characteristics, such
as gender, place of birth, and position in school. As for absence across strata, there are no clear
correlates of school or classroom absence. There is no statistically significant gender difference with
female teachers equally likely to be absent than male teachers. Although teachers who were born in
the district in which they work seem more likely to be absent from school, again that difference is not
statistically significant and they are no different than those who work in a district they were not born

 into. The only significant difference is for classroom absence between head teachers and regular
 teachers. This may be explained by the administrative and other duties that head teachers have on
 top of their teaching load when they do teach. It is, therefore, not surprising that head teachers are
 found less often in the classroom. Interestingly, and unlike many other SDI countries, head teachers
 are less likely to be absent from school than regular teachers even though the difference is not
 significant.

 Time spent teaching per day

Methodological Note

Time spent teaching per day reflects the typical time that teachers spend teaching on an average day. This
indicator combines data from the staff roster module (used to measure absence rate), the classroom observation
module, and reported teaching hours. The teaching time is adjusted for the time teachers are absent from the
classroom, on average, and for the time the teacher teaches while in classroom based on classroom observations.
While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and non-teaching activities.

Teaching is defined very broadly, including actively interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil’s work,
asking questions, testing, using the blackboard or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling or
memorization. Non-teaching activities include working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class or
doing nothing and thus leaving pupils not paying attention.


 This indicator measures the amount of time a teacher spends teaching in a school during a normal
 day, which on average was 2 hours and 47 minutes in Tanzania for the 2013/2014 school year
 (Table C 2). That is, teachers taught only about half of the scheduled time (which is 5 hours and 56
 minutes accounting for break times). Several intermediate inputs feed into the calculation of this
 indicator and are reported in Figure 3.

 The first step was to begin by recording the scheduled time of a teaching day from school records,
 which was 5 hours and 56 minutes on average. Then we multiplied this number by the proportion of
 teachers absent from school. The idea was that if 10 teachers were supposed to teach 5 hours and 56


                                                        24
minutes per day, but one of them was nowhere to be found in school, then scheduled teaching time
was reduced to 5 hours and 4 minutes (5 hours and 56 minutes x 0.856). The second step was to adjust
with classroom absence (i.e., teachers may have been at the school, but they were not in the classroom
teaching). Given the importance of classroom absence, the scheduled teaching time was reduced
further to 3 hours and 10 minutes (5 hours and 56 minutes x 0.533 10).

The last step consisted of taking into account and removing the time lost by teachers on non-teaching
activities while in the classroom. Indeed, even when in the class, teachers may not necessarily be
teaching. The percentage of the lesson lost to non‐teaching activities was measured through
observation of a standard four lesson. 11 As reported in Table C 2, roughly 12 percent of a typical
lesson was lost due to non-teaching activities. 12 To take this into account, we multiplied our
measure by the proportion of a typical lesson that was spent on teaching. In the example, the
teaching time of 3 hours and 10 minutes fell again to a low 2 hours and 47 minutes (3 hours and 10
minutes x 0.88).

There was no major difference in learning time across strata. Pupils in the EQUIP-T regions seemed
to receive slightly less than 20 minutes of learning compared to their urban peers but again this
difference was not statistically significant. It is noteworthy that EQUIP-T pupils spent less time (albeit
not significantly so) interacting with their teachers despite the fact that they (1) had the highest

10 The numbers 0.857 = (1- 0.144) and 0.533 = (1-0.467) represent the share of teachers in school and the classroom
respectively.
11This is most likely an upper bound on the time devoted to teaching during a lesson, since presumably a teacher is

more likely to teach when under direct observation (i.e. Hawthorne effects will bias the estimate upward).
12 During the observation, enumerators first had to judge whether the teacher was teaching or not. If they judged the

teacher to be teaching, they were supposed to indicate how much time the teacher spent on any of the following
teaching activities: teacher interacts with all children as a group; teacher interacts with small group of children; teacher
interacts with children one on one; teacher reads or lectures to the pupils; teacher supervises pupil(s) writing on the
board; teacher leads kinesthetic group learning activity; teacher writing on blackboard; teacher listening to pupils
recite/read; teacher waiting for pupils to complete task; teacher testing pupils in class; teacher maintaining discipline
in class; teacher doing paperwork.


                                                                           25
scheduled teaching time, and (2) enjoyed a slightly lower teacher absence rate. The main reason was
that they also had the highest time loss (20 percent, see Table C 2) on non-teaching activities when
the teacher was in the classroom.

Finally, Table 11 (and Figure C 2) provides information on a complementary measure of effort – the
share of classrooms with pupils but no teacher; i.e., orphaned classrooms. This was measured by
inspecting the school premises, counting the number of classrooms with pupils, and recording
whether a teacher was present in the classroom or not. The share of orphaned classrooms was then
calculated by dividing the number of classrooms with pupils but no teacher by the total number of
classrooms that contained pupils. In total, about one out of three classrooms (35 percent) were
orphaned and again there was little variation across Tanzania for this measure of effort.

Correlations between teacher effort and school inputs

One might expect that better infrastructure would be associated with more teacher effort – at least
poor quality infrastructure is often named by teachers as a reason for low motivation. Looking at
the SDI data, however, there is little evidence that school resources are correlated with teacher effort.
Examining the correlations between School absence rate and Classroom absence rate and the
various infrastructure indicators, no consistent picture emerges. While school absence is negatively
correlated with the sub-indicator Share of pupils with pencils, it is not correlated with the broader
indicator Minimum equipment availability. School absence seems independent of all other traditional
input indicators such as Minimum infrastructure availability or Share of pupils with textbooks. In the
same vein, classroom absence is negatively correlated with the Share of pupils with textbooks and
independent of all other indicators included in Table 12. Time spent teaching per day, on the other
hand, is not correlated with any indicator or sub-indicator. Teacher’s effort in Tanzania, therefore,
does not seem to be influenced by a school’s physical resources. An alternative explanation for
this lack of correlation might be the observed lack of variation in most of the indicators in
Tanzania (at least on average) across strata.

To summarize this section’s analysis, one observes relatively low school absence; i.e., by and
large, teachers showed up at school, but once they were on the school premises, many of them
did not spent much time in the classrooms teaching their pupils. In a large share of classrooms,
pupils were by themselves while the teacher was engaged in activities not related to teaching. By

                                                         26
this process, Tanzanian pupils lost more than half of the teaching time they were supposed to
receive and were able to interact with their teachers only 2 hours and 47 minutes per day in lieu
of the official 5 hours and 55 minutes.

C. Teachers competence

Even if teachers show up to school and spend the allocated time in the classroom engaging in
teaching activities with their pupils as expected, they need to have a fairly good command of the
subject they teach as well as the required pedagogical skills to effectively pass that knowledge unto
their pupils. This section discusses the indicator used to capture teachers’ knowledge and capacity
to teach which is dubbed Minimum knowledge.

Minimum knowledge

  Methodological Note

  Minimum knowledge is measured as the percentage of teachers who can master the curriculum they
  taught. It is based on a mathematics and language tests covering the primary curriculum administered
  at the school level and is calculated as the percentage of teachers who score more than 80% on the
  language and mathematics portion of the test. The test is given to all mathematics or language teachers
  that taught 3rd grade last year or 4th grade in the year the survey was conducted.


The share of teachers with minimum subject content knowledge is calculated on the basis of a
custom‐designed teacher test administered to the standard four mathematics and English teachers
of the 2013 and 2014 pupil cohorts. The objective of the teacher test is to examine whether teachers


                                                                   27
have the basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills that lower primary pupils need to have in order
to progress further with their education. Teachers are considered capable of teaching if they score
at least 80 percent on the tests, which is interpreted as the minimum knowledge required for the
teacher to be effective.

In addition, the test also examines the extent to which teachers demonstrate mastery of subject
content skills that are above the level they are teaching at and mastery of pedagogic skills. Out of
courtesy to teachers the test was designed as a marking exercise, in which teachers had to mark and
correct a hypothetical pupil's exam. The English (mathematics) test was administered to teachers
teaching English (mathematics), although they might teach other subjects as well. The test was
validated against the Tanzanian primary curriculum as well as 12 other Sub‐Saharan curricula. 13

The minimum knowledge indicator is calculated as the percentage of teachers who score more
than 80 percent on the English and mathematics test. The test also contains more advanced
questions in both subjects as well as a pedagogy section.

Note: (*) is the agreed cut-off point to estimate minimum knowledge for the SDI. Weighted means using sampling weight. Results based on
observations from 2,150 teachers in 400 schools. 1,200 teachers either teach English or both English and mathematics and 1,483 teachers
who teach either mathematics or both English and mathematics.


Content knowledge among Tanzanian teachers seems extremely low. As a matter of fact, only
one out of five (21.5 percent) teachers score more than 80 percent on the combined mathematics
and English test (Table 13). A familiar feature by now, there is no significant difference across strata
even though a higher share (26 percent) of teachers in Dar es Salaam manages to score 80 percent
or more, the difference with other strata is small and not significant. Overall however, all display
equally disappointing levels of content knowledge.

Table 13 details the average score on the various parts of the assessment. Table 13 shows the
extremely low scores on the English section ‐‐ a shocking 1.1 percent of teachers were above the 80
percent cut‐off and this partly accounts for the overall low scores. Although mathematics teachers
fared better, only one out of three (25.5 percent) were above the 80 percent cut‐off.

13 See “Teaching Standards and Curriculum Review“, prepared as background document for the SDI by David Johnson,

Andrew Cunningham and Rachel Dowling. The countries included for the review were: Botswana, Ethiopia, Gambia,
Kenya, Magadascar, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.

                                                                  28
Table 13 and Figure 4 show the scores in the tests. Unlike the Minimum knowledge indicator, which
captures the share of teachers who score above a threshold, the scores simply capture the
proportion of questions teachers – taken as a whole- were able to answer as a share of the total
number of questions. Taking mathematics and English together, teachers found roughly three out
of five (58.9 percent) questions on the whole test. Clearly scores in mathematics are higher
compared to English or pedagogy across all strata. Mathematics teachers correctly found two out
of three questions (63.1 percent). As expected, teachers score poorly in English with an average
score of 42.2 percent but they score even worse in pedagogy.

Tanzanian teachers, therefore, have a low pedagogic content knowledge which is critical for
effective teaching. As a matter of fact, even when teachers have a deep knowledge of their subject
matter, only a decent level of pedagogic knowledge content ensures that they can pass that
knowledge onto their pupils. In Tanzania, there is room for progress for teachers to reach and stay
at a reasonable level for both subject matter knowledge and pedagogic content knowledge.

Dar es Salaam teachers did significantly better than teachers in EQUIP-T regions across all subjects
and did significantly better than rural teachers only in mathematics. The difference between Dar
es Salaam teachers and other urban teachers was significant for none of the subject matters except
for pedagogy, if one adopts a looser confidence level of 10 percent. The next sections carry out a
more in-depth investigation of teachers’ performance on each of the three tests (i.e., English,
mathematics and pedagogy).

 D. Test scores

Methodological Note

Test score is measured as the overall score of a language, mathematics and pedagogy tests covering the primary
curriculum administered at the school level to all mathematics and language teachers that taught 3rd grade last
year or 4th grade in the year the survey was conducted.


 English

 Table 14 presents the average score on the English test, as well as a detailed analysis of
 particular questions. The average score is 42 percent correct answers indicating that teachers
 do not even master half of the standard four curriculum. Nevertheless, this gives a much more
 positive picture than the Minimum knowledge indicator, whereby only 1.4 percent of the teachers
 scored more than 80 percent on the test. Even lowering the bar to a 70 percent mastery of the
 curriculum, only 4.9 percent of the teachers reached the bar.

 Teachers scored an average close to 75 percent on the grammar assessment, which asked
 them to complete sentences with the correct conjunction, verb (active or passive voice and
 different tenses) or preposition. Four alternatives, including the correct one, were given for each
 sentence. Despite the good grammar scores, there were some serious gaps. For example, more than
 half (55 percent) of the teachers were not able to correct the sentence “If you tidy up your room, you
 won’t get candy”, even though the correct alternative (“unless”) was given (recall that teachers were
 asked to mark a hypothetical pupil’s exam).

 Scores on the Cloze exercise which assesses vocabulary and text comprehension were
 somewhat lower (53 percent). The exercise consisted of a short story with certain words removed,
 and the teachers had to fill the gaps in a meaningful way. Again, some weaknesses emerged. While
 teachers were able to confirm that pupils had answered correctly, they struggled to correct wrong
 answers or complete sentences that the pupil had left blank. For example, 71 percent of teachers
 could not correct the sentence “I want not go to school.”


 14Note that the apparent inconsistency of having a minimum knowledge score of both mathematics and English greater
 than the minimum knowledge for only English or only mathematics comes from the fact that some teachers are evaluated
 on only one subject.

                                                                30
Teachers recorded their worst performance on the composition exercise with an average
score of only 21 percent. They were tasked to correct a letter for grammar, punctuation, spelling,
syntax and salutation. Sentences like "I went to tell you that my new school is better the oldone" were
set for correction. Overall, the text to be corrected contained 21 errors and the teachers, on average,
caught 4.6 mistakes. Only 25 percent of the teachers found and corrected seven or more mistakes in
the standard four level six-line English paragraph.

Teachers in Dar es Salaam and other urban areas performed significantly better in grammar
than teachers in EQUIP-T regions or rural areas. Dar es Salaam teachers actually significantly
outperformed EQUIP-T and rural teachers in all sub-sections of the English test. When compared to
other urban teachers, though, the difference in score was only statistically significant for the overall
English score.


Mathematics

Table 15 presents the performance of teachers on the mathematics test, as well as a detailed
analysis of particular questions. (For a full breakdown of the mathematics results, see Table C 3.)
First, it is interesting to note that nationally about 1 in 100 teachers had a perfect score and 9 percent
found and corrected 90 percent of the mathematics questions. Slightly more than one out of 4 (25.5
percent) of the teachers met the Minimum knowledge standard of 80 percent. There is clearly a lot of
room for progress, yet this is undoubtedly a much more positive and encouraging picture compared
to English.

The average score on the mathematics section was 63 percent correct answers and we observed a
large and significant difference (19.2 percentage points) between scores on the lower and upper
parts of the primary curriculum. This means that teachers were much more at ease with simple
operations, such as adding two- or three-digit numbers, than with slightly more complex
computations such as comparing fractions. This pattern holds true in all parts of the country even
though standard four teachers are expected to master and be equally at ease with all parts of the
curriculum. As for the English test, Dar es Salaam teachers outperformed teachers in EQUIP-T regions
or rural areas but their scores were, on average, not statistically different from those of urban
teachers. It was for only two questions that Dar teachers outperformed other urban school teachers;
these are (i) computation of a square root and (ii) geometry 2D shapes (namely, finding the number
of sides of a triangle).

Looking at the details of the test from Table 15, 14 percent of the teachers could not subtract
two-digit numbers; the same proportion could not multiply two-digit numbers; one out of three
could not add or subtract numbers with decimals; and roughly every other teacher could not perform
division with fractions, solve a one variable equation, or interpret a Venn diagram. Almost three out
of four teachers could not interpret data on a graph, which is upper primary level material, but should
be mastered by teachers.

  Pedagogy

  The overall score on the pedagogy section was 36 percent with little difference between basic and
  more advanced questions (Table 16). 15 On average, teachers only managed about one‐third of the
  tasks in the pedagogic test. Although all teachers seem to lack pedagogical skills, the extent is more
  serious in rural schools or schools in EQUIP-T regions when compared to Dar es Salaam. Overall,
  teachers in urban schools are no different than their rural counterparts when it comes to pedagogic
  content knowledge: they are all equally ill-equipped. This is clearly illustrated by the “minimum
  knowledge” indicator whereby only one out of 1000 (0.1 percent) teacher scored more than 80
  percent on the pedagogy test. Even lowering the standard to 50 percent, only one out of five teachers
  (Figure 5) would reach the bar.

  The pedagogy test consisted of three sections designed to capture all the skills teachers would
  routinely be asked to apply when teaching. 16 The first section asked teachers to prepare a lesson plan
  about road accidents in Tanzania based on a simple information‐giving text they had read. The
  average score on this task was the lowest at 18 percent. The second task asked teachers to assess and
  compare children’s writing on the basis of two sample letters. The average score on this task was 58



  15Actually, quite surprisingly, teachers scored better on advanced pedagogy compared to basic pedagogy.
  16Because the aim is to measure pedagogical skills, not English, the text was written in Kiswahili, except in places where
  English was part of the exercise.

                                                                  32
percent. The final task asked teachers to inspect test scores of 10 children, aggregate them and make
some statements about patterns of learning. This task received a score of 22 percent.

The low scores on the pedagogy section combined with the performance on the curriculum content
imply that teachers know little more than their pupils and that the little they know, they cannot teach
adequately.

Sensitivity of Minimum Knowledge to the cut-off point

Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the Minimum knowledge indicator to different cut‐offs (i.e.,
requiring a score of 100 percent, 90 percent, etc.). First, note that teachers performed better in
mathematics compared to English or pedagogy, no matter the standard used. The English graph also
(first-order) stochastically dominates that of pedagogy, meaning that teachers fared better in
English than pedagogy, no matter the standard for minimum knowledge. Overall, the results appear
fairly sensitive to the choice of threshold, especially for English and pedagogy. For mathematics, the
share of teachers who met the standard smoothly and steadily increases across the spectrum the
lower the threshold. For English and pedagogy, however, almost no teacher met the standard until
the threshold is set at 60 percent of mastery of the curriculum. At this point, 6.4 percent and 12.4
percent of the teachers scored enough to meet the standard in pedagogy and English, respectively.
There is a very sharp increase in the proportion of teachers that met the standard when it is lowered
from 60 percent to half and then 40 percent of the curriculum. There is a jump of 43 percentage points
for English and 36 percentage points for pedagogy when the standard moves from 60 to 40 percent.
As noted before, however, it seems reasonable -if not too low a bar- to request teachers to master at
least 80 percent of the curriculum they teach for them to deserve to stand in front of a classroom.

Determinants of teacher’s performance

Are there key determinants or correlates of teachers’ performance that one can identify? It is
widely recognized now that what teachers know is the most important driver of what pupils learn
(see Metzler, and Woessmann, 2012, among others). In turn, teachers’ knowledge and performance
can have long lasting impact on their pupils through labor market outcomes and productivity as
shown by Hanushek (2011).

As expected, gender, education level, training, and teaching experience prominently figure among the
usual suspects for teacher’s quality determinants. There are clearly more variables that influence
teacher’s quality but the regression results in Table 17 focus on those few important aspects and
check how strongly they are correlated with teachers’ standardized scores in mathematics, English,
pedagogy, and combination scores of those three.

Perhaps surprisingly, female teachers performed less well than their male colleagues across the
board except in English. Controlling for a host of other factors, female teachers, on average, scored
an astonishing 0.28 standard deviation (SD) in mathematics and 0.14 SD in pedagogy. Older teachers
also scored less well with five additional years of age also lowering the mathematics score by 0.11
SD. Specialized teachers (i.e., teachers who teach only one subject) performed better than teachers
who teach multiples subjects. For instance, mathematics- or English-only teachers scored 0.328 SD
and 0.378 SD more on their respective subject compared to teachers who taught both subjects.
However, mathematics-only teachers scored significantly more poorly in pedagogy than English or
non-specialized teachers.

Because education level and teacher training are highly correlated, only the first is included in the
regression analysis of Table 17. The large majority (85 percent) of Tanzania’s primary school

teachers reported to have completed lower secondary school and have, therefore, finished the O-
level. 17 Few but a non-negligible share (four percent) have not even transitioned out of primary level.

17According to MoEVT’s policy (MoEVT, 2007), completing A-level secondary is necessary to enroll for a teacher
education diploma course. The standard for hiring teachers have clearly slipped.

                                                                    35
Level of education has a strong impact on teachers’ test performance. Teachers who reported only
completing primary scored significantly worse across the board. Unlike English, mathematics scores
are not very responsive to higher education with teachers with A-level education or even university
degrees performing at the same level than O-level teachers. This might be due to the level of the test
itself and the fact that English is not used very widely in primary schools. Finally strata dummies
confirm that EQUIP-T and rural teachers are the worst performers. Dar es Salaam teachers
outperform teachers in other urban areas in all subjects except mathematics.



Delays in salary and unpaid claims

It is expected that the level of effort teachers exert both by showing up at school and also maintaining
a “normal” level of teaching time by spending more productive time in the classroom is highly
correlated with teachers’ incentives. In a system that provides proper incentives one can reasonably
expect that teachers will exert higher levels of effort than shown in Table 8. In Tanzania, the salience
of teachers’ incentives has been fully recognized. The Big Results Now initiative (2013) report has
identified the key challenge as “the teaching profession is not respected, and teachers lack
motivation, accountability and commitment to deliver”. The BRN Education Lab had set itself to kick
start a “teacher perception transformation” through both monetary and non-monetary incentives.
One important issue the BRN Education Lab set as a priority was the resolution of teachers’ unpaid
claims. The lab suggested that all outstanding claims should be cleared and all upcoming claims
handled in a swift manner by inter alia allocating a ring-fenced budget for teachers’ allowances. In
addition to allowances, the most basic incentive for teachers is their salary. Delays in the receipt of
salary can discourage and demotivate teachers.

Table 18 shows teachers’ answers to the questions (1) “how many times have you had a delay in
salary over the past 12 months?” and (2) Do you have any other unpaid claim?” Almost one out of
three teacher (32.9 percent) claimed to have experienced at least one salary delay over the year
preceding the survey. Teachers in urban areas other than Dar es Salaam were more likely to report
such a delay. Table 18 also suggests that unpaid claims were yet to be cleared with almost half (46.7
percent) of the teachers reporting at least one unpaid claim. Dar es Salaam teachers were, again,
more likely to report an unpaid claim with 70.4 percent of them doing so. The most prevalent unpaid
claim nationally was salary arrears (23.7 percent) followed by leave (9.4 percent) and relocation
allowance and hardship pay with 3.5 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.

IV.      ASSESSMENT OF PUPIL LEARNING

Given that Kiswahili is the main medium of instruction in Tanzania’s primary schools, a set of
pupils were administered exactly the same English test except that it was translated into
Kiswahili. Altogether, the language test included six tasks. All the pupils sat for the same
mathematics test irrespective of the language test they took. The overall results for the
English/Kiswahili and mathematics scores are reported in Table 19.

Unsurprisingly, pupils scored much higher on the Kiswahili test compared to English. Indeed,
the pupils who sat for Kiswahili correctly answered 64.5 percent of questions on the overall test
compared to 49.5 percent for those tested in English. 18 The average score in mathematics was 58.3
percent and is exactly the same for both groups of pupils. Therefore, language score differences fully
account for the difference in average test scores. As a matter of fact, the average score in English was
only 37 percent, whereas the pupils scored an average of 81 percent in Kiswahili, a very
commendable performance. The pupils were also tested on four non-verbal reasoning questions and
received an average score of 53.7 percent on that part of the assessment. 19

Unlike the other indicators, a sharp pattern appears for regional inequality in the pupils’ test
scores. Dar es Salaam pupils significantly outperformed pupils in the other urban areas, who in turn
outperformed pupils in rural areas and EQUIP-T regions. The scores for the last two were not
statistically distinguishable. This pattern holds for all sections of the test. As a consequence, urban
pupils scored significantly higher than rural pupils. However, girls and boys performed at par. Quite
surprisingly, whether the pupil had breakfast – at home or at school - did not make a difference when
compared to those who were not fortunate enough to have breakfast.

While the average total score provides interesting information, looking into the details of the test can
give even more insights. Table C 4 and Table C 5 break down the results for English/Kiswahili and
mathematics, respectively.

For Kiswahili, close to nine out of 10 pupils manage the simplest tasks, such as identifying a
letter or recognizing a simple word. Actually, Kiswahili test takers performed well even with more
complex tasks, such as reading a five-word sentence (83.1 percent) or a 50-word paragraph (74.9
percent), even though one out of four pupils could not read the paragraph. The performance
significantly drops down to 63.5 percent when pupils were asked factual comprehension questions
about the paragraph they read, and only 42.8 percent of them could answer a question requiring
higher analytical skills.

The picture is completely different for English, with pupils unable to identify a simple
alphabet letter one out four times they were asked to do so. When it comes to more complex
tasks, only one out of three pupils (31.4 percent) could read a 10-word sentence and a dismal 2.7
percent could fluently read the 58-word paragraph with which they were presented. 20 Given this, it
is not surprising that only around one out of eight (13 percent) of the standard four pupils could
answer a factual question about the text and one out of seven (17.6 percent) could answer a question
about the meaning of the passage.

18 The total score is a simple average of all questions in the Kiswahili/English and mathematics sections. A correct
answer collects one point and a wrong answer is worth zero.
19 Just as for mathematics, the pupils performed similarly on NVR irrespective of the language test they took.
20 Only 37 percent of the pupils could read at least half of the words in that paragraph.

                       Box 4. Background on the SDI Pupil Assessment

It is instructive to think of the Service Delivery Indicators as measuring key inputs, with a focus on
what teachers do and know, in an education production function. These inputs are actionable and
they are collected using objective and observational methods at the school level. The outcome in such
an education production function is pupil learning achievement. While learning outcomes capture both
school‐specific inputs (e.g., the quality and effort exerted by the teachers) and various child-specific
factors (e.g., innate ability) and household-specific factors (e.g., the demand for education), and
thus provide, at best, reduced form evidence on service provision, it is a still an important measure
to identify gaps and to track progress in the sector. Moreover, while the Service Delivery Indicators
measure inputs ‐‐ and learning outcomes are not part of the Indicators ‐‐ in the final instance we
should be interested in inputs not in and of themselves, but only in as far as they deliver the outcomes
we care about. Therefore, as part of the collection of the Service Delivery Indicators in each country,
learning outcomes are measured for grade four pupils.

The objective of the pupil assessment was to measure basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills. The
test was designed by experts in international pedagogy and based on a review of primary curriculum
materials from 13 African countries (For details on the design of the test, see Johnson, Cunningham and
Dowling (2012) “Draft Final Report, Teaching Standards and Curriculum Review”). The pupil
assessment also measured nonverbal reasoning skills on the basis of Raven’s matrices, a standard IQ
measure that is designed to be valid across different cultures. This measure complements the pupil test
scores in language and mathematics and can be used as a rough measure to control for innate
pupil ability when comparing outcomes across different schools. Thus, the pupil assessment consisted
of three parts: language, mathematics and non‐verbal reasoning (NVR).

The test, using material up to the grade three level was administered to grade four pupils. The reason
for choosing pupils in grade four is threefold. First, there is scant information on achievement in lower
grades. SACMEQ, for example, tests pupils in grade six. Uwezo is a recent initiative that aims to
provide information on pupils’ learning irrespective of whether they are enrolled in school or not
and tests all children under the age of 16 on grade two material. While this initiative has provided
very interesting results, it is not possible to link pupil achievement to school level data, since the
survey is done at the household level. Second, the sample of children in school becomes more and
more self‐selective as one goes higher up due to high drop‐out rates. Finally, there is growing
evidence that cognitive ability is most malleable at younger ages. It is therefore especially important
to get a snapshot of pupil learning and the quality of teaching provided at younger ages.

The test was designed as a one‐on‐one test with enumerators reading out instructions to pupils in their
mother tongue. This was done to build up a differentiated picture of pupils’ cognitive skills; i.e. oral
one‐to‐one testing allows us to evaluate whether a child can solve a mathematics problem even
when her reading ability is so low that she would not be able to attempt the problem independently.
The language test consisted of a number of different tasks ranging from testing knowledge of the
alphabet, to word recognition, to a more challenging reading comprehension test. Altogether, the test
included six tasks. The mathematics test also consisted of a number of different tasks ranging from
identifying and sequencing numbers, to addition of one‐ to three‐digit numbers, to one‐ and two‐digit
subtraction, to single digit multiplication and divisions. The mathematics test included six tasks and a
total of 17 questions. The non-verbal reasoning section consisted of four questions.

Mathematics scores were slightly better than the English scores, but below the Kiswahili
performance. There were still some significant knowledge gaps. In terms of operations, the pupils
performed better when handling tasks involving only one-digit numbers, except for addition where
60.2 percent of the pupils could add two three-digit numbers. In order of performance, mastery of
addition was followed by subtraction, then division as a distant third and, finally, multiplication
closely followed. For operations involving two-digit numbers, 39.3 percent of the pupils could do
subtraction but this performance dropped down to 18.1 percent for division, and 12.1 percent for
multiplication. Very few pupils could perform on questions that required higher analytical skills, such
as completing a sequencing of numbers with a specific pattern (14.1 percent) or problem‐solving
task (8.9 percent).

Although the pupils correctly answered more than half of the mathematics questions, the test
revealed that the majority of standard four pupils did not perform well at the standard three
level. For example, the complete 9x9 multiplication table is intended to be taught by standard
three; simple division is also clearly in the curriculum. However, only 40 percent of the standard four
pupils could perform 6÷3 or 7x8.

Pupils in Dar es Salaam schools performed significantly better across the board. They were
followed by pupils in other urban areas, who also performed significantly better than rural and
EQUIP-T pupils. Dar es Salaam pupils correctly answered 34 percent and 25 percent more questions
than EQUIP-T pupils in English and mathematics, respectively. They also outperformed pupils in
rural schools on non‐verbal reasoning by 16 percentage points. For division involving two-digit
numbers, Dar’s pupils outperformed EQUIP-T pupils by almost four to one. For more complex
operations, such as problem-solving or completing a sequence, all pupils performed poorly. But
pupils in Dar es Salaam schools were five times more likely to get it right than EQUIP-T school pupils
(23.8 percent vs. 4.2 percent and 26.9 percent vs. 6.7 percent, respectively).


                                                            39
Interestingly, socio-economic status and gender seemed to have no impact on pupils’
performance. Indeed, pupils who had breakfast before coming to school, who, on average, probably
live in better-off households, performed at par with children who showed up at school with an empty
stomach. There was also no noticeable difference between boys and girls.

Figure 6 shows how performance in reading a language paragraph relates to performance in
mathematics. The histograms show the distribution of pupils by the number of words they could
read in the paragraph (58 words for English and 50 for Kiswahili). The lines show the average
mathematics score (on the right-hand side, vertical axis) against the number of words successfully
read by the pupils. The distribution of number of words read in Kiswahili shows some pupils
bunching on zero, then very few pupils reading between one and 40 words, and, finally, the majority
of pupils reading on the higher end of the distribution and the biggest bunching on a perfect score
(actually, 53 percent of children correctly read the entire Kiswahili paragraph). For English, the
bunching is on zero with around 26 percent of the pupils who could not read a single word; then, the
distribution is roughly uniform across the remaining of the support, meaning a more or less similar
number of kids could read 10 or 17 or 35 words in the paragraph.

The graphs clearly show that mathematics and language are strongly positively correlated.
This means the more words the pupils read correctly, whether English or Kiswahili, the better they
performed in mathematics. The grey area depicts the 95 percent confidence interval around that
score. The mathematics scores are fairly precisely estimated across the board for English test takers,
whereas the confidence intervals are large for Kiswahili. This happens mostly in the middle range
because pupils scored either very poorly or reasonably well on Kiswahili and are, therefore, at the
extreme of the distribution. There are also more children tested in English than Kiswahili. The graphs
also show that, even though Kiswahili and English test takers performed similarly on average, the
best performers in English (i.e., those who were able to read all or almost all the words) performed
better in mathematics than their peers in Kiswahili.

Correlations between service delivery indicators and learning outcomes

As stated earlier, the service delivery indicators are, by no means, an end in and of themselves. In
fact, they matter if, and only if, they explain and are somehow related to pupils’ learning, which is
what the population and the policy-makers care most about. Table C 6 to Table C 10 show a series of
simple regressions of pupils’ test scores for various subjects on individual service delivery indicators.
The scores, as well as the indicators, are averaged at the school level and standardized.

The top panel (Panel A) shows the regression results for all the schools, whereas the sample is split
into urban and rural schools for the middle panel (Panel B) and bottom panel (Panel C), respectively.
All the indicators are significant in one regression or another and they always have the expected sign.
The coefficients also suggest that the indicators have relatively large effects; for example, pupils’
mathematics scores increased by 19 percent (resp. 15 percent) of a standard deviation, if teachers’
scores in mathematics increased by one standard deviation or if class size was reduced by one
standard deviation (see Table C 8). Infrastructure and time spent teaching also come out with strong
effects on learning.

 V.      SDI SPECIAL TOPIC: GENDER

Gender equality is a leading Millennium Development Goal (MDG 3) and its first sub-component is
about equality in education. The second MDG also is about gender equality because it advocates for
universal primary education. There is evidence that gender equality is a strong driver for economic
growth and, as put in simple terms by the 2012 WDR, gender equality is smart economics. Gender
equality in education is most probably the strongest route to full gender equality. This goal has been
embraced by most countries and many have reached the MDG, including Tanzania. Unfortunately,
though, equality in education is generally equated to having equal numbers of boys and girls in
school. Although ensuring that girls have as much access to education as boys is a worthy goal, it may
not be enough. One needs also to make sure that girls are treated in the same way as boys in schools
and classrooms and that they have equal access to inputs, be it books, stationery, toilets, or teachers’
time and attention.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in SDI and other facility surveys in Africa to
produce gender-disaggregated school and classroom observation data. 21 The SDI survey collected
the complete teacher roster in each and every visited school. Questions were asked of all teachers,
but subsequently a number of teachers have been sampled for investigating absence rates,
knowledge, and classroom practices. In its classroom observation module, the 2014 Tanzania
Education SDI survey collected detailed gender-disaggregated data. This section uses the collected
information to analyze and shed new light on gender issues in Tanzanian primary schools and
classrooms.


A. Teachers’ characteristics by gender of head teacher

Tanzania has succeeded in achieving gender parity, not only for pupils, but also for teachers
in its primary education system. Table 20 indeed shows that women constituted half (49.8
percent) of primary school teachers body. There was quite a lot of regional variation hidden in this
average. For instance, in Dar es Salaam an overwhelming majority (84 percent) of teachers were
female. The same was true in other urban areas, albeit with a smaller but still strong majority, with
74 percent of female teachers. In contrast, rural schools were still lagging behind in teacher gender
parity with only two-in-five female teachers (40 percent).

directly to the pupil instead of direct observation as is the case with SDI.

In school management, however, females were grossly under-represented with less than one
out of five (18 percent) of the head teachers a woman. Even though they had the same weight (in
terms of number of people) in the teaching force, women are five times less likely to head a school
compared to men. Rural areas displayed the biggest deficit of female school managers (14 percent),
but it was in Dar es Salaam that the gender gap (35 percent) was the most important. 22

Female-headed schools had on average 25.9 percent more female teachers a strong and
significant difference. As Table 20 shows, on average, seven out of 10 teachers in schools managed
by a woman were female compared to slightly more than four out of 10 (44 percent) in schools
headed by men. Women, in fact, constituted the majority of the teaching force in all schools, except
rural ones that are headed by men. In the latter schools, there were a 2:1 male to female teacher ratio.
It is also interesting to note that in terms of teacher staff size, female-headed schools were
significantly larger than those headed by men. This held true across all strata (Figure 7) and the
average female head of school had to manage 3.9 more teachers than her male counterpart.

     Overall, the education profile of male and female primary school teachers was fairly similar,
     as shown in Table 21. The vast majority of primary school teachers (86.7 percent) have just
     completed the ordinary secondary level (i.e., four years of post-primary). The remaining 14 percent
     of teachers were almost equally distributed across the other education levels with four percent who
     completed primary (i.e., the level they teach), five percent completed the advanced secondary level,
     and four percent went beyond secondary level.

     The distribution of teachers across schools seems, however, to depend on the sex of the head
     teacher. Indeed, it appears as if teachers who have gone beyond the O-level were more likely to end
     up in a female-headed school. This is even stronger for female teachers, 9.1 percent of whom have
     gone beyond O-level but 13.6 percent were in female-headed schools vs. seven percent in male-



22The gender gap is measured as the difference between proportion of female in the teaching force and the
share of female in school managerial positions.

                                                                     43
headed school. Better educated female teachers, who are likely to have more say in their options,
seemed to choose to teach in female-headed schools.

Does the sex of the head teacher also influence teachers’ behavior? We already learned in an
earlier section of this report that male and female teachers were equally likely to be absent (from
school and the classroom). This is confirmed in Table 22, but it also shows that male teachers behaved
differently in school depending on the sex of the head teacher. Male teachers were almost 10
percentage points more likely to be in the classroom teaching when the head teacher was a man
compared to a woman. This difference is entirely explained by the fact that the teachers were in
school, but not in the classroom. Female teachers, in contrast, displayed, by and large, the same
behavior irrespective of the sex of the head teacher. Table C 11 offers more results on teachers’
practices in the classroom broken down by gender.

Finally, we looked into the intensity of classroom supervision (Figure 8) and the incidence of salary
delays and unpaid claims (Table 23) by the sex of teachers and head teachers. It is noteworthy that
most teachers (54 percent) said that the head teacher comes to observe their classroom at least once
a week. Male head teachers seemed to scrutinize their female teachers more intensively. In contrast,
there is no noticeable difference in classroom observation by female head teachers, who treated all
teachers equally in terms of classroom observation.

 Many teachers reported receiving their salary with delay (roughly one in three) and unpaid claims
 (roughly one in two). There is, however, no significant difference in salary delays with male and
 female teachers equally likely to have experienced a delay and irrespective of the sex of their head
 teacher. However, there were significant difference in terms of unpaid claims. About 45 percent of
 male teachers reported an unpaid claim. This proportion is the same whether the head teacher was
 a man or a woman. Female teachers, on the other hand, were significantly more likely (6.1 percent)
 to report an unpaid claim. In addition, female teachers in a female-headed school were the ones most
 likely to report unpaid claims with a 9.4 percent significant difference with male teachers working
 under a female head.


 B. Gender effects of classroom environment and teaching practices

 In each school, one standard four classroom was observed during an English or mathematics lesson.
 The objective of the classroom observation was to have a better understanding of the dynamics in a
 typical standard four class. Information was collected on the classroom environment and how the
 teacher carried out her teaching activity (i.e., how she behaved with pupils, whether she asked
 questions, provided feedback, went individually to the pupils, called them by name, etc.). Most of the
 questions were gender-disaggregated (for instance, the enumerator was asked to note the pupil’s
 gender when recording the number of pupils who went to the blackboard).

 Teachers led and maintained gender-balanced classrooms in terms of access to and use of
 inputs (Table 24). Female teachers had larger classes with a difference of almost nine pupils. The
 gender composition of the classes was, however, similar with roughly 54 percent of girls in the
 classroom irrespective of the teacher’s gender. In terms of access to inputs such as textbooks, pens
 or pencils, or exercise books, girls and boys had access in the same proportion as they were in the
 class (i.e., of the pupils who had access to the inputs roughly 52 to 54 percent are girls). The major
 exception concerned textbooks, with girls being slightly at a disadvantage with male teachers. To
 illustrate, in the average male teacher’s classroom, only 23 percent of the pupils had a textbook and
 among those, 48 percent were girls. However, girls represent 54 percent of the classroom population.

                                                                45
            This difference was not apparent when the teacher was female. There was no difference either for
            pens or exercise books, but this could be a reflection of the near universal access to those inputs with
            96 percent of pupils having them. As they were in short supply, books were widely shared among
            pupils. Indeed, if only 25 percent of the pupils could show they had the textbook handy, 39 percent
            used it while in the classroom.

            Table 25 shows regression results for many teaching practices as observed in the classroom. (For a
            fuller breakdown of teaching practices, see Table C 12.) Each row represents a regression. The first
            three columns show combinations of head teacher/teacher by sex. The reference group is HM-TM,
            whereby both the head teacher and the teacher are male. The fourth column is the share of female
            teachers in the school. Finally, the regressions control for stratum with Dar es Salaam as the reference
            region. By and large, the teachers’ interaction with their classroom seemed quite gender-balanced.

            There is no discernable gender effect in keeping attendance, having a scheme of work, introducing or
            summarizing the lesson, or providing feedback (positive or negative) to pupils. Teachers also visited
            pupils or sent them to write on the blackboard with no differences in gender from the teachers’ or
            the pupils’ side. There are, however, a few interesting exceptions. The textbook-gender imbalance
            effect noted in Table 24 is confirmed by the regressions (rows 4 to 6). Girls are significantly more
            likely to have access to a textbook when they have a female teacher compared to a male teacher
            regardless of the sex of the head teacher although their likelihood to access a textbook is enhanced
            when the head of the school is a woman as well. A girl with a female teacher in a female-headed school
            had 8.7 percent more chance to have a book than her similar peer with a male teacher in a male-
            headed school. The share of female teachers is also a strong driver for a higher share of girls using
            textbooks or writing on the board. Finally, it is intriguing that when the head teacher and the teacher
            were of opposite sex, the teachers were more likely to ask questions that required the pupils to use
            their creativity and imagination.

C. Pupils’ performance and teacher’s gender

Does teacher’s gender matter for pupil’s learning outcomes? Do girls perform better when
they are taught by a woman? There is a large literature on this topic (see Dickerson et al 2015,
Holmund and Sund 2008, and references therein). If teachers treat pupils differently according to
both the teacher’s and the pupil’s gender or pupils themselves behave according to their teacher’s
gender, this may impact pupils’ learning achievement. The impact may also be cumulative along the
life of the pupils through their primary cycle. A clear cut answer to this question may have deep policy
implications, but our data can only offer suggestive evidence for Tanzania.

Table 26 shows the results of a regression of pupils’ English or mathematics performances on a series
of variables of interest. It shows the effects of having a female teacher on all pupils’ test performance,
as well as on boys and girls taken separately. The teachers’ tests scores are also of special interest. A
number of school-level variables such as the share of female teachers or whether the school is headed
by a woman are also examined.

The first three columns show achievement in mathematics, whereas the last three are concerned with
the English test scores. The first regression was pooled for all pupils. The sample was, then, split
between boys and girls and the same model was run on each single-sex sample. The teacher is the
pupil’s teacher for the specific subject. Also we consider teacher’s scores on both subject.

Looking into mathematics achievement, column 1 shows a gender gap of 13 percent of a standard
deviation to the detriment of girls. Having a female teacher impacted negatively on pupils’
mathematics scores. Although, columns 2 and 3 show that this impact was only for boys, meaning
that boys performed better in mathematics when their teacher was a man. The teacher’s performance
on both English and mathematics had a strong positive effect on pupils’ mathematics scores. Again,
the single-sex regressions show that this impact appeared only for girls, meaning the better the
teacher performed, the better the girls’ mathematics performances, whereas this had surprisingly no
bearing on boys’ achievements. Finally, although the head teacher’s gender had no effect on the
pupils’ scores, the share of women teachers in the school strongly impacted the pupils’ performances,
irrespective of their sex, although the effect is stronger for girls.

The results for pupils’ performances in English are fairly similar to those in mathematics. However,
there are a few noticeable differences. For instance, a teacher’s mathematics performance had no
impact on pupils’ English achievement. Female teachers did not impact pupils’ scores, irrespective of
their gender. Finally, the more female teachers in the school, the better girls performed in English,
but this had, again, no impact on boys’ performances.

VI.         SDI COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

 After the SDI pilot in Senegal and Tanzania was carried out in 2010, the SDI was revised and rolled
 out in a number of countries such as Kenya and Uganda (2013), Nigeria, Togo, and Mozambique
 (2014). Tanzania was, however, the first country to implement a repeat survey that would allow for
 trend analysis. This second SDI has a great deal of overlap with the pilot, although there were a few
 indicators which were not comparable. It was, however, fully comparable to the 2013 and 2014 SDIs.
 Teachers and pupils were assessed with the exact same questions apart from minor changes,
 especially for names to contextualize the survey instruments. The same questions were also asked to
 heads of schools. Finally, during the analysis, the indicators were computed with the same program
 maximizing the comparability between Tanzania and the other SDI countries.

                                                                     48
    A. Comparing Tanzania to itself: SDI trends

    Tanzania, along with Senegal, was a pioneer country in the SDI by piloting the first SDI survey in
    2010. The instruments have been slightly updated since then, but the 2010 and 2014 SDIs have a
    great deal of overlap. Some indicators were not comparable and the data necessary to compute a new
    one may not have been available, but, by and large, it was possible to look into the trends in service
    delivery between 2010 and 2014.

    Table 27 shows how education indicators have evolved since the pilot SDI. In terms of access to basic
    infrastructure, there was no noticeable improvement in Tanzanian primary schools in the four years
    since the first SDI was carried out. Only two percent of the schools had electricity, clean water, and
    improved sanitation in 2014, down from three percent in 2010. Although urban schools seemed to
    have better infrastructure, they were actually statistically not distinguishable from their rural
    counterparts. As in 2010, the main constraint was again electricity, which was rarely available in the
    schools. Access to clean water, or its lack thereof, was also an issue across the board, but it was much
    more severe in rural schools.

Note: (*) For infrastructure, we used the 2010 SDI definition (i.e., school has access to electricity, water, and sanitation). This was because, in 2010,
the survey did not have lux meters to measure luminosity in the classrooms. For 2010, the minimum knowledge indicators were computed using
the 2014 definition on the 2010 test data, which explains differences with the 2010 SDI report. Source: Tanzania SDI 2010 and 2014 based on
author’s calculations.



    Class sizes, at least for the observed standard four classroom, dropped significantly from 52
    pupils in a classroom down to 43. This amounts to a reduction of almost 20 percent, despite a
    growing population and a growing demand for education. This improvement is almost entirely
    accounted for by the reduction in the size of rural classes. As a cautionary note, it is important to
    remember that the indicator captures the number of pupils in the classroom (i.e., attendance) which
    may be lower than the number of enrolled pupils.

    The most impressive progress registered in Tanzania is with teachers’ effort, especially school
    absence which dropped from 23 percent in 2010 to 14 percent in 2014, a 40 percent decrease.

                                                                         49
Figure 9 shows that urban schools deserved all the credit for this achievement. It is, however,
disappointing to note that improvement in school absence did not fully translate into classroom
absence. As a matter of fact, classroom absence decreased from 53 percent to 46 percent, but the
decline was not statistically significant and about half of the teachers were still not in the classroom.
The decline in urban areas was, however, significant and large, entirely due to the decline in school
absence. These findings are interesting because they show that it is very important to look into what
happens inside the schools. Indeed, among the teachers who showed up at school, the percentage of
those who were in classroom teaching has barely change between 2010 and 2014. Strengthening the
head teacher, in terms of leadership and management skills, seems of crucial importance for the
better working of Tanzanian primary schools.

The reduction in school and classroom absence benefitted the pupils, who between 2010 and
2014, gained 43 minutes of teaching time per day. Over the school year, which is on average 194
days, this was a gain of 24 days of full teaching, or more than a month. Urban pupils received an
impressive gain of teaching time; back in 2010, they only had 47 days of effective contact time with
their teachers and this doubled to 94 days in 2014. Despite this impressive improvement, one must
still keep in mind that Tanzanian primary pupils are still losing more than half of the teaching time
owed to them by the education system.

Teachers’ subject content knowledge in 2014 was low and has not changed compared to its
2010 level. Table 28 and Table 29 show trends in standard four teachers’ and pupils’ performance
in test scores, respectively. 23 Teachers’ performance was lowest in English and seems to have
worsened between 2010 and 2014. It was mainly teachers in rural school who experienced a decline
in their English skills. In mathematics, teachers scored on average 63 percent in 2010 compared to
65 percent in 2014, which is not a significant difference. Teachers scored well in simple arithmetic,
such as two-digit addition, and less so in more complex tasks, like operations with fractions. There is
no significant difference between 2010 and 2014 on the specific themes or topics, except for
operations involving monetary units where teachers’ scores have significantly declined.

Unlike their teachers, standard four pupils’ test performance showed improvement in some
areas. Pupils’ average English scores did not significantly change, but they performed better in
reading a paragraph and in reading comprehension. Still, pupils’ English performance was not good
with an average score around 40 percent. Pupils’ overall scores in mathematics improved
significantly. When compared to their older 2010 cohort, standard four pupils in 2014 performed
similarly for simple tasks, such as adding double digits or subtracting single digits, but outperformed
the 2010 cohort in more complex operations, such as multiplying two triple digits or dividing a
double-digit number by a single digit. Pupils in urban schools had the most significant improvement.




23 In terms of content, the tests did not change much between 2010 and 2014. However, the teachers’ test was improved
in its presentation. In 2010, it looked just like a test whereas, in 2014, the teacher’s test was designed like a marking
exercise in which teachers had to mark a hypothetical standard four pupil’s exam.

It is puzzling that pupils performed better, while their teachers’ performances have been stagnant or
might even be declining. This may be partly explained by the fact that pupils have been spending a
lot more time with their teachers as shown earlier in this report. This increased teaching time was
the resultant of lower school and classroom absence rates, which may have compensated for the
slight dip in knowledge. The reduction in class size may also have contributed to improvements in
test scores with teachers having more time to spend with individual pupils.


B. Comparing Tanzania to neighbors and others

Table 30 shows the national averages of the indicators for several SDI countries. Bearing in mind that
overall performance is low, Tanzania fares relatively well among the SDI countries in terms of inputs,
effort, and knowledge. The big-three in the East African Community - Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania –
which aim for stronger regional economic integration, are also included in this comparison. For
traditional quality indicators, such as infrastructure, Tanzania is doing worse than its EAC neighbors,
but better than Nigeria, Togo, and Mozambique. Ugandan and Kenyan schools, as well as schools in
Mozambique, had noticeably better levels of minimum equipment availability (79.5 percent, 74.3
percent, and 76.8 percent, respectively) compared to 62.4 percent for Tanzania. As shown in Table
7, the main constraint was sufficient contrast for pupils to be able to read the blackboard. In contrast,
Tanzanian schools fared better than Nigeria (48.2 percent) and Togo (24.3 percent) in regards to
minimum equipment availability. A similar picture emerges for infrastructure availability, although
the gap in infrastructure between Tanzania and its EAC neighbors was narrower. Tanzania did very
poorly with textbook availability, only outperforming Uganda with the average grade four Tanzanian
pupil being more than four times more likely to use a textbook in the classroom than her Ugandan
peer. Pupils in Togo, Mozambique, Kenya, and Nigeria were, however, more likely to use a textbook
in class with 76 percent, 68.1 percent, 44.5 percent, and 33.7 percent of pupils, respectively, doing
so.

When it comes to teachers’ effort, Tanzania and Kenya displayed patterns with relatively low school
absence rates (14.4 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively), but high classroom absence rates with
almost half of the teachers not found in classroom at any point in time. Mozambique and Uganda have
significantly higher absence rates for both. The three West African countries (Nigeria, Senegal, and

                                                                   52
Togo) have much lower classroom absence rates. The difference between school absence rates and
classroom absence rates was also narrower, meaning that when teachers went to school they tended
to be in the classroom, although they were not necessarily teaching.

Kenyan, Ugandan, and Tanzanian teachers significantly outperformed Nigerian, Togolese, and
Mozambican teachers in minimum knowledge. Tanzanian teachers (21.5 percent) are second only to
Kenya (34.8 percent), who was the best performer, although it scored modestly with only one out of
three teachers scoring above the 80 percent-threshold to be considered as having minimum
knowledge of the grade four curriculum. Almost no teachers in Nigeria and Togo passed that bar.
Tanzanian teachers’ average test scores for all three sections of the skills test (48.3 percent) are also
second only to their Kenyan counterparts (55.6 percent). For all countries, teachers performed
significantly better in mathematics than language (English for all, except Togo which uses French).
There is a similar scenario with the overall pupil test results; once again, Tanzania falls behind Kenya
and Uganda with their pupils’ test performance (40.1 percent, 45.3 percent, and 69.4 percent,
respectively).

Table 31 provides information on the average scores of the different parts of the test, as well as more
details. Tanzania teachers ranked last on language among the five countries shown in Table 31. This
is certainly due to the fact that they were tested in English, although they were supposed to have
mastered that language. The composition task proved to be the hardest for all teachers, but this was
also the area where the gap between Tanzanian teachers and their East African peers was the largest
in language test.

In mathematics, Tanzanian teachers were second only to Kenyans. It was mostly for the upper
primary part of the test that Tanzanian teachers lost ground. However, they managed to score better
than their Kenyan counterparts on comparing fractions. Tanzanian teachers had difficulty in
interpreting data on a graph or Venn diagram. For more information on the mathematics results for
teachers in Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, see Figure C 3. Finally, in pedagogy, Tanzanian teachers
fared at par with Kenyans and outperformed Ugandans. They doubled the score of the West African
teachers. Tanzanian teachers outscored all others in “preparing a lesson plan” but lost ground on
“assessing pupil’s abilities.”

VII.     CONCLUSION: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR TANZANIA?

 Over the past decade, Tanzania has invested a lot of resources in its education sector. According to
 PMO-RALG (2014), for the fiscal year 2013/14, the education sector accounted for 17.4 percent of
 the government’s expenditure and 6.2 percent of GDP. This is slightly down from 19.1 percent and
 6.5 percent, respectively, in 2012/13 but is still in the ballpark of the education budget over the
 previous decade.

 Tanzania earned a return on its education investment with completion rates in primary that
 increased from 55 percent in 2000 to over 80 percent in 2012. Gender equality has also been
 achieved in primary education and girls are catching up fast in secondary, although they still lag
 behind. However, the recent 2012 catastrophic form four exam results were a wake-up call for the
 Government of Tanzania and all education stakeholders that beyond access indicators, the quality of
 education is a critical dimension not to be overlooked.

 It is now time to invest in quality education and the government has started this process with the
 Education Big Results Now initiative that clearly recognizes quality as the next frontier and a smart
 way to improve value-for-money of education public spending. The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI)
 results show that Tanzania is doing relatively well in terms of teachers’ school absence rates,
 although teachers are not always found in the classroom, even when they are in the school. The SDI
 also shows that Tanzanian primary schools need some upgrading in terms of infrastructure and
 teaching equipment, although this is not the most important issue.

 With only one out of five teachers mastering the curriculum they teach, teachers’ capacity (or its lack
 thereof) to teach their subject matter is critical and needs to be addressed. There is a wealth of
 evidence that teachers’ knowledge and their capacity to transmit it (i.e., pedagogical skills) is a major
 determinant of pupils’ learning outcomes.

 Comparing the 2010 and 2014 SDI surveys, one clearly notices that Tanzania has made substantial
 progress in some areas, but there are still remaining gaps. Also, the achieved progress is from a very
 low base and there is still quite a bit of room for the Tanzanian education system to deliver quality
 to its pupils and get them prepared and equipped to face competition in the national, regional, and
 international labor markets.

                  ANNEX A: TANZANIA SDI SAMPLING STRATEGY

The overall objective of the SDI is to produce accurate and representative indicators at the national,
urban, and rural levels. In some countries, like Tanzania, it may be required that the indicators be
representative at a sub-national level (e.g., region or province). The main units of analysis are
facilities (schools and health centers) as well as providers (teachers and health workers). In the case
of education, the SDI also aims to produce accurate information on standard four pupils’ performance
on Kiswahili, English, and Mathematics.

A1.    Sampling frame for the 2014 Tanzania SDI

The sampling frame for the 2014 Tanzania Education SDI was based on the 2012 EMIS data provided
by the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT). The original sample frame contained
15,331 schools with identifier variables, such as region and council. This was close to the 15,362
schools contained in the PLSE 2012 school ranking database. The final sample frame was purged of
the six schools that had no standard two pupils, which left the frame with 15,325 primary schools
overall. The frame contained only information on standard two’s enrollment, whereas SDI was
focused on standard four. A separate list of schools, which was used for the distribution of the so-
called “radar books,” was also obtained. This list had fewer schools (14,120), but enrollment numbers
for all grades. That information was used to estimate standard four enrollment. The number of pupils
enrolled in standard four was estimated at 1.2 out of a total primary pupil body of 8.1 million.

With 6,025 schools (almost 40 percent) with missing location information (i.e., urban/rural), the
sample frame had an important challenge to offer. The issue was dealt with by a two-step procedure.
First, all the schools located in a municipal council (MC) or a town council (TC) were considered
urban, whereas those in a district council (DC) were tallied in the rural column. This eliminated 1,447
schools, leaving us with 4,578 schools (30 percent) with unknown locations. For the second step,
because there was no other variable that could provide information on the location, the remaining
schools were randomly split between urban and rural, with 80 percent of the schools considered
rural. During the data collection, the head teachers were asked whether their school was urban or
rural. This new information was used for post-stratification adjustment.

Although the SDI is usually representative at the national, urban, and rural levels, in Tanzania it was
requested that the survey be also representative of the traditional strata in household surveys, which
were (1) Dar es Salaam, (2) other urban areas, and (3) rural areas. Because of a large DFID education
program, it was agreed to regroup the regions in which the EQUIP-T operates as a single stratum
called (4) EQUIP-T. Table A 1 shows the overall sample frame with the number of administrative
units, such as councils, the number of standard two pupils (our final variable used for weights), and
the total number of primary pupils within each stratum.

The stratification variables provided the domains (strata) and reporting levels (the analysis tables
followed these levels) of the survey. The stratification also depended on the most important
indicators to be measured in the survey (absence rates and performance levels). Finally, it was
advisable to order the clusters within each stratum by variables that were correlated with key survey
indicators for further implicit stratification when systematic selection was used.

A multi-stage clustered sampling strategy was adopted for the 2014 Tanzania SDI. The first stage
cluster selection was carried out independently within each explicit stratum. The primary cluster
considered was the council, which was, therefore, the primary sampling unit (PSU). At the second
stage, schools were selected and, at the third stage, teachers and standard four pupils. 25 It was
decided that within each stratum, except Dar es Salaam, 25 councils would be chosen with probability
proportional to size (number of standard two pupils). Note that this implied, that at this stage, a
standard two (and by extension standard four) pupil in each stratum had an equal probability for her
council to be selected.

A2.       Sample size and sample allocation for the 2014 Tanzania SDI

The optimal sample size of any survey depends on the precision required for the main estimates and
resource constraints. The precision of survey estimates depends on the sampling and non-sampling
errors. Whereas the sampling error can be measured within a survey, this is not the case for the non-
sampling error. The sampling error is smaller the larger the sample, but the non-sampling error
grows with the size of the survey. It is, thus, highly advisable to carry out a survey of reasonable
sample size that can be managed with effective quality controls to help contain the non-sampling
error.

To gauge the precision of the estimate, a previous similar survey or a survey measuring the same
indicator is very useful. For Tanzania, a pilot 180-school SDI survey was carried out in 2010. The pilot
SDI collected almost identical data to the present survey, therefore, providing us with a very strong
advantage for a good measure of design effect and standard errors as basis for the current survey
sampling strategy. The design effect is critical for determining the optimal sample size. It is the ratio
of the variance of an estimate based on the actual multi-stage sample design and the same variance,
if the sample was a simple random one of the same size. The design effect is a measure of the relative
efficiency of the sample design.




25 The selection of teachers and standard four pupils was done once the enumerator was at the school premises. For the

purpose of sampling schools, the number of standard two pupils was used as the weight variable with the (reasonable)
assumption that the ratio between standard two and standard four pupils was constant.

Table A 2 provides information on teachers’ school and classroom absence rates in the 2010 SDI
survey, which were estimated at 27 percent and 53 percent, respectively. It also varied a great deal
across the urban and rural strata used in the 2010 survey. The design effect for teachers’ absence
rate was around 3.0 and 2.6, which indicates a more or less efficient sampling strategy (it is, indeed,
not uncommon to have design effect above 3.0 for cluster sampling). The standard errors were,
however, relatively large, especially for urban areas, as shown by the wide confidence intervals. The
2014 SDI aimed at a national standard error around 1.2 percent for absence rates. Using the 2010
SDI as our basis, it was possible to estimate the necessary sample size, for any given standard error,
using the following formula:

                                                                                                                                10
                     14 (                                                  � ) ∙ �10 ∙ �
                                              � ) ∙ �14 ≈ 10 (                                                        �
                                                                                                                                                                              14




Because the design effect for the 2010 SDI was already at 3.0 for school absence, and the current SDI
planned for two more strata, it was expected to keep the design effect around the same level, keeping
the last item on the right hand side of the above equation at 1. It was, then, easy to compute the
necessary sample size given the objective of a 1.2 standard error. For that standard error, the
estimated sample size was 427 schools. Tolerating a slightly higher standard error of 1.3 percent for
school absence rate, the sample size came down to 364 schools. It was decided that 400 schools
would strike the right balance between the budget and the desired precision.

After determining the sample size, it remained to decide on the sample allocation across strata.
Because the number of strata in the 2014 SDI was larger than in the previous survey, we did not use
information from 2010 for allocating the 400 schools across the four strata. There are several
allocation mechanisms possible for efficient sampling. For the Tanzania 2014 SDI, an adjusted-
proportional allocation was used, whereby the share of schools in the stratum was similar to the
share of pupils in the stratum compared to the overall population. Adjustments were then made if,
for instance, in a given strata the number of schools allocated was too small due to the small pupil
population in the stratum. The final sample allocation is given in Table A 3.

A3.    Sampling schools, teachers, and pupils

Now that the total sample size and its allocation across strata had been decided, it remained to sample
the actual schools that were included in the final sample and, within each school, the pupils and
teachers to be assessed. This was done using a two-stage sampling method. First, in each stratum
schools were chosen within the selected councils. Once at a selected school, the enumerator selected
teachers and pupils depending on the structure of the classrooms.

The schools were chosen using probability proportional to size (PPS), where size was the number of
standard two pupils as provided by the 2012 EMIS database. As for the selection of the cluster, the
use of PPS implied that each standard four pupil within a stratum had an equal probability for her
school to be selected.

Finally, within each school, up to 10 standard four pupils and 10 teachers were selected. Pupils were
randomly selected among the standard four pupil body, whereas for teachers, there were two
different procedures for measuring absence rate and assessing knowledge. For absence rate, 10
teachers were randomly selected from the teachers’ roster and the whereabouts of those teachers
was ascertained in a return surprise visit. For the knowledge assessment, however, all teachers who
were currently teaching in primary four or taught primary three the previous school year were
included in the sample. Then a random number of teachers in upper grades were included to top up
the sample. These procedures implied that pupils across strata, as well as teachers across strata and
within a school (for the knowledge assessment) did not all have the same probability of selection. It
was, therefore, warranted to compute weights for reporting the survey results.

A4.    Weights for schools, teachers, and pupils

To be representative of the population of interest, sample estimates from the 2014 Tanzania SDI had
to be properly weighted, using a sampling weight, or expansion factor. Note that different weights
needed to be applied depending on the relevant level for the variable, which could be the school,
teacher, or pupil. The basic weight for each entity was equal to the inverse of its probability of
selection, which was computed by multiplying the probabilities of selection at each sampling stage.
All the weights were computed and included in the dataset.

School absence rate
Share of a maximum    It is measured as the share of teachers who are absent from school at a time of an
of 10 randomly        unannounced visit. It is measured in the following way: During the first announced
selected teachers     visit, a maximum of ten teachers are randomly selected from the list of all teachers
                      (excludes volunteer and part time teachers) who are on the school roster. The

unannounced visit
Classroom absence rate
Share of teachers     The indicator is measured as the share of teachers not in the classroom at the time of
who are present in    an unannounced visit. The indicator is constructed in the same way as school absence
the classroom         rate indicator, with the exception that the numerator now is the number of teachers
                      who are either absent from school, or present at school but absent from the classroom.
during scheduled
teaching hours as
observed during an
unannounced visit
Time spent teaching per day
Amount of time a      This indicator reflects the typical time that teachers spends teaching on an average
teacher spends        day. This indicator combines data from the staff roster module (used to measure
teaching during a     absence rate), the classroom observation module, and reported teaching hours. The
                      teaching time is adjusted for the time teachers are absent from the classroom, on
school day
                      average, and for the time the teacher teaches while in classrooms based on classroom
                      observations. While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and
                      non-teaching activities.

                      Teaching is defined very broadly, including actively interacting with students,
                      correcting or grading student’s work, asking questions, testing, using the blackboard
                      or having students working on a specific task, drilling or memorization. Non-teaching
                      activities includes working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class or doing
                      nothing and thus leaving students not paying attention.

Minimum knowledge
Share of teachers     It is measured as the percentage of teachers who can master the curriculum they
with minimum          taught. It is based on a mathematics and language tests covering the primary
knowledge             curriculum administered at the school and is calculated as the percentage of teacher
                      who score more than 80% on the language and mathematics portion of the test. The
                      test is given to all mathematics or language teachers that taught 3rd grade last year or
                      4th grade in the year the survey was conducted.


                      It is measured as the overall score of a mathematics, language and pedagogy tests

                      and language teachers that taught 3rd grade last year or 4th grade in the year the
                      survey was conducted.

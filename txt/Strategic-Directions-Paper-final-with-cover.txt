 i.    This paper sets out the context and proposes key directions for the IDA18
Replenishment round against the backdrop of ongoing strategic discussions on the future
of the World Bank Group (WBG). The WBG is assessing how its four arms – IDA, IBRD,
IFC and MIGA – can best support their clients and the international community in a rapidly
changing external environment. IDA is integral to the “Forward Look? discussions and is
adapting to meet the needs of its increasingly diverse clients to help them achieve development
goals when facing challenges such as: stubbornly high poverty; fragility, conflict and violence;
and significant development and capacity challenges in building functioning economies.

ii.      The international community now confronts a large and urgent task at a time of
limited resources. It needs to implement and fulfill the promise of a compelling and ambitious
agenda agreed in 2015 – the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Addis Ababa Action
Agenda (AAAA), and the Paris and Sendai agreements. At the same time, it needs to confront
and manage a range of increasing and complex challenges – global economic headwinds;
fragility and conflict; violent extremism; unprecedented refugee flows; climate change; natural
disasters; and health crises and pandemics – all requiring a coordinated international response
across multiple policy areas. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, challenges
facing one country have increasingly stronger spillover effects for other countries. The WBG, as
a global actor that supports individual countries to address complicated multi-sectoral challenges,
is well positioned to address these issues.

iii.    As part of the Forward Look discussions, the WBG is exploring ways to stretch its
impact, building on its roles as a country partner, private sector partner, and global
integrator. This exercise has identified five areas to focus on. First, how to improve the WBG’s
ability to assist the full spectrum of client segments, tailoring its support to the diversity of
country situations. Second, how to further strengthen our leadership on global and regional
issues. Third, the importance of expanding customized knowledge services, particularly south-
south learning. Fourth, building on changes introduced in past years, how to further enhance the
WBG’s ability to respond to clients in a fast and efficient way. Fifth, given the magnitude of the
challenges and the ambition of the 2030 agenda, how to scale up finance for development,
including through significantly increasing external leverage – especially from the private sector.

iv.     A results-driven IDA is integral to the WBG’s value proposition. IDA exemplifies
the comparative advantages of the WBG itself and draws on the qualities of the other parts of the
WBG to bring a unique and powerful set of services to the world’s poorest countries. IDA
provides concessional financing to the poorest WBG clients, and its proven country-based model
is an efficient channel for donor resources to promote the 2030 agenda. IDA is able to connect
global agendas with country action, and to partner with IFC and MIGA to bring the private
sector to the poorest and most fragile countries. IDA plays a critical role as an integrator across
the international system, bringing global partnerships with other organizations and countries at
all levels of development to its work in the poorest countries. IDA is integral to a full-service
WBG, providing urgently needed concessional resources to the poorest countries that need it the
most, and helping their smooth transition to IBRD status, including by exploring the leveraging
                                                  - ii -


of IDA’s equity to provide additional financing. Possible innovations in the WBG and IDA
could further assist in providing assistance tailored to a range of country circumstances.

v.      The IDA18 Replenishment discussions begin at a time when development gains in
the world’s poorest countries are uneven and tenuous. IDA’s diverse client countries include
small islands, Fragile- and Conflict-affected States (FCSs), commodity exporters and more
diversified economies. Despite overall progress in developing countries over the past decade,
progress has been uneven at the country level:

          Robust growth in developing countries in the past decade has shifted the global economic
           center of gravity towards the developing world. However, large differences in country
           growth performance are apparent, especially among a number of FCS where resurgence
           of conflict and fast population growth hindered poverty reduction.
          Important gains were made in poverty alleviation, with the global rate of extreme poverty
           in IDA countries nearly halving since 1990 with positive developments in promoting
           shared prosperity. Yet, these achievements were not uniformly strong, with extreme
           poverty increasingly concentrated in challenging environments and a high number of
           those that escaped extreme poverty remaining vulnerable to relapsing into it.
          Meanwhile, finance flows to IDA countries have expanded as a number of them gained
           access to more diverse financing options, with several issuing bonds in the international
           capital markets. Yet, for the majority of IDA countries, concessional resources remain the
           key source of external financing as they do not have access to market-based financing at
           affordable rates. Concerns remain over sustainability, selectivity and coordination among
           the sources of financing, and the vulnerable debt outlook in a number of countries.

vi.    IDA countries are facing significant economic risks. Global growth decelerated in
2015, with a slowdown in IDA countries from 5.9 percent in 2014 to 5.0 percent in 2015. This
mainly reflects sharp declines in commodity prices, weaker capital flows and subdued global
trade. In an environment where the room for policy makers in IDA countries to respond has
narrowed, the risk of reversal of hard-won achievements in poverty reduction is significant.
Particularly at risk are the approximately 50 percent of extreme poor and near poor in IDA
countries who live in countries where growth slowed down in 2015. This risk of reversal is
compounded by more frequent and severe adverse events – climate-related disasters, pandemics,
pressure from refugees, conflict and violence – to which IDA countries, especially the poorest
and small islands, are most vulnerable.

vii.       In this challenging context, IDA’s value proposition rests on four core pillars:

          Country solutions, global challenges. IDA translates global goals into country action.
           IDA:
              o is among the largest sources of country-based financing for urgent challenges
                such as climate change and on Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV);
              o customizes global knowledge to local conditions, brings country experience to
                global policy-making and facilitates knowledge sharing among countries;
                                         - iii -


       o invests in the data needed for evidence-based policy-making, monitoring results,
         and measuring progress against the SDGs;
       o supports countries to find regional solutions to development challenges, enabling
         collective action on cross-border challenges and helping overcome scale and
         capacity constraints for small states; and
       o partners, integrates and convenes, with a record of working together with other
         organizations and donors at the global, regional and country level.

   Essential tool for resilience, risk management and crisis response. IDA provides:
       o predictable, countercyclical financing and policy advice that helps countries
         protect essential public investments and services and build targeted social safety
         nets to protect the most vulnerable;
       o support to mainstream short- and long-term climate and disaster risks into
         countries’ development planning;
       o substantial on-the-ground knowledge and advice based on experience FCV,
         investing in fragility assessments, almost doubling financial support for FCS over
         the last 10 years and working upstream to address the socio-economic drivers of
         conflict;
       o assistance in helping countries manage refugee flows with knowledge, operations
         and partnerships; IDA could play a larger role helping to address the issue of
         forced displacement helping strengthen humanitarian/development coordination
         together with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR);
       o timely response to shocks and crises through IDA’s Crisis Response Window
         (CRW), which was exhausted in just the first year of IDA17; and
       o support for regional integration and addressing regional challenges through the
         Regional program, which – like the CRW – faces greater demand than it can
         finance.

   A long-term investor in institutions, infrastructure, inclusive growth and private
    sector development. IDA helps countries:
       o build resilient, inclusive economies, generating new sources of demand and
         growth for the global economy;
       o strengthen governance. IDA’s multi-sectoral long-term support helps countries
         by building institutions and capacity to grow and manage public finances, helping
         ensure that all resources are spent wisely;
       o build inclusive economies, where opportunity for all also promotes productivity,
         resilience and growth – including through important investments in education and
         health system strengthening, and mainstreaming gender considerations, including
         in the “hard? sectors;
       o develop the private sector as an engine for job creation and growth together with
         IFC and MIGA. Of the US$20 billion per year in infrastructure commitments the
         WBG averaged over the last 3 years, over half was in IDA countries, along with
                                             - iv -


              about one-third of IFC infrastructure investments and about three-fourths of all
              MIGA guarantees; and
           o develop quality infrastructure; IDA’s involvement helps assure quality across a
             project’s full life cycle.

      A sound investment, through:
           o a proven, country-led and performance-based model that, combined with the
             ability to leverage and multiply finance, delivers development results. This
             positions IDA well to help deliver the 2030 financing for development
             commitments as outlined in the AAAA and the “Billions to Trillions? paper;
           o flexibility to serve a diverse client base with a range of financing terms, working
             in tandem with IBRD as countries move up the income spectrum;
           o a strong results focus, reflected in robust accountability mechanisms which
             benefit from dialogue with WBG’s partnership of developed and developing
             countries; and
           o a long tradition of evolving through lessons learned and adapting to meet
             changing needs. IDA will continue to adapt and support statistical capacity
             building in IDA countries.

viii. The proposed overarching theme for IDA18 “Investing in growth, resilience and
opportunity?. The proposed overarching and special themes, aim to capture and expand upon
this value proposition. This overarching theme provides a frame for the four special themes of
IDA18. Three proposed special themes build on and deepen the IDA17 focus in the following
areas:

      Climate resilient development as a special theme acknowledges the growing impact of
       climate change on development outcomes, and hence the importance of building country
       resilience to protect hard-won development gains;
      Gender Equality as a special theme recognizes both the significant progress that has
       been made in closing gender gaps, especially in education, while acknowledging the
       unfinished agenda, especially in economic empowerment; and
      Fragility, Conflict and Violence as a special theme recognizes that this is among the
       most pressing global policy issues, and that FCV constitute major obstacles in achieving
       development goals with impacts at the country, regional and global levels.

ix.     The proposed new theme of Economic Transformation and Jobs calls for an
economy-wide framework that supports the potential of both firms and workers to build
assets and use market opportunities. It also requires a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder
approach – one that is gender informed, adapted to context (e.g., FCV, youth employment), and
encompasses the full range of jobs (e.g., farmers, self-employed as well as informal and formal
wage workers). The enabling environment, includes a focus on connectivity and capabilities of
individuals and firms, with a special emphasis on quality infrastructure to ensure long-term
growth. Effective interventions to advance connectivity and capabilities must be underpinned by
macro-fiscal stability, strong domestic resource mobilization capacity, as well as sound
                                                -v-


institutions, and good governance. This theme evolves from the IDA17 special theme of
inclusive growth, and reflects suggestions at the IDA17 Mid-Term Review (MTR) to capture
“jobs,? “private sector development,? “infrastructure,? and “economic transformation? in the
special themes.

x.      The proposed IDA18 Special Themes are inextricably linked. In fact, the 2030
agenda emphasizes that the development goals are not a menu of independent objectives, but
rather underscores their interconnections and need for integrated implementation. For example,
jobs with special attention to gender concerns are particularly important in fragile environments
that are further undermined by climate change. Meanwhile, female labor force participation and
prevention of gender based violence is important not only in fragile environments, but also in all
IDA countries to allow them to reach their full potential. Moreover, displacement of people can
be exacerbated both by fragility and conflict as well as by climate change. Additionally, more
and better jobs, made possible by a vibrant private sector and sizeable infrastructure investments,
are important for stabilizing fragile states but also for ensuring that women participate in
economic activity. Developing climate resilient growth strategies requires special attention to
gender issues as women, children and the elderly are most affected. IDA is uniquely placed to
address the interlinked challenges spotlighted by the special themes because of its global breadth,
country depth, analytical capacity, financial strength and ability to draw on IFC and MIGA
where appropriate.

xi.     IDA18 provides an opportunity to further strengthen these interlinkages. Deepening
the links across all special themes and all sectors, will support identification of opportunities to
enhance resilience through infrastructure, urbanization, and technology adoption at the firm
level. Access to energy, water, transport, and telecommunications infrastructure brings
opportunities for better earnings, access to health care, markets and education. Quality
infrastructure also addresses adaptation efforts in the form of reliable water and energy systems
that help communities protect livelihoods and assets from climate risks. These risks and
demographic factors can act as threat multipliers in environments where basic government
functions are weak and societies are not cohesive. Therefore, understanding better how climate
change and the youth bulge is likely to impact demand and supply of jobs and earnings in key
sectors (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and fisheries) and regions where the poor are concentrated will
be critical to designing appropriate policy and investment solutions.

 xii. A robust IDA18 will be critical for the international community to tackle today’s
ambitious development agenda in the midst of so many complex, interconnected challenges.
Demand for IDA’s help exceeds supply: IDA17 commitments of roughly US$19 billion were a
record for the first year of a replenishment period; the CRW was exhausted in its first year and
demand for the regional program greatly exceeds its current capacity. To play its part – as a
global integrator, a key tool in finding country solutions for global challenges, and a catalyst for
economic transformation and building resilience and inclusion – IDA needs to be able to come in
at a scale where it can have influence, draw in other financing and leverage resources. In a world
of complex global challenges, a strong IDA18 replenishment, underpinned by a strong package
of policies is an investment in the poorest countries, which in turn, contributes to a more stable
and prosperous world.
1.      Ongoing strategic discussions on the future of the World Bank Group are taking
place amidst recent global agreements that have set ambitious goals for development.
These goals encompass the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the Addis Ababa Action
Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), the historic COP21 agreement on
climate change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Box 1). The WBG is
assessing how its four arms – IDA, IBRD, IFC and MIGA – can best support their clients and the
international community in a rapidly changing external environment. IDA is integral to the
“Forward Look? discussions and is adapting to meet the needs of its increasingly diverse clients
(see Section II).

2.      Achieving the ambitious global development goals will be challenging in an
environment of mounting global risks, that could reverse hard won gains in lifting people
out of poverty. Recent global growth performance has been disappointing, mainly reflecting a
slowdown in economic activity in emerging and developing countries amid low commodity
prices and diminished flows of trade and capital. 1 While global growth is set to accelerate
modestly in 2016, it will be at a much lower pace than previously projected and subject to many
downside risks. Meanwhile, peace and security challenges are more pressing, with Fragile- and
Conflict-affected States (FCSs) accounting for around 20 percent of the world’s extreme poor – a
figure that is expected to double by 2030. 2 Negative spillovers of conflict are increasingly
affecting non-FCSs (both IDA and non-IDA), including through increasing refugee flows and
the rise in violent extremism. The world is currently experiencing the largest – and growing –
displacement of people since the Second World War.3 Other risks to development progress from
climate change, natural disasters and pandemics are becoming more frequent and severe than in
the past.

3.     A world of complex global challenges needs a strong, results-driven IDA18
replenishment. To play its part as a global integrator and a key source of country-level solutions
for global challenges, IDA needs to be at a scale where it can have influence and leverage its
support. Building resilience in a world of more frequent economic shocks, natural disasters, and
pandemics requires a balance between strong immediate crisis response capacity and longer-
term investment in preparedness and resilience.

4.      This paper sets out the context and proposes key directions for the IDA18
replenishment round. It builds on guidance from Participants at the IDA17 MTR. As in
previous IDA Replenishments, IDA18 will emphasize special themes that warrant intensified and
systematic focus by IDA. The paper is structured as follows: Section I describes the current
development landscape; Section II describes strategic directions WBG; Section III outlines
IDA’s value proposition; Section IV presents the proposed Overarching and Special Themes in
IDA18; Section V elaborates on the monitoring of results; and Section VI sets out next steps and
lays out the issues for discussion.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a paradigm shift in global development aspirations:
      Comprise 17 comprehensive and inter-connected goals and 169 associated targets which bring together
       economic, social and environmental priorities on a new scale.
      Build and expand on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They are broader, more ambitious,
       have greater focus on quality, equity and sustainability, recognize synergies among development
       objectives, and have universal coverage.
      Emphasize a focus on implementation means (financing, policy, capacity, data and technology),
       monitoring of progress, and reporting on results.
      Place a high priority on data, monitoring and reporting of progress, areas where IDA can offer its
       significant expertise (recognizing that even further investments in data will be necessary).




The Paris agreement on climate change (COP21) represents another watershed moment for global
development ambitions:
      Universal agreement on climate mitigation, adaptation, and finance, adopted by 195 countries aiming to
       address climate collectively change and strengthen disaster resilience.
      Implementation requires support for country-driven strategies and for the additional financing needed to
       implement the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).
      Emphasizes regional and international cooperation for meeting more ambitious climate targets and raises
       the bar on investment requirements for climate-proofing and building resilience.
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 stresses: the need for improved understanding
of disaster risk in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard; strengthening of disaster risk
governance, including national platforms; accountability for DRM preparedness to “Build Back Better?;
recognition of stakeholders and roles; mobilization of risk-sensitive investment to avoid new risk; resilience of
health infrastructure, cultural heritage and work-places; strengthened international cooperation and partnership,
and risk-informed donor policies and programs, including financial support and loans from International
Financial Institutions (IFIs).
The financing needs from new commitments under these global agreements are vast and require concerted
action, and equal ambition, on multiple fronts. At around US$135 billion a year, Official Development
Assistance (ODA) is far from enough to finance the achievement of the SDGs. The AAAA presents a vision and
framework for intensified, synergistic finance solutions to unlock, multiply and catalyze flows across all sources
of financing – public and private, domestic and international – to achieve the SDGs. In this context, public
financing has a key role to play in providing complementary support for leveraging private sector investments.

5.      Despite overall gains for developing countries in the past decade, progress has been
uneven at the country level. Robust growth in developing countries in the past decade has
caused the global economic center of gravity to shift towards the developing world – it
contributes close to half the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Important gains were made
in poverty alleviation, with the global rate of extreme poverty in IDA countries nearly halving
since 1990 and positive developments in promoting shared prosperity. Yet, these achievements
were not uniformly strong, with extreme poverty increasingly concentrated in challenging
environments and a high number of those that escaped extreme poverty remaining vulnerable to
relapsing into it. Meanwhile, finance flows have expanded with significant changes in their
composition. However, there are concerns related to sustainability, selectivity and coordination
among the sources of financing, and the vulnerable debt outlook in a number of countries.4

6.      The global economic environment has weakened over the past year and the outlook
is subject to downside risks. Global growth decelerated in 2015, with a slowdown across IDA
countries from 5.9 percent in 2014 to 5.0 percent in 2015. This mainly reflects sharp declines in
commodity prices, weaker capital flows and subdued global trade. In an unprecedented
development since the 1980s, many of the largest emerging economies in each region have been
slowing simultaneously for three consecutive years. While near-term forecasts indicate a modest
pickup in aggregate growth, it is subject to significant downside risks.5 In an environment where
the room for policy makers in IDA countries to respond has narrowed, the risk of reversal of
hard-won achievements in poverty reduction is significant. In IDA countries, the approximately
50 percent of extreme poor and near poor live in countries where growth slowed in 2015. This
is compounded by more frequent and severe adverse events – climate-related disasters,
pandemics, conflict and violence – to which IDA countries, especially the poorest and small
islands, are most vulnerable.

7.      The development landscape for IDA countries has become more heterogeneous.
Today’s development landscape is marked by a wider and graduated spectrum of country
situations between and within country groupings. IDA’s clients comprise a wide array of
countries, including small islands, FCSs, commodity exporters and more diversified economies.6
The dispersion of GDP per-capita has increased over time across IDA countries (Figure 1.A).
As a result, the GDP per-capita of the 10 wealthier IDA countries is 6.5 times that of the poorest
– compared to 2.1 times in 1980. There is also significant heterogeneity on the poverty front: the
poverty “gap? can vary significantly even for countries with the same poverty rate (Figure 1.B),
and the profile of the bottom 40 percent varies considerably across countries.7, 8 Meanwhile, IDA
countries have gradually gained access to more diverse financing options, with several issuing
bonds in the international capital markets. Yet, for the majority of IDA countries, concessional

    The Poverty “gap? is the mean shortfall in income or consumption from the poverty line of US$1.90 a day in 2011
    purchasing power parity terms (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty
    line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence.

                                                                                                                                              -4-


resources remain the key source of external financing as they do not have access to market-based
financing at affordable rates. In this heterogeneous development landscape, IDA is well placed
to play a key role in responding to the calls of the international community to deliver on the
development agenda (see Section III).

8.     IDA’s effectiveness in serving its clients will also depend on its continued adaptation
to emerging challenges. The development agenda will be shaped by a combination of secular
trends (e.g., demographic trends, globalization and urbanization), cyclical factors and shocks.
IDA’s efforts to adapt to these factors will be both informed by and aligned with the WBG
“Forward Look? exercise.9

9.      Driven by favorable external conditions and prudent policies, IDA countries
experienced significant growth rates in recent years; but significant challenges remain.
During 2000-14, IDA countries grew on average by 5.7 percent a year, compared with just 2.7
percent a year for the world (Figure 2.A). This strong economic expansion was accompanied by
greater income convergence. 10 Strong growth and favorable external conditions helped IDA
countries accumulate fiscal and external buffers and reduce debt burdens (also helped by debt
relief) enabling them to use automatic stabilizers to tide themselves over during the crisis.11
Moreover, IDA countries have become more integrated with the global economy, thanks to
increased trade, investment opportunities and the search for higher yields (Figure 2.B).
However, there were large differences in country performance. Most notably, resurgence of
conflict and fast population growth in FCSs decreased per-capita growth rate and hindered

followed the global financial crisis, many countries failed to reconstitute fiscal and external
buffers, with a concomitant increase in government debt, especially in resource rich countries

the reduction in commodity prices, trade, higher cost of financing and increased volatility.

deceleration in demand from large emerging markets, global trade slowed in 2015 with

commodity prices falling on average by 45 percent from their 2011 peak. In addition, monetary
policy tightening in the U.S. has resulted in rising borrowing costs and decelerating capital flows
(Figure 3). As a result, growth in IDA countries slowed from about 5.9 percent in 2014 to 5.0
percent in 2015, with growing domestic (e.g., eroded policy buffers, growing external and fiscal
pressures in commodity exporters and slow productivity growth) and external challenges (e.g.,
tighter, more volatile global financial conditions). The slowdown in IDA countries was
pronounced among commodity exporters (e.g., Nigeria). Shocks and spillovers also had
significant negative impact for both commodity and more diversified exporters (e.g., security
disruptions – Burundi and Yemen; natural disasters –Nepal and Nicaragua; and spillover effects
14
   – Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, and Tajikistan). Several countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania), however, continued to post solid growth, supported by
large-scale infrastructure, ongoing mine development and consumer spending.

11.     Growth in IDA countries is projected to remain relatively strong, but the outlook is
subject to downside risks. Global growth is expected to pick up, reaching 2.9 percent in 2016
and 3.1 percent in 2017-18. This assumes a continued recovery in major developed economies,
some improvement in emerging countries, marginal changes in commodity prices and a gradual,
contained increase in interest rates. For IDA countries, the forecast is for growth to increase to
about 6 percent over the projection period. The implications for individual countries will depend
on country-specific factors, including composition of trade and availability of external financing.
Growth in IDA resource-rich countries is expected to increase relative to 2015, while more
diversified exporters are expected to record strong growth similar to the 2015 levels. A rebound
is expected in FCSs (Figure 4). This outlook is subject to significant risks, both external and
domestic.15 Risks to the outlook include policy uncertainty, eroded fiscal and external buffers,
natural disasters, political instability and conflict.

12.     Strong GDP growth has enabled to an unprecedented decline in extreme poverty
over the last two decades. Globally, the number of extreme poor decreased from 37 percent of
the world population in 1990 to 10 percent in 2015.16 Over the same period, the extreme poverty
rate in IDA countries fell from 55 to about 30 percent (Figure 5). Overall, about 700 million
people are living in extreme poverty, of which about 500 million live in IDA countries (close to
the entire population of North America).17 This significant achievement in poverty reduction at
the global level was led by progress in a small number of countries (mainly China and India). As
a result, extreme poverty has become dispersed. 18 Regionally, the extreme poor are located
mainly in Sub-Saharan-Africa (SSA) and Asia, primarily in IDA countries (Figure 6.A).

13.     Significant challenges remain in reducing extreme poverty and tackling inequality
in IDA countries. IDA countries are home to 70 percent of the world’s extreme poor. Of these,
the majority live in FCSs and/or resource-rich countries where demographic dynamics and weak
links between the natural resource sector and the rest of the economy have resulted in a slower
pace of poverty reduction compared to other IDA countries (Figure 6.B).19 Notably, the number
of extreme poor in IDA FCSs has increased over time, representing more than half the population
of this group of countries. Furthermore, more than 50 percent of the population in IDA countries
live on less than US$6 a day and are considered at high or moderate risk of relapsing into
poverty (Figure 7). Finally, inequality in about half of IDA countries has increased over time
(e.g., Madagascar, and Togo).

14.    Poverty is exacerbated by vulnerability to global issues, including conflict,
displacement, climate change and natural disasters. A major episode of violence can wipe out
an entire generation of economic progress and poverty reduction, and lead to mass
displacement.20, 21 Climate change also presents a threat to sustainable economic development
and poverty reduction. IDA countries, especially small islands, will be particularly affected by
the impact of climate-related natural disasters. The livelihoods of those least able to adapt – the
poor and most vulnerable – will be affected the most (Box 2).22

     In FY16, FCSs represent 38 percent of IDA countries. Resource-rich countries represent about 1/3 of IDA countries.
     Together, these two categories represent close to 60 percent of IDA countries.

 Natural disasters have become more frequent and severe in IDA countries. During the last decade, IDA countries
 have been affected by almost three times as many events relative to the 1980s, and their economic damage (US$
 terms) has been almost six times larger. While richer countries incur greater absolute damage, the poorest ones
 suffer the greatest relative impact.1 For example, the impact of the 2010 Haiti earthquake far exceeded that
 year’s GDP.

 Average annual losses due to climate-related events were around 1 percent of GDP globally over the period
 1970-2010. The World Bank’s recent publication “Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty?
 reports that, if unchecked, the impact of climate-related shocks on poverty reduction will worsen overtime and
 could result in more than 100 million additional people living in poverty by 2030 . Highlights from the report
 include:
           High temperatures in the second half of the 20 th century may have slowed growth in poor countries in
            both the agricultural and the industrial sectors.
           Reduced rainfall in the 20th century partly explains slow growth in IDA countries, particularly in SSA.
           Every 1°C warming reduces income by 1.2 percent in the short run, and by 0.5 percent in the long run.
            Other studies have found even larger impacts – including a 3.8 percent income drop in the long run for
            every 1°C warming.
           While both rich and poor are affected by natural disasters, the impact of such events is disproportionately
            large on the poor as they own assets that are more vulnerable and lesser in value.
           Natural disasters are one of the critical channels through which climate-sensitive events affect the ability
            of poor people to escape poverty.
           Under current vulnerability levels, the total number of global fatalities may well double between now and
            2080, based on the latest projections of climate change, population, and GDP.
As illustrated in the chart on the right, IDA countries
are among the countries with the highest overall
vulnerability to natural disasters and other negative
effects from climate change (adjusted for coping
ability).

     It is estimated that the impact of natural disasters on GDP is 20 times higher in developing countries than in industrialized
     nations

15.     The diversity of demographic changes and growth prospects present challenges for
poverty reduction and inclusiveness (Box 3). IDA countries, in particular FCSs, constitute the
bulk of countries that have rapid population growth, swelling working-age population and lag in
key human development indicators. While a country’s human resources can be a key asset,
failure to lay the foundations for sustained growth, accelerate demographic transition and create
more and better jobs will exacerbate the current situation where the extreme poor and the
vulnerable are concentrated in the most challenging environments. More broadly, a weaker
global environment poses significant uncertainties and risks for reversing hard-won
achievements in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Additional efforts are needed to
promote broad-based growth, translate this growth into reducing poverty, and set up insurance



 The last decade saw significant progress in poverty reduction as the MDG target of halving the global poverty
 rate was achieved in 2010 – five years ahead of schedule. However, 700 million people still live in extreme
 poverty, most of them in IDA countries.
 The World Bank’s Global Monitoring Report 2015 -16 estimates that even if developing countries realize the
 same country-specific per capita growth rates as observed during the 10-year period 2004–13, the global 3
 percent poverty target in 2030 will be missed. It would also be harder for the growth to reach the extreme poor
 for a number of reasons, including:
        The extreme poor are way below the poverty line compared to the previous period when they were only
         marginally below and could rise above the poverty line with the extant growth rates.
        Many of the remaining extreme poor are in environments where poverty is less responsive to growth (e.g.,
         narrowly diversified natural-resource based economies).
        Deep pockets of poverty (often linked to education, ethnicity or region) can persist even in countries that,
         at the aggregate level, are experiencing rapid poverty reduction. People in these areas/groups may be
         locked in poverty traps or other low-level equilibriums in which aggregate growth does not translate into
         gains for them.
 Accordingly income growth, much higher than in the past, will be required, and the distribution of that growth
 will need to be more favorable to those with the lowest incomes.
 The global poverty reduction target faces significant additional challenges. As elaborated in Box 3, absent action,
 climate change is another factor that would have adverse poverty reduction implications. The increasing
 incidence of conflict constitutes another threat, with effects that are felt at the national, regional and global levels
 long after peace is restored – as shown by the challenges confronted by refugees and host communities.
 The onus, therefore, is on the global community to support the least developed countries as they seek to meet the
 2030 poverty target, by providing the financial and technical assistance required.

16.    The past decade has seen a remarkable increase in global financing flows to
developing countries, but IDA countries benefited only from a small portion. This has been
driven by access to broader sources of financing and their expansion, as detailed later in this
                                                              - 12 -


section. 23 As a result, a more differentiated and complex financing architecture has emerged
among developing countries, with significant opportunities and major challenges, including in
terms of countries’ ability to manage and combine different flows. The ability to mobilize
resources needed for implementing the 2030 agenda, specifically in IDA countries, will depend
on continued strong levels of external public financing (both concessional and non-concessional)
and on deploying these resources in better and smarter ways to unlock the increasingly diverse
pool of available resources.

17.     While domestic revenue mobilization improved in developing countries, the poorest
are hampered by a number of factors. Domestic revenue mobilization by developing
countries grew by 14 percent annually during 2000-12, reaching US$7.7 trillion in 2012 (i.e.,
more than US$6 trillion higher than in 2000).24 The bulk of the progress, however, occurred in
emerging middle-income countries (MICs) and resource-rich low-income countries (LICs). 25
About 50 percent of all developing countries still have tax ratios below 15 percent of GDP.
Revenue collection in FCSs is often even weaker.26 Recent trends show that most of the increase
in tax mobilization in SSA has come from the natural resources sector. Thus, while on the one
hand there are countries that are mobilizing sufficient tax revenues, mainly driven by the
presence of natural resources, there are others that, despite tax collection efforts continue to have
small tax bases. Therefore, progress to date notwithstanding, more effort is needed in improving
tax policies and administration, particularly in LICs. In addition to enhanced tax collection,
increased development outlays could be realized through expenditure reforms. Addressing these
issues will require long-term engagement and dedicated capacity building efforts.27 A shallow
financial sector is another key impediment to mobilizing domestic resources in LICs.

18.     IDA countries benefited marginally from the increase in external financing to
developing countries. Prior to the onset of the crisis (2000-07), the net flows to developing
countries grew from US$259 billion to US$1.2 trillion. This trend was reversed by the impact of
the crisis (2008-09); but resumed from 2010 to reach US$1.6 trillion in 2014 – albeit at an annual
growth close to a third of the pre-crisis period (Figure 8.A). This evolution reflects the growing
importance of: (i) private finance – particularly to MICs in the form of foreign direct investments
(FDIs), bonds and syndicated bank-lending; (ii) remittances – which have emerged as the second
largest source of external financing for developing countries; (iii) increases in financing from
traditional development partners; and (iv) financing from new development partners, in

     This section discuss three categories of financing flows, namely: domestic public, international public and international
     private. Domestic private financing experienced a 415 percent increase between 2002 and 2011. See EU (2015).

     See World Bank (2013).

     In aggregate, tax revenues as a share of GDP for LICs are about two-thirds of that for Upper Middle-Income Countries. See
     EU (2015).

     Ahead of the Addis Ababa FfD Conference, the World Bank and the IMF launched a new initiative to help countries
     strengthen their tax systems. Responding to country demands, this initiative has two pillars: deepening the dialogue with
     developing countries on international tax issues, aiming to help increase their voice in the international debate on tax rules
     and cooperation; and developing improved diagnostic tools to help member countries evaluate and strengthen their tax
     policies.

particular from the BRICS.28 IDA countries – which depend the most of external financing –
benefited from less than 20 percent of these flows (Figures 8.B and 8.C).29

19.    An increasingly differentiated architecture for external financing has emerged
across countries at different stages of development (Figure 9). Within this new architecture,
the poorest IDA countries (i.e., IDA-only non-gap countries), rely primarily on external official
financing – almost exclusively provided in the form of grants and concessional loans. For IDA
gap and blend countries, remittances constitute the key source of external financing and private
financing represents a larger share than for IDA-only non-gap countries, yet external official

         Standing at US$137.2 billion in 2014, ODA from DAC member countries reached an all-time high, yet still falling short – in
         aggregate terms – of the United Nations target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
29
         In 2014, external flows to IDA countries stood at US$286 billion, about seven times the 2000 level and equivalent to 18
         percent of total flows. Non-IDA countries also experienced a significant increase, with the flows in 2014 standing at US$1.1
         trillion, more than 6 times the 2000 volume and equivalent to 82 percent of the total flows to developing countries.

financing still represents about 15 percent of their external flows.30 On the other hand, while
non-IDA countries benefit from a sizeable share of official financing (see next paragraph), they
have become primarily reliant on private flows.

20.     The increase in external financing flows to developing countries is not without
challenges, in particular for IDA countries. The emerging trends on private financing raise
questions regarding the sustainability of their expansion and the selectivity and management of
these flows. Private financing tends to be pro-cyclical and much less stable relative to other
sources.31 Furthermore, notwithstanding the strong increase for developing countries as a whole,
they were heavily concentrated bypassing the vast majority of IDA countries (Figures 10.A and
10.B).32 Second, with respect to official flows, a significant share of these resources benefit non-
IDA countries (Figure 10.C). Non-IDA countries also benefit from a large – and growing – share
of concessional flows. 33, 34 After peaking at about 80 percent in 2006, the share of official
concessional financing to IDA countries has declined to less than 70 percent in 2014. This
decrease is largely explained by the recent shift in official grant financing towards non-IDA
countries.35 While a significant share of the world’s poor still live in non-IDA countries, these
countries have a stronger economic and financial standing relative to IDA countries and greater
ability to access alternative sources of funding. In addition, the landscape for official financing
has become more complex. 36 Finally, while remittances are a relatively stable sources of
external financing, costs remain high in several countries and further policy action is needed to

     Private flows declined by 26 percent during the global financial crisis.
32
     Out of the 48 IDA-only non-gap countries, the top 5 countries account for 54 percent of the net FDI inflows and close to
     one-third of other private flows.
33
     Concessional financing as per the current OECD definition (i.e., loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more
     based on a 10 percent discount rate).
34
     The survey of aid donor countries’ spending plans indicates that, after several years of declines, country-level aid to the
     poorest countries should recover over the next few years. See OECD (2015).
35
     Between 2011 and 2014, official grant flows to developing countries remained largely stable, but the share to non-IDA
     countries increased from 26 to 36 percent.

     developing countries see World Bank (2011)b.

reduce them.37 Furthermore, recent developments (the de-risking phenomenon) could affect the
accessibility, affordability and efficiency of remittances services.38

      De-risking refers to the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating or restricting business relationships with clients or
      categories of clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s risk-based approach.
      Evidence points to an acceleration of this phenomenon in recent years. This phenomenon could have implications for
      remittances through several channels. For example, banks could shut off access to banking services to remittance services
      providers, resulting in their activities becoming more expensive for everyday people. See World Bank (2015)b.

market financing will increase and change
the nature of risks faced by these countries – in particular a greater rollover risk. With weaker
global prospects and the tightening of global liquidity conditions, market access may be at less
favorable terms for many of these countries (Figure 11). In this context, prudent fiscal and
financing decisions will be critical for preserving debt sustainability. Efforts to enhance debt
management capacity remain paramount.

22.     Evidence points to sharp declines in total public (domestic plus external) financing
relative to income per capita, particularly for the poorest countries (Figure 12).40 While the
external financing-to- gross national income (GNI) ratio is higher for the poorest countries, sharp
declines take place at the lowest end of the income spectrum and well before countries reach the
IDA operational cutoff. The ratio stabilizes only at GNI per-capita around the IDA operational
cutoff (i.e., gap and blend countries). While domestic public financing shows an increasing trend
relative to GNI per-capita, it does not compensate for the fall in external resources. As a result,
the poorest IDA countries – which have limited financing options and depend critically on public
concessional financing – experience sharp declines in the overall level of total public resources
as the GNI per-capita rises. This trend can also be observed in total financing (public and
private) as private financing fails to compensate for the fall in public financing for the poorest
countries.

     For a definition of “frontier? countries see World Bank and IMF (2015)a. Thirteen IDA countries are in this group:
     Bangladesh, Bolivia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Senegal,
     Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia. External borrowing by these countries in the form of sovereign bonds and
     commercial loans has amounted to US$34 billion during the period 2010-14, with a shift in recent years from commercial
     loans to bond issuances.

23.     Implementing the ambitious 2030 agenda will require a paradigm shift on
development financing. 41 Development finance will need to be used strategically to unlock,
leverage, and catalyze private flows and domestic resources. Concessional financing will remain
a key source of external public financing in most IDA countries. Scarce concessional financing
should be increased and should be used as effectively as possible – focusing on the poorest
countries and those with limited access to alternative sources of financing. Furthermore,
concessional financing should be targeted increasingly to crowd in other financing sources,
public and private, external and domestic.

D.

24.     The global development agenda will also be shaped by secular trends and shocks.
The secular trends span the whole spectrum of the development agenda: (i) demographic and
growth transitions, such as the shrinking of working-age population and slower productivity
gains; (ii) a renewed globalization, with increasingly globalized and coordinated economic,
political and social actions; and (iii) rapid urbanization, with increased demand for and stress on
services; and iv) pressures on the world’s resources, including through climate change. Shocks
and disruptions, such as financial and humanitarian crises, pandemics, natural disasters, and
social instability, have increased in frequency as well as in range and speed of propagation. In
some cases (e.g., fragility) problems have gone from being acute to chronic. IDA’s effectiveness
will depend on its capacity to adapt to these challenges. Efforts in that direction will be both
informed by and aligned with the “Forward Look? exercise detailed in the next section.

25.     Management and shareholders have initiated a “Forward Look? exercise for the
WBG. This exercise examines the three interrelated challenges of the changes in the external
environment, the WBG’s ability to adapt to these changes, and its financial capacity. Three
engagements with Executive Directors were held in January and February 2016. The outcome of
these engagements is reflected in a Development Committee paper to be discussed at the 2016
Spring Meetings and the exercise will conclude at the 2016 Annual Meetings. 42 The Forward
Look exercise is helping inform and provide the context for the IDA18 replenishment, IDA’s
ongoing innovations, the review of IBRD and IFC financial capacity, and the shareholding
review.

26.    The Forward Look discussions build on the WBG comparative advantage of helping
the world address complex problems at scale. The starting point for the Forward Look
discussions is that the WBG has solid foundations on which to build. This comparative
advantage is rooted in the three mutually reinforcing roles that it plays: first and foremost as a
country development partner around the world; second as a private sector partner; and finally, as
a global development partner (Figure 13). Furthermore, the Forward Look emphasizes that the
WBG goals endorsed by the Development Committee in April 2013 are strong strategic pillars
for engaging and supporting the 2030 development agenda.43 The WBG strategy reinforces the
need to focus on extreme poverty; highlights the increasing importance of sharing the benefits of
prosperity; and underscores that pressures on sustainability are growing.

27.     The needs, demand and profile of the WBG clients are also evolving. As detailed in
the previous section, the global landscape for development will be shaped by a number of
factors. The Forward Look exercise considers these driving forces and explores how the WBG
can respond to these emerging global challenges. This will require a multi-pronged approach
across the spectrum of clients – e.g., adapting to and mitigating climate change; increasing
female agency, voice and participation in the labor force; building resilience and lessening the
impact of FCV; accelerating job creation; building human capital; improving connectivity of
people and firms; fostering regional and global integration; diversifying production, revenues
and exports; ensuring macro-financial stability; strengthening governance; improving collective
action in the pursuit of global public goods; and preventing epidemics and pandemics. The WBG
clients’ profile is also changing: MICs and High-Income Countries (HICs) will increase in
number. The number of countries below the IDA operational cutoff will shrink over time to
encompass mostly SSA countries, and with a rising proportion of FCSs.

28.      The Forward Look discussions emphasize the need for continued results focus. The
WBG approach to this is fourfold: allocate resources to priorities; continued focus on
effectiveness; ensuring efficiency; and leveraging our and others’ resources for maximum
results.

29.   At this stage, Management and shareholders are exploring ways to stretch the WBG
impact further along five dimensions:

      Improving WBG ability to assist the full spectrum of client segments, including
       FCSs, HICs, and sub-nationals. Being responsive to a broad spectrum of client needs is
       at the core of the WBG’s mission, but requires increasing flexibility. The ability to tailor
       assistance to the diversity of country situations needs to be strengthened. For IDA in
       particular, this means further scaling up engagement in FCS as well as having the
       appropriate tools to ensure a smooth graduation process.
      Leadership on global and regional issues. Increasingly countries face challenges that
       are facets of regional and global challenges; and global challenges require action at the
       country level. It also requires capturing and sharing development knowledge through
       analytical work at the global, regional and country levels and facilitating knowledge
       sharing among clients.
      Expanding customized knowledge services, particularly south-south learning. The
       WBG is putting additional emphasis on speedier flows of relevant knowledge across the
       globe, including moving from retail approaches to South-South learning where the WBG
       directly facilitates the interaction.
      Boosting efficiency and flexibility. As the continuum of clients grow, and the
       complexity of their challenges increase, it is critical to ensure that the complexity of the
       WBG’s own policies and procedures do not grow apace. Building on changes introduced
       in the past few years – including the structuring of the Bank’s operations around Global
       Practices (GPs) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs), the systematic emphasis on
       working across the Group, and the expenditure review, the WBG will continue to strive
       to respond to clients in a fast and efficient way. The nature of the development challenges
       identified in the Forward Look emphasizes in particular that delivering sustainable, high
       quality results requires adapting to country contexts.
      Scaling up finance for development including through significantly increasing
       external leverage, especially from the private sector. The magnitude of the challenges
       and the level of ambition of the development agenda call for expanding resources, as
       captured in the ‘billions to trillions’ agenda for the MDBs. The first priority is to extend
       the WBG’s ability to help governments develop the policies and build the institutions that
       will make domestic public finance deliver more results. Second, scaling up the WBG’s
       ability to partner with the private sector is necessary to help private investment flow into
       public priorities, both within and across countries. The WBG seeks to build on its
       ongoing platform in these areas, expanding the scale and degree of leverage to help
       address the huge financing needs, recognizing that private sector finance cannot address
       all challenges, leaving a critical need for public finance and, in particular for IDA
       countries, for concessional development finance.

30.    IDA is integral to the WBG value proposition. IDA both exemplifies the comparative
advantages of the WBG itself and draws on the qualities of the other parts of the WBG to bring a
unique and powerful set of services to the poorest countries. IDA is able to connect global
agendas to country action, and to partner with IFC and MIGA to bring the private sector to the
poorest most fragile countries. IDA plays a critical role as an integrator across the international
                                               - 22 -


system, bringing global partnerships with other organizations and with countries at all levels of
development to its work in the poorest countries. IDA integral to a full service WBG, providing
urgently needed concessional resources to the poorest countries that need it the most, and helping
to ensure a smooth transition to IBRD (Figure 14). Possible innovations in the WBG and IDA
could further assist in providing assistance tailored to a range of country circumstances. Going
forward, a strong IDA18 replenishment will be critical to expanding resources for development.

31.     IDA is thus is an essential part of the strategic value of the WBG going forward,
embodying its comparative advantage but also adapting to meet the particular needs of its
client base. This includes the particular challenges of helping countries achieve development
goals where poverty remains very high; where countries may be afflicted by FCV; where
countries face significant development and capacity challenges in building functioning
economies; and where they remain among the most vulnerable to a range of shocks and disasters.
IDA intensifies, builds on and adapts the WBG’s comparative advantage, maximizing the
synergies between different parts of the Bank Group for the benefit of its clients. This lies at the
core of IDA’s value proposition, discussed in Section III.

32.    The international community is confronted with a large and urgent task at a time of
limited resources. It needs to implement and fulfill the promise of the compelling and
ambitious agenda agreed in 2015 (see Box 1). At the same time, it needs to confront and manage
a range of increasing and complex challenges – fragility and conflict; violent extremism;
unprecedented refugee flows; climate change; natural disasters; health crises; and global
economic headwinds – all requiring a coordinated international response across multiple policy
areas. As countries become more interconnected, challenges become more comprehensive and
more global. The WBG, as a global actor that supports individual countries to address
complicated multi-sectoral problems – for the continuum of countries from the poorest to upper
MICs – is ideally suited to address these issues.
                                              - 23 -



33.     For the poorest countries IDA has proved to be a powerful platform for tackling
complex, global, development challenges requiring coordinated international effort. With
in-country and global partnerships, IDA is a proven channel for international cooperation
translated through effective, country-owned and led programs on the ground. In an
interconnected world, the challenges that countries face are often facets of larger global issues.
Progress on global challenges hinges on action at country level, and global risks can be
exacerbated by adverse developments in the “weakest? link. A world with more frequent natural
disasters, pandemics and economic shocks urgently needs not only strong crisis response
capacity, but also longer-term investment in preparedness and resilience. And this investment in
building resilience in the poorest countries is an investment in global prosperity and stability.
Global trends – such as climate change, demographics, and political fragility – have the largest
and most far reaching impacts on the poorest countries, but they affect all countries. If IDA
countries are not able to make progress on key areas of development, there will continue to be
negative spill-overs on their neighbors and globally. A successful IDA18 will be critical for the
poorest countries, but its benefits will be global.
34.     IDA’s value proposition rests on four core pillars. These pillars, summarized in the
bullets below, are elaborated in more detail in the following subsections.

   i. Country solutions, global challenges: IDA has a track record of addressing complex,
      multi-sectoral challenges requiring coordinated international effort and translating global
      challenges into lasting solutions at country level. IDA is the largest source of climate
      change adaptation finance for its clients and has used its country knowledge and global
      expertise to help countries identify and act on climate change. IDA customizes global
      knowledge to local conditions, brings country experience to global policy-making and
      facilitates knowledge sharing on global challenges. IDA invests in the data that countries
      need for evidence-based policy-making and measuring results, and that the international
      community needs to measure progress towards the 2030 agenda. IDA also supports
      countries in finding regional solutions to development challenges enabling collective
      action on cross-border challenges and helping overcome scale and capacity constraints
      for small states. With a record of working together with other organizations and donors,
      IDA is an integrator, convener and partner within the international system and at the
      country level.

   ii. Essential tool for resilience, risk management and crisis response: On the ground in
       65 countries and with a network of partnerships, IDA helps countries manage risks, build
       resilience, and respond to crises. IDA’s predictable countercyclical financing and policy
       advice helps countries protect essential public investments and services and build
       targeted social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. IDA also supports countries to
       mainstream short- and long-term climate and disaster risks into development. IDA can
       take early and rapid action in response to shocks or crises (e.g., Ebola outbreak) or to
       seize new windows for re-engagement (e.g., Myanmar). IDA has built substantial on-the-
       ground knowledge and experience on FCV, has invested in understanding the drivers of
       fragility and conflict and works to address them. IDA countries are increasingly looking
       to IDA’s CRW and Regional program to provide timely help and to facilitate collective
       action on issues that cross borders. With focus on poor and vulnerable populations, IDA

         is helping countries manage refugee flows with knowledge, operations and partnerships,
         but could do more.

     iii. A long-term partner helping build institutions and infrastructure for inclusive
          growth and private sector development: IDA’s country-owned model supports
          countries’ efforts to build resilient, inclusive economies, generating new sources of
          demand and growth for the global economy. IDA works multi-sector and multi-year to
          help countries build the institutions and capacity to grow and manage public finances,
          helping ensure that resources – both domestic and external – are spent well. IDA helps
          countries build inclusive economies, where opportunity for all promotes productivity,
          resilience and growth – including through important investments in education and health
          system strengthening, and mainstreaming gender considerations, including in the “hard?
          sectors. With policy advice, standards and tools, IDA also helps countries make
          financially, socially and environmentally sustainable infrastructure investments, helping
          to promote quality across the full life cycle. Working with IFC and MIGA, IDA is
          uniquely placed to help countries develop the enabling environment needed to crowd in
          the private sector as an engine of jobs and growth.

     iv. A sound investment: IDA’s results-focused, country-driven and performance based
         model works; underpinned by a WBG that innovates and evolves, improving efficiency
         and increasingly leveraging other players. IDA is well-positioned to help deliver the
         2030 agenda, with the ability to leverage and multiply finance and a proven,
         performance-based model anchored in country ownership. With developing countries
         now more heterogeneous along a continuum of country situations, IDA has the flexibility
         to meet a range of needs with a range of financing terms, working in tandem with IBRD
         as countries move up the income spectrum. IDA has robust accountability and benefits
         from dialogue with its partnership of developed and developing countries. IDA has a long
         tradition of evolving to reflect lessons learned and adapting to meet changing needs.

35.     IDA plays a key role in translating global plans into country action. With climate
change and associated natural disasters posing huge risks for poverty reduction efforts, 44 IDA
has used its country knowledge, financing and global expertise to help countries identify and act
on climate change at the national level. Among the MDBs, the WBG has been the largest source
of climate finance, accounting for around 40 percent of all climate finance. Within the WBG,
IDA has been an engine of climate finance, with its share of overall WBG climate finance
increasing from around 20 percent in FY11 to around 40 percent in FY15 (Figure 15).

Notes: Data reflects financing from the MDBs own resources and from external sources (e.g., CIF, GEF). In 2014,
financing from external sources represented 9% of the total. WBG figures represent the sum of WB and IFC. IDA
reflect climate financing from own resources only.

36.     IDA has been the largest source of climate change adaptation finance for the poorest
countries. IDA commitments with climate change co-benefits over FY11-15 averaged US$3.6
billion. In FY15, IDA commitments with climate change co-benefits were US$3.0 billion of
which US$2.2 billion had adaptation co-benefits and US$1.0 billion mitigation co-benefits. 45
Over FY11-15, energy accounted for the largest share of commitments, followed by agriculture,
fishing and forestry and water, sanitation and flood protection; other sectors such as health and
education also contributed, but more modestly. This reflects the fact that some sectors lend
themselves more readily to climate co-benefits than others (Figure 16). IDA is set to do more in
line with the WBG commitment announced at the 2015 Annual Meetings in Lima, 46 with the
support of shareholders, to increase climate financing by one third to 28 percent by 2020.47

 37.     With global knowledge and experience, IDA works with clients to customize
 solutions to local circumstances, and facilitate knowledge exchange. From targeted and cost-
 effective social safety nets, to designing tax regimes and irrigation, IDA draws on first hand
 global knowledge and experience to help clients identify a range of options to address
 challenges. IDA also serves as a facilitator, helping to connect policy-makers and practitioners
 across developing countries in support of South-South cooperation, knowledge exchange and
 strengthening country capacity to capture and share good development practices for replication
 and scale-up, both within and across countries. In addition, through the WBG’s new GPs and
 CCSAs, IDA provides targeted country analytics and gives countries access to systematized
 global knowledge and data to help inform decision-making. For example, IDA supports work to
 gather global data and expand the evidence base regarding both the “how? and “why? of what
 works in promoting gender equality. As part of the WBG, IDA can also help bring country
 experience to inform global policy-making. For example, the WBG has highlighted in the G20
 the impacts of the de-risking phenomenon while working to reduce the costs of remittances at
 global and national level and address compliance with legal and regulatory standards in
 particular on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism.

 38.    IDA helps to improve country statistical systems, helping countries produce quality
 data for domestic policy formulation and monitoring, including of IDA results, but also
 serving the broader global need for data, including for monitoring of the 2030 Agenda.
 Quality statistics are essential for evidence-based decision making and policy formulation,
 including monitoring social and economic progress, allocating political representation and
 resources, guiding private sector investment, and holding government accountable. However, in
                                                            - 27 -


many IDA countries, capacity to produce and use quality data is low. As part of the WBG, IDA,
along with other international organization and bilateral donors, is working with countries to
respond to their desire to improve their statistical capacity. This involves equipping countries to
be able to produce and use statistics; developing knowledge and knowledge transfer; building
infrastructure, including statistical standards, IT systems, computers, and offices; as well as
developing statistical regulations and laws. Larger scale projects typically include components
covering all of the above.48.

39.     IDA is also responding to strong demand to help countries find regional solutions to
development challenges through its regional program. Growing demand for support from
IDA’s Regional program has seen more than 50 percent of the IDA17 Regional envelope utilized
in the first year of the replenishment period. Regional approaches can help promote collective
action to address challenges that affect several countries, such as forced displacement, disaster
risk or disease surveillance, or can represent an efficient and cost-effective solution to capacity
constraints, such as regional approaches to regulation. Regional approaches help promote
economic opportunity through regional integration, connectivity and trade (at present, only
around 10 percent of African trade takes place among African countries). Working with
countries and other partners, IDA continues to find innovative ways to connect national and
regional programs to address binding constraints (Box 4).


                              IDA Supports Regional Solutions to Development Challenges
     The regional IDA Program, introduced in IDA13, supports regional initiatives that have strong spill-over
     benefits across countries and that require collective action to achieve priority objectives. It also enables small
     countries (several of which are FCSs) to work in areas that would otherwise absorb most if not all of their IDA
     allocations – thanks to the additional financing these countries can access through the regional program.
     Most regional projects are focused on infrastructure, economic integration and regional public goods.
     During IDA15-16 the majority of the funds targeted regional infrastructure (in IDA16, the figure was 90
     percent), especially energy initiatives. However, the regional program is supporting a range of non-
     infrastructure interventions where regional approaches can address scale constraints, or promote collective
     action. It has, for example, supported regional market-based natural disaster risk financing tools to provide
     rapid financing in the wake in the natural disasters, most notably in the Caribbean and the Pacific, collective
     action to address sexual and gender-based violence in the Great Lakes, as well as regional approaches to forced
     displacement in the Horn of Africa. Upcoming work will focus on expanding regional disease surveillance in
     Africa, to strengthen the capacity of countries to better prevent and detect pandemics, as well as on providing
     critical capacity development in areas such as human resources for health and laboratory networks. For example,
     a regional disease surveillance project is under preparation in West Africa focusing on the longer-term resilience
     following the Ebola crisis, and this proposed project has incorporated lessons learned from the East Africa Lab
     and Health Strengthening Project. This project aims to establish a network of efficient, high quality, accessible
     public health laboratories for the diagnosis and surveillance of TB and other communicable diseases in the East
     African Community (EAC) member states. The project successfully introduced a unique and cost effective peer
     review mechanism, ensuring objectivity and promoting cross-country learning.




48
       For example, Ghana’s Statistical Development Project (which combines US$30 million from IDA with US$10 million from
       the Statistics for Results Catalytic Fund) includes institutional reform and organizational change; training; improving
       statistical frameworks; physical infrastructure and equipment; and improving data production and management.

                                             (continued)
 IDA’s regional programs are also an important avenue for partnerships. In the Great Lakes, the Sahel and the
 Horn of Africa, IDA has worked with the UN, AfDB, IsDB, AU Commission and the EU. In MENA, IDA, the
 EU, UN and IsDB are working in partnership on a Dynamic Needs Assessment for Yemen which will help
 coordinate an effective response once the conflict subsides. In the Pacific, IDA partners with the Pacific Island
 Forum on regional institutions and knowledge sharing, as well as with the AsDB, EU and Australia.
 In Africa, IDA17 is seeing unprecedented demand for regional IDA to promote economic integration and cost-
 effective regional solutions to development challenges. IDA continues to look for ways that regional and
 national IDA can complement each other to address regional binding constraints: ongoing regional projects,
 including in cooperation with IFC, are connecting power grids, introducing improved seeds and helping generate
 a trained technical workforce. Cooperation with IFC in Africa has also been promoting regional policy
 coordination, complementing support for physical infrastructure in the power sector with policy and regulatory
 strengthening.
 IDA’s regional approaches frequently leverage the whole of WBG expertise. In Mauritania, Senegal and
 Mali, IDA provided partial risk guarantees while MIGA provided a guarantee to the sponsors for the Banda Gas
 to Power Project, which utilized the WBG’s convening power and capacity to leverage private sector
 investments in a regional context. IDA and IFC together crowd in private investment to regional projects: future
 joint IDA-IFC work will include efforts to boost private sector investment on modern irrigation in the Sahel.
 The Central Asia and South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project featured close collaboration
 between IDA and IFC on project preparation, along with bilaterals and the IsDB, to facilitate electricity trade by
 putting in place the required commercial and institutional arrangements across participating countries and
 building transmission infrastructure. Community support programs will improve corridor communities’
 livelihoods, helping manage security risks.
 In East Asia and the Pacific, the WBG has quadrupled support for the Pacific Island Small States from FY09 to
 FY15, mostly through IDA (including the regional and crisis response windows). IDA increasingly takes a
 regional approach to the Pacific Island Small States to overcome scale constraints: regional approaches are
 underway for DRM, ICT, fisheries, as well as a proposed regional IDA grant to improve capacity for evidence
 based road safety management and mitigation measures. In a region where populations are dispersed across huge
 distances and a safe and efficient aviation sector is critical, IDA has also provided financing to ensure safety and
 security oversight in the aviation sector. A regional flagship Pacific Possible is planned for FY17.
40.     As an integrator, partner and convenor, IDA provides a platform for multiple partners
to work with clients on solutions to complex problems requiring “all hands on deck?. IDA’s
platform role coordinates and leverages the capacity of donors, providing a means for smaller
donors or those not present to come in behind country-led development strategies. The IDA
platform thus reduces the burden that the increased fragmentation of aid places on low capacity
clients. With global presence, IDA serves as an integrator in the multilateral system. IDA
partners with other international organizations, sometimes leading, sometimes supporting;
Examples include work with the IMF on economic management, domestic resource mobilization
and debt management, and partnerships with sister UN agencies and MDBs on fragility and
conflict;   emergency      response;    building     infrastructure;    agriculture     and food
security; infrastructure; expanding service delivery in education and health; and, addressing
cross-cutting issues such as gender equality; regional integration and anti-corruption.

41.     On the ground in 65 countries and with a network of partnerships, IDA is an
effective tool for the international community to help countries manage risks and build
resilience across the range of challenges. From economic downturns, to natural disasters and
pandemics to FCV, IDA is able to move quickly to take early and rapid action to respond to
                                                           - 29 -


shocks (as in the economic crisis of 2008-10) or crises (such as Ebola) or to seize new windows
for re-engagement (as in Myanmar, where early analytical work enabled IDA to move quickly
and effectively to re-engage once political conditions permitted).

42.    At a time of growing economic headwinds, IDA can provide much needed
countercyclical financing and policy advice to help countries protect essential public
investments and services and build targeted social safety nets to protect the most
vulnerable. Unlike pro-cyclical domestic and external private sector finance, predictable, non-
earmarked IDA financing gives flexibility to countries to meet their high priority needs and
avoid “lost generations.? These investments also build future resilience: once developed, social
safety nets can be rapidly scaled up in the event of future crises and financial sector reforms
serve not only to mitigate the impact of the current crisis but also reduce vulnerability to future
systemic risks.

43.     Similarly, IDA’s key role in the global response to Ebola focused on both short -term
crisis response and longer-term resilience. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, over US$1
billion in IDA financing not only helped to stop the spread of infections, but worked towards
future resilience by improving public health systems and dealing with the longer term social and
economic impacts. For instance, although the Ebola crisis has abated, the continued work in
strengthening public health systems remains an urgent priority, with benefits at the regional
level. To provide assistance for longer-term resilience, a new regional project is in the pipeline
that aims to strengthen cross-sectoral and regional capacity for collaborative disease surveillance
and response in West Africa.

44.    More broadly, IDA has been stepping up to meet country demand to mainstream
short- and long-term climate and disaster risks into development planning. A total of
US$3.5 billion, 61 percent of all financing commitments that contributed to disaster risk
management (DRM) in FY15, were directed to IDA countries. IDA continued to support
countries along the five pillars of the DRM framework – risk information, risk reduction,
preparedness, financial protection and resilient recovery – focusing on prevention, preparedness
and response. Major operations in FY16 include the Nepal Earthquake Housing Reconstruction
Project (US$200 million) 49 and the Malawi Emergency Recovery Project (US$80 million),
sourced from CRW resources. As of January 2016, around 80 percent of IDA operations had
been screened for short- and long-term climate and disaster risks, with the remainder in the
process of being screened. All Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) 50 that have come to the
Board to date during the IDA17 cycle included climate and disaster risks. In addition, 27 IDA
countries have been identified for potential development of country-led multi-sectoral plans and
investments for managing climate and disaster risks, with work ongoing in 12 at time of writing.

45.     IDA has the instruments to respond to crises, but demand exceeds supply. IDA’s
CRW has significantly strengthened IDA’s ability to respond to crises and disaster in a timely,
effective and predictable manner. The importance of this mechanism is evidenced by the high

were already exhausted.51 In fact, demand for CRW resources in the first year of the IDA17
cycle was higher than the total amount provided in IDA16. The CRW is now being replenished
mid-term in IDA17, indicating its importance. Under the Immediate Response Mechanism
(IRM) many IDA countries have also included IRM contingent emergency response components
in projects to provide rapid access to a portion of their undisbursed IDA balances to address
immediate post-crisis financing needs. 52 IDA’s Regional program has also enabled collective
action in response to crises and disasters impacting several countries or with cross-border
spillovers, but also faces capacity constraints (Box 4). Considering the wide range of potential
economic, climate, health or other threats facing the international community and its most
vulnerable members, it will be important to protect, and perhaps even expand, IDA’s ability to
respond effectively to shocks and crises. In this context, the UN Secretary General has just called
for a tripling of the CRW.53

donors on fragility assessments and its politically neutral platform role is particularly valuable in
FCV, where not all donors have field presence. Partnerships are critical in FCV and IDA has a
close working relationship in FCV with the UN system, notably with UNHCR in support for
refugees (Box 5).

     Under the IRM launched in 2011, once essential implementation arrangements are put in place, IRM contingent emergency
     response components (IRM CERCs) allow for pooling uncommitted resources across projects to allow IDA countries to
     make use of US$5 million or 5% of undisbursed funds for immediate financing after disasters. Countries with IRM CERCs
     include Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Madagascar, Mali,
     Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda. Adoption of an IRM manual is a condition for
     disbursement under the IRM.

Globally, UNHCR estimates that in 2014 there were 19 million refugees, a 68 percent increase relative to the
2000-2013 average. For IDA countries, the increase was 30 percent; for non-IDA (mainly IBRD) countries, the
increase was 127 percent.1
In 2014, IDA countries accounted for around half the world’s refugees (9 million), and two-thirds of these
refugees (6 million) were hosted by other IDA countries. AFR accounts for more than half the refugees from
IDA countries. SAR and EAP also have significant refugee populations.
Overall, Africa hosts more than a third of the world’s displaced population and accounts for more than one
quarter of the global total of refugees and the largest number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs). Five
countries have generated more than 80 percent of those displaced: CAR, DRC, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan,
while 60 percent of refugees in the region are hosted by just five countries: Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, South
Sudan, and Uganda.
The largest increases in recent times have been seen in MENA, where the Syrian conflict is resulting in the
largest displacement of people (around one third as IDPs and two thirds as refugees) since World War II. This
has had an enormous impact on neighboring countries: Syrian refugees now (conservatively) account for around
25 percent of the total population in Lebanon and around 15 percent in Jordan. In South Asia, there are
longstanding refugee populations, including Afghan refugees in Pakistan. ECA hosts 6 million refugees. While
forced displacement is often the result of FCV, climate change may become an increasingly important driver.
There is a strong regional dimension to many refugee flows. With the exception of LCR and MENA, more than
half the refugees originating in a region remain in that region; for Africa, the figure is closer to 80 percent. That
said, given the scale of refugee flows, the human suffering, and the impact on efforts to end poverty and achieve
the SDGs, in an interconnected world, refugees are a global challenge.
The human costs of forced displacement are immense. Individuals can suffer violence, trauma and persecution;
can live in precarious circumstances without access to basic services; and see future opportunities closed as
children miss out on education. Girls and women, who accounted for 50 percent of refugees in 2014 (from 48
per cent in 2011) are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation and, in comparison to men,
more often lack documentation, the means to travel and/or knowledge about their rights. With children
accounting for over half of all refugees (51 percent in 2014), access to education is critical but often limited.
Reasons can include language of instruction, fees, lack of infrastructure or teachers, being over-aged and
cultural barriers. Girls face particular hurdles related to safe learning environments or cultural assumptions
about the value of educating them, and child marriage. Children denied access to education represent not only a
tragic loss of human potential, but a risk for radicalization, as well as a loss of future growth and productivity
for the countries in which they live.
Beyond the enormous human costs for people forced to leave their homes and countries, there are economic
impacts on both refugee populations and host communities. These can include strains on public services,
especially health and education, but also energy and waste disposal, exacerbating existing deficiencies; impacts
on labor markets, which can include downward pressure on wages for low-skill work, and increases in informal
employment; macroeconomic impacts as well as fiscal impacts from increased budgetary costs; rising social
tensions, including from competition for natural resources, and strains on institutions in simply managing and
processing large numbers of refugees.
With refugees in host countries for prolonged periods, humanitarian crises become development challenges, for
both refugee populations and host populations. Addressing these challenges is essential for ending poverty.
IDA is leaning forward to address the challenge of improving the lives of refugees and their hosts, by working
on the ground to improve basic services and help provide livelihoods; and by bringing our economic and
development expertise to partnerships with other organizations and donors.
      Meeting needs on the ground: IDA has provided support for increased economic opportunities in
       countries hosting large displaced populations. In the CAR, where about ¼ of the population is displaced,
       a national cash-for-work program benefited 3,750 people and created 98,841 work days over the last 3
       months of 2015. Furthermore, a regional pipeline project that spans both AFR and MENA regions will
       provide support to Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda to improve access to basic social services, expand
       economic opportunities, and enhance environmental management for refugee and host communities.

                                                   (continued)
        IDA works in close partnership with other organizations, notably with UNHCR on services and
         technical assistance. With the first World Humanitarian Summit to be held in Istanbul in May 2016
         working toward a coherent approach for humanitarian aid delivery that can help meet the needs of
         millions of people displaced and otherwise affected by conflicts and disasters, IDA is helping to
         strengthen coordination across the humanitarian/development nexus.
        Learning for effective responses. In the Horn of Africa, analytic work is focusing on understanding the
         drivers of refugee flows and informing responses. Combined with close client engagement, this analytic
         work is helping finalize a promising proposal for longer-term programmatic engagement, collaborating
         across borders and integrating environmental management. IDA can bring the economic dimension to
         refugee issues, engaging Ministries of Finance in dialogue on refugee or internally displaced populations.
 In the context of a strong IDA18 replenishment, IDA could play a larger role helping to strengthen the resilience
 of countries hosting refugees from IDA countries; to manage the long-term presence of refugees and internally
 displaced persons in host countries and to find sustainable solutions for refugee populations (including return or
 integration in host country). Given its focus and poor and vulnerable populations, there may also be interest in
 exploring whether IDA can do more in refugee crisis situations.

47.     IDA also works upstream to build resilience and address drivers of conflict
whenever possible. IDA is working in countries that are not yet considered to be FCSs to
mitigate the risks of escalation of violence and conflict. Working across sectors in a country-led
model, IDA is well-placed to do more on addressing the socio-economic drivers of conflict, such
as access to natural resources; improving transparency and use of revenues from extractive
industries; improving accountability and inclusion in service delivery; improving subnational
governance; and addressing regional and sub-regional inequality. With violent extremism linked
to marginalization and lagging regions, IDA’s work to help countries build inclusive economies
and sound institutions can be a useful contribution to helping stem the rise of this serious risk to
their – and global – stability and security.

48.     Despite progress, there is clearly much more to do and to learn to bring lasting change to
the difficult and long-term challenges of FCV. Areas where IDA is continuing to focus its
efforts include exploring ways to maximize the effectiveness of IDA in FCV, including
continuous investment in knowledge and in ensuring that operations are well designed and
adapted to the particular circumstances of FCV. More can also be done to improve operational
effectiveness and flexibility, including to help address greatly increased security costs, to ensure
full application of existing flexibility and appropriate review to determine what else may be
needed, and to ensure appropriate staffing for FCSs. Lastly, partnerships (including with the
UN) can be further developed and moves to increase joint IFC-IDA-MIGA programming in FCV
expanded. While it has a sound basis on which to build, FCV, risk management and crisis
response are clearly areas where IDA can do more in the context of a strong IDA18
replenishment.

49.    IDA helps countries build resilient, inclusive economies, generating new sources of
demand and growth for the global economy. IDA works multi-sector and multi-year through
dialogue, knowledge and financing, to help countries build the institutions and capacity to: i)
grow and manage public finances, helping ensure that every dollar – both domestic resources and
ODA – is spent well; and ii) build inclusive economies. Working with IFC and MIGA, IDA is
uniquely placed to help develop the private sector as an engine of jobs and growth.

50.      IDA helps countries grow and manage finance flows, increasing their economic
resilience (Box 6). IDA works in the poorest countries to increase economic resilience through
policy guidance, institutional capacity building, technical assistance and financing. IDA, in
partnership with the IMF, works to support countries’ ability to enhance mobilization of
domestic resources and to spend them effectively. In countries with natural resource wealth,
strengthening governance and building core institutions in public financial management and
regulation are a particularly important challenge. In response to strong demand, IDA is also
scaling up its help to LICs to establish national tax systems and participate in the international
tax agenda, including in partnership with the IMF, OECD and UN. Additionally, as discussed
earlier (paragraph 21), IDA’s work to help countries build capacity to manage debt in partnership
with the IMF is more important than ever, with an increased heterogeneity of country situations,
more development finance being provided in the form of loans and IDA countries’ increased
access to capital markets.

                  .
 The WBG supports countries in the construction of effective, transparent and trustworthy institutions to help
 countries increase resources and spend them effectively. This includes improving public financial management;
 expenditure management and investment planning; enhancing domestic revenue mobilization; public sector
 modernization; institutional capacity for effective service delivery; improving citizens’ access to government
 information; and increasing government accountability through “open data? initiatives.
 As of July 1, 2014 the Governance GP had 39 active governance projects in IDA countries for a total of US$1.7
 billion.1 These include the BOOST program which has improved budget transparency in over 20 IDA countries
 including Tajikistan, Chad, and Haiti; work in the Central African Republic to help re-establish an operational
 government payroll; and improving open data in Tanzania to strengthen budget credibility and execution
 through better cash management, public investment management and procurement.
 WBG interventions range from diagnostics, technical assistance and advisory services, knowledge management
 and sharing, creating peer learning platforms, lending and reform implementation. With support from IDA,
 between FY13 and FY15, 26 IDA countries saw improvements in Public Management & Employment, 39 in
 Public Financial Management, 16 in Tax and 15 in Procurement.
 Examples of the types of interventions and public management improvements include strengthening:
        Civil service and public administration systems: IDA has helped improve the degree of integration and
         reconciliation between personnel and payroll data in Cameroon and increased the percentage of civil
         servants recruited on a competitive basis in the Kyrgyz Republic. Other interventions have led to
         reducing the time for key services and administrative processes or increasing the percentage of the
         population reporting satisfaction with central government services.

                   .
                                                    (continued)

        Public financial management (PFM) systems: The Maldives PFM Strengthening project helped
         minimize the deviation between aggregate expenditure outturn and the original approved budget while
         the Uganda Local Government Management Service Delivery project led to local governments
         registering an increase of at least 20 percent in own source revenue. Other activities focus on reducing the
         average difference between legislated budget allocation and expenditure outturns, increasing the budget
         execution rate, reducing domestic payment arrears or improving the timeliness of the release of semi-
         annual budget reports on available media.
        Tax policy and administration systems: In Myanmar, an IDA PFM Modernization project will
         contribute to enhancing the Tax to GDP ratio from 6.2 percent in FY12/13 to over 10 percent by FY18/19
         by increasing tax collections from large taxpayers and strengthening tax administration. Other activities
         include increasing the number of registered taxpayers, reducing custom clearance times or improving
         client perception of tax administration.
        Procurement systems: In Bangladesh IDA has helped expand e-procurement and use of a national
         competitive bidding process; in Mongolia, the procurement lead time has been reduced to below three
         months. Other activities include publishing financial and procurement documents or improving
         transparency and reduced transaction costs for public procurement.

     Note that beyond the Governance GP other projects in the WBG have focused or have some component related to
     strengthening institutions and public management systems.



51.     IDA helps countries build inclusive economies, where opportunity for all also
promotes productivity, resilience and growth. IDA’s multi-year investments in health,
education and social protection are critical for achieving universal health coverage in Africa.
Similarly, IDA’s multi-sector approach permits progress on issues requiring action across a
number of sectors, such as nutrition – which in turn have positive spillovers for a range of
development objectives. IDA invests in education to underpin future opportunity for all; with a
view to continuing to improve results, IDA’s education operations are now more consistently
using the results of impact evaluations to hone in on those elements most important in achieving
outcomes, including innovative approaches. Investments in universal health coverage, health
systems strengthening and education have benefits not just for individuals, but for the
productivity and future growth potential of the countries in which they live. Moreover, countries
cannot prosper with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines. IDA brings gender equality
considerations to agriculture, infrastructure, energy, and finance – "hard" sectors that are central
to women's economic empowerment.

52.     IDA also helps countries make sound infrastructure investments. With global
knowledge and expertise, IDA is responding to strong country demand with a package of policy
reforms, dialogue and tools to help countries select and design gender-informed projects that will
be financially, socially and environmentally sustainable. IDA helps countries design projects
able to attract private sector financing and uses its own financing to attract and leverage others,
including within the WBG (Box 7).

                 .
Private investment in infrastructure to IDA countries has been steadily decreasing since the end of the financial
crisis. More than half of investment is in telecoms, and much of the remainder is energy generation. There is
almost no private investment in water or sanitation or distribution. Boosting investment and helping IDA
countries develop bankable projects requires a comprehensive approach, involving all players – public, private
and MDBs. Synergies across the WBG are key for IDA’s support for infrastructure:
     The WBG is the largest financier of energy in SSA and a leader in the scale-up of renewables. The WBG
      renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio under implementation includes US$2.8 billion of
      IDA/IBRD and US$484 million of IFC support. In addition, the WBG has a portfolio of US$750 million
      from the Climate Technology Fund (CTF) and US$400 million from the Scaling up Renewable Energy
      Program (SREP), both of which are part of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). A customized mix of
      WBG financing and guarantee instruments is being used for the 360MW Nachtigal hydropower project in
      Cameroon as well as the 40MW Segou solar project in Mali.
     In Ghana, a US$500 million IDA guarantee and a US$200 million IBRD guarantee for the Sankofa Gas
      Project are expected to mobilize US$7.9 billion in new private investment for offshore natural gas – the
      biggest foreign direct investment in Ghana’s history and a leverage factor of 11 to 1.
     In Lao PDR, an IDA grant of US$65m was matched with US$18.9m in loans from the IFC to support
      rural electrification to strengthen the capacity of the power utility, expand its reach to the rural poor, and
      help the utility operate on a commercial basis, including brining electricity to 200,000 households
     In Myanmar, the WBG has a Joint Implementation Plan on Access to Electricity. IDA provided a
      US$140 million credit to increase the efficiency and more than double the capacity of the existing gas-
      fired power plant in Thaton I Monn State. IFC and MIGA have provided advisory services and financing
      for the first competitively bid Independent Power Plant in Myingyan, Mandalay Region. These two
      projects will jointly provide new access to electricity for more than 1 million households. IDA and IFC
      collaborate under the National Electrification Project – including a US$400 million IDA credit to help 6
      million people access electricity in remote areas, and the parallel complementary IFC Lighting Myanmar
      Program to help around 4 million people with market-based, off-grid solutions.
     In the Solomon Islands IDA and IFC are developing a 20 MW hydropower generation plant on a build-
      own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis. IDA (with the support of EIB and Australia) has developed
      feasibility level engineering designs, environmental assessments and community benefit sharing plans.
      IFC is serving as a transaction advisor and has helped attract an experienced hydro investor/operator.
      Looking ahead, IDA will provide a partial risk guarantee and finance the construction of a transmission
      line. Other donors are also considering financial support for the project.
     With support from IFC, Timor Leste conducted an international bidding process to select a world-class
      ports operator to build, own, operate and transfer a new US$300 million port. IDA/IBRD and other
      development partners are expected to finance a portion of the public investment commitments under the
      PPP scheme. In addition to financing, the WBG helped build government capacity for infrastructure
      planning, understanding government obligations under the PPP and optimizing the funding structure for
      public investment.
     In Afghanistan, IDA financed the digital transmission network, the WB and IFC helped reform policies to
      attract private investment, which subsequently allowed IFC to extend a US$65 million loan to
      Afghanistan’s largest mobile network and MIGA provided a guarantee for the mobile operator against
      noncommercial risks.
     In Senegal, IDA and IFC provided a suite of complementary instruments for the Taiba Ndiaye
      Independent Power Producer Project to increase electricity supply. The package aimed at facilitating
      South-South investment and promoting regional integration.
     In Nigeria, building on milestones achieved with long-term IDA support, the IBRD, IFC, and MIGA
      brought forward an integrated package of advisory services, loans and guarantees for a series of gas-fired
      energy projects to ease energy shortages. The project will also expand energy exports to neighboring
      countries in the West Africa Power Pool.
                                                            - 37 -


53.    The largest source of infrastructure finance among the MDBs, the WBG averaged
around US$20 billion per year in infrastructure commitments over the last 3 years. Over
one-half of all WB Infrastructure (Energy, Transport, Water and ICT) commitments go to IDA
countries, along with about one-third of IFC infrastructure investments and about three-fourths
of all MIGA guarantees since 2012. In IDA countries, financing for infrastructure (Energy,
Transport, Water, and ICT) has ranged between around US$6-11 billion per year, according to
demand.55 Depending on the year, between one third and one half of commitments are in South
and East Asia (Figure 18).

54.     IDA plays a vital role in meeting demand for financing for infrastructure in the
poorest countries. While private capital market flows may greatly outweigh MDB and ODA
financing in general in developing countries, the same cannot be said for private infrastructure
investment in IDA countries. Since the financial crisis, IDA commitment levels are about the
same as the total yearly global commitments – public and private, debt and equity – in private
and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) participation in infrastructure in the same countries. If
telecom projects – mostly investments in mobile licenses – are removed, the total private and
PPP flows into infrastructure are considerably less than IDA contributions to the same countries’
infrastructure. Globally, private participation in infrastructure in developing countries is under
significant pressure; a phenomenon also reflected in the decline in the number, volume and share
of PPP projects in the IDA and overall WB portfolio from FY14 to FY16H1.56

     According to calculations by the G24 and the Green Growth Institute, over 2004–2013, the WBG accounted for around one
     third of the infrastructure investments by the eight largest MDBs (concessional and non-concessional loans, grants, equity
     investments, and guarantees). See Humphrey (2015).
55
     This does not include additional commitments to social infrastructure, for instance health and education, which were nearly
     US$2 billion in FY15.
56
     Overall, PPP projects accounted for around 12 percent of overall projects in IDA countries at end FY16H1 (US$10.13
     billion or 19 percent of projects by commitment volume), marginally down from 13 percent in FY15 (US$10.23 billion or
     20 percent of projects) and 14 percent in FY14 (US$10.09 billion or 22 percent of projects). Over the same period, IFC’s

55.      The quality of infrastructure investment matters as much as the quantity and IDA’s
involvement helps assure quality. The impact on jobs and growth depends on, for example, the
regulatory and investment climate, the efficiency of public spending, and the selection and
design of projects. IDA supports the full life cycle of infrastructure development – from advice
on policy and regulatory reforms, to project preparation, transaction structuring and financing,
through to implementation and ongoing maintenance, as well as monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) of development impact. IDA helps countries build resilient infrastructure, as well as the
institutional capacity to manage that infrastructure over the longer term. IDA also works with
countries to identify which projects the public sector is best placed to undertake, and where
partnering with the private sector makes sense, and helps them identify, allocate and mitigate
risks, including fiscal risks. All IDA-supported infrastructure investments add critical value by
promoting robust fiduciary, social and environmental safeguards to ensure sustainable results. In
cooperation with MDB partners, the WBG has also developed practical tools to help countries
choose the right projects and to structure them in a way that makes then financially, socially and
environmentally sustainable.57

56.     Working with IFC and MIGA, IDA helps countries improve the business
environment and spur private sector investment for jobs and growth. The combined WBG
offers a broad range of interlinked advice, services and financing to catalyze private sector-led
growth and sustainable job creation which few others can match.58 These range from significant
infrastructure financing; advisory services to structure PPPs; support for sequencing of broad
sector reforms; tax reforms to reduce unnecessary burdens on businesses; guarantees to
encourage investors to come into challenging environments; legal and technical assistance to
improve the business environment. To date, eighteen joint IDA/IFC/MIGA implementation
plans have been identified for sixteen IDA countries, of which seven are FCSs. Five Joint
Implementation Plans are currently being implemented, of which two are in FCSs, with a further
six (of which one is an FCS) in the design stage. IDA continues to work with clients and, in
partnership with IFC and the private sector, to advance gender equality globally through lending,
expertise, and convening power.

57.    At a time of limited resources, IDA is a sound investment, with a track record of
innovating and evolving, of improving efficiency and of increasingly leveraging other players
and resources to deliver development results. Results are at the core of IDA’s business model
and are an area of continued management attention to ensure that the results culture its
mainstreamed throughout IDA’s work (see Section V below). Results are also at the core of
communicating IDA’s value, demonstrating how IDA works with countries to make a difference
on the ground. IDA has strong accountability and oversight and the high fiduciary standards of
the WBG. IDA’s effectiveness as a channel for aid delivery is attested by its consistently high
rankings in a range of independent reviews (Box 8).

     PPP-related portfolio of investment projects in IDA countries saw an increase, while the overall portfolio remained fairly
     stable over the same period at just under 5 percent.
57
     Examples include the Project Preparation Checklist, country assessments of PPP readiness, and PPP certification for
     officials.
58
     The WBG’s important role in mobilizing the private sector flows was recognized in the context of the post-2015 Agenda.
     See United Nations (2014) and Schmaljohann et al (2015).

     IDA is recognized as an effective source of development finance and expertise.
     External assessments see IDA as one of the international community’s top performing donors, citing high
     confidence that funding will deliver results, more predictable flows, and low administrative costs (including
     with the WBG now cutting more than US$400 million from its annual budget base).
     For example:
            The FY15 review of the most recent Country Opinion Survey reports two straight years of improvements
             in clients’ impression of the WBG effectiveness and the extent they believe staff are well prepared to
             help solve clients’ most complicated development challenges.
            A 2015 AidData survey of policy makers from 126 countries, the World Bank was ranked 1st out of 56
             donors on agenda-setting influence in developing countries.
            The 2014 Aid Transparency Index placed IDA in the highest category of multilateral organizations.
            A 2014 assessment by the Center for Global Development and the Brookings Institution named IDA as
             one of the international community’s top performing donors, citing IDA’s low administrative costs,
             more predictable aid flows, and large project size relative to other donors.
            According to a recent Brookings paper, the SDGs “represent, in many ways, a validation of what the
             WBG has been doing for many years.? 1
     1
         See Kharas (2015).



58.     IDA maximizes and leverages resources with the aim of moving from billions in
ODA to trillions in financing from all sources. IDA has a multiplier effect – leveraging the
rest of the WBG, providing a platform for a range of contributors, and helping draw in new
private sources of finance through its presence and policy dialogue. In line with AAAA, IDA
uses scarce concessional finance to mobilize and crowd in other financing sources, public and
private. IDA can work with innovative new sources of private finance to embed lasting change
at country level. For example, the Global Financing Facility (GFF) attracts additional domestic
and international financing sources, including capital markets to expand access to quality health
care. Teamed with IDA, the GFF encourages countries to put real money towards health goals.
Similarly, the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility also aims to leverage IDA resources to
encourage country- and regional-level investments in preparedness and strengthening health
systems (a key element for health sector resilience). Additionally, shareholders have called on
the WBG and other MDBs to further optimize their balance sheets and leverage capacities to
mobilize financial resources through innovative financing mechanisms. 59 In response, IDA
Management and Partners are exploring options including leveraging IDA’s equity to provide
additional financing. Furthermore, IDA Management and partners are exploring how to leverage
greater private investment flows to IDA countries, and in particular FCSs. In addition to IDA’s
complementary public investments, this could include flexible approaches to encourage private
investments and address critical constraints to private investment through risk mitigation
instruments, risk-sharing with IFC and MIGA, structured mobilization platforms, targeted policy
interventions, and sector reforms.

59.    IDA is part of a strong WBG that has undertaken ambitious reforms to ensure
resources are targeted where they can have the greatest impact on the basis of rigorous
Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs). The WBG’s new country engagement model
underpinned by rigorous SCDs and other analytical products promotes greater selectivity.
Combined with IDA’s performance-based allocation system, this model helps ensure that scarce
resources are targeted to where they will have the greatest impact (Box 9).60 Moreover, the new
WBG organizational structure of GPs and CCSAs mirrors the SDGs, enabling the organization to
help countries implement their plans.61

                Box 9. Selectivity and Impact: the WBG’s New Country Engagement Model
     The new country engagement framework launched in FY15 is evidence-based and supports countries’ efforts to
     end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The framework aims to be country-
     led and to increase selectivity in line with the WBG’s mandate and comparative advantage. The framework also
     helps the WBG collaborate and coordinate with other development partners to leverage resources and seek
     greater coherence across institutions and alignment with the country’s development priorities.
     The framework has four components:
        Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD): The SCD, conducted by the WBG in consultation with national
            authorities, the private sector, and other stakeholders, identifies a select group of high impact areas that
            will support a country in accelerating its development. It is an all-encompassing exercise, aiming to
            capture all areas of knowledge or knowledge gaps to give the most comprehensive picture of the
            country’s development situation possible.
        Country Partnership Framework (CPF): The CPF starts from the country’s own development goals and
            draws upon the SCD and other WBG analytical work. It derives program priorities selectively from the
            intersection of high-impact areas identified by the SCD, country priorities and the WBG comparative
            advantage (figure). The CPF is results focused, centered on a select group of objectives that the WBG
            program will help the country achieve. It is highly flexible and can be revised to reflect changes in
            country priorities, country circumstance and learning from implementation. For FCV, given
            uncertainties, WBG activities in the outer years remain flexible in the initial CPF.
        Performance and Learning Review (PLR): The PLR reviews implementation progress and introduces
            mid-course adjustments, updating the results framework and extending the CPF as necessary.
        Completion and Learning Review (CLR): The CLR is a tool for accountability and increasing
            development effectiveness. It assesses CPF program performance, WBG performance and alignment of
            CPF with the WBG twin goals.
     The success of the WBG engagement is finally reviewed and validated by the IEG.




     Early experience with the WBG’s new country engagement model suggest it has reinforced the focus on
     results, enhanced the platform for one WBG engagement; improved integration of cross-cutting issues –
     including gender, climate, fragility and violence – and served as a strengthened tool for partnership.

60
       To date, SCDs have been conducted in 13 IDA countries.
61
       See Schmaljohann et al (2015).

60.    IDA has a long tradition of evolving to reflect lessons learned and adapting to meet
the broad range of needs of a highly heterogeneous group of countries. IDA benefits from
the experience and expertise of its global partnership of developed and developing countries.
With a country-owned and led model, IDA strives to learn from experience and feedback to
continually improve and respond to new developments. Over time, IDA has responded to
emerging requests from partners with a number of important and bold innovations to enhance its
operational focus and maximize its financing and effectiveness to greatest client benefit. This
process of listening, learning and leading in development innovation will continue in IDA18.



A.

61.     The overarching theme for IDA18 “Investing in growth, resilience and opportunity?
aims to encapsulate the core elements of IDA’s value proposition. These include IDA’s
ability to connect country solutions to global challenges; its long-term engagement and
investment in building robust institutions, inclusive growth and private sector development; its
role as an essential instrument for building resilience, managing risk, and responding to crises;
and its results focus and sound investment. The proposed overarching theme also aims to
integrate the four special themes set out below, working up from these identified priorities to
craft a holistic vision of what IDA18 aims to achieve. Lastly, the overarching theme aims to be a
clear and compelling message, able to resonate with senior policy-makers and political leaders. It
also aims to convey the sense that, in an interconnected world, IDA for the poorest countries will
benefit all countries, that development finance is an investment with a return – both for IDA
countries and for the global community. Given that it encapsulates the four special themes,
Management proposes that the overarching theme not have separate policy commitments; its
aims are well captured by the actions under the special themes below.

B.

62.     The special themes for an IDA replenishment serve to deepen and catalyze focus
and results in critical areas across the IDA clientele. The special themes can help highlight
areas that need some extra attention – these have included: a strong focus in the 1980s on social
sectors; a focus on debt sustainability in the 1990s to the present, which resulted in the approval
of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, the development of the Debt Sustainability
Framework and IDA’s grant allocation framework; and the focus on results in the 2000s with
IDA’s pioneering work on results measurement, the focus on managing crisis and building
resilience at the time of the financial crisis, and the strong emphasis on gender, climate change
and FCV in several recent replenishments. While special themes can push the envelope in key
areas, including through increased data availability and the development of new tools, the IDA
client remains in the driver’s seat in setting country priorities in the use of its IDA resources.

63.     Participants at the IDA17 MTR urged that the IDA18 special themes be kept
selective, simple and compelling. Given the significant unfinished agenda, they particularly
encouraged a sense of continuity across the themes from IDA17 to IDA18, while emphasizing
continued adaptation to evolving circumstances and the 2030 Agenda (Figure 19) in each theme.
The proposals in this paper take this guidance into account and attempt to reflect this careful
                                              - 42 -


balance of continuity with adaptation. Each of the proposed special themes are described below,
followed by a discussion of the interlinkages between them.




Climate Resilient Development

64.     Climate change ranks high among systemic issues with large impacts on poverty
reduction. The WB’s recent report “Shock Waves? demonstrates the close nexus between
climate change and poverty reduction.62 The study uncovers the impact of climate change on
agricultural productivity and food prices, and highlights the climate change link with heat waves,
floods, droughts and other health consequences. For instance, in SSA, the study points to the
potential for climate change to trigger higher agricultural prices, thereby threatening food
security. It also unveils that poor urban households are more exposed than non-poor households
to the impact of floods. In the most extreme form of livelihood impacts, climate change could
make ecosystems completely uninhabitable, forcing out inhabitants – notably in small islands,
some of which are at risk of disappearing before the end of the century. The report concludes that
in the absence of action, the impact of climate change related shocks on poverty reduction will
worsen overtime and could result in more than 100 million additional people living in poverty by

62
     See Hallegatte et al (2015).
                                               - 43 -


2030. Natural disasters will impact livelihoods, increase diseases, cause crop failure and increase
food prices. These climate and disaster risks present a large agenda for action, ranging from
global partnerships and agreements, adaptation, insurance mechanisms, and the ability to provide
timely financing to mitigate the impact of climate-related natural disasters when they occur.

65.      2015 was a landmark year with 195 countries adopting a global climate agreement
in Paris, the Sendai Framework and the SDGs. The Paris Agreement sets ambitious
commitments for parties to reach peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve
rapid reductions thereafter to keep the increase in the global average temperature well below 2
°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C
above pre-industrial levels. Adaptation actions are considered as important as mitigation actions,
and the agreement promotes enhanced adaptive capacity and reduced vulnerability. The Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is the first post-2015 agreement on disaster risk
reduction. It outlines seven targets and four priorities for action: (i) understanding disaster risk;
(ii) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (iii) investing in disaster
reduction for resilience; and (iv) enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to
"Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.63

66.     The WBG is well positioned to help countries achieve their targets while fostering
inclusive development adapted to climate change, thus mitigating the risk of millions going
back into poverty. IDA has the opportunity to scale-up its contribution to supporting the goals
of multiple areas of the Paris Agreement (Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and the Sendai Framework.
These include strengthening the resilience of the most vulnerable countries through adaptation,
risk reduction, climate finance and facilitating low emission development, especially through
improved land management and improved economic efficiency of large-scale infrastructure
(particularly those across multiple countries). These efforts would also contribute to the SDGs
and enhance country systems and capacities. Specifically, IDA18 could contribute to:

        Deepening the discussion on climate change and resilience and continue to
         mainstream climate change in IDA’s work. This would provide opportunity to enhance
         resilience, risk reduction, building back better and improved preparedness through the
         use of programmatic approaches that are consistent with national and regional context.
         Such focus would contribute to the success of the INDCs and strengthen adaptation,
         resilience and risk reduction into the future INDCs;
        Enhancing the monitoring of climate finance from a wide variety of sources,
         instruments and channels. IDA18 provides an opportunity for further deepening of the
         methodology for climate finance tracking; and
        Undertaking analytical work and developing metrics that will improve the
         understanding of opportunities and risks from climate change policies for
         development priorities, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable. The work could
         explore the overlap between low-emission and climate resilience pathways, especially for
         long-lived and large scale assets. It would also provide examples of pooling of climate
         and development finance from multiple sources to support design and implementation of
         these assets. For a limited number of IDA countries, whose development hinges upon
63
     See United Nations (2015)b.
                                               - 44 -


       fossil fuel reserves or fossil-fuel dependent infrastructure, the analysis will include their
       economic vulnerability to the impact of a range of international and national
       environmental and climate policies. Potential options such as diversification of national
       asset portfolios and international economic integration to reduce the vulnerability will be
       highlighted.

67.     IDA18 provides the opportunity to continue mainstreaming climate change in IDA’s
work, and assist IDA countries in making progress towards climate resilient development,
including through strengthened preparedness. Building on commitments made in IDA16, the
IDA17 commitments pushed the envelope by mainstreaming climate and disaster risk in IDA
countries’ strategies, policies, plans and investments, and built climate-screening tools as a first
step towards climate resilience. Continuing climate change as a special theme in IDA18 would
acknowledge the importance of climate change for achieving poverty reduction and protecting
hard-won development gains. IDA18 will continue to support WBG corporate commitments,
such as efforts around increased climate co-benefits, and scale-up activities towards climate
resilient development; and when requested by countries, towards low emission development.

68.     Within the WB, IDA18 will be anchored in the WBG’s Climate Change Action Plan,
which will be presented to the Board in March, 2016, and the Regional Business Updates
(e.g., Africa). Discussions on strengthening the WBG approach to leveraging private sector
financing for climate resilient and low emission development, and addressing climate change
challenges through regional approaches will also be aligned with the IDA18 discussion.

Gender Equality

69.      IDA countries have made progress in closing gender gaps, especially in education;
but there are still lags in critical areas. The maternal mortality rate remains very high and IDA
countries face major gaps in economic opportunity, with women’s labor force participation,
employment status, job quality and access to productive inputs consistently trailing those of men.
Financial inclusion is a major challenge: more than 79 percent of adult women and men in IDA
countries remained unbanked in 2014 – and women are less banked than men by 9 percentage
points. Women and girls in IDA countries are also often deprived of voice and agency with the
incidence of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and sexual violence high, especially in situations of
fragility and conflict.

70.     Gender equality is a special theme for IDA17 and in earlier replenishments.
Important progress has been made, including (but not limited to): adopting a new gender
strategy, for the first time covering the full WBG; taking actions on improving availability and
quality of gender data in IDA countries; launching projects to address GBV and sexual violence
in FCSs; and, strengthening the knowledge base of what does (and does not) work to close
gender gaps.

71.    But there is still unfinished business. As more CPFs are prepared under the WBG’s
new operational model, continued focus on having SCDs identify relevant gender gaps and
addressing them in the CPF content and results framework will be necessary. Impact evaluations
on women’s economic empowerment have informed policy and operations, especially in SSA,
but need to be expanded. New Regional Gender Action Plans will be developed in ECA, MNA
                                              - 45 -


and AFR. Implementation of the new gender strategy involves rolling out a tracking mechanism
to better capture lessons and results throughout the implementation cycle and, critically, at the
close of an IDA-funded project.

72.     IDA18 provides the opportunity for investing in women’s improved access to jobs
and assets, and shifting the focus to results that really matter. Fulfilling one of the IDA17
commitments, a new WBG gender strategy was presented to the Board of Executive Directors in
December 2015. It will guide the work under the remainder of IDA17 as well as under IDA18.
Building on the framework in the 2012 WDR, the WBG will focus on four objectives: (i)
improving human endowments (including reducing high maternal mortality rates and closing
sticky “first-generation? gaps in enrolment and attainment); (ii) removing constraints for more
and better jobs (including a focus on enabling factors, such as better policy frameworks for care
services, reducing infrastructure and transportation deficits, and reducing skill gaps and
occupational sex segregation); (iii) removing barriers to women’s ownership of and control over
assets (with a focus on key productive assets such as land, housing, financial services and
technology, with a special effort by IFC to work with IDA countries to promote women’s access
to financial products, technology and agricultural supply chains); and (iv) enhancing women’s
voice and agency and engaging men and boys (including increasing women’s voice in service
delivery and supporting the reduction of GBV).

73.     As part of the WBG Gender Strategy, the IFC will use its investments in IDA
countries and advisory services to help clients effectively close gaps between men and
women in their workforces, as customers, corporate leaders and in supply chains. IFC will
work with clients to promote women’s better access to loans, savings and insurance services,
along with digital payment platforms. IFC will also help clients better understand how to
redistribute the burden of care so as to promote an increased share of women at all levels of the
workforce, especially in male-dominated sectors. On the knowledge side, IFC will help clients
better measure what works, and to collect sex-disaggregated company data.

74.     The new strategy places a stronger emphasis on IDA country outcomes and results,
which requires: strengthening the country-driven approach, with better country-level diagnostics,
policy dialogue, and sex-disaggregated data; developing a better understanding of what works
for gender equality, by enriching the evidence base; building more systematically on what works,
and bringing the evidence to task teams and clients; adopting a strategic approach to
mainstreaming that helps achieve results in client countries, including a more robust monitoring
system, and; leveraging partnerships for effective outcomes, particularly with key UN agencies
and the private sector. As part of the implementation of the new gender strategy, and to
strengthen our reporting for IDA18, we will launch a new system to better track how our
operations perform in generating results.

75.       Under IDA 18, success will require making progress in some key areas:

         Sex-disaggregated data and surveys by including individual-level information on
          employment and physical and financial assets. Real progress must be made in IDA
          countries’ availability and quality of data, both from the public and private sector.
          Household surveys must include better coverage of intra-household issues on
                                                - 46 -


         ownership/control over physical and financial assets, employment and income. Enterprise
         and labor force surveys must better capture work and earnings. IDA is well-placed to be
         an effective catalyst and partner in this work.
        Building the evidence in frontier areas. To improve the effectiveness of IDA18
         operations, the WBG is investing to understand what works and what does not to close
         economic gender gaps. In particular, further efforts will be made to build the knowledge
         base on frontier issues, including on jobs and assets, but also, for instance, in looking at
         the linkages between women’s livelihoods in FCV and GBV.
        Increase the use of Impact Evaluation evidence to inform project design under
         IDA18. The WBG Regional Gender Innovation Labs now conduct over 75 impact
         evaluations, most of which are in IDA countries. These rigorous, multiyear evaluations
         test initiatives to close specific gaps between men and women – many of them in
         economic opportunity – with results expected during the IDA18 cycle. Under IDA18,
         operations will develop a program seeking to improve the uptake of these rigorous results
         in their design.

Fragility, Conflict and Violence.

76.     Fragility, Conflict and Violence remain among the most pressing global policy issues
today and constitute major obstacles to achieving development objectives, including the
WBG twin goals. The close nexus between fragility and poverty is illustrated by the fact that the
FCSs have made slowest progress towards any MDG, including those that have already been
achieved globally. Overall, about 2 billion people live in countries where development outcomes
are affected by fragility, conflict and high levels of violence. In IDA FCS, more than half of the
population live in extreme poverty. The number of extreme poor in those countries accounted for
about 20 percent of the world’s extreme poor in 2012, and by 2030 this figure is expected to
double. While the number of civil and transnational wars has decreased globally, various forms
of conflict, domestic political instability and violent extremism are on the rise.64 There is also a
growing recognition that these challenges are not confined to LICs with weak capacity and poor
governance. Localized areas of fragility and high levels of social violence, where pockets of hard
to reach poor remain, can exist within the boundaries of an otherwise high capacity country.

77.     Recent events have also highlighted that FCV do not respect state boundaries and
are affected by transnational drivers and challenges. Some fragility dynamics are inherently
cross-border in nature (such as the Boko-Haram crisis or the refugee crisis) and create regional
and global spill-overs. Today, 60 million people are displaced because of conflict, of which 20
million are in refugee status.65 Most of the refugees are hosted in neighboring countries, as is the
case not only in MENA, but also in SSA and SAR. FCV situations are also increasingly
intertwined with regional and global dynamics: the vulnerability of state institutions combined
with transnational drivers such as organized crime, ideological movements and illicit financial
flows can lead to disastrous episodes of instability and/or state collapse which in turn can
generate spill-overs that affect regional and global security.

78.     The WBG is uniquely placed to support development in difficult environments and
to help address global challenges associated with FCV. The WDR 2011 has highlighted the
significant time it takes to address underlying causes of fragility and conflict and to put in place
the institutional arrangements required for governments to effectively mitigate and manage
associated risks. The WBG’s strong client focus, its long-term perspective and commitment, its
technical expertise and deep cross-country experiences represent important benefits for
governments at risk of conflict, violence and instability. The Bank has also embarked on
important analytical work on the definition of fragility. This will provide a more nuanced
approach to understanding and assessing fragility.

79.     Over the years, the WBG has engaged in important policy and financing reforms to
facilitate a scaled up engagement in FCSs. These changes culminated in IDA17 with a
significant policy and financing package, to increase IDA’s strategic relevance and operational
effectiveness, including through the introduction of the TAR. 66 At the IDA17 MTR donors
welcomed the progress made but also identified remaining challenges, in particular staffing in
FCSs, increased transparency in the use of the TAR and the high reliance on trust funds. IDA
deputies also called for continued attention to GBV, greater focus on risk mitigation and
displacement/refugees, enhanced collaboration with the UN and faster Bank responses during
crises.

80.      Building on the substantial progress achieved and lessons learned, possible areas for
strengthened engagement in IDA18 have been identified. These would consolidate and
expand those agreed in IDA17 and include new ones that would address the changing nature of
fragility and highlight linkages with other special themes. Priority areas and related
commitments for further enhancing IDA’s effectiveness in FCSs can be grouped under the
following four objectives:

        Support countries in addressing FCV challenges through improved
         strategies/operations and leveraging knowledge. This could include mainstreaming of
         fragility assessments, risk monitoring and risk management mechanisms, further building
         on and integrating lessons of what works in FCS contexts to more directly address core
         FCV issues, and deepening IDA’s support to tackling issues of FCV highlighted in the
         2015 Gender strategy.
        Improve operational effectiveness and flexibility. This objective would build on
         IDA17 commitments related to FCSs and further enhance the adequacy of the Bank
         operating model for delivering high quality operations in FCSs. This would include the
         need for addressing higher logistical and implementation challenges and costs in FCS
         countries, exploring whether current operational flexibility needs to be enhanced in
         special circumstances, and exploring the staffing and human resource solutions available
         in FCSs for their growing portfolio.
        Strengthen partnerships and “one WBG? approach. More specificity could be added
         to the IDA17 partnership and one-WBG commitments based on work done over the past
         year. This could include building on and strengthening the partnership with the UN and

66
     At the IDA MTR, Deputies endorsed the introducing a minimum base yearly allocation in the TAR of SDR 4.0 million to
     ensure higher financing to countries with small populations, subject to Board approval.

       the EU, further building on the WBG’s convening role. In addition, recognizing the needs
       for the private sector to be part of early interventions in FCSs, the WBG collaboration
       would be further scaled up. This will build on the proven track record IDA’s joint work
       with IFC and MIGA in FCS environments.
      Ensure adequacy of IDA financing framework and instruments. Recognizing the
       need for ensuring adequate and predictable financing to FCSs, Management could review
       and explore possible enhancements to its financing mechanisms. This could include
       reviewing IDA’s current resource allocation modalities and proposing – if deemed
       relevant – possible options to ensure that they remain responsive to the FCV challenge –
       including from forced displacement – and reflect the current understanding on FCV while
       promoting an effective use of the resources and preserving an adequate incentive
       structure.

Economic Transformation and Jobs

81.     Jobs and increased earnings through private sector-led growth is the cornerstone of
a self-sustaining development model and are critical to supporting social cohesion. Growth
in labor earnings are the largest contributor to poverty reduction – explaining between a third and
a half of the reduction in poverty. In the context of IDA countries, where the large majority of
jobs are in agricultural self-employment and non-farm informal activities, what matters most is
not job creation per se but rather increasing earnings through higher productivity. Moreover, the
degree to which jobs and earnings opportunities are inclusive – to youth, women, to residents of
lagging regions, and the bottom 40 percent more broadly – has important implications on social
cohesion and internal as well as international migration, particularly in FCSs and countries
facing youth bulges.

82.     Delivering sustainable, higher earning jobs in IDA countries, especially in an era of
lower global growth and depressed commodity prices, fundamentally requires facilitating
the process of economic transformation through the provision of critical infrastructure and
a supportive policy environment. This starts with raising productivity in the agricultural sector,
releasing workers to be absorbed into higher productivity sectors and activities, including
industry and tradable services. This shift into higher productivity jobs offers the potential to
support domestic resource mobilization through expansion of the tax base, which will be
increasingly critical to support IDA countries in moving toward stable and sustainable fiscal
regimes. But it also requires improving productivity and job quality in the informal sector, where
the large majority of jobs will be created in most IDA countries for the foreseeable future.

83.     The private sector sits at the heart of the economic transformation agenda.
Governments can support or hinder the private sector in creating higher productivity jobs, but
while public sector driven activities may play a palliative role in crisis periods or to address
specific market failures and lagging population groups, private sector investment and market
integration drives the broader process of economic transformation. In this sense, the private
sector can be leveraged to deliver solutions – including infrastructure, innovation, and the
delivery of critical social and market services – in IDA countries, particularly in the FCS context.
Moreover, communities that invest in multiple infrastructure services – power plus roads plus
                                                - 49 -


telecommunications, for example – reap far greater benefits in the form of non-farm wages and
job creation than those which invest in a single sector.67

84.      Economic transformation for more jobs and more productive jobs is underpinned
by an economy-wide framework that supports the potential of both firms and workers to
build assets and utilize market opportunities. It also requires a multi-disciplinary and multi-
stakeholder approach – one that is gender informed, adapted to context (e.g., FCV, youth
employment), and encompassing the full range of jobs (e.g., farmers, self-employed as well as
informal and formal wage workers). Such an enabling environment, which IDA, and more
broadly the WBG, has assisted governments in on a global level, includes the following key
pillars (Figure 20):
     Connectivity: Connecting people to better job opportunities and firms to markets
         through infrastructure, information, and networks.
             o Firms: Supporting the potential of firms to connect to domestic, regional, and
               global markets and to exploit the potential of regional integration and of global
               value chains through infrastructure (transport, ICT); facilitating the exploitation of
               agglomeration economies through support for urbanization, corridor
               developments, and industrial infrastructure, including special economic zones.
             o Workers: Connecting people (particularly the poor and vulnerable) to better jobs
               and services through infrastructure provision, urbanization and secondary towns
               development, and support for mobility, including access to transport, public
               services, and information.

        Capabilities: Enabling individuals and firms to build assets and leverage those assets to
         raise productivity and expand earnings.
             o Firms: Raising productivity by improving access to infrastructure (energy, water,
               and transport), land, capital, and technology, and improving management
               capabilities, particularly in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
             o Workers: Ensuring workers have capabilities to transition into higher productivity
               employment through: asset-building, including human capital (education and
               health), financial inclusion, and social capital, supported by productive safety
               nets.

        Macro and micro foundations: Effective interventions to advance connectivity and
         capabilities must be underpinned by stable, efficient, inclusive, and competitive markets
         that facilitate both growth and shared prosperity. Macro-fiscal stability, including strong
         domestic resource mobilization capacity, along with sound institutions and good
         governance (rule of law, property rights protection, control of corruption, regulatory
         efficiency) are necessary to encourage entrepreneurship and enable firms to invest,
         expand, hire workers, and invest in learning and productivity enhancement. This must be
         further supported by well-functioning factor markets and smooth and equitable access to
         land, capital, and labor. Equally important are well-functioning product markets,
         including open trade regimes, competitive domestic markets, favorable investment

climates, and national innovation systems. By addressing market failures and through
public investment that addresses bottlenecks, public resources can catalyze and leverage
private capital to deliver solutions for inclusive job creation in IDA countries, particularly
in the FCS context, to reach the 2030 agenda.

85.  Support for economic transformation and jobs has been at the forefront of the
WBG’s strategic focus in recent years.

      The WBG has supported economic transformation, diversification, and job creation in
       FCSs through a wide variety of operational approaches, including support for critical
       quality infrastructure, value chain development, market access, special economic zones,
       as well as support for firm-level upgrading.
      The WBG has leveraged the synergies of IDA, IFC, and MIGA to support private sector-
       led growth, job creation, and poverty reduction in IDA countries. For example, IDA, IFC,
       and MIGA offer a range of financing instruments to support public and private sector
       investment. Lessons from existing collaboration can help guide further significant
       scaling up of joint WBG assistance.

86.    As agreed in IDA17, in-depth Jobs Diagnostics in 15 countries, including 5 in FCSs,
are being delivered. They analyze both the supply and demand side of the labor market to give a
comprehensive assessment of the opportunities and challenges for job creation. Going forward,
the lessons learned will be better integrated into country strategies through the SCD/CPF
process.

87.   In IDA18, IDA could build on lessons from IDA17 as well as the ‘billions to trillions’
agenda. The focus could be on helping countries better identify and address country-specific
impediments to economic transformation, private sector-led growth and job creation along two
dimensions:
                                              - 52 -


   (a) Deepening existing operational tools and expanding approaches to deliver more
       effectively in the multi-stakeholder environment inherent in the economic transformation
       and jobs agenda, such as measures offering risk mitigation tools and credit enhancement
       to leverage IDA and IDA’s balance sheet; and

   (b) Enhancing further and disseminating the Bank’s knowledge base through more
       data and analytics to support the focus on productivity, economic transformation, and
       jobs and earnings, and strengthening feedback loops to operations through lessons
       learned. This also includes building on and enhancing the job diagnostics and by
       improving the monitoring and evaluation of growth and jobs impacts of investments,
       particularly in major infrastructure projects.

Links Among the Proposed Special Themes

88.     IDA18 provides an opportunity to explore and strengthen links among the special
themes. The 2030 agenda emphasizes that the agreed development goals are not a menu of
independent objectives. Instead, the framing of the SDGs emphasize the interconnections
between development goals and the need to pursue their implementation in an integrated manner.
Through its global breadth, country depth, analytical capacity, financial strength and by working
with IFC and MIGA, IDA is uniquely placed to respond to this call. As detailed below, there is
significant scope for synergies among the proposed special themes. IDA’s holistic approach to
development will ensure that efforts under one special theme are leveraged for advances in
others.

      Gender Equality and Economic Transformation and Jobs: Jobs are at the core of the new
       WBG gender strategy. As countries diversify from agriculture and move up the value
       chain, it will be critical to help women break occupational segregation in the labor
       market, with special efforts to increase the productivity both of those working formally
       and informally. This could build on ongoing work with the Jobs Diagnostics – all those
       produced to date draw on sex-disaggregated data as a step to identify actions that can
       bring about more, better and inclusive jobs and collect information on gender
       norms/occupational segregation The connectivity and capability provided by energy,
       water, transport, and telecommunications infrastructure brings opportunities for better
       earnings, access to health care, markets and education (e.g., minimizing travel times
       allows women to balance overlapping schedules of work and household responsibilities).
       Furthermore, where infrastructure services fail, it is the women of the developing world
       who suffer disproportionately. In cities, for example, personal safety and security is
       compromised by poor transit systems and unreliable and unpredictable transport systems.

      Gender Equality and Climate Resilient Development: Ongoing work shows that women,
       children, and elderly are often the most vulnerable to climate change. Women’s
       responsibilities, including as stewards of resources, position them well to contribute to
       livelihood strategies adapted to changing environmental realities. Adaptation efforts
       should include work to empower women, especially in agriculture, to help communities
       actively prepare for potential climate shocks, and to ensure that productivity gaps with
       men continue to close. Having social safety nets as part of the climate resilience and
       disaster response decreases the short and long-term effects on their lives, livelihoods, and
                                                               - 53 -


          assets. This is particularly true for FCSs, such as Haiti, where climate-related impacts can
          erode development gains and leave a long-term legacy.

         Fragility, Conflict and Violence and Gender Equality: Ongoing work on FCSs, including
          in the Great Lakes region in Africa, looks to prevent and mitigate the effects of sexual
          and GBV. Under IDA18, an urgent agenda will be to build a larger knowledge base to
          understand the norms of masculinity and violence against women, with a particular focus
          on what can work for normative change. IDA could also do more to make the linkages
          between responses to GBV and women’s economic activities in project design. Finally, it
          will be important to include women fully in post-conflict transition operations, whether in
          the demilitarization and demobilization agenda or in fast-disbursing community-driven
          development projects.

         Fragility, Conflict and Violence and Climate Resilient Development: Climate risks and
          demographic factors can act as threat multipliers in environments where basic
          government functions are weak and societies are not cohesive. Repeated cycles of
          conflict and violence may hamper appropriate mitigation and adaptation policies, adding
          the effects of climate change to communities already devastated by violence. In higher
          capacity environments, they can exacerbate conflict risks, through for example increased
          resource competition, volatility of food prices and transboundary water management
          disputes. Further efforts are also needed to better understand the impact of climate change
          on migration, migration as a mechanism for adaptation, and the needs of fragile
          communities that ultimately migrate due to (or in part) to climate change.

         Fragility, Conflict and Violence and Economic Transformation and Jobs: Providing ex-
          combatants with sustainable employment and income is a critical component for
          stabilization and long-term development in post-conflict (PC) environments. Investments
          in the expansion of water and sanitation networks and in road maintenance and
          rehabilitation produce much more short-term jobs than other, technology-intensive
          investments, due to the natural targeting to low income workers.68 Yet, in a PC setting,
          almost no private investment in infrastructure materializes in the first seven years after
          the close of conflict.69 Thus, the time in which these countries are at the highest risk for
          return to conflict coincides with the years in which investment is least likely to flow.
          More broadly, the challenge of a sizeable number of youth entering the labor market
          represents a significant stress factor for FCSs. Failure to address the jobs challenge,
          especially in countries with an upcoming “youth bulge,? is likely to have serious
          implications not only on poverty reduction, but also on migration and social cohesion. In
          FCSs, employment creation has remained flat, due to weak infrastructure, high costs, low
          productivity and depressed levels of investment. Employment levels will remain
          substantially below what’s needed unless private-sector led economic transformation is
          jumpstarted.




68
     Largely due to the sensitivity of infrastructure investment to sovereign risks.

        Economic Transformation and Jobs and Climate Resilient Development: Reducing
         greenhouse gas emissions is, in large part, an infrastructure story. The alternatives
         available and consumer choices related to passenger and freight transport as well as
         energy production and consumption will drive client countries’ ability to reach their
         INDCs. While IDA countries represent a small share of overall emissions, infrastructure
         investment decisions are being made today that will lock countries into particular carbon-
         intensity paths.70 In addition, understanding better how climate change is likely to impact
         jobs and earnings in key sectors (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and fisheries) and regions
         where the poor are concentrated will be critical to designing appropriate policy and
         investment solutions. Deepening these links will support identification of opportunities to
         enhance resilience and also promote adaptation, through infrastructure, urbanization, and
         technology adoption at the firm level. Concretely, reliable water, transport, and energy
         systems and quality housing are critical to managing the impacts of climate changes on
         economic activity and individuals' well being. If investment in resilient assets is
         postponed inhabitants and economies will be at increased risk.




89.     IDA’s focus on monitoring, measuring and achieving results goes back more than a
decade and is now embedded systematically into IDA’s operations, reporting and systems.
In 2002, as part of IDA13, IDA was the first MDB to use an overall framework with quantitative
indicators to monitor results and performance, now known as the IDA Results Measurement
System (RMS). IDA has, thus, been a pioneer in results measurement, through the RMS, with a
view to maximizing development impact and ensuring efficiency.71, 72

90.     IDA has now established a strong track record with its sustained focus on results,
while adapting to changing needs and lessons learned. Since IDA13, the RMS has been
enhanced and refined in order to better position IDA to identify the extent of progress achieved,
along with emerging challenges. Notably, IDA’s results focus has been reinforced by continued
support for statistical capacity building in IDA countries and improved quality of results
frameworks in IDA’s operations and country strategies. The RMS has also been expanded to
provide a more comprehensive measurement framework for monitoring IDA countries’ progress,
IDA-supported development results, as well as IDA’s operational and organizational
effectiveness. The RMS includes selected aggregated Core Sector Indicators (CSIs) that
measure IDA’s contribution to key sectors.

91.    The IDA RMS provided the foundation for development of the WBG Corporate
Scorecard. The Corporate Scorecard launched in 2011 also covers financing from IBRD. In
2014, the first WBG Corporate Scorecard (also covering the IFC and MIGA) was presented as an
implementation tool to track progress toward the goals of the new WBG strategy. The current

70
     These lock-in effects will include levels of sprawl and the potential for urban densification, the share of thermal power in
     energy matrices, the efficiency of commercial trade across transport corridors, and the orientation of riders to transit
     alternatives versus individual cars.

                                               - 55 -


WBG Corporate Scorecard covers 83 indicators, divided into three main tiers: the long-term
development outcomes and the broader the context of countries in which the WBG operates;
results achieved by WBG clients implementing operations supported by the WBG; and a
performance tier to measure operational and organizational effectiveness.

92.     Looking ahead, IDA will continue its focus on rigorous monitoring of results. For
instance, as noted above, a critical component of the new WBG gender strategy will be to put in
place a tracking mechanism to better capture lessons from throughout the implementation cycle
and, critically, to capture results at the close of a project. More broadly, efforts will continue to
strengthen results measurement at the country and project level and to create incentives for staff
to incorporate lessons from evaluations and other studies (including impact evaluations) in order
to rebalance a compliance mindset with a learning perspective. There will be an enhanced focus
on tracking the implementation of policy commitments and attention to strengthening the
monitoring of IDA’s special themes building on the existing robust system put in place for
IDA17. The RMS will also maintain a close linkage with the IDA18 policy commitments and
further enhance its relevance as a management tool to track progress on IDA’s development
effectiveness, with a special focus on IDA’s special themes.

93.     Efforts will be focused on enhancing and streamlining the RMS while maintaining
its robustness and strategic value. Key efforts will include harmonizing the RMS with the
WBG Corporate Scorecard as much as possible to improve efficiency, enhance coherence
between the tools and contribute to improving the quality of the associated data. Alignment with
the SDGs, as its global monitoring indicators are finalized, would be another critical
consideration. It will also include efforts to improve the usability of the IDA RMS as a
management tool, such as refining indicators of the RMS as part of the ongoing CSI reform,
acknowledging and adjusting challenges associated to data quality (i.e., measurability,
quantifiability, marginal effort to report) and refining aggregation methodologies for measuring
and aggregating indicators to make these relevant to current practice and the re-organized WBG.
Central to these efforts will be ensuring that the IDA RMS (and WBG scorecard) is consistent
with and reflect the spirit of the new SDGs, while maintaining the RMS’s ability to serve
specific needs in monitoring IDA’s performance.




94.     The IDA18 replenishment will be key in setting the tone for IDA’s role in tackling
today’s ambitious development agenda and complex, interconnected challenges . The
detailed papers to be prepared on the overarching and special themes for the June meeting will
demonstrate this, and present areas where IDA can push the envelope to best meet those
challenges. The papers, which will reflect the inputs from Participants at the first IDA18
meeting, will present possible policy commitments to further strengthen both results as well as
cost efficiency and effectiveness. They will also emphasize efforts to expand the knowledge base
of IDA’s engagement and strengthen the statistical capacity of IDA countries, essential for
evidence-based solutions.
                                              - 56 -


95.     Rising to the challenge of the global ambitions, and associated country needs, will
require a strong replenishment for IDA18. This will be underpinned by a strong agreement on
the importance of tackling the areas set out by the special themes and overarching theme. A
robust replenishment would be underpinned by a strong package of policies and strong support
for the proposed strategic directions to ensure IDA continues to be well-positioned to tackle the
global ambitions and support clients in their development paths. In this context, do Deputies:

   a. Agree that the reflection of today’s complex and interconnected challenges in this paper
      appropriately sets the context for the IDA18 replenishment?

   b. Recognizing the need for strong coherence between the ongoing discussions in both the
      WBG Forward Look and the IDA18 replenishment, agree that IDA is a key tool for the
      international community to implement global agreements in the poorest countries?

   c. Agree with the proposed overarching theme for IDA18 of “Investing in Growth,
      Resilience, and Opportunity?, and the continued focus on results?

   d. Agree with the four proposed special themes for IDA18, including (i) continuation of the
      IDA17 special themes in the areas of climate resilient development, gender equality and
      fragility, conflict and violence, and the directions for deepening work in these areas
      articulated thus far in the paper; and (ii) a new special theme of economic transformation
      and jobs with a focus on connectivity and capabilities, and building the foundations of
      stable, efficient and competitive markets; with a special emphasis on quality
      infrastructure?

   e. Agree, given IDA’s focus on poor and vulnerable populations, to explore how IDA could
      enhance its support to address the issue of forced displacement?

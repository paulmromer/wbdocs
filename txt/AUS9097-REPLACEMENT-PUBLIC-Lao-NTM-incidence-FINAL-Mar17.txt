Executive Summary
1.      As a small, land-linked, and commodity-dependent country in a fast-expanding
region, Lao PDR’s growth prospects are directly linked to its ability to benefit from
integration into the global economy. Over the last decade, the Government has given priority
to the integration of its economy into both the Southeast Asia region and the multilateral rules-
based trading system. As a result, the country signed the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement
(ATIGA) in 2010 and became a formal member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
2013. Both agreements required profound modifications on tariffs, non-tariff measures
(henceforth NTMs), customs reforms, and trade facilitation.

2.      This report provides a comparative overview of the landscape of NTMs affecting
imports in Lao PDR. The effectiveness of the regulatory framework to trade is important for
firms and consumer to be able to access imported products in a cost-efficient way as well as for
the Government to exercise the adequate control to ensure that products comply with domestic
regulations. An efficiency system should also minimize informal trade. This report focuses
specifically on the incidence of NTMs in import flows. It provides a comparative overview with
respect to other countries in the region and with the situation before WTO accession.
Additionally, this report identifies current lingering regulatory hurdles that hamper the ability of
the country to reap the gains of a deeper integration with the global economy.

3.       While the accession to the WTO brought Lao PDR NTMs close to the regional
practice, the current framework still includes a cumbersome and costly import license
scheme that raises the time and costs to bring products into the market. Three main
problems associated with the procedures to obtain licenses are identified. First, because the
system to grant licenses is centralized in the capital for the majority of regulated products, rural
traders must spend time and resources to obtain the certificates in Vientiane. Second, a lack of
coordination between central authorities, in charge of granting licenses, and border agencies, in
charge of enforcing the licenses, leaves room for provincial authorities to exercise their own
discretion and delay the process. Third, internal procedures and timelines to grant licenses at the
central government are not well communicated to the trading community, leaving room for
unnecessary delays and encouraging informal payments to be made to expedite the process. Para-
tariff fees associated with import licenses applied to approximately US$ 211.5 million worth of
imports in 2014 (7% of the total) and are estimated to be equivalent to ad-valorem tariff of 5.4%,
which is well above regional and world averages.

4.      Besides increasing the costs and the time required to import products, the current
license structure may have negative implications for households (specially the poor) and
can also encourage importers to resort to informal channels to bring their product into the
market, putting the health and safety of consumers at risk. Because traders typically pass
part of the extra costs incurred by obtaining the license, the impact of this policy is reflected in
the final prices paid by consumers, resulting in a negative welfare impact. The costs associated
with the imposition of these measures are large in sectors that are potentially important for
domestic consumption (vegetable oil, processed food, and vegetables).



                                                 i
Policy Recommendations


5.     Conducting a regulatory impact assessment of import licenses and of their
associated fees should be a priority. An immediate step should be reviewing the manner and
frequency that fees are collected to reduce the administrative burden associated with applying for
and obtaining import licenses for the trading community. This effort must be followed up by a
more comprehensive review of licenses in those products that, while important for the daily life
of Lao people, do not generate important fiscal revenue to line agencies. Products under this
category include bicycles, food preparation items, stoves, baby strollers, and –to a lesser extent,
motorcycles.

6.      The institutional mandate to review, consult, and propose regulatory modifications
to streamline NTMs is already in place at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC).
The Department of Imports and Exports (DIMEX) serves as the technical secretariat of the NTM
Review Sub-Working Group (NRSWG), which is the interagency body in charge of discussing
and streamlining proposals made by DIMEX at the highest level of the Government. To ensure
that the technical analysis translate into policy actions, it is paramount that the NRSWG is
legally enacted by the MOIC.

 I.    Introduction

1.      An efficient and transparent regulatory framework governing international trade is
a necessary condition for countries to realize the benefits of international trade. Over the
last decade, Lao PDR has been deepening its economic ties with the global economy through the
formal accession to the WTO in 2013. At the regional level, the country is committed to be full
member of the ASEAN Economic Community. These agreements entailed profound changes to
Lao PDR’s regulatory framework governing international trade.

2.      This report provides an overview of the incidence on NTMs on import flows in Lao
PDR before and after WTO accession and identifies lingering regulatory hurdles that may
still hamper the ability of the country to reap the gains of a deeper integration. Employing
detailed and comparable NTM information, this note characterizes the changes in the trade-
related regulatory framework in Lao PDR and compares the current scheme with that of other
countries in Asia. The report also combines econometric estimations of Ad-Valorem Equivalents
(AVEs) of NTMs with qualitative information collected through fieldwork to identify priority
measure to streamline.

3.      The analysis indicates that the accession process to the WTO brought Lao PDR’s
NTMs landscape closer to the regional practice. The reduction of the incidence of NTMs after
WTO accession is explained mainly by a remarkable reduction in the prevalence of non-
technical measures, particularly quantity controls. Yet, the country still uses this type of
regulation with a higher frequency than other countries in ASEAN. In line with international
practice, the relevance of technical barriers – technical regulations that lay down compulsory
product characteristics or their related processes and production methods – has increased over
time.

4.      The current NTM landscape still includes a cumbersome and costly import licensing
scheme and an array of para-tariff charges –import taxes and levies other than custom
duties– linked to licenses that translate into a complex import regime that raises
substantially the time and cost to bring products into the market. Automatic and non-
automatic licenses cover around 34% of imports by value. Three main problems with the
procedures to obtain licenses are identified. First, because the system to grant licenses is
centralized in the capital, rural traders must spend time and resources to obtain the certificates in
Vientiane. Second, lack of coordination between central authorities, in charge of granting
licenses, and border agencies, in charge of enforcing the licenses, leaves room for provincial
authorities to exercise their own discretion and can lead to delays in the approval process. Third,
internal procedures and timelines to grant licenses at the central government are not well
communicated to the trading community, resulting in unnecessary delays and incentivizing
making of informal payments to expedite the process.

5.     Para-tariff fees associated with import licenses applied to approximately US$ 211.5
million worth of imports in 2014 and are estimated to be equivalent to ad-valorem tariff of
5.4%, which is well above regional and world averages. The collection of para-tariff used by

                                                 1
Lao PDR include import fees, import licensing fees, stamp tax, customs inspection fees, as well
as taxes and additional changes for sensitive product categories.

6.      Taxing imports to generate fiscal revenue for line ministries may have unintended
consequences for both the welfare of the community and the competitiveness of Lao PDR’s
enterprises. While some developing countries with underdeveloped tax systems tend to tax
imports to capture fiscal revenue, the impact of this policy goes beyond raising the cost for
traders as they are typically passed on, at least in part, to consumer and are reflected in market
prices. The report finds that the costs associated with the imposition of non-technical measures in
Lao PDR is high particularly in sectors that are potentially important for domestic consumption
(vegetable oil, processed food, and vegetables). Consequently, the current system may have
negative welfare implications for households, especially the poor. A costly and complicated
import regimen also encourages importers to resort to informal channels to bring their products
into the market, putting the health of consumers at risk.

7.       Assessing the necessity and proportionality of para-tariffs linked to import licenses
should be a priority for the Government of Lao PDR, particularly in those sectors where
imports are important for domestic consumption. The institutional capacity to undertake this
review is already in place as the Department of Imports and Exports (DIMEX) of the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce has established a technical working group to review and propose
recommendations to streamline binding NTMs. Conducting an analysis on the necessity and
proportionally (tests recommended by the WTO to review trade-regulations) of these measures
may prove useful to help consumers access imported products and may contribute to reducing
the incidence of informal trade. International experiences on streamlining NTMs indicate that a
robust technical analysis (regulatory impact analysis) paired with political support at the highest
level of the Government increases the possibilities of policy changes aimed at improving the
business climate. See Annex 1 for some international experiences on the processes and
institutions to streamline NTMs.

8.      This report is organized as follows. Section II discusses main conceptual issues and
presents the data and metrics to examine the role of NTMs in import flows. Section III, describes
the trade incidence of NTMs and compares it with similar countries and with the situation prior
to WTO accession. Section IV combines an econometric technique with qualitative information
to discuss the stringency of NTMs. Section V presents some concluding remarks and provides
some recommendation for reform.

II.     Non-Tariff Measures

9.     Broadly defined, Non-Tariffs Measures are regulatory measures, other than
ordinary customs tariffs, that may have an economic effect on international trade in goods
by changing quantities traded, prices or both (UNCTAD, 2010). Because of the different
types of policies encompassed by this definition, the economic analyses of NTMs and their
implications for trade and, ultimately, for economic development, are not yet well understood
(Ferrantino 2006). The changing nature of international trade, moving from an exchange in final
products to an exchange in intermediate products, also poses challenges for countries to
understand how to deal effectively with NTMs (Staiger 2012). This section discusses main
conceptual issues to consider when analyzing the role of NTMs and presents a general
framework and data sources necessary to conduct a comparative study of the current regulatory
framework governing trade in Lao PDR.


      A. Conceptual Issues


10.     As statutory tariffs have been dramatically reduced in recent decades under the
forces of multilateral, preferential, and unilateral trade liberalizations, NTMs have taken a
central role in the international trade agenda. While the World Trade Organization (WTO)
recognizes the right of countries to introduce trade regulations to achieve legitimate non-trade
objectives such as protecting human, animal, and plant life; NTMs can also be used as
protectionist tools.1 While every country implements regulations to meet legitimate policy
objectives associated with protecting their communities from poor quality or potentially unsafe
goods entering their markets, they need to recognize that excessive or poorly designed regulation
often increases the cost of doing business and therefore, the final price paid by consumers.

11.      Regardless of their objectives, NTMs have far reaching economic effects beyond
raising trade costs. Countries imposing NTMs may inadvertently end up hurting the poor –as
NTMs may increase the price of key staples– and hampering the competitiveness of their own
private sector –as NTMs may affect the price of imported inputs in products that are ultimately
exported. Likewise, NTMs applied by other trading partners’ also have a direct impact on the
ability of firms to enter and survive in foreign markets.

12.      The significance of NTMs in increasing trade costs is important. In average, estimates
of tariff equivalents of NTMs tend to be higher than tariffs across the world. Kee et al (2009), for
instance, find that NTMs add, on average, an additional 87% to the level of trade restrictiveness
imposed by tariffs, and note that for 34 countries (of a sample of 78) the contribution of NTMs to
the overall level of restrictiveness is higher than the contribution of tariffs. Similarly, Calvin and

1
  The multilateral discipline on non-tariff measures encourages countries to employ international standards for
technical regulations, when possible. In addition, the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and the Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) agreements indicate that regulations must be science-justified, not more trade-
restrictive than needed, and must be applied in a non-discriminatory fashion.

                                                      3
Krissoff (1998) show that the tariff equivalent of NTMs on US apples exported to Japan is
27.2%. This estimate significantly exceeds the average tariff rate of 19.3%. Results from
businesses surveys also indicates that burdensome trade-related regulations are binding factors
impeding the ability of firms in low and middle income countries to increase their
competitiveness (Henson et al 2000).

13.     However, NTMs cannot be simply dismissed as trade barriers that ought to be
removed. Results from gravity type models including Disdier et al (2008), Fontagné et al (2005),
Portugal-Perez el al (2010), and Reyes (2012) indicate that while NTMs increase trade costs,
they can also be trade promoting. This is because certain NTMs, such as product standards and
labeling requirements, provide firms valuable information about domestic technology,
idiosyncratic tastes, and consumer preferences that would be very difficult and costly to obtain
otherwise. These regulations may also be welfare-enhancing because they provide consumers
with information thereby lowering the cost of determining the quality of a product (avoiding the
‘lemon problem’), facilitating comparison, and reducing uncertainty (Crivelli and Gröschl 2012,
Disidier et al 2008, and Ganslandt and Markusen 2001).


    B. Taxonomy and Data Collection Process


14.     Given the encompassing definition of NTMs, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD
established in 2006 a Group of Eminent Persons on Non-Tariff Barriers (GNTB) to define a
classification of NTMs, which could be used to collect comparable information across
countries.2 The subsequent NTM nomenclature developed by GNTB comprises a tree/branch
structure. Measures with similar objectives are categorized into 16 “branches” (chapters) denoted
by alphabetical letters A to P. Chapters A to O specify the requirements the importing country
imposes on imports, while Chapter P details those regulations they place on their exports. Each
of these 16 “branches” is further disaggregated into “sub-branches” (1-digit), “twigs” (2-digits)
and “leafs” (3 digits) allowing for a finer classification of NTMs. Table 1 presents the structure
of the NTM nomenclature at the highest degree of aggregation.




2
  The GNTB established a Multi-Agency Support Team (MAST) which comprised representatives from several
international organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

15.     During the last four years, the international community has collected and classified
trade regulations according to this NTM taxonomy. Currently NTM data is publically
available for 51 countries, including information for Lao PDR collected in 2011 (Annex 2). The
information is made public through the World Integrated Trade Solution website
(http://wits.worldbank.org) –the World Bank’s gateway for trade data and analysis.

16.     Given that the WTO accession process involved a series of regulatory changes to
align the country with multilateral disciplines, we updated the NTM data in 2014 from
information stored in the Lao PDR Trade portal. The Lao trade portal is a recently developed
online platform that centralizes the regulations and procedures that are compulsory for traders to
export and import products. Box 1 presents a brief overview of this tool as of its importance to
increase the transparency of trade. With the support of DIMEX, the regulations were matched to
NTM and HS codes. This report therefore employs two waves of NTM data in Laos collected in
2011 and 2014, in conjunction with similar data collected in other countries around the globe, to
assess the extent to which NTMs in Lao PDR changed after WTO accession and to determine
how it compares with other countries in the region.


          BOX 1: THE LAO TRADE PORTAL – MAKING TRADE MORE TRANSPARENT
The Lao PDR Trade Portal (www.laotradeportal.gov.la), launched by the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce on June 22, 2012, enables traders to cut down the number of trips needed to get information or
the length of time for carrying out transactions when trading across borders. In a transitional economy
such as Lao PDR, new firms often find it difficult to get information on business processes. The private
sector has identified a lack of transparency and predictability surrounding regulations as a major
investment climate constraint. It is also the first step towards the establishment of a National Single
Window which will allow traders to discharge all import/export obligations through one channel
electronically.



                                                      5
The Lao PDR Trade Portal provides traders with access to:
•       All trade-related laws, regulations, measures, restrictions and licensing requirements and tariffs
       indexed, cross-referenced, and searchable by commodity code;
•       Non-tariff measures (NTMs)
•       Detailed process maps of business procedures for importing and exporting;
•       Full listings of national standards for products;
•       Procedures for clearing goods at the border;
•       Downloadable forms; and,
•       E-alerts which traders can customize to receive information on commodities.
As of June 2015, all line ministries vetted the information and authorized the publication of collected and
classified NTMs in the Lao Trade Portal. All 370 measures were uploaded and published in the Lao PDR
Trade Portal. Within these, 226 measures are NTMs based on the UNCTAD NTM Classification System
and 144 measures are considered as national standards (i.e. voluntary measures).
The Lao PDR Trade Portal is now fully operational, content is up-to-date, and the portal platform is stable
and remains relevant to the needs of traders. Similar portals are now being implemented with support
from the World Bank in several developing countries including Lesotho, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal,
Malawi and Botswana and work will soon commence on one in Vietnam. The trading community
continues to provide positive feedback on the Lao PDR Trade Portal. As of end of March 2015,
cumulative hits on the home page total 211,007 since its launch in June 2012 with 43 percent representing
hits that dive down into rich portal content. Content searches for legislation made of 17.2 percent,
commodity search (14.4 percent) and import and export manual (10.2 percent). By country of origin
search, more than 56 percent of hits were from Lao PDR, followed by Thailand (8.1 percent), Vietnam
(4.3 percent) and USA (4.2 percent). Between January and March 2015, there were 28 queries posted on
the feedback facility regarding import, export and transit information and procedures. DIMEX responded
to these inquiries almost instantly.
The Lao PDR Trade Portal is also helping Lao PDR comply with WTO and ASEAN commitments that
require member countries to make their trade-related regulations available to the public in an easily
accessible manner.



17.     The data provides comprehensive information about the different type of NTMs
that are currently enacted in each country. Each regulation is classified according to the
highest level of disaggregation of the 2012 UNCTAD NTM classification and assigned to the
specific product(s) (6-digit HS codes) covered by the regulation. While the data contains
information on whether the measures are aimed at individual trading partners or are applied
irrespective of them, we keep only those measures applied on a MFN basis. The data also
contains information about the entry date of each measure as well as the agency responsible for
its administration and enforcement. We focus the analysis on NTMs affecting imports as they
cover the lion share of regulations government trade. In particular, we look at the complete set of
technical measures (sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, and pre-
shipments inspections requirements) and at a subset of non-technical measures (price and
quantitative controls).




                                                     6
III.   Incidence of Non-Tariff Measures in Imports

18.     A quantification of the incidence of NTMs in trade flows requires the definition of
clear metrics to compare their relevance across countries, economic sectors, and type of
regulations. We employ standard inventory measures to characterize the change in the trade-
related regulatory environment in Lao PDR after WTO accession (Deardorff and Stern 1998) and
to compare its current situation with that of other countries in the region. The indicators
comprises the percentage of product lines covered by at least one NTM (frequency ratio), the
share of the total import value impacted by at least one NTM (coverage ratio), and the average
number of NTMs applied to a given product (the pervasiveness score). See Annex 3 for the
formal definition of these indicators.

19.     Despite the thorough definition of the proposed indicators, it is worth noting that
they do not identify whether NTMs serve as a barrier to or catalyzer of trade. The data
solely identifies the products that are affected by different types of regulations along with their
respective import value. In addition, given the nature of the data, we cannot observe
implementation or enforcement problems. The analysis is also heavily dependent on the
diligence of the data collection process, which in the case of the data for Lao in 2011 was
undertaken by a consultancy company.


       A. A comparative Snapshot


20.    The prevalence of NTMs in imports in Lao PDR decreased after WTO accession,
indicating that the alignment of the country to multilateral disciplines resulted in less
intervention to trade flows. After WTO accession, Lao PDR reduced the percentage of
products covered by at least one NTM from 72% -the second largest frequency ratio in the
sample- to 13% -the second lowest level of the sample – (Figure 1). A similar trend can be
observed in the case of the coverage ratio where the reduction goes from 83% to 42% of the
import value that is subjected to at least one NTM. The number of NTMs that are applied to the
average import product (pervasiveness score) was also significantly reduced after WTO
accession. In 2011, this number was equivalent to 2.6, the third highest across comparable
countries. By 2014, this measure had fallen to 0.4, the third lowest.

21.     The reduction in the incidence of NTMs in imports is explained mainly by a notable
reduction in the prevalence of non-technical measures, specifically the use of quantity
controls. Yet, the country still employs these measures in a higher frequency than other
regional countries, such as Indonesia and Philippines. Although non-technical measures are
progressively losing ground around the globe, the ASEAN region still makes frequent use of
quantitative measures and price controls (Figure 2). These so called ‘command and control
measures’ are likely a remnant of earlier periods when several countries were managed as
centrally planned economies. Lao PDR and Cambodia, the least developed countries in the
sample, apply more price controls measures than China, Philippines, and Indonesia. 3 However,
during the same period the incidence of technical regulations has increased. In fact, the share of
imports covered by TBT measures (coverage ratio) increased from 5% in 2011 to 16% in 2014.
The import incidence of SPS measures, however, shows a small reduction.

22.     While Lao PDR now relies less on non-technical measures to regulate imports, its
current stock of NTMs still indicates the prevalence of a number of para-tariff charges as
well as a cumbersome licensing system that translates into a complex and pervasive import
regime and raises substantially the level of protection. Para-tariffs –import taxes and levies
other than customs duties– affect 23% of imports by value. In developing countries where the
domestic tax system is underdeveloped, it is not uncommon for Government agencies tend to use
these instruments to capture fiscal revenue to finance their operating expenses.

23.     Import licenses (both automatic and non-automatic) also cover a significant share of
import value (21.8% and 12.6%, respectively), increasing the cost of doing business. Figure
3 shows a network representation at the 2-digit NTM code level of disaggregation that portrays
the current landscape of NTMs in the country. The most prevalent measures in Lao, as judged by
the coverage ratio, are additional taxes in connection to services provided by the Government
(category F6) and other automatic licensing measures (category C4). These measures covered,
respectively, 23.1% and 21.8% of import value in 2014. The importance of these measures in
Lao contrast international evidence where technical measures are the most prevalent NTMs, in
particular conformity assessment for both SPS and TBT measures. Annex 4 presents the network
representation for the world as a whole.

        B. Incidence of NTMs on sectoral Imports


24.     The prevalence of NTMs varies greatly across sectors both for technical and
economic reasons. While some products, such as agriculture, electric machinery, and weapons,
are highly regulated because of consumer and environmental protection issues, some other goods
are by their nature less subject to laws and regulations.

25.     The reduction of the use non-technical measures after WTO accession was driven by
a substantial decline in quantity controls across all economic sectors. However, this
reduction was partially offset by a larger share of products subjected to price control
measures (para-tarrifs) affecting mainly vehicles, optical and medical instruments,
processed food and beverages, fats and oils, and wood products. Examining the incidence of
different types of NTMs at the sectoral level (Table 2), we find that in 2011 almost all economic
sectors were affected by quantity controls whereas in 2014 these measures were restricted to
vehicles, mineral products, and oil. At the same time, the number of products affected by price
control measures (para-tariffs) increased. In particular, vehicles, optical and medical instruments,
processed food and beverages, fats and oils, and wood products are currently affected by an array
of para-tariff measures; which include import fees, import licensing fees, stamp duties, customs
and other border management agency inspection fees, as well as additional taxes and charges for
sensitive product categories.4 Fees associated with licenses (category F65) are the most pervasive
type of para-tariff measure, covering almost 14% of total imports in 2014.

 The analysis using coverage ratios shows broadly the same results in terms of sectoral incidence of NTMs. See
Annex 5.

Notes: The figure depicts the trade-related regulatory framework in Lao PDR. Each node represent a type of NTM at the 2-digit.
There are 33 type of NTMs at the 2-digit level: 21 technical measures (8 SPS, 8 TBT, and 5 PSI); 12 non-technical measures (4
quantity controls and 8 prices controls). Node sizes are proportional to the coverage ratio (the share of import value affected by each
measure). The position of each node in the map reflects its connectedness in the network. Nodes with many relevant connections
tend to be situated around the core of the network. Links represent the join importance of the pair of measures (joined coverage
ratio). The table at the bottom presents the description and the coverage ratios of the nodes. Data is for 2014.

26.     The use of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures in Lao PDR tends to be in line with
international norms and are primarily concentrated in animal, vegetable and foodstuff
segments as the control of such products is essential for ensuring the wellbeing of
consumers and the protection of the environment. Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)
measures are understandably more dispersed across sectors, with a concentration in vehicles and
optical and medical instruments. Pre-shipment inspection requirements (mostly automatic import
licenses) were expanded from vegetable sectors before WTO accession to many agricultural
products after WTO accession.

27.     Import license fees (category F65) are the most important para-tariff currently in
effect in Lao PDR. Around US$ 211.5 million of imports (7% of total import value) were
covered by these fees in 2014. This requirement is applied to a wide range of products (Table 3).
However, given their relative importance in terms of imports flows, only petroleum, cars,
motorcycles, and auto-parts are significant for fiscal revenue purposes. These sectors represent
92% of the value of imports affected by this measure.

28.     There are several products affected by import license fees that do not make a
significant contribution to revenue and could, instead, encourage rent-seeking activities, as
well as increasing the cost of importing products, and generating unfair delays for the
trading community. A total of 35 products (4-digits HS codes) account for 7.4% of imports by
value in 2014 (Table 3). Among this group, several products are particularly important for the
daily life of Laotians including bicycles, food preparation items5, bicycle parts, stoves, and baby

strollers. The complete list of the products affected by licensing fees is provided in annex 6.
Assessing the necessity of fees linked to import licenses for these products would facilitate
imports without adversely affecting fiscal revenue. Given the popularity of motorcycles in the
country, it may be timely for the Government to reassess the role of licensing fees on these
products. As discussed above, the current requirements also provide unnecessary opportunities
for rent seeking behavior from low level officials.

        for distribution to final consumers, an import license is not mandatory.

IV.    How Stringent are Non-Tariff Measures?

29.     Regardless of their type or the legitimate policy objective, NTMs increase
compliance costs for the private sector. For example, importers of processed foods currently
face not only standard technical regulation that are intended to protect Lao PDR consumers, but
also a complex system of non-technical measures (such as para-tariff charges or licensing fees),
which significantly increase the cost of bringing lawfully goods across the border. At least some
of these costs will be passed onto consumers via increased domestic prices —the amount that is
passed on to consumers depends on many observed and unobserved producer and market
characteristics—and should be measured. Unnecessarily high compliance costs will also
encourage importers to resort to informal channels to bring in their products, putting the health of
consumers at risk.

30.     The following section examines the level of stringency of the current regulatory
framework governing trade at three different levels. First, we employ an econometric model
to estimate ad-valorem equivalents (AVEs) of NTMs. Second, we report traders perceptions on


                                                      13
binding regulatory constraints gathered through focus groups discussions. Third, we report
regulatory complaints reported by Lao PDR’s main trading partners.

31.     There are two ways of looking at the impact of NTMs in trade flows: through prices
or through quantities. When a country imposes a cost-raising NTM on a certain good, that
good’s price rises on the domestic market. If the regulatory measures are non-discriminatory as
mandated by WTO rules, the price rise reflects a cost increase that is the same for imported and
domestically-produced brands of the good. The price rise, in turn, reduces demand for both
imported and domestically-produced products. Thus, there are conceptually two ways of
approaching the demand-reducing effect of the measures: (i) by looking at the price increase, or
(ii) by looking at the reduction in the quantity demanded. Both approaches raise data and
estimation issues. See Ferrantino (2006) for a discussion about the econometrical methodologies
to estimate the impact of NTMs.

32.     This report uses a price-based model to estimate the impact of NTMs on border
prices in Lao PDR. Using the empirical model explained in Annex 7, we estimate AVEs in Lao
PDR in 2014 and compare them with the average in the Southeast Asia region and in the world.
The analysis is performed by economic sector and by type of NTMs. Non-technical measures are
pulled consolidated in the ‘rest’ category.

33.     This analysis indicates that the current NTMs framework in Lao PDR is equivalent
to an overall ad-valorem tariff of 6.3% (Table 4). This percentage is lower than the averages
for the region (9.3%) and the world (8.3%). The relative low impact of NTMs in border prices
reflects the low-level of technical regulations enacted by the country in comparison to more
developed economies. In fact, AVE for both SPS and TBT measures are slightly lower than the
world average. SPS measures, in particular, have much lower AVEs in Lao PDR (2.5%) than in
the region (5.8%) and the world (4.0%).

Note: This table shows the average AVE estimated for each economic sector in Lao PDR, the East Asia Region,

34.     However, non-technical measures in Lao PDR are equivalent to a larger tariff rate
than in the region or the world, indicating the pervasiveness effect of these measures for
importers. The estimated AVE for this type of NTMs (labeled as ‘Rest’ in Table 4) is of 5.4%,
which is well above the regional (3.3%) and the world (0.2%) averages. As shown in Table 2,
para-tariffs represent the largest share of non-technical NTMs imposed by the country. The
sectors where non-technical NTMs have a higher incidence in terms of ad-valorem equivalents
are fats and oil (26.1%), processed food and beverages (23.0%), optical and medical instruments
(13.7%), and chemical products (8.9%).

35.     The evidence presented here indicates that the implementation of non-technical
measures contributes to a complex import regime that increases the cost of doing business
across borders in sectors that are potentially significant for domestic consumption, such as
vegetable oil and processed foods. As traders may pass at least part of these extra costs on to
consumers, such regulations may have negative welfare implications for households in Lao PDR,
particularly for the poorest segment of the population. A pervasive import regime also
incentivizes informal trade, which according to several observers remains a significant problem
in Lao PDR (see USAID 2013 and Anderson et.2009).




                                                                        15
         A. Private Sector Perceptions


36.     Import licenses were also identified by private sector representatives as key
regulatory hurdles that increase the cost and time to import goods. In March 2015 the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the World Bank, conducted a series of
focal group discussions with representatives of food and manufacturing sectors to discuss their
experiences importing products into Lao PDR and to identify key regulatory bottlenecks
affecting their businesses. While the econometric estimation of the level of stringency of NTMs
is useful to benchmark the cost-raising impact of NTMs across different countries, the aggregate
level of analysis at which they are computed impedes the identification of the specific measure
that is responsible for high level of AVEs. Therefore, the econometric analysis was
complemented by discussions with private sector representatives who shared their experience in
complying with trade regulations on the ground.

37.    According to the private sector, the way trade licenses operate is detrimental to the
business environment for three main reasons. First, because the majority of licenses are
granted in Vientiane, traders in rural areas must go to the capital to apply for permit.6 Second, the
system leaves room for discretion for provincial authorities to request more information (or
documentation) than what required for in the license. Third, internal procedures and timelines to
grant licenses at the central government level are not well communicated to the trading
community, leaving room for unnecessary delays and encouraging the use of informal payments
to expedite the process.7 Other important constraints mentioned by private sector representatives
include the lack of automation of procedures at the border in agencies other than Customs and a
broader lack of coordination between central government officials and provincial authorities.


         B. Trading Partners Assessments
38.     Many countries periodically monitor regulatory barriers in partner countries that
can potentially affect the ability of their exporters to access markets according to the rules
established under bilateral or multilateral agreements. For instance, the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) submits an annual report to the U.S. Senate on significant foreign
regulatory trade barriers, which provides an inventory of the most important foreign barriers
affecting U.S. export of goods and services. Likewise, the Directorate-General for Trade of the
European Commission maintains an online database listing trade barriers reported to the
Commission as detrimental for EU market access throughout the world. A similar online system
has been developed in East Africa that allows trades to identify problematic NTMs that affect
their capacity to trade with regional countries. These reports and systems aim at enhancing

6
  The regulation that notifies the products subject to import licenses is No. 0076/MOIC.DIMEX (available at
http://www.laotradeportal.net/index.php?r=site/display&id=73). Currently, the Government is revising this
legislation to transfer the authorization to grant licenses to the provincial level, mainly for pesticides and chemical
substances. Export licenses for logs, trunk, bark, transformed timber, and semi-finished times are granted at the
provincial level.
7
  For instance, one private sector representative reported that licenses granted by the ministry of Public Health had to
be signed directly by the Minister himself, greatly delaying the procedure to obtain the permit.

awareness of trade restrictions and facilitates bilateral negotiations to remove or improve NTMs.
As part of this study the US and EU report were reviewed to identify any specific constraint
relating to the use of NTMs in Lao PDR. 8

39.     Mandatory registration requirements for importers and the extensive use of licenses
needed to import products in Lao PDR are identified as key regulatory barriers by the U.S.
According to the 2014 USTR report on foreign trade barriers, all importers must register with the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce before importing. In addition, motor vehicles, petroleum and
gas, timber products, cements, and steel, are subject to import licensing. American businesses
also complained of irregularities and corruption in the customs clearance process, even though
the recent expansion of the automated customs declaration processing system (ASYCUDA) to
main customs entry point has reduced the clearance time for the imports of goods.

40.     Corruption and informal payments are also reported as major barrier to trade for
U.S. businesses seeking to operate in Lao PDR. According to the report, informal payments to
low level officials in order to expedite administrative procedures are common. In a 2012 survey,
one quarter of firms reported paying bribes, with the median amount of the bribe rising by a
factor of ten since 2009. To date, the EU commission has not received any complaint regarding
trade barriers in Lao PDR9.

(www.globaltradealert.com) platform. This initiative seeks to provide information in real time on state measures that
are likely to discriminate against foreign commerce. Lao PDR has only one measure (as opposed to 51 in Thailand
and 3 in Cambodia) related to a new ministerial decree in the Law on Investment Promotion of 2009 which allow
foreign investors to own land. According to this regulation, foreigners are allowed to purchase a maximum of 800
square meters of land from provincial and national authorities if they have invested at least USD 500,000 in the
country.

V.     Concluding Remarks and Policy Recommendations

41.     During the last decade, Lao PDR has taken significant efforts to modernize the
regulatory framework governing trade and private sector development. Progressive steps
were taken to establish a more rules-based economy and a predictable investment climate. Both
international and regional multilateral commitments have served as external anchors to motivate
and to cement economic reforms. The country is currently implementing its obligations under the
ASEAN Trade in Goods agreement (ATIGA) which entered into force in 2010 and, in 2013
became the 158th member of the WTO.

42.     This note provides a comparative overview of the landscape of regulations affecting
imports in Lao PDR. We compare the current stock of NTMs and its incidence in import flows
with that of other countries in the region and also with the situation before WTO accession. The
overall objective of the report is to combine this analysis with econometric estimations of the
stringency levels of NTMs and qualitative information from fieldwork to identify lingering
regulatory hurdles that hamper the ability of the country to reap the gains of a deeper integration
with the global economy.

43.    We find that the current NTM framework in Lao PDR is broadly in line with
similar countries in the region. Consistent with international practice, the importance of old
fashioned command and control approaches to control import competition via prices or quantity
controls, such as minimum prices or import quotas, has been reduced. Consequently, the
importance of technical measures, such as SPS and TBT measures, which reflect societal
demands for minimum quality levels, have been increased. Overall, accession to the WTO has
brought the NTM framework in Lao PDR closer to that of the ASEAN region.

44.     Yet, the current import licensing scheme and the associated array of fees linked to it
raises substantially the time and cost to bring products into the market. Three main
problems associated with the procedures to obtain licenses are identified. First, because the
system to grant licenses for the majority of products is centralized in the capital, rural traders
must spend time and resources to obtain the certificates in Vientiane. Second, a lack of
coordination between central authorities, in charge of granting licenses, and border agencies, in
charge of enforcing the licenses, leaves room for provincial authorities to exercise their own
discretion and delay the process. Third, internal procedures and timelines to grant licenses at the
central government are not well communicated to the trading community, leaving room for
unnecessary delays and encouraging informal payments to be made to expedite the process.
Import licenses fees are applied to 45 broad product categories (4-digits HS codes) which
accounted for US$ 211.5 million in 2014. Licenses applied to the importation of oils, cars, and
auto-parts generate 92% of the revenue produced by licenses-linked fees. Fees applied to licenses
in other products do not generate significant revenue and, instead, increase the cost of doing
business.

45.     The impact of taxing imports using fees linked to licenses has an impact beyond
increasing trade costs. Because traders typically pass part of these extra costs the impact of an
inefficient import system is reflected in the final prices paid by consumers, resulting in a

                                                18
negative welfare impact. Moreover, the costs associated with the imposition of non-technical
measures in Lao PDR are large in sectors that are potentially important for domestic
consumption (vegetable oil, processed food, and vegetables). Consequently, the current system
may have negative implications for households, especially the poor. A complex import regimen
also encourages importers to resort to informal channels to bring their products into the market,
putting the health and safety of consumers at risk.

46.     Revising the import licensing scheme and, more importantly, assessing the necessity
and proportionality of fees linked to import licenses, should be a priority for the
Government of Lao PDR. A first step should be changing the manner and frequency that fees
are collected to reduce the administrative burden associated with applying for and obtaining
import licenses for the trading community. This effort must be followed up by a more
comprehensive regulatory impact assessment of licenses in those products that, while important
for the daily life of Lao people, do not generate important fiscal revenue to line agencies.
Products under this category include bicycles, food preparation items, stoves, baby strollers, and
–to a lesser extent, motorcycles. Conducting an analysis on the necessity and proportionally
(tests recommended by the WTO to review trade-regulations) of licenses may prove useful to
help Lao PDR’s consumers access imported products and may contribute to reducing the
incidence of informal trade.

47.     The institutional mandate to review, consult, and propose regulatory modifications
to streamline NTMs is already in place at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The
Department of Imports and Exports (DIMEX) serves as the technical secretariat of the NTM
Review Sub-Working Group (NRSWG), which is the interagency body in charge of discussing
streamlining proposal made by DIMEX at the highest level of the Government. To ensure that
the technical analysis translate if policy actions, it is paramount that the NRSWG is legally
established.

Annex 1: Process and Institutions to Streamlining NTMs 10
Brazil
Brazil has improved its regulatory practices, including the adoption of regulatory impact
assessments (RIAs). The program to strengthen the institutional capacity and the quality of
regulation (PRO-REG) is focused in promoting and implementing RIAs in Brazilian regulatory
agencies. Several gubernamental agencies take part of this initiative. Although this is an ongoing
process, some preliminary lessons are as follows.
First, this experience confirms the importance of the staff availability to implement RIA and
cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and the specific skills required to quantify economic, social, and
environmental impacts. Staff size and deadlines to develop the studies need to be correlated; thus
if deadlines are short, more people must be assigned to the task.
Second, the characteristics of regulatory institutions are critical. A requirement for succeeding in
establishing RIAs is to take into consideration the administrative structure of the agency
conducting the process in terms of hierarchy, how tasks are distributed and shared, and
individual competencies. Above all, it is important to have a clear diagnostic of the institutional
infrastructure before implementing the RIA.
A third important factor is financial resources. Improvements in staff, databases, and
infrastructure are dependent on the availability of financial resources. The competition for
financial resources might compromise the development and implementation of new tools for
RIAs, even though these tools could provide gains in optimizing the allocation of public budget.
Another important issue is that this kind of initiative to quantify and qualify the effects of
regulations and propose scenarios to policy makers is only possible if cooperation is achieved
among the different governmental agencies, research institutes and universities, and, especially,
the private sectors represented by their organizations and other representative organisms. A
network of experts is a way to pursue a faster advance in this arena.

Indonesia
Streamlining NTMs in Indonesia received a new impetus from the Ministry of Trade in
September 2011, which launched a pilot program establishing a review process for NTMs issued
by this ministry, currently responsible for 61 percent of all NTMs issued. The main thrust of the
program is to remove the NTM review process from the unit that implements NTMs and to equip
a new unit with adequate capacity to conduct RIAs. The decree establishes a Non-Tariff Policy
(NTP) Team within the Ministry of Trade whose tasks are to (1) coordinate with relevant
agencies for input into the formulation and establishment of NTMs; (2) formulate and submit
recommendations to the Minister of Trade on NTM policies; (3) monitor and evaluate the
implementation of NTM policies; (4) introduce NTM policies to stakeholders; and (5) participate
in international trade negotiations in the framework of bilateral, regional, and multilateral
cooperation with implications for Indonesia’s NTM policies.

The ministry also introduced a standard operating procedure (SOP) for reviewing NTMs to
conduct objective and independent assessments within a specified time. The team will analyze
the eligibility of a proposed NTM; analyze potential impacts of a proposed NTM using
appropriate analytical tools; verify the proposed NTM’s consistency with other national policies
and with the WTO rules or other international agreements; and hold a public consultation
through meetings with stakeholders or field surveys. The NTP Team should reach a conclusion
regarding the NTM within a maximum of 60 working days.

Mexico
Mexico’s COFEMER (Comisión Federal de Mejora Regulatoria) RIA program was consolidated
and detailed in reforms to the Administrative Procedures Act in 2000, which were greatly
influenced by the Economic Deregulation Unit’s five years of experience in the review of
regulations and international best practices. The main aspects of the program were:

   The presidential appointment of the COFEMER head and the granting of technical autonomy
    to the institution.
   The creation of the Federal Council for Regulatory Improvement as a means of ensuring the
    accountability of COFEMER and giving the business, labor, and academic sectors an
    important role in the direction of the reform program’s work program.
   Requiring each ministry and regulatory agency to name a vice-minister in charge of
    coordinating in-house regulatory reform efforts, and of submitting two-year work programs
    to COFEMER for review and public comment.
   Implementing a detailed RIA review process and a mandatory minimum 30-day period of
    public comment for all regulations. COFEMER can question and require more detailed
    analysis of RIAs within 10 working days of submission and has 30 working days to issue its
    opinion on the proposal itself. Ministries and agencies must publicly respond to all
    COFEMER comments and suggestions.
To enhance transparency and provide guidance on how to conduct RIAs, COFEMER developed
an electronic platform that allowed for the centralization of communication between COFEMER
and the vice-ministry in charge of regulatory reform in each institution, easy access to technical
reference materials, and prompt publication of relevant consultation documents. The online RIA
template includes sections on the following:

   The description of the regulatory action, identifying the nature of the problem and risks that
    each proposal seeks to address.
   Legal analysis, including a clear review of powers, and compatibility with the existing
    regulatory framework.
   Alternatives considered (both regulatory and non-regulatory), and an explanation of how the
    proposal is considered to be the least intrusive option to attain the stated goals.
   Implementation strategy and the consideration of resources necessary to ensure proper
    compliance and supervision.
   Quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs and benefits of the proposal. In addition to requiring
    explicit consideration of effects on market competition, domestic and international trade,
    small and medium size enterprises, and consumer access to goods and services, the RIA

health, safety, and the environment be itemized.

Annex 3: Indicators for Measures the Importance of NTMs
This report uses three main indicators to evaluate the pervasiveness of NTMs in import flows as follows.

Frequency Ratio: This measure accounts exclusively for the presence or absence of an NTM, indicating
the percentage of imported products to which one or more NTMs are applied. In formal terms, the
frequency index of NTMs ( ) imposed by country j is calculated as:


                                             Fj    i i   100
                                                   DM 
                                                    Mi 
                                                         

Where  is a dummy variable taking the value of one if product  is subject to one or more NTMs and
 (also dummy variable) indicates whether there are imports of product . Because products have all
equal weights, this measure tends to over-emphasize products with very low import value.

Coverage Ratio: This indicator measures the importance of NTMs in terms of the overall import value.
The ratio represents the percentage of the imports to country j that is subject to at least one NTM. In
formal terms the coverage ratio ( ) is given by:

                                                       ∑  
                                                = [            ] . 100
                                                        ∑ 

Where  is defined as before, and Vi represents the actual value of imports of product . Because
products affected by trade restricting measures are imported in lower quantities and therefore get a lower
weight in the calculation, the coverage ratio tends to under-estimate overall trade restrictiveness. This
problem is commonly known as an endogeneity bias and it arises by virtue of the fact that imports are
dependent on NTMs.

Neither the Frequency nor the Coverage ratio takes into account whether more than one type of NTM are
applied to each product.

Pervasiveness score: In practice, a large number of products have more than one regulatory measure
applied to them. For example, a product could be subject to a sanitary standard as well as a technical
measure on quality, and finally to some licensing. Arguably, the greater the number of NTMs applied to
the same product, the more regulated the commerce of that product is, especially if measures are from
different NTM chapters.11 The pervasiveness score ( ) provides the average number of NTMs 
affecting an imported product  . In formal terms the pervasiveness score is given by:

                                                      Ni M i 
                                                Pj           
                                                      Mi 
                                                              

Where  is defined above and  represents the number of NTMs that apply to product i.




11
  The rationale is that measures within the same chapter are similar in nature and thus often impose relatively less
burden than measures from different chapters.

Annex 7. Ad-valorem Tariff Equivalent Estimation


We rely on the price-based methods to estimate the price-impact of NTMs on border prices
(Cadot and Gourdon 2014). The only type of prices observable in absolute form and at a
disaggregated level are trade unit values, obtained by dividing trade values by quantities. There
are several problems with using trade unit values to assess the price-raising effect of NTMs. One
is that the data is noisy, as customs typically monitor imperfectly import quantities (border taxes
are assessed on values, not quantities). The second problem is that trade unit values do not
include intermediation margins (from CIF border price to wholesale and retail prices). This is
problematic in the presence of quantitative restrictions, if licenses are given to domestic
distributors; in that case, trade unit values will not reflect the shadow value of the licenses. This
potential problem should however be kept in mind when interpreting the price effect of NTMs.
Formally, let o, d and p index respectively the origin country, the destination country and a
product identified at the six-digit level of the Harmonized system (over 5’000 products). Let  o
and  d designate vectors of “fixed effects” identifying respectively each origin country and each
destination country. These fixed effects adjust the model’s constant for each country,
neutralizing the influence of all idiosyncratic factors that could influence the level of prices (for
the destination country, they control for the cost of living; for the origin country, they control for
aggregate productivity). Let vodp be the unit value of product p imported from country o to
country d, and x od a vector of bilateral determinants of trade including distance, common
language, common border, and so on. Let A designate type-A measures (SPS) in the MAST
nomenclature, “B” type-B measures (TBT), and “C” type-C measures (PSI). We define a dummy
variable to identify if a country employs a particular type of NTM as follows:

                      1 if country d applies a type-A NTM to product p
                  A
                 ndp                                                  (3)
                      0                    otherwise

The estimation equation is

        ln vodp  o   d  1Andp
                                 A
                                     1B ndp
                                           B
                                               1other ndp
                                                         other
                                                                 2 ln 1  todp   xod γ  uodp (4)

Note the similarity of (4) with a standard gravity equation of trade. A variant of this equation
makes it possible to differentiate the effect of NTMs depending on characteristics of the
importing country by interacting country characteristics such as the level of income with the
presence of NTMs:


        ln vodp   o   d                     1k ndp
                                                       k

NTMs not with country characteristics as in (5), but with country dummies. The idea is the
same—namely, to account for systematic variations between countries in the application of all
NTMs on all products, depending on levels of income, governance, and, when using dummies,
on any unobservable characteristics of a given country.
Given that there are over 4’575 products at the HS six-digit level on which at least one country in
our sample has an NTM (in all, there are over 5’000 products at HS6); three different types of
NTMs and three coefficients by type of NTM (the importer-specific dummy interacted with the
three type of NTMs), the estimation in (5) would involve estimating a maximum of 35 × 3 ×
4’575 =62375 coefficients. This is likely to be intractable if we try to estimate these coefficients
in a single regression. We run this regression instead product by product and only show import-
weighted average AVEs for each type of NTM, by country and by economic sector.
Note that the degree of pass-through of compliance costs is not mechanical and depends on
market structure. In a standard monopolistic-competition model, “mill pricing”, where producers
charge the same FOB price to all destinations, is optimal. There is then full pass-through.
However, new theoretical and empirical developments show that the degree of pass-through
depends on market structure, firm size and other determinants (see e.g. Auer and Schoenle 2013
and references therein).

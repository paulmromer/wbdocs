I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Chad perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Chad
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Chad
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information


II. Methodology
From April to June 2015, 401 stakeholders of the WBG in Chad were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; PMUs; consultants/contractors
working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/community based organizations (CBO); the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 277 stakeholders participated in the survey
(69% response rate).

Some respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in
person, and others received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Chad; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Chad; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President,
       Prime Minister were combined with those from the office of Minister; respondents from
       ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants
       working on WBG-supported projects were combined; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/CBOs, trade unions, youth groups, faith-based groups, and
       private foundations were combined in the “CSO? category. Few respondents from local
       government, independent government institutions, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the
       judiciary branch were included in the “Other? category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Area of Primary Specialization1




1
  Given the large number of respondents specializing in Finance & Markets (19%) and Education (15%) sectors,
cross-sectoral analyses were conducted to examine if respondents from these sectors dominated the overall
responses to the multiple choice questions about Chad’s development priorities and sectoral areas that can contribute
to poverty reduction in the country. For details, please see Appendix F.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
        Because of the small number of respondents from areas other than N’Djamena, these
         areas were combined into the “Other? category. Only significant geographic location
         differences in ratings on indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this
         report. All comparisons can be found in Appendix C (see page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
     Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
      with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Chad, the WBG’s relevance
      to Chad’s development, and the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in the
      country.

IV. General Issues Facing Chad
Headed in the Right Direction
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/
       Minister and employees of ministries/PMUs/consultants on WBG-supported projects
       were most positive about the prospect of Chad, whereas respondents from the private
       sector organizations/financial sector/private banks were least likely to indicate that the
       country is headed in the right direction.

IV. General Issues Facing Chad (continued)
Development Priority2
        Areas of specialization: Respondents who primarily specialized in “education? (15% of
         the sample) were significantly more likely than other respondents to indicate that
         “education? is Chad’s most important development priority. Respondents who primarily
         specialized in “finance & markets? (19% of the sample) were significantly more likely
         than others to indicate that “public sector governance/reform? is Chad’s most important
         development priority.

  When more than 10% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of sectors in question
H2 in Appendix I), analyses are done to examine these respondents’ views about the top development priorities in
the country.

What Would Contribute Most to Reducing Poverty3
        Areas of specialization: Respondents who primarily specialized in “finance & markets?
         (19% of the sample) were significantly more likely than other respondents to indicate that
         “rural development?, “anti-corruption?, and “economic growth? would contribute most
         to reducing poverty in Chad.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Chad, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the nineteen specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Chad. The
       areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Chad, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Chad or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Chad, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop
more effective strategies that support development in Chad.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, IFC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

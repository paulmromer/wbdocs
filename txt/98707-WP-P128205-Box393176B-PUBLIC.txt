This report examines the impact of social assistance programs on labor force participation in the Republic
of Georgia. In particular, it evaluates the ‘Targeted Social Assistance’ (TSA) program, which provides a
monthly subsidy to families below a welfare threshold.

Social assistance programs have a key role to play in protecting households from shocks, ensuring a
minimum level of subsistence and facilitating efficient labor market transitions. However, these programs
could also unintentionally reduce incentives to work, especially in the formal sector if the income effect is
sufficiently large, their design disproportionally taxes work and/or eligibility criteria explicitly or
implicitly make working (formally) less attractive. Few rigorous studies exist that establish the causal link
between social assistance and labor market outcomes in developing countries.

In the case of Georgia, applicant households are evaluated through a proxy means test to determine
eligibility for the TSA program. For this study, a newly designed survey of approximately 2000
households and administrative data were combined with a regression discontinuity design in order to
exploit the sharp discontinuities in treatment – defined as being a beneficiary of TSA – around the proxy
means score threshold.

Results suggest that the TSA program indeed generates work disincentives around the eligibility
threshold, with these disincentives concentrated among women. On average, women who receive TSA are
7 to 11 percentage points less likely to be economically active than women who live in households that do
not receive the transfer. This is a very large effect given that the labor participation rate among women in
the sample is 60.5 percent. Moreover, the analysis indicates that disincentives effects are larger for
younger women, and for women who are married and/or have children. Among men, there is no
statistically significant effect. These findings are supported by various robustness and falsification tests.

These findings have important policy implications. First, they highlight the importance of carefully
considering potential work disincentive effects of further increases in the generosity of the TSA program,
and the potential benefits of considering an expansion of coverage rather than an increase in generosity. A
comparable evaluation of the TSA program in 2007 found no work disincentive effects, but the program
then was only half as generous as it is today. Second, this report suggests that strengthening the provision
of complementary services, such as child and elderly care, can go a long way in reducing the TSA work
disincentive effects found among women, since the women that stop working (formally) are young, have
young children or are married. In addition, the evidence on potential and reservation wages suggests that
improving the access to training and upskilling of women in rural areas can be an important part of the
agenda for getting them into work outside of their homes. Finally, the report also points at the potential
benefits of combining the social assistance program with more stringent requirements to participate in job
search or activation programs, or to make receipt of benefits conditional on training requirements, for
either the children in the household, or in the form of life-long-learning, for inactive individuals of
working age. Furthermore, these results may be of value to other countries, if they have similar levels of
welfare and have adopted, or are planning to adopt, similar social assistance programs.

Since the transition, Georgia has had poor labor market outcomes, especially among women, youth
and older workers. One quarter of all households does not have a single employed individual.3 Only 55
percent of the adult population aged 15 and over is employed, a decrease from 59 percent in 2001.4 This is
substantially lower than in the best performing European countries. The low employment rate is primarily
driven by a high prevalence of unemployment, which stands at 14 percent. Labor force participation, at 64
percent of the adult population, is not exceptionally low overall, but this masks large inequalities between
various socio-economic groups.5 For example, inactivity is much higher among women than among men
(the difference in participation rates stands at 14 percentage points)6, and among youth, aged 15-24, as
compared to prime age workers. Almost one fifth (19 percent) of youth are not in employment, nor
enrolled in formal education or training, and about three quarters of these are out of the labor force.
Similarly, participation is lower among older workers (aged 55-64), and older women in particular often
exit the labor force early.

Those who do work often do so in low-productivity, low-paying jobs. For example, the agricultural
sector accounts for about half of total employment, and often does not offer a high or steady income year-
round.7 Especially among working women, the agricultural sector dominates – it accounts for 57 percent
of female employment.8 Moreover, 38 percent of working women and 20 percent of working men are
family workers, mostly unpaid, and 51 percent of working women (compared to 37 percent of working
men) work part-time rather than fulltime.9

Social assistance programs can help improve labor market engagement – through, for example,
improved household income and protection against shocks. However, such public programs can also
create disincentives to work – for instance, by introducing a loss of social assistance income as soon as
individuals start working. Hence, social assistance, though meant to support poor and vulnerable
households, could also have unintended adverse impacts.

This report examines the impact of a large social assistance program in Georgia, ‘Targeted Social
Assistance’ (TSA), on labor market outcomes. The TSA program provides a monthly subsidy to poor
families below a welfare threshold, identified through a proxy-means test. Although any household in
Georgia can apply for TSA, only those with low proxy-means test scores – representing low levels of
wealth – are granted benefits. The amount transferred to a family depends on the number of household
members, and consists of a base benefit (60 GEL currently; 30 GEL at the time of data collection) and a
top-up benefit per additional household member beyond the head of the household (48 GEL currently, 24
GEL at the time of data collection).

Studying Georgia’s TSA program is relevant for a number of reasons. First, the TSA program has a
good coverage of the poor when compared to other countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and is
well-targeted. Second, recent changes in generosity allow for insights into the links between generosity

and work disincentives, as the results obtained here can be compared with an evaluation conducted in
2007, when the TSA program was less generous than it is now. In this previous study, no disincentive
effects were found. Third, as mentioned above, Georgia is a country where labor market outcomes remain
poor, and where understanding the complex reasons behind low participation or high unemployment for
different sub-population groups is of utmost importance. Finally, the design of the TSA program makes it
amenable to quasi-experimental evaluation, an opportunity to generate rigorous evidence on the impacts
of social assistance on work incentives.

There is reason to believe that Georgia’s TSA program may be generating disincentives to work.
When asked whether a negative income shock would make one or more household members to start
looking for work, about half of all TSA recipients sampled for this study responds positively.10 Among
non-recipients that are close to the eligibility threshold, responses are similar at 49 percent. Among TSA
beneficiaries, 17 percent of households responding positively to this question state that one or more
women, but no men, in the household would start looking for jobs; 27 percent state that one or more men,
but no women, would start looking for jobs, and 56 percent of households state that both men and women
would look for jobs in this scenario (Figure 1). Even when asked directly whether at least one household
member would stop working if the household would start receiving TSA, 6 percent of TSA non-recipient
households responds positively.

This report uses of a regression discontinuity design, a new household survey and administrative
data to identify the causal effect of the TSA program on labor force participation in Georgia. Due to
its design features, the TSA program provides a unique opportunity to apply a regression discontinuity
analysis to measure the causal impact of social assistance on labor market outcomes by only focusing on
households of very similar socio-economic status.

  When asked: “Would currently jobless household members start working / try to find work if the household lost
20% of its monthly income?, 48 percent of TSA recipient households states that this would indeed be the case. 20
percent is the typical share that TSA benefits represent of household income in Georgia.

This report contributes not only to the existing literature, but also provides suggestions for future
policy-design related to the TSA program in Georgia. First, our findings contribute to the existing
literature in two main ways: (i) we investigate, in a rigorous manner, the causal link between social
assistance and labor force participation in the context of a developing country, where relatively little
rigorous evidence exists; and (ii) we disentangle some of the potential channels through which the effects
found may come about, by quantifying the impacts of the program among different demographic,
educational and socio-economic groups. Second, the findings presented here can inform future policy
design in Georgia regarding the TSA program and related labor market policies. Third, our findings are
relevant to countries similar to Georgia that are in the process of expanding their social assistance
programs, or of designing new programs.

This study shows that Georgia’s TSA program does generate disincentives to search for jobs or
work around the threshold of eligibility, with this effect being concentrated among women. On
average, the program reduces labor force participation by 7 to 11 percentage points among women. This is
a very large effect given that the participation rate among women in the sample is 60.5 percent. Among
men, there is no statistically significant effect. The disincentive effects are concentrated among a sub-
group of women who are relatively young (15-29) and women who are married and/or have children. We
hypothesize that difficulties in accessing formal or informal child care and the lack of other
complementary services, together with social norms, help explain these results. In addition, the evidence
on potential and reservation wages suggests that improving the access to training and upskilling of women
in rural areas can be an important part of the agenda for getting them into work outside of their homes. It
should be noted that these results are relevant for households that are concentrated around the eligibility
threshold for receiving the TSA benefit.

This report is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the existing literature and provides a more
detailed overview of the TSA program. Section 3 describes the sampling frame, the sampling method and

                             2.1 REVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE

Evidence from developing countries, although limited, suggests a negligible impact of social
assistance transfers on labor supply among working age individuals, both male and female,
associated with the fact that often, transfers in these countries are not very generous. For example,
an evaluation of the PROGRESA program in Mexico shows that, although there is a significant poverty
reduction effect, the program does not bring about significant disincentives to work for men or women
(Skoufias & Di Maro, 2008). This is confirmed by findings from a micro-simulation study that tests the
potential impact of cancelling the benefit as well as doubling its generosity (Freije et al., 2006). Adato &
Hoddinott (2008) discuss the case of South Africa, where cash transfers have in fact been found to
increase labor force participation, possibly because financial resources are needed for job search. In the
case of Bolsa Familia in Brazil, the existing evidence also suggests no disincentives to work.11 In Europe
and Central Asia, evidence from Armenia provides similar results (World Bank, 2011). Using a regression
discontinuity design, Armenia’s Family Benefit Program was found to have no effects on labor force

participation or work. For rural workers, a slight negative impact on hours worked was found. In fact, very
few studies have found a negative impact of social assistance on labor supply, mostly specifically on the
decision to work in the formal sector.12

Studies conducted in OECD countries, on the other hand, find that exceptionally generous
government transfers can generate disincentives to work.13 In particular, if the size of the benefits
starts to approach the level of market wages for low-paying jobs, there is an increased probability of
disincentive effects.14 The evidence from the United States, moreover, suggests that rather than cutting
back on the number of hours worked, social assistance beneficiaries may decide not to participate in the
labor force altogether when benefits are sufficiently generous.15

Georgia is an interesting case for analyzing work disincentives arising from social assistance. Less
than half of all working age individuals work formally or informally in Georgia: employment rates among
the working-age population are 49 percent among men (age group 15-64) and 42 percent among women
(age group 15-59).16 In addition, its TSA program is relatively large: it covers 12 percent of the Georgian
population and about two fifth of all individuals in the poorest quintile. 17 As of 2012, the average
beneficiary household received 78 GEL per month (US$47)18, or 26 percent of post-transfer household
consumption; this was 45 percent among the poorest quintile. As such, the program is relatively generous,
especially in comparison to the income of the poorest households, and may, therefore, give rise to
disincentives to participate in the labor market.

A previous study on the labor market effect of Georgia’s TSA program, using data from 2007, did
not reveal any disincentives to participate on the labor market.19 As part of the 2007 Living Standards
Measurement Survey in Georgia, an extra 2000 households were interviewed. These households were all
clustered around the proxy-means test (PMT) score that forms the threshold for receiving TSA benefits.
At the time, this threshold was set at 52000 points, on a scale with a total range of 0-200,000 measuring
household welfare.20 The sampled households had scores ranging from 50,700 to 53,000. After testing for
similarity in terms of basic demographic characteristics – such as age, gender and education level, a
regression discontinuity approach was used to determine that receiving TSA, at the time, did not lead to a
lower chance of being economically active. However, the analysis did not include models to test for
effects among men and women separately. In addition, separate models were tested for the effect on
employment – i.e. having worked in the reference week – and for “looking for work?, rather than testing
for labor force participation as a whole. As mentioned above, the generosity of the program has since
increased and the program has been expanded through an increase in the PMT threshold score that defines
eligibility (changes effective in 2009). As such, a causal analysis on the impact of TSA, with these new
design features, on labor supply decisions in Georgia is warranted. Moreover, the analysis presented in the
current paper includes not only evidence on labor market disincentives, but also on the most likely
channels through which these could come about.

           2.2 GEORGIA’S ‘TARGETED SOCIAL ASSISTANCE’ PROGRAM

                 2.2.1. AN OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL PROTECTION IN GEORGIA

Georgia has a wide range of social protection programs, encompassing the TSA, pensions, child and
foster care programs. In 2012, government expenditure earmarked for social protection amounted to
approximately 1.8 billion GEL. This is slightly below 7 percent of Georgia’s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), or close to 30 percent of overall government expenditure. The majority of this budget goes to non-
contributory pensions (4 percent of GDP, and over half of total spending earmarked for social protection),
whereas a much smaller share is allocated to social assistance programs (1.1 percent of GDP). In total, the
TSA program encompassed about 9 percent of Georgia’s social protection budget in 2012. Figure 2
presents an overview of budget allocation towards social protection in Georgia and other countries in the
region. Figure 3 breaks down Georgia’s social protection budget into the various programs administered.

Notes: Pensions for politically prosecuted individuals are paid out to those who are recognized to have suffered political
repression during Soviet rule. The ‘Benefit for refugees / Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)’ refers to a social transfer for those
that fled Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the early 1990s and in 2008 after the Russian invasion.


                                              2.2.2. THE TSA PROGRAM

The TSA program was launched in 2006, in an effort to provide financial assistance to the poorest
families of Georgia. Beneficiaries are identified through a proxy-means test that measures household
welfare through a large set of welfare indicators (Box 1). The program is administered by the Social
Services Agency (SSA), which maintains a live database containing key information on all applicant
households. This is referred to as the United Database for Socially Unprotected Families (UDSUF). The
SSA is part of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Affairs (MoHLSA). Applicants can register on a
continuous basis, and are recertified at least every 4 years21. Although any household in Georgia can apply
for TSA, only those with low proxy-means test scores – representing low levels of wealth – are granted
benefits (Figure 5). For TSA, the PMT threshold score is set at 57,000 points. Households scoring below
57,000 earn approximately 42 GEL per month per capita when adjusted for adult equivalent units.22 In
total, the UDSUF database contains scores ranging from 0-200,000. As of January 2013, 39 percent of the
Georgian population is registered in this database. 23 Households that receive TSA also receive state-
financed medical insurance coverage through a program called “Medical Insurance for the Poor? (MIP).
For MIP, the eligibility threshold is slightly higher than for TSA, meaning that more households qualify
for MIP than for TSA.




21
   In some cases, recertification occurs sooner: for example, if the household appeals the first evaluation of its PMT
score, if the address of the household changes, or if there is a change in household composition.

   The definition of ‘adult equivalence’ is identical to the definition used by the Georgian Department of Statistics, as
reported in UNICEF (2012).

                    BOX 1 : GEORGIA’S MEANS -TESTING METHODOLOGY


Eligibility for TSA is determined by a proxy means test (PMT) that is administered by the SSA to
any household that applies. The test is based on a complex scoring formula that yields a composite score
based on over 100 household welfare indicators that include economic, demographic, and regional
measures (Figure 4). The overall score also takes into account a subjective assessment of the hou sehold’s
welfare, conducted by a government representative.

The TSA could still expand in terms of coverage, but performs well in terms of targeting accuracy
and generosity. As of 2011, TSA covered 12 percent of the Georgian population (450,000 individuals),
and 38 percent of the poorest quintile (figure 6). While two thirds of the poorest Georgian households are
still not covered by the TSA program, the data on targeting accuracy shows that this is due to the program
size rather than to a lack of accuracy: close to two thirds of benefits accrue to households in the poorest
quintile, which is high in comparison to other countries in the region. At the same time, the TSA is a
relatively generous program: for each household, benefits in 2011 consisted of a core sum of 30 GEL per
month (US$18), complemented by a benefit of 24 GEL per month ($14 USD) per additional family
member. The average family received 78 GEL per month (US$ 47), which made up 26 percent of post-
transfer household consumption (45 percent among the poorest quintile). Average spending per individual
beneficiary was around GEL 29, compared to GEL 20 in 2008. In 2013, after data collection for this
study, benefits were doubled, to a core payment of 60 GEL per month and additional payments of 48 GEL
per family member (Table 1). Figure 7 shows how government spending on the programs has evolved in
recent years.

  2.2.3. EVALUATION OF TSA: SATISFACTION WITH PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
                             AND EFFECTIVENESS

Previous studies have identified possible causes for the TSA coverage gap among the poor.
According to a report published by UNICEF and USAID (2011), many of those in the poorest quintile
have heard of the UDSUF database, but still did not apply. Some of these individuals have negative
attitudes to the application system, and some are unaware of the procedures that must be followed.
Particular barriers faced by this group include lacking documention, language barriers, the distance from
the dwelling to the regional office, and a lack of permanent residence status. Three quarters of non-
applicants stated that they did not know how to apply for the database.



                                                                  16
Non-beneficiaries of TSA but who are close to the threshold of eligibility often evaluate the
application process for TSA to be unfair, whereas only very few beneficiaries of TSA say the same
(Figure 8). The most commonly cited reason for perceived unfairness is that the eligibility criteria are
thought to be an inadequate measure for who really needs assistance. The second most cited reason is that
officials do not adhere to the eligibility criteria. It should be noted that these results, though informative,
may be biased due to the subjective standpoint of applicant households who were not granted the TSA
benefit.

For beneficiary households, TSA is contributing to household welfare. 82 percent of households report
that their economic situation improved when they started receiving TSA (Figure 12). The two most
commonly cited reasons for improvement are that the TSA helps cover household expenses and that the
TSA provides stable and predictable source of income. At the same time, only 3 percent of recipient
households argue that the TSA provides “enough support? to cover basic expenses.

There does not seem to be a social stigma associated to receiving social assistance in Georgia.
According to data from the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS), people in Georgia mostly believe that
poverty is to be attributed to “injustice in society? or to “being unlucky? (59 percent of respondents),
whereas only a very small share links poverty to “laziness and lack of willpower? (less than 9 percent).
Indeed, data from 2009 suggest that among households receiving TSA, a substantial share of those who
could be expected to work actually did have jobs at the time: among the 55 percent of TSA recipients who
were of working age in 2009, approximately one third was working, and another quarter was looking for a
job. Approximately one sixth was not working because of family or household duties, or because they
were discouraged to enter the labor market. The remainder of working age individuals was inactive for
other reasons, including studies, illness, disability, and being a pensioner.24 Among TSA beneficiaries of
all age groups, those who were inactive because they were either discouraged or did not want to work,
only constituted about 5 percent of the total.

Results from the survey administered for this particular study generally confirm these findings
(Table 2). A vast majority agrees that social benefits are an effective tool to reduce poverty levels in
Georgia. By contrast, only about one third of non-TSA recipients agree that only those in need receive
benefits. Although more than half of all respondents acknowledge that social benefits lead to a more equal
society, over three quarters contend that in the case of Georgia, benefits are too small. Adverse effects of
social benefits, such as making people less willing to look after themselves and their family, and
permitting laziness and a lack of motivation to work, are only acknowledged by few.

                   3. SAMPLING FRAME, SAMPLING AND DATA

The main analysis uses a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to examine the causal impact of the TSA
program on labor force participation among households that are close to the eligibility threshold. This
section provides detailed information on the sampling method used and the data that was collected.


                              3.1 SAMPLING FRAME AND SAMPLING

A newly designed survey – henceforth referred to as “the Georgian Social Assistance and Health
Insurance (SAHI) Survey? was administered to a carefully selected random sample of 4006
households, concentrated around two score thresholds: one for TSA and one for the MIP program.
For the current study, a subsample of 2002 households, concentrated around the TSA threshold, was used.
The UDSUF database of the SSA as of August 2012, described in more detail in Section 2.2, was used as
the sampling frame. This database includes basic demographic information as well as the exact PMT score
received by each applicant household. The sample is representative of Georgian households registered in
the UDSUF database around the threshold score at the national, regional and urban/rural levels.

The sampling frame was restricted to only include households with scores deviating from the
threshold by a maximum of 3000 points.25 This means that the sampling frame covers households that,
as of August 2012, fell between 54,000 points and 60,000 points (57,000 points is the eligibility
threshold). If below the threshold, the household qualifies to receive TSA benefits. As of August 2012, 5.6
percent of all applicant households included in the UDSUF database had obtained a score within this
bandwidth.

Among this group, the selection of the final sampling frame was subject to certain conditions to
ensure comparability and data quality, leading to a further reduction in the number of included
households by 21.1 percent. First, those households that had not been re-scored by the SSA since 2010
were excluded, to ensure up-to-date information on households’ overall welfare status. Within the selected
score range, 13.5 percent of households were excluded from the sampling frame for this reason. Second,

  The overall score range runs from 0 to approximately 200,000. A bandwidth of 3000 points was chosen because,
on the one hand, it included enough households to draw a random sample with enough power to predict relatively
small effects accurately, and on the other hand, it represents a range of scores that is still narrow enough to only
include a relatively homogenous group of households. In order for the treatment and the control groups in the sample
to be proportional to the final sampling frame, the original score range of ± 3,000 points was slightly adjusted. The
adjusted score range includes scores 54,660-60,000. The bandwidth of 3000 was also that used in the earlier study of
TSA in Georgia.

                households that were included in the database on or after January 1st, 2012 were excluded from the
                sampling frame, to ensure that the registration process for all households in the sample had been
                completed at the time of data collection and to allow time for program impact. Among the selected score
                range, 8.8 percent of households were excluded from the sampling frame for this reason. Third, eligible
                households who did not receive benefits as of October 2012 – shortly before fieldwork – were excluded
                from the sampling frame, and households who were not eligible but did receive assistance were also
                excluded. This was done to ensure that only households with up-to-date administrative records were
                included in the sample. Among the selected score ranges, 4.2 percent of households were excluded from
                the sampling frame for this reason. Lastly, households were excluded if they were eligible for TSA at the
                time of data collection, but had a previous score that was higher than 80,000 points. This was done
                because such extreme reductions in scores could reflect erroneous records. Among the selected score
                ranges, 4.6 percent of households were excluded from the sampling frame for this reason. In the UDSUF
                database as of October 2012, therefore, 4.4 percent of the applicant households fell within the sampled
                score range and met these conditions. A distribution of this final sampling frame is shown in Figure 10.

                As can be seen in Figure 10, there is some “bunching? of households just below the TSA threshold in
                the sampling frame. In the early years of the program, scores were smoothly distributed. However, two
                recent changes have resulted in bunching below the threshold: first, since 2011, households were given the
                opportunity to appeal if their initial score did not fall below the 57,000 threshold. The households filing
                for appeal were rescored, and some of them did receive a new score below 57,000. In the final sample, we
                introduce extra robustness tests in our models to eliminate any remaining bias as a result of this appeal
                process. Second, in 2011, the SSA started to cross-reference its own database with other sources that
                contained information on the welfare of specific households. It was found that some households reported
                to possess more assets in these other databases. Hence, the PMT scores of these households were likely to
                be biased downwards, and they were taken out of the UDSUF database and disqualified from receiving
                benefits. This could explain a decrease in the number of households just to the right of the PMT score.
                Even without robustness tests, our results would remain valid because households do not have precise
                control over their PMT scores. Even if they can attempt to push their score down, they cannot ascertain
                that this will result in a score below the threshold. For a regression discontinuity design, the identifying
                assumption is that subjects do not have precise control over their scores. This requirement is met, as
                explained in Section 4.


                                                                                    20
The sampling design controls for observable as well as unobservable community-level
characteristics that may impact the results of interest. In particular, and following the sampling design
used in Bauhoff et al. (2010), 6-household clusters were selected within each stratum based on probability
proportional to size. The sample was pre-stratified for urban and rural areas. Clustering adds value to an
RDD design as it allows researchers to control for unobserved characteristics associated with households’
geographic location. In this study, clusters generally include a mixture of applicant- and non-applicant
households, so that observable and unmeasured community-level characteristics that may have an impact
on the investigated outcomes are controlled for. Proportions of beneficiary and non-beneficiary
households and total cluster size vary somewhat due to non-response. We sampled with replacement. The
results presented in this report are adjusted for this specific sampling design.

The final sample is comprised of 2,002 households and 6,575 individuals. This is 10 percent of the
final sampling frame. Table 3 provides a breakdown of the sample by treatment status.26 Annex 1 provides
an overview of the regional composition of the two sample groups, each broken down into their treatment
and control – “beneficiary? and “non-beneficiary? households. Interviews were conducted between mid-
December 2012 and mid-March 2013.

                                                  3.2 THE DATA

The response rate was 79 percent, equally distributed among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries.
Among the 2,002 households, 1,580 were part of the original sampling frame, whereas the remaining 422
households (21 percent) were chosen from a “reserve? sample that was constructed to replace households
in the original sampling frame which could not, or refused to, be interviewed. Reasons for non-response
were similar among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. In approximately half of all non-response cases,
nobody was at home or the dwelling was not found.27 Only 1 percent of the original sample (4.75 percent
of non-response cases) refused to participate in the survey.



26
   The chosen sample size was based on power calculations designed to identify, at the 5 percent level of
significance, a five percentage point effect on average labor force participation of the TSA program. This effect size
was determined based on the outcomes typically found in similar studies, as well as in previous work in Georgia
itself. The recommended sample size resulting from these power calculations was 1454 households around the TSA
cutoff. The actual sample was about 25% larger than this.
27
   Annex 2 presents an overview of reasons for non-response among these 21%. Apart from small variations in
regional composition and household size, there are no systematic differences between the non-response cases and the
rest of the sample. Differences in household size mainly reflect a higher non-response rate among single-individual
households. This is most likely the result of a higher statistical likelihood of missing a one-person household, as
compared to missing any member of a household consisting of several individuals. Indeed, household size is similar

                                                           21
Surveyed households were asked to provide information on a range of topics. The survey covers basic
demographic information (such as gender, age, ethnic background and marital status), information on
educational background, information on employment status, type of employment, wages earned, and
employment history, and information on household welfare, consumption and housing conditions. A short,
self-reported evaluation of the TSA program (among beneficiaries) and self-reported behavioral responses
to being granted TSA (among the control group) is also included. A sub-sample was asked to respond to a
number of questions on values and trust.

As expected, the TSA sample is more rural, poorer and less educated than the average Georgian
individual. Table 4 illustrates that even the demographic outlook of the sample differs from that of the
general population: there are less working age individuals in the TSA sample as compared to the
population average. Similarly, the sample is predominantly made up of rural residents, whereas in the
general population, a slight majority is urban. Education levels are also lower in our sample: in particular,
a much larger share of our sample has only completed primary education as compared to the general
population, and fewer individuals have completed tertiary education. Similarly, Table 5 illustrates that on
average, a household in the sample has only 59.5 percent the amount of income of an average Georgian
household, after adjusting for household size and composition, and without taking the TSA benefit into
account.

Not all sampled households in the treatment group have been receiving TSA for the same amount of
time, and some of the households in the control group did receive TSA benefits in the past. In the
models presented in Section 5, we control for the number of years during which the household has
received TSA (Figure 11). Moreover, to the extent that control subjects did receive benefits in the past,
estimates would be lower-bound ones since the control could also exhibit some program effects.

                                                   4. EMPIRICAL APPROACH

We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate the impact of TSA on labor force
participation.28 An RDD is uniquely suitable to examine these impacts in Georgia, because it allowa for a
comparison in outcomes between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries who are highly similar, apart from
the treatment condition. In doing so, a causal interpretation of results requires less stringent assumptions

28
   Labor force participation is defined as being either employed or actively looking for work. Employment is defined
as having worked, for at least one hour, during the last 7 days, paid or unpaid. Unemployment is defined as having
tried to find a job or start a business during the past 4 weeks at the time of the interview. Discouragement is defined
as having stopped looking for work, either because the subject believes that there are no jobs available for someone
with his or her qualifications, or because the subject does not know how to search for work.

                                                                       23
than other statistical methods. In the case of the TSA program in Georgia, treatment and control groups
can be identified by making use of the PMT scores assigned to applicant households to determine
eligibility for the program. As discussed earlier, the threshold score used to distinguish eligible and
ineligible households is 57,000. The control group consists of households with PMT scores just above
57,000 – i.e. households not receiving TSA.

Following Lee and Lemieux (2010), we estimate:
                                                                           x=n
                  Yi = β0 + β1TSAi + β2Scorei + β3Scorei^2 + Σ βiXi + ɛ            i                            (1)
                                                                          x=1

                                                                                            x=m
                  Yi = β0 + β1TSAi + β2Scorei + β3Scorei^2 + β4TSAi*ITni + Σ βiXi + ɛ                i          (2)
                                                                                            x=1



where Y reflects the outcome variable of interest (labor force participation status) for individual i, β0 is a
constant, TSA is a dummy variable indicating whether the individual pertains to a household that receives
TSA benefits (TSA=1 if so; zero otherwise), β1 is the estimated local average treatment effect, β2 and β3
measure the relationship between the score and the outcome29, and β4 measures the impact of various
interaction terms (ITn). X represents the x’th control variable (ranging from 1 - m)30, and ɛ i is the error
term. As explained below, certain respondents were not aware of their status regarding the receipt of
benefits or misreported their treatment status. We use administrative records to avoid any bias that may
result from “selective recall? (Bauhoff et al., 2010) or from confusion of the TSA program with other
benefits.

The structure of the data allows us to exploit a sharp jump in treatment at one specific threshold in
the PMT score. This jump is not accompanied by any other systemic differences that might affect
the outcome variable of interest. Although there is some degree of variance in welfare between the
treatment group and the control group, the only sharp jump in income comes from treatment. As
highlighted by Lee and Lemieux (2010), as long as subjects do not have precise control over their
assignment to either the treatment or the control group, an RDD allows for isolation of the treatment

The research design meets the key identifying assumptions of an RDD (see Lee and Lemieux, 2010).
First, the assignment variable – in this case, the PMT score – is continuous around the cutoff, and is
determined before treatment. As discussed in Section 2.2, the PMT score ranges from 0-200,000, with no
interruptions within this range. Second, the choice of the cutoff value in the assignment variable is not
driven by anything other than the treatment. There is no reason to believe that factors other than receipt of

29
   In addition to a linear and a quadratic relationship, higher-order polynomials were also tested. These were found
not to affect the results.
30
   As is discussed below, certain background characteristics, including gender, age, the household’s PMT score and
other socio-economic and educational characteristics were included as controls to account for variation within each
treatment status along these characteristics that matters for the outcome of interest. See Annex 6 for more details.
31
   The underlying assumption is that assignment of beneficiary status is properly enforced (Bauhoff et al., 2010). In
reality, there may be cases where expected beneficiaries are in fact not receiving the benefit. However, this seems to
be unlikely. Less than 1% of all sampled households could present a certificate with their score to the interviewer
that indicated a different recipient-status than was recorded in the UDSUF database. Results presented in Section 5
are not sensitive to excluding these households from the sample, nor to using their self-reported treatment status as
opposed to the administrative records.

                TSA would change abruptly at the cutoff score and thus, affect labor force participation. The formula on
                which eligibility for TSA is based has many variables, and, incidentally, labor force participation and
                employment are not direct components of the formula.

                Third, random assignment to treatment and control groups was tested by examining the statistical
                similarity of recipients and non-recipients, based on demographic and socio-economic outcomes (Annex
                3). Only very few characteristics are significantly different across the treatment and control group, and
                where differences exist, they remain negligible in size. The most important difference between the two
                groups is that beneficiaries are more likely to live in rural areas. This is to be expected, as income levels
                are generally lower in rural environments, which is picked up by the PMT scoring procedure.
                Correspondingly, households in the treatment group have, for example, slightly lower levels of education.
                In addition to these differences correlated to urban/rural status, TSA beneficiaries also have slightly fewer
                assets (as expected, given the PMT formula). In the models presented below, we control for these
                variables where appropriate. We also examine whether the TSA program had differential impacts on the
                outcome of interest depending on these variables. We also make separate estimations for rural and urban
                samples.

                Finally, subjects have only imprecise control over the assignment variable. As discussed in Section 2.2,
                the PMT formula used in Georgia is too complex to precisely manipulate, largely due to the fact that the
                number of welfare measures on which the score is based is very large. However, as shown in Figure 12,
                there is some bunching of households just below the eligibility threshold. As such, one could be concerned
                about the possibility of indirect manipulation. For example, households are able to appeal their initial
                score, and to be rescored upon appeal, with some possible bias towards getting included in the TSA
                program after rescoring.

                Households can get rescored for various reasons. All households in the UDSUF database, get rescored
                periodically. A regular re-evaluation of the household’s PMT score is done every 4 years, to examine
                whether an adjustment of the PMT score is necessary. In addition, rescoring can also occur for other
                reasons, including appeal of the initially assigned score. Households get rescored if there are substantial
                changes in living conditions, such as a change of address, a change in household composition, or a change
                in employment status. In addition, the SSA recently started allowing households to file for appeal if the
                household believed that the assigned PMT score did not accurately reflect actual levels of welfare.

                                                                              25
The opportunity to appeal one’s score seems to have introduced bunching. As explained in Section
3.1, the PMT score was characterized by a smooth distribution before the appeal process was introduced.
As such, there is a high likelihood that the bunching observed just below the TSA eligibility threshold is
related to the appeal process. However, in the data collected for this study, it is not possible to distinguish
between the various reasons for rescoring, and hence, households that got rescored because of appeal
cannot be isolated. As a proxy, we investigate two groups in particular: households that got rescored
within a very short timeframe, and households that jumped from the non-beneficiary group to the
beneficiary group after rescoring, in particular in cases where rescoring took place within a short period of
time. The first group is of interest because the SSA is obliged to rescore households that file for appeal
within a period of 2 months.

Households that get rescored within a period of 2 months (15 percent of the households included in
the TSA sample) differ from other households on certain observables.32 In particular, beneficiary
households that were rescored within two months have a larger average household size as compared to
other beneficiary households; they more often have young children and youth in the household; they have
more working age household members, and they have fewer pensioners. Non-beneficiary households that
were rescored within 2 months differ from the rest of the non-beneficiary households on the same
observables. In addition, they are more often found in urban environments, and contain more men. In both
the treatment and control groups, there is no difference between those rescored within two months and the
rest of the sample in terms of education levels. Lastly, households rescored within two months that are
currently in the treatment group are characterized by a lower average adult equivalent per capita income
than the remainder of the treatment group. This result is not found in the control group. It remains unclear
whether this is the result of a genuine negative income shock or of a conscious effort to under-report
income in the survey. In the results presented in Section 5, we control for these characteristics. However,
since the two groups could also differ on unobservables that matter for the outcomes examined here33, we
also control for this group of households as a whole. In addition, we test the sensitivity of our results to
exclusion of these households. This does not affect the results.

In the selected sample, 26 percent of households that were rescored changed from non-beneficiary
to beneficiary status – a share that is almost twice as high as the 14 percent who changed from
beneficiary to non-beneficiary status. If these changes in status simply reflected errors or changes in
family composition or income, one would expect these two numbers to be very similar. The observed
asymmetry could be an indication of manipulation, although it could also reflect the overall worsening of
economic conditions over the observed period (2006-2012) in Georgia, possibly associated with the global
economic crisis.34 Indeed, the share of rescored households that obtained a lower second score – by at
least 1000 points – (58 percent) is much higher than the share of rescored households that obtained a
higher second score by at least 1000 points (38 percent), regardless of what side of the eligibility threshold
the new score was on. Similarly to the first group, those who switch from being non-beneficiaries to
beneficiaries are different on some observables from others in the treatment group.35 In particular, these

33
   This would be the case, for example, if members of these households are particularly interested in receiving a
government transfer, and are hence more likely to “game? the system. This would generate bias if these
unobservables are correlated with their interest in working.
34
   This would correspond with evidence from the Welfare Measurement Survey, 2011, in which half of all
households surveyed state that their situation had worsened because of the crisis (UNICEF, 2012).

“switching? households are likely to be urban.36 In the results presented in Section 5, we control for these
characteristics. To eliminate any potential bias due to unobservables, we test the sensitivity of our results
to controlling for, and to excluding switchers. This does not affect the results.37

Very few households were rescored within 2 months in such a way that they switched from
beneficiary status to non-beneficiary status. Among those who were rescored within 2 months (13
percent of individuals, and 15 percent of households), less than one fifth (2 percent of the total TSA
sample) received a second score that was below the TSA threshold of 57,000 points.

A third issue of concern is a change in the PMT formula in mid-2010. The PMT formula used by the
SSA was changed in mid-2010 in order to let communities play a greater role in reviewing households’
eligibility, and to exclude certain assets which are difficult to measure or to translate into an indicator of
household welfare. However, as shown in Figure 13, we do not observe an increase in the share of
households switching from the control group into the treatment group after mid-2010. As such, it seems
that the change in PMT formula has not contributed to the observed bunching.

In short, we are confident that the research design meets the identifying assumptions of the RDD
strategy.



36
   In the control group, ‘switchers’ – i.e. households that used to be TSA beneficiaries before rescoring – have a
larger average household size, more working age individuals, a lower average age, and, similar to the treatment
group, a different regional composition.
37
   At the same time, it should be noted that, when not restricted by the time interval between subsequent scoring
events, a substantial share of the sample switches from control to treatment status. Especially in cases where this
time interval is large, such a switch may have nothing to do with appeal, but may very well reflect a genuine
deterioration of wealth in the Household. As such, we test different specifications, in some of which we add
restrictions based on the time interval between scoring events.

                                                              27
In terms of external validity, there are three main limitations. First, since the sampling frame only
includes households that have applied to the UDSUF database, households that did not apply but that
would have received similar scores are not represented. These households may be systematically different
from those included in the sampling frame. Second, the sampling strategy systematically excludes clusters
that do not have a mix of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Third, results identify average treatment
effects around the TSA eligibility threshold rather than for the total population that receives TSA benefits
(hence we estimate local average treatment effect). These caveats need to be kept in mind when
interpreting the findings of this study.

Next, we discuss the main results.


                                               5. MAIN RESULTS

Statistical analysis suggests that the TSA program generates work disincentives around the
threshold of eligibility, and that these disincentives are concentrated among women. As a first step in
analyzing the impact of TSA on labor force participation, we compare means on labor force participation
rates between beneficiary and non-beneficiary individuals (Figure 14). In households benefiting from
TSA, the female labor force participation rate is 59 percent compared to 62 percent among women in non-
beneficiary households. The difference in means is not significant for men. The number of working age
individuals among TSA beneficiaries – i.e. the treatment group, at 58 percent, is also significantly lower
than the number of working age individuals in the control group (61 percent).

Notes: Differences in participation between the treatment and control group are insignificant for the full sample and for men, and
are significant at the 10 percent level for women.

The regression discontinuity analysis confirms this finding. A participation disincentive effect is
found, and once again, this effect is concentrated among women (Figures 15 and 16. Annex 5 provides a
list of means of included covariates, and Annex 6 presents results for the main specifications.38 Similarly,
in models where only men are included, no effect is detected in any of the specifications tested. On the
other hand, in models where only women are included, a conditional effect of 7-11 percentage points is
found in most models. As such, the findings from this survey suggest that able-bodied, non-student
women who live in households that receive TSA are approximately 9 percentage points less likely to join
the labor force, as compared to women living in similar households, but which do not receive TSA.

  The models shown in Annex 6 are probit models. We also used linear probability models as a robustness check. In
these linear regression models, similar results were found. Results are available from the authors upon request.

Notes: Figures reflect the gender-separated equivalents of Model 2 in the basic models reported in Annex 6.

Various falsification tests confirm these findings. As a falsification test, identical regression
discontinuity models were tested for one score below the actual threshold, and one score above the actual
threshold. The score values chosen were 55830 and 58500. No significant differences were found between
subjects below and subjects above these two random scores, supporting the findings presented here.39

Results from labor force participation do reflect a fall in employment and hours worked, rather
than a fall in unemployment. There is a negative impact on employment, and we find a negative impact
on hours worked, conditional on working, among both men and women. Across specifications, TSA

 In addition, a model was tested where the per capita transfer amount received by the Household was added to the
model as an extra control variable. This did not change the results, and this additional control was not significant.

receipt reduces men’s work week by 3-5 hours, conditional on working; TSA receipt reduces women’s
work week by 5 hours, conditional on working.40

Among women, results suggest that the participation disincentive effect is particularly large in
younger age groups, and among those who are married and / or have children. Firstly, we find an
interaction effect between receiving TSA and age: the disincentive effect of receiving TSA seems to be
weakened significantly as individuals, and women in particular, get older. This may be related to the
household- and family related responsibilities that many younger women face. In order to examine this in
more detail, we test additional model specifications in which we split the female half of the sample based
on marital status, whether there are children in the household41, and whether women belong to the age-
group 15-29 or 30-59 (Table 6). Although results must be interpreted with caution due to the restricted
sample sizes, these models suggest that in addition to a concentration of disincentive effects among young
women, being married indeed strengthens rather than weakens disincentives. Similarly, living in a
household with children seems to strengthen disincentive effects.

A simple comparison of means indeed shows that the strongest difference in labor force
participation rates between the treatment- and control group is found when splitting up women of
working age into two age-groups: 15-29 and 30-59 (Figure 27). This result holds when students and
disabled individuals are excluded from the sample. Although there are also differences between treatment-
and control group when women are split by family status, these differences are not found to be statistically
significant. However, once again, these results should be interpreted with caution, due to limitations in
sample size.

Notes: Only the observed differences in participation rates between women in the treatment and control group in two categories
were found to be significant: 1) married women with older children (p=0.09) and 2) single, divorced or widowed women with
both young and older children (p=0.06).

Among women, there are differences in motivation to work between those receiving TSA and those
not receiving TSA. A sub-sample of male and female individuals was asked to respond to questions on
attitudes regarding work and family responsibilities. For example, a larger share of women in the
treatment group as compared to the control group report disagreement when asked whether they would
enjoy having a paid job, even if they do not need the money (Figure 18). Similarly, when women who are
currently out of the labor force are asked whether they would want to work if they could choose without
restrictions, many among the recipient households report that they would not want to work (28 percent of
respondents), whereas this is a much lower share in the control group (19 percent of respondents) (Figure
19).

Self-reported attitudes of men and women on the relation between family responsibilities, social
norms and work for women are consistent with these findings. As reported in Table 7, a large majority
of both men and women in our sample report that they believe that paid work for women harms the ability
of the household to raise the children. Similarly, many women, and a similar share of men, are of the
opinion that for a woman, being a housewife is not less fulfilling than having a paid job. Lastly, even
when asked whether men should have priority over women in accessing jobs, a majority of women agrees.
Here, an even larger majority of men expresses agreement. These findings provide important supporting
evidence for the hypothesis formulated above: that disincentives for women to join the labor force may be
related to social norms and family responsibilities.

Further analysis suggests that the disincentive effect on labor force participation among women is
concentrated among those who live in rural areas (Table 8). When the sample is split up by urban /
rural location of the residence, we find no statistically significant effect among women who live in urban
areas.

In addition to age, marital status, family responsibilities and location, low expected productivity
seems to shape labor market decisions. TSA beneficiaries who work earn very low wages. The median
wage of paid workers in the treatment group of our sample is 152 GEL per month, whereas this is 195
GEL per month for the control group.42 In Georgia as a whole, the median monthly wage amounts to 269
GEL.43 In addition, the profile of TSA beneficiaries included in this sample in terms of education level,
geographic location and access to productive assets suggests that the supply of jobs for this group may be
more limited than for individuals that do not qualify for receiving TSA. Yet, despite these differences in
potential earnings, reservation wages among TSA beneficiaries are not statistically different from those of
non-beneficiaries (Figure 20). Critically, reservation wages are significantly higher than the earnings of
beneficiaries actually working. As a result of these forces, inactive TSA recipients may be discouraged to
seek employment because of low anticipated wages, or may decide to stay at home and fulfill house and
childcare responsibilities based on the lower opportunity cost of staying at home. This evidence on
potential earnings and reservation wages suggests that improving the access to training and upskilling of
women in rural areas can be an important part of the agenda for getting them into work outside of their
homes.

employed individuals (P<0.05).

Finally, we find a positive and significant interaction effect between recipient-status and the number
of years during which the household has received TSA in the past. This effect is found in our
aggregate model, which includes both men and women and in our model that includes women only. No
such effect was found in a model including only men. This evidence would be inconsistent with benefit
dependency. On alternative hypothesis is that TSA allows households to build assets over time that could
be used for productive activities, increasing female labor force participation. Given the relevant debates on
benefit dependency, this is one important area for further research.

In short, the results above suggest that work disincentives are concentrated among women who are
young, with children or married, and living in rural areas. Together with the qualitative evidence also
gathered, it appears that the lack of complementary services for raising children, such as affordable
childcare, may be an important constraint to participation. In addition, the evidence on potential and
reservation wages suggests that improving the access to training and upskilling of women in rural areas
can be an important part of the agenda for getting them into work outside of their homes. More research
would be needed to thoroughly investigate what induces disincentives to participate in the labor force.


                                              6. CONCLUSION

The results presented here suggest that recent increases in generosity of Georgia’s TSA program ,
such as the increase in benefits for additional family members that occurred in 2009, may have
generated disincentives for women to enter the labor force. The findings from this paper apply
specifically to households around the eligibility threshold of the TSA. However, we have some reason to
think that the TSA more generally could be creating work disincentives. Although not causal evidence,
using a nationally representative survey (UNICEF’s Welfare Monitoring data survey for 2011), we find
that—controlling for basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics— a member of a household
which gets TSA is about 7 percentage points less likely to be working or looking for job compared to
individuals in households that receive no TSA. More research is needed to determine the exact causes of
any disincentive effects among women. However, results here suggest that, for example, disincentives
effects are larger for younger women, and for women who are married and/or have children.

This suggests that in large part, the disincentive effects found from the TSA program in Georgia are
mediated by the lack of appropriate mechanisms for supporting working women, especially when
they are married and/or have children. In such cases, it appears that the TSA program serves as a safety
net that allows these women to care for their children and homes. This is likely to be caused, at least in
part, by a lack of affordable formal childcare facilities, especially in rural areas: for every group of 100
children under the age of 3 in Georgia, there are less than 10 formal childcare spots available, and only 6
in every 100 are actually enrolled44. What could add to this is low expectations in terms of wages and/or
(types of) jobs available for these groups of women in particular, as outlined in Section 5 above.
Moreover, descriptive evidence from the SAHI survey and preliminary qualitative evidence suggests that
social norms may inhibit women to work as well: many individuals, including women, in Georgia seem to
view the rights and opportunities of men and women very differently when it comes to jobs and labor
force participation. Lastly, our findings suggest that the average TSA recipient is more likely to live in a
rural area and to have a relatively low education level. This may further limit the number of jobs on offer

for those who receive TSA. For women, if there are no jobs available locally, commuting to work may go
against the norms that are upheld by the community.

The current findings are relevant for Georgia and beyond. In Georgia, these results suggest, firstly, the
need to carefully re-evaluate the design features of the TSA program. One of these is the most recent
generosity-expansion of the program. Given the available evidence on poverty reduction effects, it could
be an option to focus more on coverage of the program and less on (further) expanding generosity. For
example, one option would be to introduce proxy-means testing for (part of) the currently universal
pension benefits, and to divert the thus freed resources to expanding coverage of the TSA program.
Certainly, there are to be trade-offs between expanding coverage and increasing generosity in terms of
overall welfare. However, since new beneficiaries are most likely richer than existing beneficiaries, one
would expect that a given amount of transfers would have smaller disincentive effects than increasing
further the transfer amount for a given group. This is particularly the case given, as is in Georgia, that
disincentive effects seem to arise from an income effect rather than a substitution effect, as suggested by
the lack of impact in the earlier impact evaluation of the TSA before the increase in generosity.

Strengthening the work incentives of social assistance programs is most likely to be successful if
accompanied by measures that assist people in finding work and reduce the costs of working. This
could include incentives to complete higher levels of education or job-specific training, but also for
example incentives for individuals to become more geographically mobile, so that they can move to
locations where jobs are available. Incentives on the side of employers can also help, as can policy
measures that counter normative systems that keep especially women out of work. Policies that facilitate,
or reduce the cost of, high-quality childcare, can go a long way. In addition to formal childcare services,
preschool, for children aged 3-5, and after-school activities for school-aged children could also help
women keep a job while taking care of their children. Yet, as the empirical evidence from these programs
indicate, early education has to be high-quality (Cascio 2015). Results also point to the potential role of
supplemental measures that more directly link benefit receipt with job search, take-up of active labor
market programs and education or training. Where appropriate, this could include an obligation to actively
look for work while receiving the TSA benefit. Balancing policy design with the institutional demands
necessary to successfully implement these policies is necessary. In cases where finding a job is unlikely,
education or training requirements, or participation in active labor market programs, could be used
instead. For women with young children, requirements need to be adapted depending on whether or not
there are childcare options at a sensible distance.

There are several open questions for which additional research would be useful. One area for future
research is to better understand the impact of TSA and other public transfers on private, informal transfers,
to measure the extent to which there is crowding out. If there is in fact crowding out, then public transfers
aimed at helping the poor will be less effective than initially thought and the gains from such programs
would actually be shared with better-off households who are the ones who usually give the transfers. In
other words, if there is crowding out, government transfers will have a limited distributional effect, in
addition to possibly having pervasive effects on the already existing informal risk-sharing arrangements.
In the context of Georgia, a next steps is to aim at measuring the impact of TSA in total household
income. Further research could focus on collecting larger samples of those groups of women that were
found here to be most likely to face disincentives to work as a result of the TSA program. This would
allow for a more granular understanding of the drivers of potential work disincentives. Moreover, the
research agenda could further focus on better understanding how different modalities linking social
assistance with productive employment and search impact labor force participation decisions.

Notes: *** p<.01, ** p<.05, * p<.1 A Additional household-level covariates for which the difference in means was analyzed
include: regions, household composition in terms of age groups (no. of youth aged 15-24, no. of prime aged workers aged 25-49,
no. of older workers aged 50-64, and no. of children aged 0-18). For all of these additional indicators, results were either not
significant, or if they were, the difference in means was very small. In particular, in the regions of Mtskheta-Mtianeti and Racha-
Leckhumi, qvemo Svneti, the treatment group represented a significantly larger share of the sample than the control group,
whereas in Tbilisi, the opposite was the case. B A positive number in these columns indicates that the non-recipient group (the
control group) has a higher average than the recipient group (the treatment group). A negative number indicates the reverse. C The
‘Radio and TV Goods’ index includes: Radio set, Satellite Antenna, TV set: flatscreen, TV set: non-flatscreen (Range: 0-4). D The
‘Housing Assets’ index includes: Air Conditioner, Dishwasher, Gas stove / Electric stove, Heater, Oven, Refrigerator, Vacuum
cleaner, Washing machine (Range: 0-8, converted to 0-100). E The ‘Luxury Goods’ index includes: A second dwelling, Camera,

Notes: *** p<.01, ** p<.05, * p<.1 A A positive number in these columns indicates that the non-recipient group (the control
group) has a higher average than the recipient group (the treatment group). A negative number indicates the reverse. B Sample
restricted to subjects aged 16-65, and not enrolled in grades 1-9. C Education levels were split up as follows: None or Incomplete
Primary, Primary, Secondary (incl. basic/vocational), Tertiary. D Sample restricted to subjects aged 15-64. E ‘Working Age’ refers
to individuals aged 15-64. ‘Working Age (Georgian)’ refers to men aged 15-64 and women aged 15-59. F Additional covariates
for which the difference in means was analyzed include: 5-year age cohorts, and (among those of working age who are without
jobs) the month and year in which the respondent had last worked. For all of these additional indicators, results were either not
significant (which was the case in the MIP sample), or if they were, the difference in means was very small. In particular, the TSA
treatment group had a slightly higher share of individuals aged 70-74, as well as a slightly higher share of individuals aged 80-84
(both had a one percentage point difference). Short-term joblessness (having last worked 1-2 years ago) was slightly less prevalent
in the TSA treatment group as compared to the TSA control group (3 percent vs. 6 percent of jobless subjects in the control
group).

Notes: A Households were only categorized as ‘rescored within 2 months’ if their original score was not below the TSA cut -off
score of 57000. B Labor intensity in the household was defined as the number of working household members, excluding the
subject being analyzed, divided by the total household size. C 2.15 percent of all sampled households reported a TSA income that
was higher than the reported overall household income. Hence, there are a number of overall income values in this variable which
fall below zero. D ‘Pensioners’ are defined as individuals aged 65 and over for men, and aged 60 and over for women, reflecting
the official retirement ages in Georgia.

Notes for basic models:
A
  Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. B In model 3, 2/3 of the total score range was used
(55440-59000). In model (4), ½ of the total score range was used (55830-58500). C 2.15 percent of all sampled households
reported a TSA income that was higher than the reported overall household income. For these households, income was set to zero.
D
  Reference categories: Education level: None / incomplete primary; Family type: Unmarried, no children. E Additional control
variables include: the number of years during which the household has received TSA benefits in the past, the number of other
individuals in the household that are employed as a share of total household size, regional fixed effects, whether the individual
belongs to an ethnic minority, whether there are pensioners in the household, and interviewer fixed effects.

Notes for interaction models:
A
  Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. B In all models, students and individuals with a disability
were excluded from the analysis. C Income refers to per capita, non-wage income. 2.15 percent of all sampled households reported
a TSA income that was higher than the reported overall household income. For these households, income was set to zero. D

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Gabon perceive the Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Gabon regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Gabon;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Gabon;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Gabon;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Gabon.

II. Methodology
In January 2014, 250 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Gabon were invited to provide
their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 222 stakeholders participated in the survey (89% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via email and returned it accordingly. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Gabon; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG); the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Gabon; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing
in Gabon.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Gabon: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Gabon is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Gabon, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved
   in Gabon.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Gabon, WBG staff preparedness
   to help Gabon solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Gabon, with which stakeholder
   groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus
   most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what reasons respondents
   attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Gabon, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Gabon’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty one development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Gabon: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Gabon, and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement that they use
   more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Gabon, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 116 respondents (73% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2011 and 181 respondents (60% response rate) who completed the survey in FY 2005.
Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the office of the President, Prime Minister were
        combined with respondents from the office of a minister; a small number of respondents
        from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral agencies; respondents
        from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
        organizations; and the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, PMUs,
        consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, and the judiciary
        branch were included in the “Other? category. Note that respondents from NGOs,
        community based organizations, trade unions, and faith-based groups were combined
        under the “CSO? category.

       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings of the
        WBG’s effectiveness across nearly all of these thirty-one development areas, except
        global/regional integration, social protection, and disaster management. For the most part,
        employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, respondents
        from bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the media tended to give the highest ratings for
        the WBG’s effectiveness, whereas respondents from private foundations and academia/
        research institutes/think tanks tended to give significantly lower ratings.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (page 74).

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Gabon, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Gabon. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Gabon, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Gabon
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had statistically similar levels of agreement
        regarding all of these statements compared to respondents in the FY ’11 and FY ’05
        country surveys.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement across
        all of these areas of the WBG’s work. For the most part, respondents from bilateral/
        multilateral agencies and the media tended to have the highest levels of agreement,
        whereas respondents from private foundations and academia/research institutes/think
        tanks tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.

        disburses funds promptly compared to respondents from the FY ’11 and FY ‘05 country
        surveys.
       In addition, respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of
        agreement that the WBG increases Gabon’s institutional capacity and that the WBG’s
        conditions on its lending are reasonable compared to respondents from the FY ’05
        country survey.
       Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies had the highest levels of agreement with
        the indicator questions, whereas respondents from private foundations had significantly
        lower levels of agreement.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower ratings for the
        following qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner: straightforwardness
        and honesty (compared to respondents from the FY ’11 and FY ‘05 country surveys) and
        flexibility in terms of changing country circumstances (compared to respondents from the
        FY ’05 country survey).
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across many of these
        qualities (all indicator questions). For the most part, respondents from bilateral/
        multilateral agencies tended to give the highest ratings, whereas respondents from private
        foundations tended to give significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details).

        tanks, and independent government institutions tended to indicate that the WBG should
        reach out more to groups outside of the Government, employees of ministries/ministerial
        departments/implementation agencies, local governments, the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks, and the media tended to indicate that the WBG should provide more
        adequate data/knowledge/statistics/figures on Gabon’s economy, and respondents from

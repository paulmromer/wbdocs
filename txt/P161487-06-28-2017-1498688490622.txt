Executive Summary
This report represents a high-level diagnostic of the capital market in Argentina, its potential for
corporate, SME and infrastructure financing, and proposed actions to unlock such potential, as
well as the respective roles of financial authorities and market participants. A detailed assessment of
the government bond market was outside of the scope of the report. However its importance to support
the development of the corporate bond market should be highlighted.

Addressing the macroeconomic situation and developing a robust investor base are the key long
term challenges for Argentina to develop a resilient capital markets that could be a source of
funding for strategic sectors, from corporates to infrastructure and SME financing. On the former,
the authorities will need to continue implementing measures to bring down inflation to acceptable levels.
In this context, it is key that the use of LEBACs to mop-up liquidity be temporary. Furthermore,
consideration should be given to the use of alternative monetary mechanisms that could minimize
negative effects on capital market instruments.

In addition, a thorough review of the overall tax framework for financial instruments is
recommended. Such a review could lead to tax removals in some segments and potentially higher taxes
in others; thus while elimination of the credit-debit tax may not be feasible; consideration should be given
to applying it in a revenue neutral way that levels the playing field for capital market participants and
potential new instruments, given the substantive distortions that it creates currently for the financial sector
and its effects on the real economy. On the demand side, actions are needed to develop a robust
institutional investor base to anchor the market. In particular, consideration should be given to the
creation of a long term savings schemes, via a 401K and/or incentives for life insurance. In addition, the
development of credit enhancements and other type of risk sharing mechanisms to foster investors’
participation in strategic sectors is also needed. All this will require coordination among the financial
authorities. Furthermore it is acknowledged that many of these measures might require time for their
implementation.

In the meantime, there are a few actions that the authorities could take that could deliver “quick
wins?. On the demand side: (i) the FGS could be given a more active role as an anchor investor in the
market through the reform of its investment regime, (ii) a series of reforms could be implemented to ease
access and reduce entry barriers for foreign investors to the market, and (iii) ensure that there are suitable
vehicles available for retail investors if “repatriated? assets are brought back. On the supply side: the
authorities could consider (i) making available a space for private offers, (ii) reviewing the regime for
mutual funds to ensure the existence of different types of vehicles for retail participation and long term
investment in the market; and (iii) reviewing the procedures for the authorization of public offerings with
a view to make additional improvements to it.




                                                                                                        Page 6
Overall, as macroeconomic conditions improve and the actions identified above are implemented,
the markets for corporate funding (equity and debt) should expand. There are currently few
significant regulatory or infrastructure obstacles for the issuance of corporate equity and debt. The key
obstacle is the limited ability of the domestic investor base to absorb large issuances. As well, a
comprehensive review of the corporate governance framework is recommended on the equity side.
Measures to enhance liquidity for both equity and debt instruments should also be part of a long term
strategy for corporate financing. It would be beneficial for the MoF and CNV to consult the domestic and
international investor community to find what instrument risks and protections are of priority from a
risk/return and regulatory perspective.

The small and medium enterprise (SME) financing market, in contrast, requires significant
changes. To a large extent, the current system works due to legacy legislation that directs insurance
companies to invest in SME instruments via MFs; thus the yield of such investments, while positive in
nominal terms, is below market rates (i.e. provides an implicit subsidy for SMEs). In the long run, as
inflation and interest rates decrease, an SME asset class that can be sold on market based terms needs to
be developed. The Mercado Argentino de Valores (MAV) could have a key role in defining a strategy for
the development of the SME asset class, based on an assessment of different instruments and their
potential for SME financing including instruments linked to factoring, private offers and alternative
markets. The authorities are encouraged to conduct a holistic review of SME access to finance. This
would include the causes of the level of informality, and the impact of current guarantee schemes with a
view to maximizing their potential for purposes of developing capital market instruments with underlying
SME assets or debt.

Structural issues would need to be addressed for the capital markets to play a role in infrastructure
financing. On the public private partnerships (PPP) side, the government needs to work on the
implementation of the new PPP law, the development of the accompanying regulations, and appropriate
standards for the PPP Units, along with the identification of a pipeline of bankable projects. On the
financing side, where infrastructure projects have USD earnings, a dollar market (onshore and offshore) is
likely to develop. However, financing for peso earning projects is an open question. Solutions to address
currency risk do not seem available in the short term due to the high levels of inflation and interest rates.
In the medium term the development of inflation linked instruments might be an option – but this is not
without risks and needs a calibrated application once interest rates have been brought down.

There are other structural issues that could affect the long term development of the capital
markets: ensuring that the Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV) becomes a credible and effective
supervisor should be a key objective, particularly as the market grows in size and complexity. Steps
have already been taken in this direction, with the appointment of a new board, which has embarked on a
wholesale review of the organization. In addition to changes in the authorization regime highlighted
earlier, there is a need to continue working on (i) improving supervision, through the implementation of
risk-based supervision at the micro level and the development of a process for the identification of risks at
the market wide level, and (ii) developing and implementing a credible and effective enforcement
strategy. In the meantime, the framework for independence and accountability will need to be
strengthened. It is important that the CNV adequately communicates to the market the changes that it is
implementing.


                                                                                                      Page 7
In addition, the CNV has strategic decisions to make concerning competition in financial market
infrastructure. Initially, the move of the existing exchanges towards a consolidated model but under a
principle of specialization, seems a rational approach that could deliver positive outcomes to the country,
provided that contestability remains. Such contestability would be tested by the expansion of the Mercado
Abierto Electrónico (MAE) into other types of markets and products. It is critical that a credible futures
markets be developed (either by Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos – BIMA, or MAE). On clearing and
settlement services, given the size of the market, a collective industry solution might be desirable,
whereby both the central securities depository (CSD) and a potential central clearing counterparty (CCP)
would be structured as “public utilities? to service different trading venues. In any event, the authorities
are encouraged to conduct a process of consultation with the market about the degree of competition in
market infrastructure and the potential effects of different business models on market efficiency, integrity
and reliability.

Strategic decisions are also required in connection with securities intermediaries; where a review of
the licensing regime is warranted. Overall some level of consolidation might be desirable, but under a
regulatory framework that ensures sufficient flexibility to accommodate different types of intermediaries,
from dealers to introducing brokers, placement agents, and advisers. The latter three categories would be
particularly important to ensure further penetration of capital market instruments to the retail population
across the country. In this context, an integrated licensing regime that follows a “cascade? system based
on the definition of regulated activities seems suitable. An intermediary could apply for a license
encompassing all, or just some, activities - provided that it complies with the capital requirement for the
“riskiest? activity along with any qualification requirement applicable to the activities for which
authorization is being requested. A process of consultation with capital market private intermediaries
should also be conducted to ensure proper calibration of the licensing regime.

Introduction
This report represents a high-level diagnostic of the capital market in Argentina, its potential for
corporate, SME and infrastructure financing, and proposed actions to unlock such potential. An
assessment of the government bond markets was outside of the scope of the report. However its
importance to support the development of the corporate bond market should be highlighted.

The report’s findings are based on discussions and information from key representatives of the
public sector and a cross section of market participants and other stakeholders. These included
representatives from the Ministerio de Finanzas (MoF), the Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), the
Central Bank (CB), and the Unidad de Información Financiera (UIF). It also met with representatives
from the Mercado de Valores de Buenos Aires (MERVAL), the Mercado Argentino de Valores (MAV)
the Mercado Abierto Electrónico (MAE), a sample of brokerage houses, banks and fiduciary entities, the
Fondo de Garantía de Sustentabilidad (FGS - ANSES), an insurance company, a credit rating agency, a
sample of law firms, and a tax firm.

The report is organized as follows:

       Part One provides a description of the state of development of the market, in particular the supply
        and demand side.
       Part Two provides an assessment of critical factors that have an impact on capital market
        development along with recommendations to address them.

Part I. The State of Development of the
Capital Markets
Argentina’s private capital markets are small compared to peers. Market capitalization stood at
about 11 percent of GDP compared to between 35 to 39 percent for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico and 90
percent for Chile by 2015. The chart below also shows prior historical period data for comparator
countries.

                         Table 2. Stock Market Capitalization as percent of GDP




Private bond markets exhibit relatively higher level of development; however only short-term
financing is available mainly as a result of high inflation and interest rates. As well, in terms of
comparator economies, the bond market remains below potential and levels achieved a decade ago.

On the demand side, the institutional investor base is small: the FGS a state fund created as a result
of the nationalization of the private pension system is the main institutional investor with assets

under management of US$50 billion. Assets in mutual funds (MFs) and the insurance industry
represent roughly 3 percent of GDP each. Direct retail investment is very limited, and foreign investment
participation is almost non-existent.

The market has been served by regional exchanges, currently under a process of consolidation, and
an over the counter electronic market for debt securities organized by the banks. The number of
securities intermediaries has significantly increased since the demutualization of the exchanges and
currently stands at about 346. The legal framework for the securities markets is robust, though specific
issues need to be addressed. All these issues will be further detailed below.

Section I. The Supply Side

The markets for corporate financing

The corporate bond and equity markets remain small at around 13 percent of GDP currently.
Corporate bonds are currently the most frequently used instrument, with USD 4.4 billion of
issuance in 2015. Fixed income instrument maturities go up to three years but most are very short term.
The government bond market has been limited and to-date focused on short and medium term dollar
based instruments given the high peso rates. The larger, better quality companies typically tap
international debt markets. This is driven predominantly by high inflation and Peso interest rates, and the
local investor base not being large enough to absorb the funding and capital raising requirements of large
corporates. Medium size companies get funding from the banking sector, but this funding is also short
term.

As of end 2015, there were 207 companies with debt issuances in the market, for an outstanding
amount of USD 30.6 billion. Out of these 155 were non-financial companies (with USD 14 billion in
outstanding issues), while 52 were banks (with USD 2.9 billion in outstanding issues). The remaining
issuances of USD 16 billion are considered as SME issuances. Issuances are in pesos or dollars,
depending on investor demand and the company’s activity. Issuances in pesos are refere nced to Badlar,
which is a benchmark rate constructed to reflect banks’ wholesale funding rates, although currently it
does not seem to be reflective of average bank funding rates as it excludes a significant retail component
as well as short term funding (including current accounts) under 30 days. Overall the level of leverage in
the corporate sector stands at reasonable levels, with corporates’ gross debt to equity ratio at 40 percent.
Interest payments are estimated to be around 35 percent.

Debt issuances via trusts and securitizations have been used by a small group of corporates, and the
framework is tested and trusted. Securitization issues amounted to USD 2.3 billion as of December
2015. They have mainly been used by a few corporates (mostly retail stores) and banks to finance
consumer credit. Thus, most of them are backed by receivables and consumer loans. Most issuances have
been short term and dollar denominated.

Private bond markets are highly illiquid. In fact the bulk of trading volumes correspond to the trading
of government paper (see Table 2 below).




                                                                                                    Page 13

As of end 2015, there were 101 listed companies on the equity market. The market is relatively
diversified, however, with the majority of companies being non-financial, which differs from the
situation in most other emerging markets. Of the 101 companies listed, 89 are non-financial companies
(with a USD 61 billion market capitalization for domestic companies), and the remaining 12 are banks
(with USD 17 billion equivalent of market capitalization for domestic companies). Total market
capitalization of listed domestic companies at the end of 2015 was USD 60 billion, which amounts to 11
percent of GDP. Free float remains low (at about 24 percent for non-financial companies and 7 percent
for banks). Large companies have raised equity capital mainly on overseas markets using ADRs, rather
than issuing domestically, and the bulk of issuances are dual listings (about 80 percent). A small tranche
is listed domestically, while the larger tranche is listed in the USA.

This has concentrated liquidity in the foreign markets. As of end 2015, the equity market turnover
ratio was 4.8 percent.

The markets for SME financing
Bank financing has been the major source of external financing for SMEs. Although an overall
assessment of SME financing was not conducted; however as per discussions held, it is understood that




                                                                                                                                       Page 14
the majority of the external financing to SMEs takes place via bank credit.1 Further it is understood that
CB regulations require banks to allocate a specified percentage of their deposits to providing loans to
SMEs at a specified rate, currently at 22 percent (known as “línea productiva?). However, the penetration
of banking credit is low compared to the number of SMEs, which is estimated at about 600,000.

Capital markets play a role in SME financing, mainly as a result of a compulsory investment
regime for insurance companies as they are currently required by law to invest 3 percent of assets
under management (AUM) in SME assets via MFs –commonly known as “inciso k? in the law. In
practice this financing has been done via the issuance of non-traditional short term instruments by the
SMEs (post-dated checks or promissory notes which have performed a role similar to factoring); and
occasionally market instruments or “obligaciones negociables? that are issued up to 3 years in pesos.
These instruments are in turn bought by the MFs, usually at yields below market rates given the need for
insurance companies to meet the required investment allocation, and a shortage of these instruments. For
2014, financing via inciso k amounted to USD 690 million, and as of October 2015 to USD 753 million.

The sociedades de garantía recíproca (SGRs) play an important role in SME financing, by providing
full credit guarantees to both banking and capital market products. SGRs are credit guarantee
entities regulated by the Secretaría de PYMEs (SEPYME) and by the CB, the latter if they wish to be
granted the “status? of garantía preferida A.3 There are currently about 30 SGRs, and only seven with
garantía preferida A status, with Garantizar SGR having 60 percent market share.4 Shareholding

from bank financing, 3 percent from suppliers and 4 percent from capital markets. Source: Inversiones y acceso al

  CDP refers to “cheques de pago diferido?; ON to? obligaciones negociables?; VCP to “valores de corto plazo? and
FFs to “fideicomisos financieros?.
3
  As per CB regulations banks only need to provision one percent for loans with a preferred guarantee A (garantía
preferida A). In addition they are not required to conduct their own diligence of the loans. Market participants
indicated that many banks opt for a streamlined credit analysis.
4
  Garantizar’s commission schedule is similar to a hedge fund: it charges banks a 2.5 percent fee to invest in the
fund and a success fee of an average of 15 percent.




                                                                                                         Page 15
structure varies, from Garantizar which has a mixed ownership of SMEs and banks to other SGRs which
are closely linked to a specific leading industry (mainly agribusiness). Irrespective of shareholding
structure, there are incentives for banks to provide funding to SGRs.5 Pursuant to CB regulations SGRs
must keep a ratio of funding to loans of 4 to 1. Guarantees can be given to a variety of instruments from
loans to post-dated checks and even SME bond issuances. In the case of Garantizar, the allocation of
guarantees is as follows: 80 percent for bank loans, 13 percent for post-dated checks and the remainder
for commercial guarantees. As per current regulations, all credit guarantees must be backed with
collateral, which can range from a personal promissory note to real estate depending on the amount to be
guaranteed.

The markets for infrastructure financing
There has been limited financing of infrastructure via capital markets. There are a few infrastructure
related companies listed on the equity markets. In addition, a few companies, mainly from the energy
sector have issued corporate bonds. In general such issuances have been short term (up to 3 years) and in
dollars. Overall yields of issuances have historically been below market rates, due to the existence of a
compulsory investment regime that required insurance companies to invest in infrastructure assets via
MFs that specialize in infrastructure firms (similar to the regime in existence for SMEs). However, with
the recent removal of this mandatory allocation, infrastructure investments by insurance companies
ceased and infrastructure investments now need to compete for yield on market terms.

The markets for housing financing
The market for housing financing is almost non-existent. Long term mortgage loans have not
developed, primarily due to the high interest rate environment and lack of reliable inflation data. Thus the
mortgage bond market has not developed. Some mortgage certificates have been used to securitize
portfolios but not as long term assets. The current creation of an inflation index to be used by the
mortgage sector may spur a longer term market, however this is likely only after inflation declines. Long
term finance is set to be expanded as the agency for housing, PROCREAR, is planning on financing
25,000 housing units in a first phase. While some of this financing will be subsidized, a significant
portion will require the use of market priced bank loans.

Risk markets

Risk markets are underdeveloped. Currency forwards and futures are mainly short term due to the high
cost of longer term contracts given wide inflation and interest rate differentials (e.g. between peso and
dollar). Recent transactions on the currency futures market ROFEX, on which the CB under the previous
government was primarily on one side, along with the potential liabilities arising from pending suits
resulting from these transactions, have badly damaged the credibility and reputation of the exchange. For
equity derivatives, single stock equity contracts exist, however as there is no operational securities
lending and borrowing market, and short selling is not permitted, they are one way, i.e. hedging products
are not offered. Commodities futures are listed over agricultural commodities such as grains.

    Funding provided to a SGR is 100 percent deductible from banks’ income tax.

Section II. The Demand Side

Argentina lacks a sufficiently domestic institutional investor base, which significantly impacts
capital raising activities and the liquidity of the domestic market. Overall the number of accounts
across the various exchanges has reduced significantly over the last decade from 600,000 to 200,000.

The most important institutional investor is the Fondo de Garantía de Sustentabilidad (FGS), a part
of the social security agency ANSES, which is a state fund of approximately USD 50 billion. This
fund was created as a result of the 2008 nationalization of the private pension funds. The investment
regime allows ANSES to invest up to 100 percent of the FGS portfolio in assets with real guarantees, up
to 50 percent in government securities, and up to 20 percent in infrastructure. The FGS portfolio is
currently invested as follows: 12 percent equity (of which 80 percent is in 9 equities in which FGS has a
significant stake), 68 percent public sector bonds, 10 percent infrastructure projects, and a small portion in
local MFs (equity and debt). ANSES currently faces a number of restrictions with respect to market
activity, the most significant of which is a prohibition on share and corporate bond trading (FGS cannot
sell equity, including for the purpose of rebalancing their portfolio).

Insurance companies are small, with assets under management of approximately 3 percent of GDP
across all insurance activities, of which life and annuity activity is at an incipient stage at 0.7
percent of GDP. Insurance companies invest in both domestic USD and Peso denominated instruments
in order to match the denomination of their product offering. Insurance companies have in the recent past
faced a regime of directed investment. Previously they were required to invest 15 percent of assets in
infrastructure or SMEs, but in January, 2016 this was changed and they now have a requirement to direct
3 percent of AUM to SME investments that meet specific requirements. Directed lending is creating
distortions in the yields of SME instruments that cause them periodically to be substantially below market
rates, specifically in MF products that meet the directed lending criteria.

MFs are small, at roughly 3 percent of GDP. As of December 2015 there were 345 MFs. All except
one were open-ended funds. MFs are typically short term, and predominantly invested in instruments that
meet the criteria for insurance company investment, due to legislation that requires insurance companies
to invest through MFs, and also because MFs funds are exempt from the credit-debit tax. The majority of
MFs are fixed income funds (60-70 percent of the MF industry, both money market and transactional
funds).

Retail investors do not invest in the stock or non-government bond markets, either as long-term
investors in securities, or as active traders. There is some retail participation in MFs, although this is
not significant. Retail investors prefer USD denominated investments due to inflation and confidence
concerns. There seem to be sizeable holdings of retail assets in two categories, neither of which are in the
formal domestic financial sector, and do not benefit the development of local capital markets: (i) there is
an estimated USD 1-3 billion in safety deposit boxes with domestic banks, and (ii) between USD 3-5
billion in holdings and investments abroad. There is potential for the growth of the domestic retail
investor base through repatriation of foreign assets. There is also a significant level of retail participation
in Peso denominated LEBACs, (CB issued short term paper) as these instruments provide returns close to




                                                                                                      Page 17
that of inflation. Investors participate in LEBACs through online banking platforms. This is currently
crowding out investments in other instruments.

Foreign investors are noticeably missing from the domestic capital markets for a number of
reasons, the key being ongoing concerns about the macroeconomic situation and an uncertain
policy environment. This applies to equity as well as fixed income, and also non-listed direct
investment. However, there are a large number of procedural and regulatory barriers that will continue to
be a deterrent for foreign investors, even were the macroeconomic and policy environment to improve.
Such barriers include onerous account opening, know your client (KYC), and tax registration procedures
and requirements. An example is that if a foreigner wants to open an account in a local bank, it needs a
local representative to sign the account opening papers, and cannot do so remotely. However, it is
understood that KYC requirements are currently being reviewed with the objective of rationalizing them;
including by allowing reliance on the due diligence performed by foreign regulated entities. In addition, it
is understood that some capital controls remain, in particular a minimum investment period of 120 days
for foreign investments.

Section III. Market Infrastructure

Several regional exchanges where only brokers can have a seat provide trading platforms; however
a plan has been submitted for their consolidation into one single market, the BIMA. BIMA will
work under the principles of federalization, specialization and interoperability. In practice this means that
the different exchanges will not be competing for the same products, rather they will specialize but under
a model of interoperability that would potentially allow members to trade in all markets. In this context
MERVAL would become the main market, while MAV would become a junior market specialized in
SMEs. ROFEX is not currently part of the consolidation plan, due to the potential liabilities that it faces
as a result of legal suits regarding currency futures contracts.

A “specialized? market, organized by the banks, the MAE has coexisted with the regional
exchanges; and it has now plans to become a full blown market. MAE has mainly functioned as an
electronic over the counter money market, settling bilaterally. However, its plans now are to openly
compete with BIMA across all asset classes and products. In this regard, it has recently requested
approval to expand its license to currency futures.

As per the plans of these two groups, two CCPs could potentially be created. Currently Banco de
Valores acts as settlement bank for the securities exchange markets. However, both groups have plans to
set up CCPs. The mission understands that Caja de Valores, the CSD, will continue to serve both
markets.

Section IV. Intermediaries
There are currently 366 entities authorized to provide securities intermediary services in
Argentina. Of these 323 are “pure? securities intermediaries whose activities range from advice only to




                                                                                                     Page 18
intermediation in the exchanges while 43 are banks.6 The number of securities intermediaries increased
significantly with the demutualization of the exchanges, which was brought about by the Capital Markets
Law (CML) approved in 2012.

Trustees have played a key role in the securities market in Argentina as trusts are the preferred
SPVs for securitization. Trustees are under the regulation and supervision of the CNV, and also of the
CB when the underlying assets are loans. The market is relatively concentrated, with Banco de Valores
holding about 60 percent of market share.

Section V. Legal and Accounting Environment

Overall the legal framework for the securities market is in place; although a few specific issues need
to be reviewed. A capital markets law (CML) was approved in 2012. In general it is perceived to be a
modern law that facilitates (i) the issuance of many different instruments, (ii) the organization of different
markets under principles that foster their integration, and (iii) competition among intermediaries. That
said, there are operational issues that could potentially affect market development going forward, such as:
article 20 of the CML that allows the CNV to intervene and appoint directors in listed companies; the lack
of a sufficiently defined space for private offerings; and the framework for tender offers, as will be further
explained in the next section. There is a separate MF law. In general, this law is considered restrictive as
it regulates only funds to be offered to retail investors. These issues will also be further explained in the
next section.

The majority of the preconditions for capital market development appear to be in place; however
confidence in the judiciary is an issue. An in-depth review of the legal framework was not conducted,
however, market participants mentioned the existence of (i) a robust legal framework for trusts which has
allowed the development of securitization structures, (ii) a sound framework for corporate insolvency
which allows for out of court restructuring, although specific issues need to be addressed in particular the
recognition of close out netting for purpose of further development of the derivatives markets (iii) a legal
framework for secured transactions, (iv) a legal framework for factoring, and the recognition of electronic
invoices, although specific issues need to be addressed for further development of the factoring industry
and related capital market instruments, in particular the legal status of invoices and the requirements for
their transfer, and (v) robust accounting and auditing practices based on the implementation of IFRS and
AIS complemented with a cadre of expert professionals. However, reforms implemented over the last
decade eliminated the commercial courts and currently all suits need to be brought to the federal tribunals,
which are considered not to have sufficient expertise to deal with financial issues. More generally, foreign
participants lack trust in the judiciary. The implications of the latter will be further discussed in the
section on infrastructure financing.

 Participants observed that the difference in tax treatment of securities accounts versus bank accounts have given an
advantage to brokers over banks (related to the credit-debit tax).

Part II. Key Constraints for Capital
Markets Development and
Recommendations to Address Them
Similar to other countries, the level of development of the Argentinian markets is the result of a
complex set of issues. Overall macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary policies are the main factors
explaining the current level of development, and in the wake of past government policy shifts that
had a significant impact on market participants’ confidence in the markets, stabilization of macro
indicators is key. Over time, as the macroeconomic environment improves and a careful balance
between fiscal needs and financial sector growth is achieved, the markets should grow. In such a scenario,
the key long term challenge for Argentina would be the development of a strong domestic institutional
investor base to anchor the market, to be complemented with active foreign participation. This requires
the implementation of a set of actions; many of which will bear fruits in the long run. However, a few
actions have been identified that could deliver “quick wins? to the authorities. All these issues are
discussed below.

Section I. Macroeconomic, Fiscal and Monetary Challenges

Macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary policies have had, and will continue to have, a major impact
on the capital markets in Argentina, in particular limiting the growth potential of long term
funding instruments. Macroeconomic conditions and developments, in particular the high inflation and
high nominal interest rates, explain to a large extent:

       the limited ability of the government to issue domestic currency treasury securities that could help
        form a yield curve;
       the absence of long term finance for corporates, SMEs, housing, and infrastructure;
       the preference for issuance of securities in dollars, and the appetite of investors for dollars as the
        only viable instrument for long term saving;
       the limited participation of companies and assets in the financial system, given the effects of the
        credit-debit transaction tax; and
       the flight of capital and a tendency not to place savings in the formal banking system (this last
        factor is also largely driven by confidence issues).


The new Government has taken, and is continuing to take, actions that will promote further
confidence in the markets. By allowing the currency to float, and solving the impasse with the holdout
creditors, Argentina was able to regain access to the international debt markets via the issuance of
government bonds. These have been critical measures to restore confidence. Furthermore, the



                                                                                                     Page 20
oversubscription of the bonds reflects a vote of confidence in the new government’s economic and market
policies. Legislative initiatives including the recently approved Ley de Blanqueo de Capitales, a reform to
the Capital Markets and MF laws, and a new PPP law, all support the expansion of opportunities and
investment in the capital markets.

However, bringing inflation to acceptable levels remains key for the development of capital markets
and long term finance. Central Bank measures to tackle inflation through the mopping up of liquidity
via the issuance of short term, high yielding monetary instruments (LEBACs), at rates of around 35
percent, are temporarily crowding out private sector capital markets. It is expected that inflation will be
brought down to levels of about 20 percent by 2017; but reaching single digit inflation is seen as a
medium term goal that could take more time (some estimate at least 5 years). In this context, actions are
needed along with coordination between the MoF and the Central Bank to assess what instruments could
best achieve the goal sought by the Central Bank while minimizing negative effects on the capital
markets. The Central Bank may consider scenario analyses on the marginal effects of different policies to
determine whether other less direct tools (e.g., reserve requirement ratios) could be used to lower inflation
with smaller interest rate effects. In the medium term, alternative solutions might be needed to foster the
development of a long term finance market, such as the use of inflation-linked instruments. However, the
development of these type of instruments is not without challenges. These issues will be further explored
in the section on infrastructure financing.

In addition, a careful balance between fiscal needs and policies to promote financial sector growth
needs to be achieved. Tackling the fiscal deficit should remain a priority. However, the current taxation
regime is creating distortions that have affected the capital markets and will continue to have a significant
impact on it. In particular, the credit-debit tax which imposes a tax on every movement in a checking
account (money being deposited or withdrawn) is having a number of distortionary effects both on a
broader level (increasing the obstacles for SMEs to transact in the formal banking system) and on specific
products and instruments of the capital markets (such as mutual funds). Thus a thorough review of the
overall tax framework for financial instruments should be undertaken. This review could lead to tax
removals in some segments and potentially higher taxes in others so while elimination of the credit-debit
tax may not be feasible; consideration should be given to applying it in a revenue neutral way that levels
the playing field for capital market participants and potential new instruments, given the substantive
distortions that it creates currently for the financial sector and its effects on the real economy. This is the
approach that is being used in Brazil.

Capital market development would be supported by a government securities market to set
reference rate benchmarks for private bond issuances. In the past decade the government debt market
has been less structured due to extraordinary circumstances. From 2010-12 long term dollar issuances
were mainly on account of the rescheduled bondholder’s debt. The central bank also issued medium term
non-transferable dollar notes and public institutions such as the Banco de la Nacion (BNA) issued two
year variable rate peso notes while other non-financial public enterprises issued 3-6 month dollar
instruments. From 2012-14 the government issued variable rate 4-year peso bonds as well as 5-6 year
BONAR/BONAD bonds linked to the variable Badlar benchmark. Public enterprises continued issuing
short term paper. After the debt swap/rescheduling, new government issuances began attracting mostly




                                                                                                      Page 21
domestic investors, and many such issuances funded obligations of the government to other public
enterprises.

From 2014-15 the government continued issuing 2-4 year notes and peso bonds at variable rates and some
2 to 10 year dollar and dollar-linked BONAR and BONAD bonds at fixed rates, as well as peso BONAC
bonds at variable rates based on the LEBAC or Badlar. All these issuances, albeit, mainly in dollars for
the fixed rate segment, attracted domestic investors, but made some minor inroads toward lengthening the
yield curve for dollars. In 2016, with the new government, dollar and euro fixed-rate bonds of various
maturities (3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 20, and 30 years) were issued with high international investor subscription.
On the peso side, a combination of Badlar-based variable notes as well as variable inflation-linked (CER
index) notes and some fixed rate notes and bonds were issued in the 2, 5, 7, and 10 year maturity ranges.
These issuances have begun referencing different segments of the local yield curve but significantly
higher volumes and liquidity/tradability in the peso bond market will be needed, with a regular issuance
schedule, before private bond pricing can rely on a reliable rate benchmark in each yield curve segment.

Section II: Structural Problems on the Demand Side

Outside the macroeconomic environment and how it affects market participants’ confidence, the
largest issue facing the development of the domestic capital markets is the lack of a robust investor
base, across all categories of investors: institutional, retail and foreign. This particularly impacts
capital raising. Market consensus is that offerings of both equity and corporate bonds can be successfully
placed domestically with a size of up to USD 200 – 300 million. Any offering larger than that needs to be
placed on international markets as the domestic investor base is too small. Until the demand side of the
markets is further developed, larger offerings will continue to be placed abroad, even under improved
macroeconomic conditions and improved investor confidence.

Thus, the key priority for the authorities going forward should be the development of a more
robust investor base and more optimal deployment of available savings in the economy. Cross
country experience indicates that the development of domestic institutional investors is critical. A
domestic institutional investor base provides a more stable and longer term investor base than either
foreign or retail investors. There are few examples of countries that have successfully developed their
domestic capital markets without this class of investors. There are a number of initiatives that can be
taken in this respect:


       The FGS could be permitted via a reform of its investment regime, a more active trading role as
        an anchor investor, leveraging its resources to attract other investors, and generating more
        liquidity in the securities market, thus being allowed to trade and invest in safe diversified assets
        and new issuances given its heft in the asset management industry.

       Confidence in private pension funds has been severely dented by the nationalization of the private
        pension funds, thus it will be important to look at the development of alternative savings regimes



                                                                                                     Page 22
         such as a voluntary savings regime based on the USA “401 K? model to encourage long term
         domestic savings through the formal financial system. Such employer based schemes, while
         technically voluntary, have automatic enrollment based features which can increase participation.

        In this context, initiatives to grow insurance penetration, particularly life insurance and retirement
         insurance annuities, should be pursued. These include increasing tax incentives for investors in
         life insurance products.

The development of a more robust domestic institutional investor base will be a long term
endeavor. Some of the actions recommended above could bear fruit in the short term and constitute
“quick wins?; in particular those related to the FGS. The impact of others, in particular those related to a
private retirement scheme and life insurance would be seen in the medium to long term.

In this context, and in parallel to these reforms, measures to ease access for foreign investors should
be prioritized. Increased participation of foreign investors may have the effect of improving confidence
for retail investors to bring them back into the market. Thus, efforts in this direction could deliver a
“quick win". The efforts to improve access for foreign investors are also largely aligned with the
requirements for moving from MSCI Frontier to MSCI Emerging market status (see box 1). This will
likely increase foreign investment in Argentinian companies due to the need to rebalance portfolios to
track the index.

In particular, as indicated above, investors face a series of procedural and regulatory requirements
related to the opening of accounts and the due diligence that participants have to conduct on them
and tax registration resulting in onerous administrative costs in terms of time and money that deter
foreign investment in the capital markets. These are the most critical changes that could also deliver
“quick wins?. In the medium term. Other areas where improvements might be needed relate to market
infrastructure, including the robustness of clearing and settlement processes, and the development of
omnibus accounts.7 Finally, if Argentina wishes to remain competitive in attracting foreign investor flows
into domestic markets, it should review the tax treatment for foreign investors.8 Coordination will be
needed between different entities of government, including the MoF, CB, Ministry of Justice and revenue
authority in order to develop a comprehensive approach to reducing barriers for foreign investors.

  Omnibus accounts have the potential to reduce costs as one account is needed for many investors, meaning that
each investor does not have to be dealt with individually. In 2012 Poland introduced omnibus accounts to open the
Polish market to new investors by easing accessibility. Other countries in the EU that use omnibus accounts are
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Spain. Omnibus accounts are also
used in Switzerland and the USA.
8
  For example Peru recently eliminated the tax on capital gains for foreigners as part of the measures to remain in the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It is understood that some capital controls may remain and these should be part of
the review.

       C.4 Stability of Institutional Framework




It is important to highlight that foreign investors’ participation might not be equal for all market
segments. It could be expected that their interest would first be in government securities (new treasury
issuances as an initial benchmark) as well as the larger corporates via equity (in which they are already



                                                                                                              Page 24
investing via ADRs); while their participation in corporate bonds might require more time, and additional
improvements in the macroeconomic environment. Their participation in infrastructure financing through
equity or debt will require that a robust PPP framework is in place, and appropriate risk-sharing
mechanisms to cover non-commercial aspects of project risks.

The largest deterrent to retail participation in the capital markets is a lack of confidence, both in
the markets themselves, but also in the stability of the regulatory framework, and the
macroeconomic and political environment. The repatriation law is intended to deliver a “quick win?,
and encourage retail investors to bring their resources back into the financial system. The creation of
suitable vehicles to channel these funds toward capital markets and the funding of priority sectors in the
real economy is a critical step to potentiate this “quick win.? As envisioned, closed-end funds appear as a
key vehicle toward this end. However, to make repatriation attractive, the taxation of such vehicles going
forward (not just for the moment of repatriation) should also be addressed, including a possible
elimination of the income tax on capital gains and restructuring the wealth tax. Finally, it is understood
that full confidence of investors will require consistent actions of the authorities over time on the macro
and institutional front. Furthermore, in the long run, it is critical that the authorities consider a full review
of the taxation regime within a revenue neutral context, as it seems to be creating significant distortions to
investing in capital markets, and more generally for the financial sector.


Section III. The Supply side

Specific issues affecting the markets for corporate, SME, and infrastructure financing will be
discussed separately. That said, there are a few technical issues that could impact all segments of
the market. Addressing them could deliver “quick wins?. They relate to (i) a review of the public
offering regime, (ii) a review of the framework applicable to MFs, and (iii) a review of the procedures for
authorization of offerings. The latter change is explained in the next section. In the long term, the need
for a thorough review of the tax system should be emphasized as it appears to be creating significant
distortions for capital market development as a whole and for the preference of one instrument over
another.

Review of the public offering regime
The objective of this review would be to achieve a better balance between investors’ needs for
information and the cost of disclosure. In particular:

    •        The creation of a recognized private offering regime that could be applied to all types of
             instruments, ranging from corporate issuances (both equity and debt) to MFs. The private
             offering regime could be based on conditions such as the number of investors involved, the
             maximum amount issued, the minimum size of investment, and the type of investors to which
             an offer is addressed. On the latter, offers addressed exclusively to sophisticated investors
             could be part of the private offering regime. This category could include both professional
             investors, such as institutional investors, and high net-worth individuals. Issues of private



                                                                                                        Page 25
             offerings could potentially be exempted from any disclosure requirement vis-à-vis the
             regulator and would not require authorization by the CNV. Alternatively, some of those
             offers, such as those addressed to sophisticated investors, could be subject to the filing of an
             offering memorandum that would not need to be reviewed by the CNV, but that would be
             subject to antifraud provisions. In either case, all offers conducted under this regime would be
             subject to a notification requirement. This requirement would allow the CNV to monitor any
             emerging risks arising from this regime.9

    •        As a result of the above, a review of the current “special? regime for SMEs would be
             warranted. Such review would aim to determine whether it could be transformed into a
             proportionate regime for SMEs issuances that could be offered to retail investors.10 This
             review would provide the foundation for the development of an “alternative? market at the
             exchange level, with proportionate listing requirements and to the extent possible reduced
             transactional costs.

    •        A “residual? review of the public offering regime would also be beneficial, to ensure the
             alignment of all these regimes. In tandem with this review, improvements in the authorization
             function can be considered as further explained in the next section.

Review of the framework for mutual funds (MFs)
The review of the MF regime would aim at ensuring the availability of a wide variety of MFs, under a
proper framework that adequately distinguishes between different type of funds and investors for
purposes of determining the applicable prudential and disclosure requirements. In particular:


    •        The development of distinct regimes for MFs offered to the public versus MFs offered under
             a private offering regime. This review would build on the creation of a space for private
             offers as recommended above. Funds to be offered to retail investors would be subject to a
             stricter “prudential? and disclosure framework, while funds to be offered under a private
             offering regime could be given much more flexibility. It is important to note, however, that
             while the rules for funds to be offered to retail investors should be stricter, the current regime
             appears restrictive, in particular in regard to eligible assets. In any event, the specific rules
             applicable to funds would be developed based on a typology of funds, which would help to
             ensure that the risks of different structures and types of underlying assets are well disclosed




9
   This “broad? private offering regime exists in countries such as the United States and Canada. In both cases, the
current regimes have been the result of evolution in the market. The authorities are best placed to decide how best to
tailor them to the specificities of the Argentinian market.
10
   Such type of regime exists for example in the United States.




                                                                                                             Page 26
             and managed.11 For example, specific rules should be developed for money market funds,
             REITs, ETFs, etc.

     •       Addressing the obstacles preventing the use of closed end-funds, as these can be important
             instruments for channeling investment into the real economy (including the sectors of
             infrastructure, SMEs, and real estate). It is understood that the main obstacles relate to: the
             current regime that imposes double taxation of closed-end funds thus making them
             financially unviable; the limited scope of allowable investment in closed end funds; and the
             joint liabilities of asset managers and depositories of these funds.

     •       Reviewing the regulations on distribution of MFs to ensure that they do not pose obstacles to
             an open architecture model. In this context it is important that the framework for MF
             distribution effectively allows the development of a network of distribution agents and
             potentially also independent advisors. This might bring additional competition to the industry
             (and with it potentially innovation and reduction of fees). Finally, certain operational rules
             that might be affecting the use of distribution agents should be reviewed including: (i) the
             process of approval of distribution contracts; and (ii) the distribution of KYC responsibilities
             between the fund manager and the distribution agent. On the latter the CNV could potentially
             develop rules that allow for the contractual distribution of such responsibilities, provided that
             certain conditions are met.

     •       Finally the role and responsibilities of the fund manager versus the depositary could be
             reviewed. Market participants highlighted the scope of responsibilities of the depositary
             versus the fund manager as a potential deterrent for further development of the industry.
             There is no best model to follow.12 In this respect what is important is that the authorities
             reviewed the impact of such enhanced obligations.


Section IV: The Supervisory Authority

A series of legacy issues need to be tackled to ensure that the CNV is ready to supervise a more
developed and complex market in an effective and expedient manner. Overall, market participants
expressed concerns about past practices of the CNV, whereby both regulation and supervision were used
to pursue government interests and policies, without rigorous technical foundation. The appointment of a
new Board has restored credibility on the CNV. However its challenge is to effect long term changes in
the organization, in particular the way it conducts its key functions. The CNV is perceived to have a very

11
   It is noted for example, the prevalent use of open-end structures, which require careful management of liquidity
risks. This would be an area that the CNV would need to pay increased attention in line also with current work by
the FSB and IOSCO. That said, the framework for open-end funds offered to retail investors currently has certain
features that are too strict, particularly with regards to eligible assets.
12
   For example, under the European Union Directives for UCITs the depositary’s role goes beyond custody and also
encompasses an “oversight? role. This broader role is not a feature of the U.S. system.




                                                                                                          Page 27
formalistic approach, which can result in serious bottlenecks as well as in an ineffective supervision of
risks.

The CNV Board is aware of these challenges and steps are being taking to address them. The Board
has embarked on a wholesale review of the organization aimed at improving its governance and
functioning. As part of such review, the Board has conducted meetings with different market participants
to obtain a deep understanding of the market, the potential changes needed in regulation, as well as in its
authorization, supervision and enforcement functions. Improving the authorization function

Actions are needed across all regulatory functions; however in the short term improvements in the
authorization function could deliver “quick wins.? Improvements are also recommended in the
supervisory and enforcement functions; however they would bear fruit in the long term, by increasing
investors’ confidence in the regulatory and supervisory framework. Further the CNV is encouraged to
take a holistic view and ensure that all key functions are robust, including regulation and licensing. In this
context, sufficient attention needs to be given to investor education –in this case potentially as part of a
country strategy on financial education.

It is important that the CNV adequately communicates to the market the changes that it is
implementing. Further, ideally many of the changes could be consulted with the market, in particular
those that could have an impact on their activities such as changes in the authorization and the licensing
regime.


Streamlining the procedures for public offering
Achieving a proper balance between the need to ensure that investors have complete information at
the moment of investment and the expediency of the authorization process is a challenge faced by
regulatory agencies across all types of markets. The review of offering documents as a condition for
the authorization of a public offering is considered a best practice followed by the majority of IOSCO
members. The review aims at ensuring that issuers provide a complete and accurate description of the
company or vehicle offering securities and its risks. This, in turn, requires a deep understanding of the
underlying business by the regulatory authority, so that it can make a judgment on whether the offering
documents adequately reflect the risks of the business. Naturally such review can take time, and in many
cases can require follow-up questions by the regulator. At the same time, increasingly regulatory
authorities are devising mechanisms to optimize this process, as there is a clear understanding of the
impact that time can have in the ability of an issuer to take advantage of “windows? of opportunity to tap
the market under favorable conditions. The most common mechanisms are (i) a commitment to provide
comments all at once under pre-established deadlines and (ii) the development of streamlined procedures
for seasoned issuers (shelf registration) and for issuance programs.

It is understood that the CNV has instituted mechanisms aimed at reducing its time of response;
however there may be room for improvement. It is understood that the CNV has committed to
providing one single set of comments as part of the authorization process, and that a shelf registration
regime is already in place. However, market participants have commented that in practice the



                                                                                                     Page 28
authorization of a new issuance could take more than a year. In other jurisdictions where similar concerns
have been raised, a review of files has indicated that in many cases the responsibility for delays is on the
participants’ themselves or at least equally shared, because participants do not provide all documents at
once or do not respond to inquiries of the regulator in a prompt manner. In this context, it is
recommended that CNV track the time of response of both sides and makes such statistics available to the
market as a way to bring accountability to the process. In addition the CNV could review whether the
current shelf registration regime could be further optimized, in terms of (i) eligible issuers, (ii) conditions
for incorporation of information by reference, and (iii) conditions for automatic approval of the
supplemental prospectus.13 In addition, the CNV could develop guidance notes for “new? issuers, and
frequently asked questions related to the authorization process. Additional improvements could be
implemented over time, particularly if the number of issuances grows, such as the specialization of staff
by types of instruments and products, and the creation of different levels of review for plain vanilla versus
new or more complex products.

Strengthening supervision
As envisioned by the Board, supervision at the level of individual firms and products should be
strengthened, via the implementation of a risk based approach. In tandem, the CNV would need to
conduct a review of reporting requirements to ensure that it currently receives all the information
necessary to implement such approach. There is no methodology that can be considered a best model for
risk based supervision (RBS); thus the recommendations below should be considered guidance.

        In the case of intermediaries, it is proposed that the CNV implement a risk scoring methodology
         that focuses on an understanding of the business model of the different intermediaries and its
         effects on both prudential and conduct risk, and the controls in place to mitigate such risk. Such
         assessment, along with an assessment of the relative importance of the firms would form the basis
         for prioritization and to decide the intensity of supervision.

        In the case of issuers, it is proposed that the CNV develop a set of criteria and indicators to
         determine the frequency and intensity of review of issuers’ periodic and ongoing information,
         including size indicators, indicators that allows the CNV to track substantial changes in the
         financial position of a company/vehicle, the existence of qualifications in the audit report, etc. As
         the market grows, such indicators could be developed by sectors, so that outliers could be
         identified. Finally a robust market surveillance system must be developed, based on automated
         alerts.

        In the case of MFs, indicators should be developed by types of funds, with a view to identify
         outliers that would then be subject to closer scrutiny.


13
   While shelf registration is used in many jurisdictions there are important differences in the flexibility of the
regime, which to a large extent can be explained by the level of development of the market. The authorities are best
placed to determine where to draw the line. 14 Carvajal, Ana, Berg, Alex and Rodgers, Malcolm. Improving
Accountability of Securities Regulators, World Bank Group, 2014.




                                                                                                           Page 29
In addition, in line with the plans of the Board, the CNV should develop a process for the
identification of risks at the market-wide level, including systemic risk. There is no unique way to
implement such processes; however some early lessons are starting to emerge (see Box 2 below).
Initially, as envisioned by the Board, an emerging and systemic risk committee could be constituted,
along with the development of a set of indicators and tools for market wide analysis. The process for
emerging and systemic risk identification could follow a five step approach (identification, assessment,
prioritization, identification of the suitable response and monitoring). A risk registry should be developed
to provide strong governance arrangements. Finally, the mission encourages the authorities to review
whether arrangements for systemic risk identification and management at the financial sector level are
also needed.

           Box 2. Developing processes to identify systemic risk by securities regulatory agencies

 The current global crisis has shown that securities markets can be the source of systemic risk or at least a
 transmission mechanism. As a result, there is now an understanding of the need for securities regulatory
 agencies to develop processes that allow them to contribute to the identification of systemic risk, even in cases
 where they do not have a systemic risk mandate. This is now also embedded in the IOSCO Principles.

 The specific framework and processes are largely influenced by the structure of financial regulation and the
 mandate given to different regulatory authorities within a jurisdiction, as well as the level of market
 development in that jurisdiction. In general, the processes for systemic risk identification implemented in
 different countries, in particular G20 jurisdictions, typically contain the following features:

         First, securities regulatory agencies explicitly recognize the role that the board plays in the oversight of
          processes for risk identification and management. Typically, boards are informed about emerging and
          systemic risks and actions undertaken or that need to be taken to mitigate them.

         Second, many securities regulatory agencies have found it necessary to create specific organizational
          structures to support risk identification. Some agencies have established committee type structures,
          composed of senior level staff of the organization, although the specific department members vary.
          That is the case for example, of ASIC in Australia and of both, the OSC and AMF, in Canada. In other
          cases, agencies have established units or departments specialized in risk with the main objective of
          ensuring a consistent approach to risk management and providing technical support for the
          development of risk management tools. That is the case for example of the Hong Kong SFC. In both
          cases, however, there is a recognition that risk identification needs to be the result of a collaborative
          (organization wide) approach. In addition, some agencies are creating teams or units to further their
          capacity to identify risks within different levels of the organization, such as the SEC in the United
          States.

         Third, securities agencies typically attempt to establish strong links between the organization’s
          strategic planning and its risk management processes. This effort reflects an understanding that
          identification of risks, particularly those that can impact the ability of the agencies to fulfill their
          mandate, should drive the strategic direction and activities of the organization.

         Fourth, increasingly regulators are establishing risk registries as a key governance arrangement for the




                                                                                                                Page 30
            process of identification of emerging and systemic risk. A good example is the risk registry developed
            by the Hong Kong SFC.

           Finally, in many cases agencies have recognized the need to change the profile of positions and/or to
            add staff with different skillsets to the relevant operational units, to ensure that the agency adequately
            discharges its role of contributing to systemic risk identification.


Developing a credible and eff ective enforcement function
Finally, it is critical that the CNV develops a credible and effective enforcement function , supported
by an understanding that the key role of enforcement is to affect behavior. The principles below seek to
provide guidance on the key aspects of such a strategy.

          Enforcement should focus on material issues: the public interest is not well served when scarce
           resources are used in an unfocused and undifferentiated manner, responding simply to day to day
           pressures, rather than to a clear strategy that focuses the bulk of resources to those misconducts
           that produce the most harm to investors and to market integrity as a whole. In practice, the
           focusing of resources requires the development of guiding criteria to determine the materiality of
           cases. These criteria should include considerations such as the strategic significance of the case
           (i.e. what is the extent of harm or loss; what is the impact on the regulatory objectives), the
           benefits of pursuing misconduct (i.e. is enforcement cost-effective), as well as issues specific to
           the cases (i.e. what evidence is available).

          Enforcement should serve the ultimate objective of affecting behavior and improving
           overall business standards in the securities market: to serve its purpose the enforcement
           function needs to be used in a way that not only remedies problems but deters future misconduct
           and contributes to strengthening investor confidence. This has several implications in connection
           with the type of actions that can be taken, their severity and their disclosure.

          Shortcuts to proceedings, such as settlement, need to be used carefully so as not to damage
           public confidence in the enforcement function: enforcement actions can be resource and time
           intensive, especially where the matters are complex. Thus in some countries regulatory agencies
           use settlements as a way to leverage resources. While shortcutting the enforcement process is
           indeed attractive to regulatory agencies with serious resource constraints, the regulator has to
           consider carefully whether shortcuts are a short term gain at the medium to long term cost of its
           regulatory objectives and the credibility of its enforcement function. Key factors that could affect
           the credibility of settlements involve whether they can be entered without admission of guilt,
           whether they can be used when the misconduct involves fraud or reckless disregard, whether the
           sanctions imposed are significantly reduced vis-à-vis the sanction that would come as a result of a
           proceeding, and whether there is sufficient disclosure of the terms of the agreement. These issues
           are far from settled and different jurisdictions adopt different practices.




                                                                                                                Page 31
Preconditions for the effective discharge of key functions
The CNV should continue to migrate towards a system that ensures its independence from both the
government and commercial interest, as required by the IOSCO Principles. This is critical to keep
market and investors’ confidence in the CNV. The CML already contains some provisions that foster
independence. In addition, the following steps should be considered:

       Robust governance: the Government has already taken critical steps to ensure that a robust
        governing body is in place, with the appointment of the five directors that comprise the Board. In
        addition, the Board should review its current functions with a view to ensuring proper allocation
        of responsibilities. There is no single model that could be predicated as the best; however based
        on cross country experience the it is recommended that the Board focus on providing the strategic
        direction to the institution - via the approval of regulations and of the strategy for each of the key
        functions - and conducting strong oversight of day to day operations. In turn, day to day
        operations including authorizations and licenses should be delegated to the functional
        departments. Finally, the Board should review the ethics rules applicable to the whole
        organization, including rules governing conflicts of interest.

       Strong legal and operational arrangements to protect the Board and staff against suits:
        experience indicates that weak provisions could have a chilling effect on the supervisors’
        disposition to pursue and impose strong measures against breaches of laws and regulations. It
        should be emphasized, however, that the IOSCO Principles do not require full immunity. For
        example, a system would meet the Principles even if staff could be sued for actions or omissions
        arising from the discharge of its functions, if staff can only be found liable for gross negligence,
        and the supervisory agency assumes the upfront cost of legal defense, irrespective of whether the
        suits take place while the staff member is in office or not.

        Stable sources of funding: the IOSCO principles are neutral about the funding model for
        regulatory agencies. Experience indicates that the mechanisms in place on who decides on the
        level of funding and its allocation have a more significant impact on independence than the
        source of funding itself (whether from the regulated entities in the form of fees, from a public
        budget or a mix). In practice, this means that the CNV should have a key role in both areas, and
        that any potential approval of the level and allocation from a governmental agency, such as the
        MoF, should be done at a high level (rather than on a line by line basis).

At the same time it would be important to develop a framework for strong accountability. Basic
mechanisms of accountability exist in most IOSCO jurisdictions; but their value in assessing the overall
performance of the regulatory agency (i.e. effectiveness of securities regulators in achieving its mandate)
is limited. Best practices are emerging in leading jurisdictions, which are anchored in both ex-ante and ex-
post mechanisms. Ex-ante mechanisms include the definition and publication of strategic priorities by the
regulator, and of specific actions attached to such priorities to which some measure of success is linked.
These strategic priorities are the basis for ex-post reporting, whereby the regulator on an annual basis
reports on whether the actions previously identified as key to meet the priorities established were



                                                                                                     Page 32
completed and if not, the reasons that prevent the regulator from achieving them. While annual reports are
already published in many jurisdictions, the difference vis-à-vis leading agencies is precisely that this
reporting is linked to strategic priorities and those in turn to risks, thus providing meaning and context to
the activities and actions reported. 14

In addition, several preconditions need to be in place for the CNV to be able to achieve significant
improvements in its key functions.

        Ability to pay competitive salaries and to train staff as needed: it is acknowledged that this is a
         challenge for many regulatory agencies as in many cases salaries are bound by the civil service
         scale. However, in line with progress obtained in some jurisdictions, it is recommended that to
         the extent possible salaries for financial sector supervisors, including CNV staff be set in relation
         to a private sector benchmark.15 Complementarily, the CNV should be in a position to provide
         on-going training to staff.

        Recruitment of staff with a diverse skillset: in many countries regulatory agencies have relied
         mostly on lawyers and accountants. However, as markets develop, other skillsets become
         necessary for a robust assessment of the risks inherent in the securities market.16 Thus the it is
         recommended that CNV evaluate the need to add different profiles, such as macroeconomists and
         financial analysts, to its current structure.

        Robust IT systems and resources: automation is critical to enhance the efficiency of a regulatory
         agency. In this context, the following areas should be a priority for the CNV: (i) enhancing
         systems aimed at collecting information from market participants including during the
         authorization process as well as systems to distribute such information to the public in friendly
         formats and on as “real time? basis as possible --the former includes a review of the potential
         application of XBRL language to the financial information received from regulated entities; (ii)
         strengthening market surveillance systems; and (iii) expanding the level of automation of internal
         processes related to key basic functions, in particular authorization, licensing, supervision and
         market surveillance and enforcement

        An appropriate organizational structure: the definition of a clear strategy to conduct each key
         function, along with procedures to support them and a clear definition of responsibilities between
         the board and the functional departments are the key issues that need to be addressed to achieve
         regulatory outcomes. That said, it is useful that the CNV conducts a review of the organizational
         structure to ensure that at a high level it is in line with its key functions (regulation,

14
   Carvajal, Ana, Berg, Alex and Rodgers, Malcolm. Improving Accountability of Securities Regulators, World
Bank Group, 2014.
15
   Examples of countries where salaries of the securities regulatory agency are not bound by civil service salaries are
OSC Canada, Hong Kong SFC and Costa Rica SUGEVAL. In the case of OSC and SFC salaries are benchmarked
with a peer group.
16
   That has been the experience for regulatory agencies in industrialized countries, including for example the US
SEC, OSC Canada and AMF France.




                                                                                                              Page 33
          authorization, licensing, supervision and enforcement and potentially investor education), and its
          strategic view of how best to perform them so that a clear view of risks to the regulatory mandate
          (investor protection, deep and liquid markets and financial stability) inform both day to day
          activities and the annual plans of the organization. Thus, while the organizational structure of
          other agencies could be taken as a reference, the mission highlights the importance that any
          changes be done after careful consideration of the specificities of the Argentinian market.


Section V: Market Infrastructure

The CNV has strategic decisions to make concerning competition in market infrastructure. As
indicated earlier, there are currently separate projects to (i) consolidate the existing exchanges into one
single market under the principles of specialization, federalization and interoperability, along with the
creation of a CCP to serve these markets; and (ii) to transform the current electronic over the counter
money market (MAE) into a full blown market with its own CCP.

The IOSCO Principles do not prescribe a particular model for market infrastructure, and different
models can be observed across countries which are a result of both market development and
strategic decisions of the authorities. In many countries market infrastructure has started under a
vertical integration model, whereby a single trading venue (exchange) was served by a single clearing
entity and a single settlement entity, all under common ownership. As markets have developed,
competition has appeared. In general, there has been more competition in trading services. However the
level of competition in clearing and settlement services has varied greatly depending on the country and
the asset class (see Table 3). Along with competition there have been processes of consolidation
(including at a cross border level) as a way to reap the benefits of economies of scale and scope.

Different market structures are subject to different risks. As a result, it is difficult to determine a
priori which structure can deliver the best outcomes for a country in terms of ensuring the best
balance between market efficiency and financial stability. In general all three services (trading,
clearing and settlement) are subject to economies of scale, scope and network effects. As a result benefits
are sometimes derived from consolidation. However, consolidation may have negative effects on
innovation, users’ responsiveness and pricing –and may potentially exacerbate “too big to fail? problems.
That is why there is recognition of the importance of regulatory contestability and along with it the
potential need for rules on fair access, price transparency, unbundling of services and interoperability to
ensure that competition can take place. At the same time competition may lead to negative outcomes if
risks arising from market fragmentation cannot be adequately managed. 17

Accordingly, the decision on the level of competition to apply to market infrastructure in Argentina
needs to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the market. Therefore the comments and
recommendations provided below should be taken as guidance. Further, their implementation might
require changes to the law.

        On trading services, the move of the existing exchanges towards a consolidated model, but under
         a principle of specialization, seems a rational approach that could deliver positive outcomes to the
         country, provided that contestability remains. Such contestability would be tested by the
         expansion of MAE to other types of asset classes and markets. A credible market for futures
         would also need to be developed (either by BIMA or MAE). Given the large infrastructure
         funding needs in the economy, there is a large importance to be placed on currency futures (USD
         / Peso), particularly in an environment of currency volatility. It is therefore important to look at
         options to restart the futures market in a sustainable and secure manner. Given the reputational
         issues surrounding ROFEX, it may be the case that the exchange will be unable to rebuild its
         brand and reputation, and an alternative venue for the trading of these instruments should be
         considered.

        On clearing and settlement services, given the small size of the market, a collective industry
         solution might be desirable initially, whereby both the CSD (the Caja de Valores S.A) and a
         potential CCP would be structured as public utilities to service different trading venues, including

17
   For example very interesting discussions are taken place at the EU level regarding the risks derived from
interoperability in CCPs.

         the futures markets.18 This public utility nature should be reflected in the governance
         arrangements of both institutions and thus changes might be needed for Caja de Valores, while
         the governance arrangements of the prospective CCP would need to be carefully designed.
         Further, under this model, it would be desirable that settlement takes place in central bank money.
         Both the CCP and the CSD would need to be considered systemically important institutions given
         the impact that their failure would have on the functioning of the markets. As a result they should
         be subject to enhanced licensing requirements and enhanced supervision. In particular in the case
         of the CCP, particular attention will need to be given to its minimum capital and risk management
         requirements, including the existence of a robust default waterfall and business continuity plan.

        The development of a CCP would likely change the role of Banco de Valores. In any event, if
         Banco de Valores were to continue providing post-trading services for the market as a whole (or
         at least for the BIMA market), then a review of its current structure and the activities that it can
         undertake would be advisable. Currently Banco de Valores performs additional activities that
         pose conflicts of interest that might be difficult to manage.

In line with the above, it is proposed that as part of the decision making process the authorities
conduct a consultation process. This would be to obtain a deeper understanding of the impact that
different models (from a public utility model to the coexistence of different CCPs in effective
competition) could have on the development of the Argentinian markets, and in particular on their
efficiency, reliability and integrity. Such consultation should reflect on the role of foreign investors and
their impact on the choice of model.

Section VI. Securities Intermediaries
Strategic decisions are also required in connection with securities intermediaries. The current legal
and regulatory framework provides for the existence of several types of licenses, some of them with
limited capital requirements. Some participants raised concerns about the number of intermediaries
currently in the market, the level of capitalization of some of them, and the need for a process of
consolidation.

The IOSCO principles do not require a particular model of licensing regime for securities
intermediaries, but it does require that their licensing requirements, and in particular their capital, be
aligned with the risks of the activities authorized and effectively undertaken. In practice the licensing
regime varies greatly across countries, and is influenced by other strategic decisions such as whether the
country follows a universal banking model or not (see Table 4).

Overall experience indicates the benefits of ensuring competition in the securities intermediary
industry as competition can bring down fees, encourage innovation and foster penetration of capital
markets. There are risks stemming from increased competition. However, save for systemically
important intermediaries, the regulation of securities intermediaries does not aim to avoid their failure,
rather it aims to ensure that any insolvency is handled in an orderly manner, with the least disruption
possible for investors. Thus, such risks can be addressed via a regulatory framework that (i) aligns capital
and authorization requirements more generally with the risk posed by the intermediary, and (ii) provides a
strong framework for the custody of clients’ assets including a n investor compensation scheme, along
with a strong risk based supervisory approach.

In the context of Argentina, at the outset it seems that the number of intermediaries is high and that
some level of consolidation might be desirable. However any review of the licensing framework
should ensure sufficient flexibility to accommodate different types of intermediaries from dealers to
introducing brokers, placement agents, and investment advisers. The latter three categories would be
particularly important to ensure further penetration of capital markets instruments to the retail population
across the country. In this context, an integrated licensing regime that follows a “cascade? system seems
suitable for the country. An intermediary could apply for a license encompassing all, or just some of the
activities, provided that it complies with the minimum capital requirement for the “riskiest? activity along
with any qualification (fit and proper) requirement applicable to the respective activity for which
authorization is being requested. A solvency regime would accompany the minimum capital
requirements. Based on cross country experience, it is recommended that such solvency regime be
implemented in a proportionate manner. An initial high-level proposal is outlined below (see Table 5).
Additionally, a whole separate category of information service providers could be created, which would
include research analysts, credit rating agencies, auditors and price vendors.19


19
   In most countries research is usually conducted by sell-side analysts that belong to securities firms (broker-
dealers) and is thus considered a complementary activity. However it is recommended to create a separate
“regulated? activity to ensure that independent research analysis could exist, subject to conflict of interest

Particular consideration would need to be given to qualification requirements. As the type of MFs
expand, the qualifications needed for fund managers might need to be specifically tailored to the new
risks faced by such funds. For example, in the case of REITs or infrastructure funds, some of the expertise
required is not just financial. Based on the experience of other countries, it is recommended that the
regulations leave room for joint ventures.

In line with the recommendation above, any change in the licensing regime should be subject to
broad consultation with the market. Licensing requirements could potentially act as an undue barrier;
thus it is critical that they be appropriately calibrated to encourage innovation while at the same time
ensuring robust risk management. Thus, the proposal above should only be taken as guidance. For
example, the authorities should consider whether a category of specialized intermediaries for the SME
market is warranted.

Part III. Corporate markets

Section I. Lessons from Cross Country Experience

Even within Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), the markets for corporate financing are at
different stages of development. The causes of this are complex, and often relate to the
macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary environment, and the lack of a large investor base. In addition,
in most countries there are structural issues that affect the willingness of companies to come to market.
On the equity side, many companies are unable or unwilling to meet the transparency and disclosure, and
corporate governance requirements of a public offering and associated listing on the exchange. They may
not want to share ownership as many of them are family owned. For bond issuance, a key factor is the
cost of bond issuance compared to bank lending, especially in countries where banks are very liquid.
Further, even in cases where corporates do come to market, the capital markets have not been able to
provide long term financing. Improved macroeconomic conditions help to address some of these
challenges, however in many countries the dominance of the banking sector is much harder to tackle.

In addition, a key “regulatory? challenge is how to balance the needs of investors with the costs of
disclosure. Countries are testing different solutions as to how to ensure that “proportionate? regimes are
in place. These solutions relate to the creation of a space for private offerings, and the creation of
proportionate regimes for public offerings, as discussed above. On the equity side, such proportionate
regime needs to be concerned not only with disclosure but also with corporate governance.

For both equity and debt, secondary market liquidity is an ongoing issue for many EMEs.20 The
problem is more acute for corporate bond markets, although it must be recognized that bonds are by
nature less liquid. To a large extent liquidity is dependent on the existence of a wide investor base with
different investment profiles; thus problems of the investor base largely explain the level of liquidity of
many emerging markets. That said, the more limited the availability of instruments, the more investors
might opt for a buy to hold strategy. Some measures can potentially be taken, such as the implementation
of market makers and changes to the way securities are traded.21 However, experience indicates that there

20
   Liquidity concerns also exist in the most advanced economies, although their causes differ. On the equity side,
there are concerns that market fragmentation brought by the proliferation of trading platforms and dark pools, and
the increased use of high frequency trading are affecting liquidity and more generally changing the structure of the
markets, to the detriment of long term investors. On the corporate bond side, the implementation of Basel III has
triggered a re-pricing of market making activities. This in turn is leading to changes in the market structure of
corporate bonds, from principal to agency models, whereby liquidity would now need to be given by investors
themselves.
21
   For example, in some countries the less liquid securities are not traded on continuous markets; rather a call market
is in place, so that liquidity can be concentrated at specific points in time.

is no easy solution. Further, some minimum level of liquidity might be necessary for participants to
engage in market making activities along with a careful consideration of the potential incentives that
could be provided to them.

Section II. Recommendations for Argentina

There are currently few significant obstacles for the development of the equity and corporate bond
markets in terms of the regulatory framework for issuance and ongoing disclosure, and the market
infrastructure for issuers. As the macroeconomic and monetary conditions improve, the domestic
markets for corporate funding (equity and debt) should expand, along with an increased participation
from foreign investors. Furthermore, with the change in government, there has been a renewed interest in
issuance to fund investment in anticipation of an improved macroeconomic climate. In equities foreign
investment may include direct joint equity stakes in selected expanding industries as well as increased
foreign investment in domestic equity indices. Debt investors will likely await for additional government
benchmark issuances, and/or well established large corporate issuances, and project finance with specific
credit enhancement guarantees is an area where investor supply will need to be sought. Thus far in 2016
there have been two international corporate transactions. There is an anticipated pipeline of 5-6 more
transactions.

That said, along with the review of the public offering regime recommended above, a key pending
issue on the equity side is formulating a clear strategy for corporate governance. Market participants
consider that the current governance requirements at MERVAL are roughly in line with those in the
international markets; and that the key problem is enforcement. However, it would be useful to assess
whether a two-tiered structure might be more suited to the market. The first tier would have higher
requirements aligned with those in the international markets, while the second tier would have a more
basic framework. This could potentially help to attract foreign investors to the domestic market, while at
the same time providing flexibility to accommodate medium size companies for which the higher
requirements might be too difficult to comply with. A similar approach was used by Brazil, with the
creation of the Novo Mercado. In tandem stronger enforcement mechanisms would need to be devised
(probably beyond a “comply or explain? regime).

On the corporate bond side, the key challenge is to continue lengthening the maturity of the debt.
Overall there are no quick solutions. Improvements in macroeconomic conditions are critical, as is the
development of a broader and deeper market of domestic government securities to set a yield curve.
However, achieving single digit inflation would be a medium to long term goal. In this context, the
development of inflation linked products should be explored following the recent use of dollar issuances.
As further explained in the section on infrastructure financing, certain preconditions will need to be in
place for the development of those products: first inflation will need to have been brought down
significantly and a credible index should exist for peso issuances.

For both equity and debt, going hand in hand with steps to increase the domestic investor base and
measures to increase supply, would be a review of other measures to increase liquidity and improve
price formation. These will include making the asset management regime of FGS more flexible, by
allowing it to rebalance its equity portfolio so it can play a larger role as an investor in the listed corporate


                                                                                                        Page 41
market, and as a more active participant contribute to the overall liquidity of the market. In addition, in
the long term, the potential development of a market making framework (which will require an
operational securities lending and borrowing and short selling framework), should also be considered as
was recently done in Peru.

ETFs are a product that may contribute to the formation of liquidity in the markets, with the
caveat that liquidity benefits from their introduction are typically concentrated in the already
larger, more liquid stocks and bonds as these are the ones most suitable for inclusion in an ETF
index. As investors are comfortable with the risks involved in the purchase of government paper, ETFs
based on a basket of underlying government bonds could potentially generate a catalytic effect in the
creation of ETF products for broader asset classes including corporate bonds and equity. This could also
be a good way to attract retail investors to the exchange, amplifying their investment opportunities across
fixed-income and equity products in a cost-effective way and under a single trading environment. For
fixed income products, ETFs would also be a way to enhance transparency, consolidate bond indices
(tracked by the ETFs) and potentially diversify the investor base and liquidity of the underlying
instruments.

Finally, other technical issues should be addressed. On the equity side, a review of the tender offer
regime is advisable given the potential for increased M&A activity resulting from increased foreign
participation in the markets. Also, as already contemplated, the powers of the CNV over companies that
have done a public offering should be reviewed with a view to eliminating “exorbitant? powers which
should be removed.

Part IV. Use of Capital Markets for SME
Financing

Section I. Key Lessons from Cross Country Experience

Worldwide SMEs consider access to finance as one of their greatest obstacle to growth. In EMEs,
formal SMEs represent 45 percent of employment and 33 percent of GDP, while the credit gap for formal
SMEs is estimated at USD 0.9 to 1.1 trillion. Another USD 0.5 to 0.6 trillion represents the credit gap for
the estimated 60 to 70 million formal microenterprises in EMEs. 22

Thus, there is an increasing need to explore mechanisms to expand sources of funding for SMEs. As
in advanced economies (AEs), finance to the SME sector in EMEs has been predominantly in the form of
bank lending. This is due to the high initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring costs of SMEs, relative
to the size of credit demanded. Banks can have an ongoing relationship with SMEs and their owners
and/or management, involving multiple financial products. This allows them to reduce such costs, or
cross-subsidize them by selling other products or services. It is estimated that financing from banks
accounts for approximately 50 to 70 percent of the external financing used to fund SMEs’ investments in
growth.23 However, the crisis has led to an active debate about broadening the range of financing
instruments available for long term financing of SMEs. Alternatives may enable better responses to the
diverse needs of the SME sector, and reduce vulnerability to credit shocks.

Cross country experience indicates that capital markets can play an important but complementary
role in SME financing. Bank financing remains key for SME financing due to the reasons stated above.
However, depending on their level of development, capital markets can play a role in improving SMEs
access to funding as summarized below:

        Refinancing of SME lenders: such refinancing can take place via (i) corporate bond issuances
         allowing SME lenders to improve their funding structure and/or costs which in turn could be
         reflected in better terms for SMEs, and (ii) securitization structures that allow them to divest their
         portfolio of SME assets and free capital that can be used again for SME lending. Issuances by
         SME lenders can be observed already in many emerging markets. However, SME securitization
         remains a niche market, only developed in a few industrialized countries. Nevertheless interesting
         experiences with SME securitization have taken place in countries like the United States and

         Spain from which lessons can be drawn on the potential use of guarantees to leverage capital
         markets for SME financing.

        Financing of SMEs: there are two ways in which capital markets can directly support SMEs:

            o   By providing liquidity: this takes place mainly via the securitization of SME receivables.
                Countries like Chile (via the Bolsa de Productos) and Mexico (via NAFIN) have been
                successful in developing electronic platforms for factoring trading, and reverse factoring.
                In Chile’s case, credit insurers enhance the ratings of listed factoring receivables on the
                Bolsa, making them even much more liquid. Capital market instruments linked to reverse
                factoring can be seen in Chile and Peru, where funds have also been created to invest in
                pools of receivables.

            o   By providing long term funding: this can be done via different types of instruments in the
                private and public markets, such as private placements and public issuances via
                alternative markets and/or main markets, respectively. Experience indicates, however,
                that these avenues are mainly available to the medium and more formal SMEs. Further,
                while many alternative markets have been developed in both industrialized and emerging
                markets, their long term viability is a challenge. 24 Thus, they need careful designing.


Section II. Recommendations for Argentina

Similar to the cross country experience, in Argentina, access to finance is one of the most important
constraints that firms face. Nearly half of firms rate it as a major obstacle (compared to 30 percent
overall, for the LAC region). There are substantial gaps in long-term finance to support productive
investment - evident in the short term nature of bank loans, and amplified by the low depth of capital
markets and small size of institutional investors. Argentina has one of the lowest investment to GDP
ratios in the LAC region (less than 15 percent of GDP), suggesting capital accumulation constraints to
economic growth. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the most affected by economic
volatility and finance constraints, despite playing a critical role in employment and growth. Access to
finance is a particularly acute problem for MSMEs since, for example, they only receive credit
representing two percent of GDP while formal MSMEs account for at least 50 percent of GDP, generate
over 70 percent of total employment, and 47 percent of sales.

In this context, it should be emphasized that any strategy for the use of capital markets for SME
financing needs to be linked to an overall strategy for SME access to finance. Thus, it is
recommended that two reviews be done as key inputs for an SME finance strategy:

Development Practices, World Bank Group, Working Paper WPS7160, January 2015.




                                                                                                   Page 44
       A review of current barriers for SME access to finance, including the high level of informality of
        the SME sector in Argentina. Many countries face this type of challenge; however there appear to
        be additional distortions that exacerbate the problem in Argentina. In particular the mission notes
        the impact that the credit-debit tax might be having on the reluctance of companies to transact
        through the formal banking system, and consequently in their access to finance.

       A review of current guarantee schemes, including those provided by the SGRs and also
        FONPYME, with a view to understanding their cost and impact and ways to better leverage them,
        potentially also for purposes of facilitating the development of capital market instruments. In this
        context, there are potential benefits to develop a system of guarantees to be provided on a pooled
        basis (for a pool of SME loans or other SME assets). The experience of Spain, with SME
        securitization funds provides important lessons as to how to leverage guarantees in the context of
        capital markets. The MoF, CNV and domestic investment banks and securitization companies
        can coordinate to develop viable proposals for such instruments.

As for the capital markets component, the current SME check-based market needs an overhaul. As
indicated above, the current system works due to legacy legislation which forces insurance companies to
purchase SME instruments via MFs; thus the yield of such investments, while positive in nominal terms,
is often below market rates. If such legacy legislation were to be removed is likely that investment in
SME related instruments would significantly decreased, as was the case for real estate investment. Thus,
it might be necessary to implement any change in a gradual way; while the authorities work on the
creation of an SME asset class that can be sold on their own risk/return merits.

MAV could play a key role in the development of an SME asset class. While exchanges have
traditionally focused on the development of public markets, it seems that MAV is taking a more holistic
approach, whereby its goal is to accompany SMEs along the financing chain, from instruments in the
private markets --such as venture capital and private placements-- to issuances in the public markets. This
approach is welcome. However, it is important that broad consultation takes place within the investor and
borrower community as well as with CNV and MoF, so that the strategy developed responds to a country
view of the potential of SMEs.

It is recommended that the following issues be explored as part of the development of such a
strategy:

       An analysis of the potential viability and development of capital market products linked to
        factoring and reverse factoring, such as funds that invest in SME receivables: capital markets
        products linked to “true? factoring could allow for SME access to finance on market terms, once
        the current compulsory regime for insurance companies is phased-out. Under the current system
        (based on post-dated checks) guarantees and the financing itself are based on an analysis of the
        credit risk of the SME. In contrast, under a “true? factoring regime financing would be based on
        the credit risk of the companies to which SMEs supply good or services; rather than SME credit
        risk. Further, if the schemes are developed based on reverse factoring, then the risk could be
        limited to very large and known companies. Tax issues are the key factor discouraging the



                                                                                                    Page 45
       creation of factoring instruments in the domestic market, given their underlying asset revolving
       nature, and thus paying the credit-debit tax frequently makes the vehicles financially unviable. In
       fact, there are funds constituted abroad investing in these type of assets. Thus, this issue would
       need to be addressed. In addition, it would also be desirable that other legal issues were tackled,
       in particular strengthening the legal standing of invoices (to become “titulo ejecutivo?) and
       facilitating their transfer. A similar type of analysis could be done in connection with leasing
       assets. Since these are technically not capital market products, the MoF may wish to take the lead
       on this along with consultation with other ministries and financial authorities.
      An analysis of the potential role of private offerings for SME financing. In other countries
       private placements are a key mechanism for medium size SMEs to access the capital market
       given the more limited disclosure that applies to them. Thus, as indicated in a previous section it
       is recommended that the authorities consider the development of a private offering regime.
       Conversations with the market suggest that some level of private offers is taking place; however
       reporting to the CNV is not required under the current legal framework.
      An analysis of the potential role of an alternative regime for public offerings tailored to SMEs
       (both equity and debt). As emphasized above, this regime would be suitable for the larger SMEs.
       It is understood that the creation of such an alternative regime is being explored by MAV. The
       initial strategy is to work on creating a specialized segment, whereby MAV would cater to SMEs
       of a particular sector (such as mining), based on regional strengths. Such approach seems
       legitimate. Further, it has been used by other alternative markets, in particular the TSX Venture
       Exchange in Canada. A similar approach could be taken for other strategic sectors such as
       agribusiness.
The authorities are encouraged to assess what should be the right balance between the development
of bespoke solutions and standardized instruments. In its strategy MAV highlights the development of
bespoke products. Yet, in the long run standardization is needed to foster the development of the
securities and derivatives markets as it allows better pricing and potentially increased liquidity. For
example, although there is a wide range of bespoke agri-finance products and instruments to address the
funding needs of agribusiness, thought should be given as to which subset of that is most suitable for
trading on exchanges, to build a liquid and sustainable exchange instrument.

Part V. Use of Capital Markets for
Infrastructure Financing

Section I. Key Lessons from Cross Country Experience

Both AEs and EMEs face an infrastructure financing gap that traditional funding sources will not
be able to meet. It is estimated that an additional USD 1 trillion to USD 1.5 trillion of annual investment
in low and middle income countries will be required through 2020 to meet the infrastructure demand from
industry and households25. However, in the majority of EMEs, the need for fiscal consolidation and the
size of the funding gap makes it clear that stronger private participation in infrastructure is needed. Bank
lending has been a key source of funding for private participation. Yet, additional funding channels will
be needed to finance a stronger private participation as it is estimated that the capacity of banks to provide
such financing would be constrained both by the size of the gap as well as the impact that Basel III
requirements might have in their appetite to provide long term loans. As a result, increasingly institutional
investors are being looked at as a potential source of funding, given their sizable AUM, their need to
diversify their portfolios and the theoretical alignment of infrastructure financing with their long term
liabilities.

Despite its theoretical appeal, currently large institutional investors in AEs invest less than 1
percent of their AUM in infrastructure26, and the level of investment is even more limited in
EMEs.27 This disconnect is a result of a complex set of issues ranging from the lack of investable
(“bankable?) projects and concerns about the fairness and integrity of the PPP processes, to rigidities in
the investment regime of institutional investors and the lack of risk sharing mechanisms that could align
the projects to their risk-return appetite.28

Increasingly EMEs are taking actions to tackle these obstacles in a holistic manner. Some early
lessons are emerging from those experiences:

     •       First, at a high level, traditional funding sources including sponsor and bank financing remain
             key, and thus the strategy for countries is to find integrated solutions that optimize the use of
             all types of funding.




25
   See WBG, IMF and OECD, Report to the G20: Op cit.
26
   Excluding indirect investment via the equity of listed utility companies and infrastructure companies.
27
   However, there is significant variation in their risk appetite. In particular, the Canadian and Australian funds have
a five to 10 percent allocation for infrastructure (one as high as 15 percent). In EMEs, institutional investors in
Chile, Mexico and Peru lead infrastructure investment. Ibidem.

                                                                                                               Page 47
•   In the short to medium term the participation of domestic institutional investors is more likely
    for brownfield projects, while traditional funding sources would probably remain the main
    source of funding for greenfield projects. However significant innovation is taking place and
    different structures are being tested that could potentially change this balance.

•   Different instruments can and are being used to channel this investment –aside from the
    traditional investment via listed companies with an infrastructure related business and their
    bond issuances. Funds, both equity and debt, seem to hold important potential to attract
    domestic institutional investors, given their benefits in terms of diversification and the
    possibility to “outsource? due diligence to a professional manager – although issues of fees,
    duration of the fund and more generally alignment of incentives need to be given careful
    consideration. Further, debt funds can potentially be used to offload bank loans, freeing bank
    capital to be used again in infrastructure financing. On the fixed income side, there is also an
    increased use and testing of project bonds.

•   In general, robust risk-sharing arrangements are needed to make PPPs viable and to secure
    funding from institutional investors. Particularly in the case of debt instruments, credit risk
    guarantees are being used to bring the instruments to an acceptable risk level (See Annex I
    for a detailed explanation of risk sharing mechanisms). The WBG is currently supporting
    many EMEs to develop such guarantees (see Box 3 below).

•   Many emerging markets face challenges in attracting foreign institutional investors. In
    addition to the challenges identified earlier, currency risk is in many cases a key hurdle as
    there are seldom effective long term-hedging instruments available in EME currencies.
    Therefore, this is a risk that institutional investors would need to take on and be adequately
    compensated for, or it must be transferred to a third party. In many EMEs the only
    counterparty capable of taking on currency risks are the national governments and MDBs. So
    far global institutional investors have been mostly limited to purchasing local sovereign
    bonds. Infrastructure bonds issued as quasi-sovereign instruments (such as those issued by
    Peru) may have appeal.




                                                                                            Page 48
                  Box 3. World Bank/Country Initiatives in Infrastructure Finance

The World Bank Group has been recently involved in various infrastructure finance programs in Latin America.

In Colombia, the WBG provided technical advice in designing the financing instruments for the national roads
and highways (4G) program where it assisted in the structuring of project bonds with a view to making them
marketable to external and internal private institutional investors (e.g., pension funds).

In Brazil the WBG has been advising the government on the development of standardized infrastructure bonds
involving the guarantee of interest payments during the construction phase and the credit enhancement of bond
principal – this involves the development of domestic banking institutions to have capacity to purchase collateral
which would back up such guarantees.

In Peru, the WBG is involved in preparing a guarantee project that would backstop the domestic development
bank allowing it to offer guarantees to project concessionaires and financiers/investors. The program is
developed hand in hand with the modernization of the PPP rulebook and changes in regulations to ensure that the
government lays off any commercial and market risks to the private sector, in order to minimize its fiscal
exposure to projects.




Section II. Recommendations for Argentina

On the financing side
Similar to many other emerging markets, Argentina faces a significant infrastructure financing
gap. The private sector estimates that up until 2025, there will be a demand for USD 1 trillion worth of
projects including at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels and for both the private and public
sectors, distributed roughly in the following primary areas with the residual in a number of miscellaneous
areas of infrastructure:

    •        USD 275 billion: Housing
    •        USD 160 billion: Energy
    •        USD 150 billion: Urbanization
    •        USD 90 billion: Water/sewerage
    •        USD 60 billion: Roads/highways
    •        USD 265 billion: Other (health, industrial, gas, education, railroads, agriculture, telecoms)


Thus, there is an opportunity to expand private participation in infrastructure execution and
financing, inter alia, via PPP contracts. In fact, Argentina has a history of the use of PPPs, mainly in
the telecommunications and energy sector. While PPPs were regularly used in the 1990s, their use was




                                                                                                            Page 49
halted during the last decade. As a result PPP contracts went from USD 10 billion outstanding in 1992 to
USD 3 billion in 2015.

There is interest by the new Government in expanding the use of PPPs. PPPs are currently being used
in the renewable energy sector, supported by a specific law for that sector. In addition, a new draft PPP
law has been prepared. With this draft law the Government seeks to address the key concerns that have
kept the private sector from engaging in PPPs, in particular the need to ensure the right to use arbitration
abroad in case of conflicts, and clear termination rights and penalty clauses linked to mechanisms for their
execution abroad, and the possibility of robust risk sharing arrangements. The law has been drafted at a
high level (it is a “ley marco?), and would thus require the issuance of a sets of rules and regulations to
make it fully operational.

As in other countries, financing would require integrated solutions. Furthermore, as per
conversations held, banks are aware of the need to strengthen their teams with project finance experts to
be able to contribute to PPP financing. Many of them would have the backing of their parent offices, both
in terms of expertise and potentially also funding.

Financing through capital markets faces challenges. In contrast with other countries in the region,
Argentina lacks a robust institutional investor base with a sizable amount of assets under management to
anchor infrastructure financing. Thus, in the short to medium term, financing via the capital markets will
likely require the participation of foreign institutional investors. In this context, FGS has a significant
amount of AUM that could play an important catalytic role, if its resources are strategically used to attract
such investors.

There are clear differences in financing options for projects earning in dollars versus those earning
in pesos.

       •   For projects earning in dollars: the option of bank financing in dollars would likely be
           available. Domestic banks could obtain the dollar funding from their parent companies (in cases
           where they are part of an international group) or by tapping the international markets.
           Alternatively the concessionaries could access international banks directly. A key challenge
           would be the tenor of the debt.29 Capital market solutions could potentially be developed to
           lengthen the tenor of such financing. That could be done, for example, by complementing bank
           financing with infrastructure debt funds, in which FGS or the MDBs could act as strategic
           investors. The ideal would be that such vehicles were structured locally; however given current
           barriers to foreign investment it is likely that at least initially they would be created abroad.
           Another option would be the issuance of project bonds in the international capital markets (placed
           via Regulation 144 A and Regulation S). There is also potential for the development of equity
           funds to expand the financing for the equity portion of the project. As is the case for debt funds, it
           would seem likely that these vehicles would initially be created abroad as private equity funds.

           For projects earning in pesos: the availability of private financing is an open question.

     It is expected that Basel III would have an impact on the risk appetite for banks to provide long term loans.

            o   At the outset it would seem that foreign investors would not be willing to invest in pesos
                since currency hedging is financially prohibitive at current interest rates. However,
                solutions that would require the Government to take the currency risk do not seem
                advisable nor sustainable.

            o   Thus, inflation linked funding might be an alternative solution.30 However, preconditions
                would need to be met, in particular (i) interest rates would need to come down
                significantly, (ii) a robust index would need to be available, and (iii) a cross currency
                swap or other type of currency hedge would need to be available for foreign investors,
                which initially might need to be provided by the CB. It is important to highlight that the
                use of instruments linked to inflation does give rise to concerns. On one hand, there are
                concerns that they could embed inflationary expectations in the financial system; on the
                other, that any index used would lag actual inflation. Finally, time would also be
                necessary for market participants to regain trust in inflation indexes given past
                experiences with the underlying data used to calculate the inflation index.


Overall foreign institutional investor participation, even in cases where financing in dollars is
suitable, will likely be dependent on the Government taking a large share of the risk. That has been
the case for most of the projects financed through capital markets in Latin America, even when tapping
the international markets in hard currency. This could potentially mean the need for both contractual
guarantees, as well as credit risk guarantees (see Annex I for information on both types of guarantees).

MDBs could play a role jumpstarting the guarantee market; however the sheer size of the
infrastructure portfolio requires the development of domestic solutions. Domestic financial
institutions with some heft, such as Banco de la Nación could play a catalytic role in credit enhancement
instruments. These could be initially backed by government capital guarantees which could be initially
counter-backed by a multilateral guarantee to provide full investor confidence. The banking and/or
capital market laws may need to be amended to specify the capital and leverage requirements allowing a
financial institution to be licensed to offer this type of guarantee product. But once the mechanism was in
place and funded, it could begin operating with fewer wrap-around guarantee layers provided that an
initial set of projects obtained the needed financing.

The guarantee business could have several participants. Other large domestic banks such as the
Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires could potentially be players in the credit enhancement market. As
well, banks such as Banco de la Nación could potentially “sell? some of its guarantee exposure to other
banks or guarantee companies (SGRs) in Argentina (in small strips) while passing on a pro-rata portion of
the guarantee premiums. The financial and regulatory authorities would need to decide if this would be
sound as most such guarantee companies to date mostly focus on guaranteeing bank credit or

  There is mixed experience with the use of inflation linked instrument in EMEs. Chile is an example of the
successful use of inflation linked bonds.

guaranteeing other forms of SME funding which in aggregate are much smaller sums than amounts
guaranteed under infrastructure projects. However, if the mechanism became successful under one or two
institutions, these could eventually lay off small parts of their exposure to other firms that transact in
credit enhancements.

 Box 4. Methodological Issues – Default Probabilities.

 An institution assuming these guarantees would need to count on a methodology for provisioning of
 risks under PPP contracts based on an actuarial analysis of potential contractual breach or credit default
 situations. Such a methodology can be developed by analyzing the global portfolio of infrastructure
 projects’ financial performance and risk factors that triggered defaults and under what project,
 contractual and financial structures. Once an adequate level of actuarially calculated reserves is
 determined, the initial pipeline of projects can count on a backstop guarantee for the reserves of the
 guaranteeing institution. In other words, a second generation of backstop guarantees initially provided
 by multilateral institutions would be, not for individual projects, but to support the balance sheet (i.e.
 actuarial reserves) of the institution offering the guarantee. As per above such guarantees can be
 separate for bond credit risks and/or for government-related risks such as incomplete partial payments
 or the ultimate termination risk.

 To reach a viable institutional structure, this would ex ante require a balance sheet analysis of the
 selected institution, required reserves and solvency calculation based on actuarial risk estimates of a
 relevant portfolio of PPP projects, contingencies and VAR analysis under worse case scenarios, range
 estimates of the probability of invoking guarantees by creditors or concessionaires, back up financing
 lines for liquidity, and finally, pricing of guarantees. Other metrics underlying any such guarantee
 funding would include ensuring outright or shadow rating of projects (the latter where project bonds
 are not publicly available), and the need for the institution to partner with investors, brokers and
 underwriters in assessing project risk and investor risk appetite. The selected guaranteeing institution’s
 instruments for credit enhancement could include not only project bonds, but also debt funds,
 securitizations, and equity funds.


Finally, a few operational and regulatory aspects would need to be resolved to make the
constitution of some of the instruments described above possible, in the domestic markets. As
indicated all the vehicles suggested above (funds and project bonds) could be created and placed in the
international markets. However, in line with a long term goal of attracting international investors to the
domestic markets, the authorities should ensure that such vehicles and instruments could potentially be
constituted and placed in the domestic markets. Thus as recommended earlier: (i) all issues that have
prevented the development of closed-end funds (e.g. tax treatment, etc.) would need to be addressed; (ii) a
regime for offers exclusively addressed to qualified investors should be implemented to facilitate the
placement of these products; and (iii) the accounting treatment for non-traded bonds and mark-to-market
versus book value requirements, would need to be clarified to ensure transparency in the instrument’s
valuation. Finally consideration should be given to increasing the maximum allocation for FGS to invest
in infrastructure.



                                                                                                    Page 52
Other PPP issues
As indicated above, the Government would need to issue rules to ensure proper implementation of
the PPP law. These include critical aspects such as: (i) methodologies to evaluate project viability; (ii)
eligibility criteria; (iii) unsolicited proposals; (iv) bidding, selection and procurement process; (v)
institutional structure; (vi) contract management and oversight; (vii) financial structuring and financing
plan; (viii) risk allocation; and (ix) model contracts.

While a centralized PPP Unit is not essential (though some countries opt for such model), there is a
need to develop across-the-board standards for PPP processes and documentation in order to
provide certainty to investors. These standards include for potential project bidders, sponsors and
partners: the bid documentation and tendering document including the subsequent detailed preparation of
project feasibility studies (including design, engineering, and geological studies, environmental and social
impact assessments); financial modelling and risks simulation; risk impact and mitigation studies;
development of project specific performance indicators; and the financial close package.


Finally, for the Government to ready itself for the infrastructure finance and PPP “industry? it
needs to:

    •   identify a project pipeline and develop a multiannual report for the participating line ministries
        and subnational governments that summarizes the status of existing and potential PPP projects;
    •   conduct a project screening and prioritization exercise for potential PPP projects, within and
        across sectors and regions, taking into account the priorities of the country, sector strategies,
        needs, technical and financial feasibility, readiness, and other relevant considerations;
    •   conduct pre-feasibility and detailed feasibility studies as required by Government guidelines and
        developing a business case for government approval;
    •   appraise and structure the pipeline of projects following Ministry of Finance guidelines based on
        international best practices by providing the necessary financial, technical and legal inputs;
    •   identify, allocate and mitigate risks as discussed in this report;
    •   tender and negotiate with the private sector until both commercial and financial closure aspects
        are achieved;
    •   provide guidelines for contract management as well as operations and maintenance oversight
        during the life of PPPs;
    •   refine the existing guidelines for evaluating potential fiscal impact; and
    •   standardize PPP processes and documentation across sectors.




                                                                                                    Page 53
Annex I. Risk sharing arrangements

A robust PPP framework should have a clear delineation of risk sharing between the public and private
sectors. The general principle is that, irrespective of the structure, timing or contingencies of a project, the
private sector should be equipped to take all commercial risks since that is the type of “market? risk
which is of private sector competence. The Government (or a guarantor, directly or indirectly) should
only assume political/regulatory type risks, or in the case of credit risk, provide for the credit
enhancement of a bond if that is the only method to raise it to a rating commensurate with the risk
appetite of financial market investors.

Thus, the two main parties to be covered for risk by the government and/or associated guarantors are (i)
the concessionaire (real sector enterprise) risk against government contractual breaches, or (ii) investor
(financial market) risks associated with performance of a bond instrument particularly during non-revenue
earning stages of a project. Accordingly, the main project guarantees pertain to contractual issues or credit
issues. Thus the credit enhancement mechanisms for infrastructure projects can be elaborated as follows:

Contractual Risk Guarantee: these typically cover potential risks to the concessionaire firm which
would not be able to meet the income projections of the project (thus also putting bond investors or banks
at risk) due to breach of contractual provisions by the government as a PPP partner, or due to
contingencies that reflect catastrophic level events that affect project execution. The usual triggers include
the inability to execute previously promised commitments such as allowing (i) land purchases, (ii) rights-
of-way for certain facilities or areas, (iii) previously agreed guaranteed minimum revenues (below which
the government would compensate), (iv) pre-agreed cost sharing of project costs in the form of
government budget obligations that do not materialize, (v) expropriation of assets, (vi) change in agreed
tariffs where these are regulated (e.g.: energy prices, toll road fees), and (vii) unexpected major
geological risks that make the project cost/benefit unviable).

When such breaches or risks materialize and the concessionaire is not compensated, this can also result in
project termination risk, i.e., where the concessionaire has the legal right which it invokes, to end its
participation and execution of the project. The guarantee in these instances, by a third party, would
compensate the concessionaire upon the verification of such a contractual breach and thus provide
continuity. In the case the concessionaire does not continue, the guarantee can cover the contract
termination risk which means that other private parties involved in the execution or financing of the
project have their exposure covered.

Partial Credit Guarantees: these typically cover potential credit risks at key stages of the project which
would be deemed unacceptable to financial/bond investors without compensatory protections such as
credit enhancement mechanisms. The main risks pertain to fear of default and occur initially at the
construction phase of the project where bond risk can relate both to (i) inability of the project to make

timely coupon/interest payments, or (ii) put the bond principal at risk by the time the maturity of the final
bullet payment approaches.

Figure 1 describes a potential direct guarantee for bond investors in PPP projects to be provided under
initial pipeline projects. Such a partial credit guarantee could be provided by an external agency or as a
wrap-around guarantee to an Argentine bank that offered domestic guarantees; and include either a rolling
coupon payment guarantee and/or a final principal payment guarantee, or both. An alternative model for
a similar structure would be a guarantee provided to the concessionaire to cover contractual risk breaches
versus an outright credit risk / debt guarantee.

          guarantee



A second type of structure is shown in Figure 2 below. In this case, the guarantee relies on channeling the
product via large domestic banking institutions with an initial back-stop of such banks’ balance sheets by
the government, and backed by a long term contingent external credit line. In this case, the guarantee is a
credit guarantee for bond investors. However, two types of guarantees are envisioned and they are split
by different institutions to avoid an excessive balance sheet burden on either institution. One guarantee is
for interest coupon payments during construction to assure investors of expected bond earning. The other
is the guarantee of principal at bond maturity, or alternatively, at the end of the construction period.

In the illustration, the bank providing the guarantee of bond principal ( Bank “A?) would use a long term
external credit line to purchase government paper as collateral with which to offer and back up the
guarantee. The collateral would earn interest during the term of the bond so the initial outlay to purchase
government securities would be much smaller. As well, the earnings on the government securities would
be sufficient to pay off the credit line interest. If the guarantee was invoked, the collateral would be
liquidated and paid out to honor the bond principal payments. The bank would then need to repay the
credit line provider over the life of the loan for the present value of the principal. However, the idea of
the mechanism is to provide a higher rating for the bond to enhance its credit.

In the second case, Bank “B? would pay the interest on the bond during the construction phase of the
project. Once the project was in its operational phase, Bank ?B? would capture part of the revenues
associated with the interest coupons and use it to repay itself, or repay the credit line provider for the
liquidity extended to Bank “B? for that purpose.

PPP Contract Issues. Other risks to the government rather than to the concessionaire or investor, pertain
to the issue of renegotiation of contracts midway through execution. Renegotiation is sometimes
inevitable. However, the government should have a baseline scenario such as a purely public sector
executed project using private contractors, to periodically calibrate against PPP/concessionaire contract
renegotiation and cost escalation requests in order to determine at which point the cost/benefit advantages
of using PPP arrangements are outweighed by renegotiation costs.

Such decisions not to continue a contract and seek alternatives, are by nature extremely difficult since a
“no-go? decision on a renegotiation implies that the public sector must take on the remainder of the
project by itself, or a new bidder must be sought, both options having also potentially costly outcomes.
Thus, contract renegotiation clauses must provide for contingencies that are well beyond the predictability
of commercial risk, and barring contractual breaches by the government, essentially force majeure events.

Another key issue in public/private risk sharing pertains to availability payments (vigencias futuras).
These were traditionally and originally meant for the government to close project funding gaps that would
later be covered by revenue streams. Their payment was linked to performance indicators. However, in
some countries in the region, they are being used by the Government as a mechanism to address the
reluctance of investors to take construction (project) risks. That has been the case of Peru, where for
particular projects the Government has issued certificates to the construction company with an
unconditional and irrevocable payment obligation once certain construction milestones were achieved.
These certificates were then securitized and sold to domestic and foreign investors. These instruments
have been very effective in raising private sector financing and building a track record of institutional
investor participation in infrastructure financing; however they constitute a significant contingent liability
for the Government. As a result they should not be viewed as a long term solution.

Selected Issues on the PPP Framework. The new PPP law has several good features which will help to
promote the use of capital market financial solutions. The new law also compares favorably with the old
law which had some instances of government interference in PPP arrangements or the government
playing on overly central controlling role under PPP projects. Under the new law the explicit instance of



                                                                                                       Page 57
special purpose vehicles (SPVs) is featured and which updates and modernizes the PPP framework –
while Argentine legislation already earlier had instances of uses of trusts and SPVs for example, for
securitization, given the project-specific design under PPPs it is a positive feature to include SPVs under
PPPs as a unique application.

The law permits project cost variations within a 20% range without needing renegotiation (although there
does not seem to be any mention about renegotiations of contracts if cost estimates need to be exceeded).
In some surveys of Latin America PPP contracts between 30% and 55% of PPP contract amounts were
renegotiated and most of such renegotiations were initiated by concessionaire). Thus, the provisions for
contract renegotiation should be defined in detail lest PPP projects end up costing the Government the
same or more than if the Government had simply put out contracts to bid under a 100% publicly

The law makes reference to minimum revenue guarantees. While this is fine and part of standard
practice, it should not to be abused as standard feature in all cases and in some instances revenue

will need to be defined, for example, to include breach of certain promises such as (a) land rights, (b)
regulated tariff levels, (c) fiscal matching resources (d) right-of-way promises, and other causes for
compensation or contract termination. As well, the new law has positive features to project debt
payments upon invoking termination. The causals of termination of course require specificity and
exactitude while drawing the line between guarantees and compensation for contractual versus outright
termination.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in the Republic of Congo perceive the WBG. The survey
explored:
    General Issues Facing the Republic of Congo
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in the Republic of Congo
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2015, 370 stakeholders of the WBG in the Republic of Congo were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime
Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/
implementation agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of
WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local
governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations;
the financial sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/
research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 265
stakeholders participated in the survey (72% response rate).

Respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in person.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing the Republic of Congo; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in the Republic of Congo; and the
WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 90%, N=361). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 103).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from private sector organizations were combined with
       respondents from the financial sector/private banks; respondents from NGOs/community-
       based organizations, private foundations, trade unions, and faith-based groups were
       combined in the “CSO? category; and few respondents from the Office of the President/
       Prime Minister, the office of a minister, the office of a parliamentarian, independent
       government institutions, bilateral/multilateral agencies, academia, and other organizations
       were included in the “Other? category. Note that there were no respondents from youth
       groups and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’12 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 4.85; weighted mean in FY’12 = 5.02).1
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in the Republic of Congo, and
        significantly, moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG contributes to the
        country’s development results.

        the Republic of Congo is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the
        FY’12 Country Survey.
       Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from local government
        were most positive about the prospect of the Republic of Congo, whereas respondents
        from CSOs were least positive in this regard.

Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’12 Country Survey indicated that
       they most often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to “the
       Government working inefficiently? (53%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from the private
       sector and CSOs were significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted
       reform efforts to that “there is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation?
       compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in the Republic of
Congo, bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty
five specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in the Republic of Congo. The
       areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in the Republic of Congo, suggesting
       that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key
       drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year22
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in the other appendices.

FY ‘12 Number of comparable respondents = 335  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 239

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

          World Bank Group Country Survey FY15 – The Republic of Congo

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved
in development in the Republic of Congo or who observe activities related to social and economic
development. The following survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in the Republic of
Congo, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group
uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop more effective strategies that support
development in the Republic of Congo.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity
and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA,
IFC, MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank
Group with which you are most familiar.

To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If
you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank. If you feel that you do not have an
adequate amount of information on a subject, please check “Don’t know?.


PLEASE NOTE: IN SOME CASES THE SURVEY WILL ASK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER
OF RESPONSES. PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE ANY MORE THAN REQUESTED. IF
MORE RESPONSES ARE CHOSEN, DATA CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS.

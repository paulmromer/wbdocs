This Report is based on a field study of two large settlements, Satghara (a Census
Town) and Bhagwatipur (a rural cluster with 10,000 plus population) in the
Madhubani district of Bihar. A large proportion of the working population in
both the settlements is primarily employed in non-farm economic activities,
more than 75 percent in Satghara and nearly 35 percent in Bhagwatipur.

The study explores the social dynamics of the “rural? non-farm economy by
empirically mapping non-farm occupations in both the settlements. It examines
the dynamics of caste, community and gender within the social organization of
the non-farm economy in terms of their economic and social hierarchies and the
differential incomes and status they provide. The study also looks at the
relationship of the local non-farm economy with patterns of outmigration. It
further attempts to understand the manner in which the changes in the regional
structures of power and domination have influenced the local economic
processes and are being influenced by them with a specific focus on the non-farm
economy in the two setting. The study also attempts an assessment of the
possible development and urbanizing effects of the rather rapid growth of non-
farm economy in rural Madhubani.

Fieldwork for the study was completed during the second half of 2014. It
included a survey of 300 respondents engaged in non-farm occupations,
qualitative interviews with relevant informants and case studies of localities in
the two settlements and of different occupations. For the purpose of this study,
we treated all those economic activities that did not primarily involve direct
employment in agriculture, i.e. cultivation of land, as ‘non-farm’.

As is the case with most rural settlements in India, the households across both
the settlements are divided into a wide range of caste groups and communities.
Caste based communities mostly live in their own localities, known as tolas or
paras. The tolas are also named after the titles of the community. While some
localities do have mixed-caste inhabitant populations, they are few. This was
particularly so with the Dalit and Muslim localities.

We were able to identify a total of 1,680 individuals employed in different
categories of non-farm activities, of which 1,384 were in Satghara and another
296 in Bhagwatipur. A large majority of the non-farm activities are typically
individual centric and self-owned enterprises. Those engaged in these activities
are relatively young men, below the age of 45 (76%) and many of them have had
the experience of working outside the state as migrant workers (48%). The main
findings of the report are summarized below.

                                         ii
Non-farm preferred to on-farm occupations. The growing density of
population in the region, fragmented land holdings and the uncertainty caused
by frequent floods and drought, abetted by a lack of investments in building
agricultural infrastructure by the state, has resulted in agriculture no longer
being a viable occupation for a large majority of the rural population. Agriculture
has also declined socially. As is the case with most other regions of the country,
younger generations, even in families where the land holdings are large, no
longer view agriculture as an aspirational occupation. The political churning that
the region has experienced over the last three decades has also made
agriculturally dominant groups marginal to the local politics and power
structure.

More than 60 percent of those who reported being currently engaged in a non-
farm activity are first generation workers, i.e. their fathers and other members of
the family from the generation prior to them were either employed in agriculture
or in a traditional caste based occupation. Only 10 percent of survey respondents
wanted their children to take up agricultural cultivation as an occupation with
90 percent expressing a preference for non-farm occupations.

A wide range of different non-farm occupations - more than 50 - were
identified. Appendix 1 gives a detailed listing of non-farm occupations
identified across both settlements and Appendix 2 gives a descriptive
account of such occupations. A large majority of the non-farm activities are
typically individual centric and self-owned enterprises with only 3 percent of
respondents reporting their status as employed workers. A majority (51
percent) of them work from rented premises, with 24 percent owning the
establishment premises they work from and the rest (25 percent) working from
temporary structures with no formal title or ownership.

Most of the respondents reported starting a non-farm activity because it made
sense to them as a possible source of employment. Many of them did so either
because it was their family business (30 percent) or they had been exposed to it
during their work outside the village (nearly 15 percent) and many others
reported assessing that they simply had no other options for employment (12.3
percent) or that there was a local need for the business they initiated (28.7
percent).

The recent expansion of road and communication networks, mostly after the
turn of the century, has played an important role in the growth of the local non-
farm economy. Not only are towns like Madhubani well connected to the state
capital and other towns of the region through good quality highways, rural
settlements in the region are also well connected through pucca roads. Cell
phones and digital networks have also reached the interiors of Bihar. Besides

                                        iii
making physical movement and communication possible, they also make
migration convenient and easier.

But non-farm occupations observed continue to be informal and subsistent
in nature and scale. A large majority of our respondent across communities and
caste reported near subsistence level incomes from their enterprises. From the
total sample, only 12 percent reported earning more than 10,000 rupees per
month, which diminishes for specific caste/community groups. 70 percent of the
SC respondents and 61.6 percent of the Muslim respondents reported a monthly
income of less than Rs. 7,500 per month (See Table 22). 75 percent of
respondents do not want their children to take up the same occupation as them.

The local non-farm economy is not based on modern technology, except where
technology itself is a source of employment, such as cell phone repair shops.
Even in such cases, their social organization remains low-skill based and almost
universally informal. Even those dealing with sectors like modern medicine are
likely to be working without any formal qualifications and licenses from the
relevant departments.

Modern manufacturing is completely absent in both settlements. Manufacturing
establishments, where they exist (bhuja-puffed rice, jewelry, brick kiln, trunk
making) are traditional and small-scale activities that mostly use manual labor
and only occasionally mechanical and do not use electric power. They neither
generate a significant volume of employment nor require a high volume of
investment. By the way of their appearance and configuration too, the operation
of these non-farm activities in rural Madhubani retain the semblance of the
‘rural’ i.e. a site for the reproduction and sustenance of cheap labour, largely
catering to local requirements. This is in keeping with state-level data showing
minimal industrial growth industrial growth in the state over the past three
decades while the rural non-farm economy has grown almost at par with the
pace at the national level.

Non-farm economy is largely a male enterprise, with women making for a
miniscule proportion of the total employment in the category. Women
engaged in the non-farm economy tend to be employed in low-income
occupations and reported lower income levels than men. The number of
women owning and managing a non-farm enterprise on their own is not more
than 4 percent of the entire universe (we expanded our sample of women
respondents). Those women engaged in non-farm economy tend to work in
occupations that are either traditionally identified with women, such as bangle
making, or in occupations that involve serving exclusively or primarily women,
such as tailoring or running a beauty parlor for women or vegetable vending.
Some of them also “help? their men but they tend to be “invisible?.

                                       iv
The income levels reported by women tend to be lower than men. Nearly one
fourth (22.2 percent) of total women respondents report a monthly income of
less than Rs. 2,500 as compared to only 8 percent of male respondents. None of
the women respondents in either of the markets reported a monthly income
higher than Rs. 10,000 per month whereas 13.6 percent of the male respondents
did. On the whole, of the women reporting participation in the non-farm
economy, 45 percent report earning less than Rs. 5,000 per month

Caste and community affiliations still play a determining factor in types of
non-farm occupations of respondents. Community-specific exclusions can
be observed in specific non-farm categories. Active discrimination in
relation to certain occupations and differentials across non-farm
occupations on key indicators such as amount invested in enterprise,
monthly income and ownership of assets were also observed. One of the
obvious underlying assumptions about the social dimension of economic change
in the process of a shift from farm to non-farm economic activity is the process of
“secularization? or “modernization? of occupational identities. While the
traditional agrarian economy is structured around caste, non-farm economy is
usually seen as more likely to be a matter of individual choice and ability.

This, however, does not seem to be the case. The social organization of different
occupations largely remains structured around caste and community.
Community and caste diversity exists only in certain categories of non-farm
occupations. These include activities such as cell phone repair, modern
electronic and communication related services, vehicle repair, medicine-related
occupations, vegetable and fruit sellers and drivers/transport. Here too, we can
easily observe community specific exclusions in some of the occupational
categories. For example, there is no SC respondent in information technology,
cell phones or communication related occupations. Similarly, we find very few
Muslims, SCs or women in relatively modern categories or high investment
oriented occupations, such as those related to medicine and health, education or
construction and hardware. Even though a range of communities own grocery
and other utility shops, they are dominated by relatively upper and trading
castes that have been traditionally involved with such work. The same holds
good for food related outlets, which tended to be owned by individuals from
specific castes and communities. Apart from visible and not so visible divisions
and differences of non-farm activities in accordance with the logic of traditional
hierarchies of caste and communities, we also observed active discrimination
against some communities (Muslims and Dalits) in relation to certain
occupations.



                                        v
There were also clear disparities between different communities on key
indicators such as ownership of business premises and monthly income. 80
percent of SC respondents reported operating from temporary structures with
no formal title, as opposed to 50 percent of all respondents.

Migration plays a critical role in the rise of the local non-farm economy
through remittances and skills of return migrants. Migration is also, in a
sense, the main non-farm activity with nearly three-fourth of households in
the district having a male member working outside. There has been the
growing outmigration from Bihar. Motivated or compelled by the “push? of the
local economic situation, young men began to move out, sometime in the 1970s
to far off places for work. Initially a small proportion of them went to places like
Punjab and Calcutta, the trend continuing into the decades of the 1980s and
1990s. By turn of the century nearly three-fourths of the rural households in
districts like Madhubani had at least one of its male members of working outside
the village, mostly in far off cities and towns and some even abroad.

Unlike the usual process of migration, which tends to be one way with people
moving from rural to urban centres, resulting in a steady process of
urbanization, most of the migration from Madhubani district and much of rural
Bihar tends to be circular in nature. Consequently, despite such high rates of
migration, Bihar has seen no spurt in its urban population or desertion of it rural
settlements. However, the seasonal and circular out-migration of labour from
Bihar is changing many dimensions and dynamics of the region. The rise of the
rural non-farm economy is one such change.

The circular migration of working Biharis means that while the young men go
out for work, their parents and wives stay back in the village. A direct implication
of this is that not only do they regularly come back to the village to visit their
families every few months (generally twice in a year), most of them also return
for good at the end of their working life, when they are 45 to 50 years of age and
can no longer bear the hardships of life as a migrant worker. In the interim, they
send regular remittances to support their families. A share of these remittances
is invested in the land being cultivated by the family left behind; the rest is
available for meeting the consumption needs of the family.

The incoming remittances create a demand for a variety of goods and services,
from groceries for domestic consumption to medical stores and educational
centers, schools and tuition centers. The local entrepreneurs, many of whom
have themselves been migrants, open shops and other outlets to fulfill these
needs. Nearly half of our respondents (48 percent) currently engaged in non-
farm economy have been migrant workers at least some time in their working
life, before they started working locally or set-up their own enterprise.

                                         vi
In terms of assessing development and urbanizing effects of the growing
non-farm economy in rural Madhubani, our assessment is not very
encouraging. Even though non-farm economic activity is seen as a desirable
economic enterprise over being completely dependent on agriculture, it does not
seems to stimulating any kind of local level economic dynamism that has the
potential of urbanizing the region or pushing it to the path of economic growth.
As mentioned above, our survey and close qualitative observations demonstrate
that much of the local non-farm economy, which has been growing steadily over
the past three decades, remains subsistent in nature and scale. It generates very
little surpluses or savings, and thus no possibility of capital accumulation. Its
expansion is mostly horizontal with little or no evidence of it acquiring a future
beyond its current form of low-end commercial enterprises.

Most of the enterprises are self-owned and appear to be temporary in nature. A
large majority of our respondents do not see their current occupations taking
them very far. Those who have economic surpluses prefer going out, to
Madhubani and other urban centres. Even though the 2011 Census of India has
classified Satghara as Census Town, the quality of its non-farm economy is not
very different from that of the rural cluster of Madhubani. The story is not very
different when we look at the quality of its infrastructure in the two settlements.

Even though the traditional jajmani type relations have disintegrated, a good
proportion of occupational categories continue to be structured around caste
lines. Many of these caste related occupations also happen to be low-income and
low-value occupations. More importantly, those from the traditionally “low?
status communities, the SCs and the lower OBCs, are more likely to be working in
the low value non-farm activities than the “others?. In other words, within the
non-farm sector, their occupations are often located at the lower end of the
occupational hierarchy. They also tend to work from temporary premises, which
adds to their vulnerability. The activities that generate higher income and carry
superior status tend to be the monopolies of the traditionally upper castes or the
upper OBC, the trading caste.

The decline of agriculture and the disintegration of traditional power structure
do not seem to be giving way to a dynamic market driven economy of a modern
democratic society. The expansion of the non-farm economy has meant a
growing economic dominance of the trading castes, such as the Suris in
Bhagwatipur. Money lending businesses, which too are controlled by the
traditional goldsmiths and those from the trading castes, seems to be flourishing
in the two settlements. The poor often borrow money at high interest rates,
ranging from 3 to 10 percent monthly interest rates, which keep them trapped in
the subsistence economy, even when they go out for work or have their own
petty business in the village.

                      Social Dynamics of Non-farm Economy
         A Study of Two “Rural? Settlements of Madhubani District, Bihar

                                      Surinder S. Jodhka

1. Introduction: In the development discourse and academic writings on
economic change in contemporary India, Bihar is almost always presented as
one of the least developed regions/states of the country. Though estimates of
poverty vary and the pace of economic growth has seen some acceleration in the
recent past, Bihar continues to be counted among the poorest states of India,
nearly at the bottom. The per capita income of Bihar in 2008-09 was only Rs.
13,728, a mere 33.7 percent of the national average. Though it went up to 28,317
rupees five years later, in 2012-13, which works out to be 41.18 percent of the
national average, it was still less than one-fourth of the richest state, Haryana,
which stood at 122,660 rupees for the same year. The state has seen virtually no
industrial growth during the past decade. Though the share of secondary sector
in its total state income went up from 13.8 percent in 2003-06 to 21.2 percent in
2010-13, manufacturing remained nearly stagnant and grew merely by 0.2
percentage points, from 5.6 to 5.8 percent during the same period1.

Bihar is also the least urbanized region of India. Against the national average of
31 percent plus, Bihar had only 11 percent of its population living in urban
centres in 2011, only slightly higher than a decade ago when it was 10.5 percent.
While the urban population for the entire country grew by 3.4 percent during
this period, Bihar added only another 0.8 percent to its urban population.

The high density and growth rate of population also adds to its problems. Bihar
is the third most populous state of India, after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. In
2011, the total population of the state was more than a 100 million, with a
growth rate of 25.42 per cent for the previous decade. With more than 1100
persons living per square kilometer, Bihar is the most densely populated region
of the country, nearly three times more than the national average of 382 persons
per square kilometer.

However, Bihar is an important state of the Indian union. As a political region, it
has pioneered significant changes in the Indian democracy. The region has been
a site of social churnings, which have enabled the erstwhile “backward?
communities to rise politically, significantly transforming the regional power
structure and social profile of the local level political elite. These changes and
mobilizations have given birth to new aspirations for mobility and development
among those who, for long, had been on the margins of the society in Bihar. A

direct outcome of such a development has been the increase in out-migration
from the state for employment and education across sections and communities.
This ‘rise of the plebian’ has also produced a growing pressure on the political
and administrative establishment for delivery and accountability.

Over the past two decades or so, the state has seen some significant economic
changes. Even though a large proportion of its population continues to be
demographically rural, its dependence on agriculture has been declining. A good
proportion of rural incomes come from a variety of non-farm economic activities
and from remittances sent to their families by the migrant workers working in
different parts of the country. This is particularly true about the relatively
“backward? pockets of the state.

1.2: Non-farm Economy in Contemporary Bihar: As mentioned above,
even though Bihar continues to be among the poorest regions of the country, its
economy has been growing at a significantly faster pace, much faster than it did
during the first four or five decades after independence. Besides the growth of
roads and communication networks, the agricultural economy of Bihar has also
witnessed some growth, albeit concentrated only in some parts of the state. The
Economic Survey of 2013-14, published by the Government of Bihar claims, with
pride:

       During 1999-00 to 2005-06, the state income at constant prices grew at
       an annual rate of 5.7 percent. After that, the economy witnessed a
       turnaround and grew at an annual rate of 12.0 percent. It should be noted
       here that the rate of growth achieved by the economy during 2006-13 is
       not only much higher than what was achieved in previous period, but one
       of the highest among all the Indian states (page xx).

According to official sources, the state witnessed growth in all spheres of its
economy during the period 2006-13. Registered manufacturing grew at 18.2 per
cent, construction grew at 21.9 per cent, communication at 38.4 per cent, trade,
hotels and restaurants at 15.1 percent, and the banking and insurance sector
grew at 23.5 per cent. The agriculture sector also grew, though at a lower pace of
nearly 6 per cent (ibid).

In an economy where land-holdings are consistently getting smaller and the
proportion of rural population remains high, economic diversification and
growth of rural non-farm activities are being popularly viewed as a possible way
out. The opening lines of the Report of a study sponsored by the erstwhile
Planning Commission is a good example of this common-sense about the rural
non-farm sector:


                                        2
          …the agricultural sector is, by itself, incapable of creating additional
          opportunities of gainful employment in the wake of increasing
          population. As a result, the impetus for achieving sustained development
          in rural areas has to pivot around expanding the base of non-farm
          activities… it could provide the solution to the problems of rural areas
          such as poverty, unemployment and out-migration of the rural work
          force. The significance of the non-farm sector is even more pronounced in
          the agriculturally backward and low productivity regions… 2.

While this may indeed be the case, we still know very little about the dynamics of
non-farm economy, particularly its social and political dimensions. We also do
not know much about its diverse regional contexts and its possible links with
other patterns of change and impact on the larger economy.

1.3: Study and the Research Questions: Based on a field study of two large
settlements in North Bihar district of Madhubani, each with a population size of
more than ten thousand, and a significant engagement of the local workers in
non-farm economic activities, this paper tries to explore the social dynamics of
the “rural? non-farm economy by empirically examining the following:

      1. What is the range of non-farm occupations (and a broad mapping thereof)
         that have existed or evolved over time in the two “rural? settlements?

      2. How are these occupations organized and viewed socially in terms of
         their economic and social hierarchies and the differential incomes they
         provide and social status attached to them? Or, in other words, what
         kinds of dynamics of caste, community and gender operate within the
         social organization of the non-farm economy?

   country/world shape the local non-farm economy and are, in turn, shaped
   by it?

4. How do the changes in the local economy influence and are influenced by
   the local and regional structures of power and domination, including the
   administrative systems that influence (facilitate, encourage, obstruct) the
   growth of non-farm economy?

5. How do the old structures of exclusion, such as caste hierarchies or
   community-based divisions, operate in the rural non-farm economy? Do
   communities tend to monopolize the valued occupations? Are there
   practices of discrimination against specific social groups and/or
   categories in the rural non-farm economy?

2. Historical Context of the Changing Rural Economy of Bihar

2.1: Introduction: In the textbooks for India’s political economy, rural Bihar
has been best known for its backward “semi-feudal? agrarian social structure
where the system of production and distribution were built upon interlocking
land, credit and labour markets. The tenure holding upper classes of zamindars,
almost exclusively drawn from the local level upper castes, controlled the social,
political and economic life of the region. The upper middle castes, now known as
the OBCs, cultivated land but tended to work as non-occupancy tenants (raiyats)
and to a lesser extent, as traders and agricultural labourers. The lower middle
castes, currently called the Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs) were mostly
agricultural labourers and a smaller proportion worked as artisans and peasants.
The Dalits or the Scheduled Castes were generally landless and worked as
agricultural labourers. Thus, the system of ‘caste stratification of Bihar was
almost identical to that based on the interests in land’ (Sharma 2005: 962).

A survey of 36 villages conducted by Pradhan Prasad and his team in 1981-82
tells us about the continued dominance of such social and economic relations in
many pockets of rural Bihar even three decades after India’s independence. The
failure of legislative measures on matters of land ceiling and redistribution (the
Land Reforms initiated during the 1950s) coupled with lack of facilities for
irrigation had kept the agrarian economy “backward? and the traditional caste
hierarchies entrenched. Summarizing the core findings of their survey, Sharma
writes:

       …the vast majority of poor peasant households were ‘deficit’ ones, which
       forced them to take consumption loans from the land-owning class and
       which they were never able to return even in the long run, due to their
       being heavily in debt and deficit. This led to a system of informal bondage
       which assured the big land-owning class a number of benefits including
       availability of cheap labour, better terms for leasing out land, benefits
       obtained through distress sales and by acquiring poor peasants’ lands
       almost for nothing and the like (Sharma 2005: 963).

The 1981-82 survey also showed that until then the so-called forward castes
were still largely big peasants and landlords, while scheduled castes were mostly
agricultural labourers. The heterogeneous category of backward castes was
spread across class groupings but each subgroup tended to be concentrated in
one or more classes. Muslims were spread across the classes, with the largest
concentration (about half) being among non-attached agriculture labour. Thus
the interrelationship between caste and class was strong, but it was by no means
perfect. This was also true of the relationship between class and landownership.
One-third of the agricultural labourers were attached or bonded and the rest

                                         5
were in casual employment. The middle castes, particularly the three dominant
castes, the Yadav, Koeri and Kurmi, had begun to experience some upward social
mobility (Prasad et. al. 1988).

A research team from the Institute of Human Development (IHD) re-surveyed
the same 36 villages in 1999-2000 (Sharma 2005; Rodgers et. al. 2013). They
found that in most parts of the state, the “forward castes? were still big peasants
and landlords and the Scheduled Castes were mainly agricultural labourers. Even
for other castes, class configurations remained more or less the same.
Notwithstanding this broad picture, the agrarian structure and class composition
had undergone a significant change during the intervening period of around two
decades.

The upward mobility of the middle castes, particularly of the dominant ones,
towards higher classes in the hierarchy was clearly evident. The lower middle
castes (the EBCs) had also consolidated their position over the years and a good
number of them had risen to the rank of middle peasants. On the other hand, the
proportion of big peasants among upper castes had declined and their
proportions among the absentee landlords and non-agriculturists had increased.
A small number of them had also joined the ranks of agricultural labourers,
which did not appear in the earlier survey. The survey also found a significant
increase in the proportion of non-agriculturists in the study villages.

The period between the two surveys had also witnessed a drastic decline in the
proportion of attached labour, to less than 10 per cent of the total wage labour.
Thus, casualization of wage labour emerged as the contemporary dominant
trend. The percentage of casual workers to the total workforce had increased
from 34 per cent in 1981-82 to 52 per cent in 1999-2000, the increase being
mainly at the cost of self-employed and attached labour in agriculture. The
casualization of workers had been the most significant among lower and middle
level caste groups (the EBCs). This was a clear indication of declining structures
of the traditional caste-centric patron-client relations and of “semi-feudal?
dependencies.

The IHD team surveyed the same 36 villages once again after a gap of 10 years, in
2009. The pace of change had accelerated and by this time the attached labour
had nearly completely disappeared from the rural landscape of Bihar (Datta et.
al. 2012). These changes also induced out-migration, which in turn increased
local wage rates and initiated other realignments in the local economy, polity
and social relations, including an extensive growth of non-farm economy and
employment. We return to a discussion of these changes in greater detail in the
later sections of this paper, after a broad overview of the existing literature on
the rural non-farm economy in India and Bihar.

2.2: Broad trends in the non-farm economy of India: Over the past
decades, the contribution of agricultural sector to India’s aggregate income has
been declining quite rapidly. It declined nearly by 10 decimal points during
1999-2000 (23.2 percent) and 2012-13 (less than 14 per cent). However, in
terms of employment, the agrarian sector continues to be huge. According to
official data, a little less than half of the working Indians are still employed in
agriculture and allied activities. The move away from agricultural employment
seems to have picked-up only in the recent past. Agriculture employed as many
as 59.9 percent of the main workers in 1999-2000. During the next five years
(2004-05) their numbers came down only by 1 percent to 58.5 percent.
However, during the next 7 years, it declined quite significantly, by around 10
decimal points, to 48.9 percent3.

Given that the aggregate employment in the organized sector is not showing any
significant growth, the move away from agriculture is mostly towards the non-
farm informal economy, either locally in the rural setting or outside, in sectors
like construction and infrastructure. Unfortunately, the rural non-farm sector
has remained under-studied, primarily due to the nature of its classification.
Defined residually, non-farm activities are broadly understood as all activities
other than land-based agriculture. It therefore constitutes a diverse range of
activities. According to Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001: 1), ‘a common view is that
rural off-farm employment is a low productivity sector producing low quality
goods, expected to wither away as a country develops and incomes rise’, as a
result of which it hasn’t received adequate attention both conceptually and
administratively. Given the method of enumerating primary economic activity by
number of labour hours involved, ‘it will be an underestimate of the actual
percentage of labor hours which are devoted to non-farm activities’ (Lanjouw
and Lanjouw 2001: 3; Wiggins and Hazell 2011). However, despite the
methodological and conceptual challenges, several scholars have attempted to
understand the nature, scope and growth patterns of the non-farm sector in
India.

2.3: Literature on Non-farm Economy: Historically, non-farm economic
activities have been an integral part of the rural economy, even if not
significantly. Village studies in the past have accounted for the presence of non-
farm employment in their region of study, whether it is Epstein’s (1973) study of
two villages in Mysore district in the south of India, reporting on the movement
of entrepreneurs to the tertiary sector or that of Srinivas (1976) noting the
investment in bus lines in a village in Mysore along with similar reportage from
Wiser and Wiser (1971) and Saith and Tankha (1992).

                                                7
Traditional non-farm activities, as Wiggins and Hazell (2011: 8) suggest,
‘particularly labour- intensive household manufacturing of baskets, pottery and
roof thatching, die out, displaced by the import of cheap plastic pails, iron pots
and corrugated roofing’. Some of such categories of rural non-farm activity,
according to Bhalla (1997) have thrived in the past because of protection from
outside competition by restrictive production policies (such as reserved
handicraft industries in India) but with the removal of such barriers in the wake
of liberalization, such rural non-farm employment may have faced a loss of jobs
and activities until new forms of activity emerge as they did in India in the 1990s
(Bhalla 1997).

However, the expansion of the non-farm sector since the 1980s wasn’t observed
as being significant (Acharya and Mitra 2000), except in the state of Kerala.
Bhalla (1993) states that between 1961 and 1981, states where non-farm
employment expanded were Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka,
Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, besides a modest expansion in Karnataka,
Maharashtra, Orissa and West Bengal (Chadha 1997). According to Bhalla’s
analysis, undertaken through diversification of the indices at the district level,
three kinds of regions could be classified during this period: (i) Bihar with
symptoms of agricultural involution, (ii) high farm productivity districts of
Punjab and coastal Andhra Pradesh which displayed increasing concentration in
agriculture and (iii) a large block of highly diversified districts, clustered around
industrial towns, or forming long geographical corridors, linking large urban
conglomerations (Bhalla 1993, 1997).

The existing literature also points to the crucial links between the rural farm and
non-farm sector especially in the wake of emergent ‘production, consumption
and potential linkages’ due to the income effect of the green revolution
technologies (see also Hazell and Haggblade, 1991; Bell, Hazell and Slade 1982;
Hazell and Ramasamy 1991; Wiggins and Hazell 2011). Similarly Vaidyanathan
(1983) argues that non-farm employment emerges as a response to (i)
agriculture being unable to provide adequate employment as well as to (ii) a
situation of higher farm incomes. Vyas and Mathai (1978) clearly state that non-
farm economic activities are crucial supplementary sources of income for ‘more
than half of the agricultural households in India’ whose ‘cash income from
farming is inconsequential’ (Vyas and Mathai 1978: 335). Thus, the expansion of
non-farm economic activities is not entirely a function of either residual or
distress activities in the rural economy but may also be a case of diversification
within the rural economy.

According to Himanshu et. al. (2011), the non-farm sector in rural India has
grown steadily during the past 30 years, with some acceleration during the late

                                          8
1990s to the mid-2000s followed by a leveling off after 2004-05. Kumar et. al.
(2011) also demonstrate that the non-farm sector has consistently grown over
time and employed nearly one-third of the rural workforce in 2009-10, as
compared to merely one-fifth in 1983 at all-India level.

Even though non-farm employment grew faster than agricultural employment, it
was not accompanied by decline in the agricultural workforce in absolute terms
until 2004-05 when the non-farm sector not only absorbed the new entrants to
labour force, it was also accompanied by decline of workforce in the agricultural
sector (Himanshu 2014). Both the nature of such diversification and the regions
across which such transformations have occurred since 2004-05 lend
themselves to an interesting analysis as (i) it is driven by casual employment in a
few sectors such as construction and transport and communication and (ii)
poorer states have now become the new drivers of non-farm employment
diversification unlike the previous two decades when it was driven by the rich
and industrialized states (Himanshu 2014). For example, the growth of non-farm
employment 2004-05 to 2012 has been higher than the national average for
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and
Jharkhand, which have traditionally been states with low agricultural
productivity and high poverty in rural areas as compared to the lower growth
rate of non-farm employment in traditionally better-off states of Tamil Nadu,
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Kerala.

Village level studies in Tamil Nadu (Lindberg 2012; Hariss and Jeyaranjan 2014;
Heyer 2013), Gujarat (Breman 2015), Punjab and Haryana (Singh and Bhogal
2014; Vatta and Siddhu 2007; Vatta and Garg 2008; Jodhka 2014), Uttar Pradesh
(Himanshu et. al. 2015; Srivastava 2015), Bihar (Rodgers et. al. 2014; Jha and
52014) and in Andhra Pradesh (Rawal et. al. 2008) point to the increasing
importance of the non-farm sector in rural economies, even if varying in degree.
As Himanshu (2014) suggests, these studies also highlight some general
commonalities: the declining role of agriculture, increase in self-employed and
casual work rather than regular employment, benefit of the expansion in non-
farm activities to vulnerable groups within the village and the importance of
infrastructure for commuting to nearby urban areas for non-farm work.

What is also distinct about the growth of non-farm employment in the period
after 2004-05 is the reduced agricultural distress in India due to an increase in
the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for some crops, betterment of terms of trade
in favour of agriculture, higher public spending in the rural economy including
the MGNREGA, and increased resources in the form of social protection
measures that minimized the impact of external shocks to the rural economy
(Himanshu 2014). However, most of the growth in the non-farm sector is not
only concentrated in few activities but has also been dominated by construction

                                        9
and transport, constituting 92 per cent of all the new jobs created in the non-
farm sector between 2004-05 and 2011-12, with manufacturing actually
declining as share of total rural non-farm employment. Himanshu (2014) also
contends that most of the increase in non-farm employment has been in the
nature of casual employment, in the absence of agricultural employment
opportunities and ‘was in all probability residual in nature’.

Increased public expenditure in the rural areas is seen as another reasons for
expansion in the growth of rural non-farm activities in India, particularly on
items such as electricity, roads, education and health (Fan, Hazell and Thorat
2000). According to Bhalla (1997) after several decades of agriculture-led
growth, India’s urban economic growth stimulated corridors of rural non-farm
development along major highways and transport routes. Papola (1992)
highlights the role of small towns in the rural hinterland in the employment of
rural workers and in promoting non-farm employment in rural areas. Chattaraj
(2010) in her analysis of ‘roadscapes’ focuses on informal industry and everyday
life along a highway, the National Highway 117, which links rural and urban
spaces, and in doing so highlights how ‘new forms of previously city-based work
have spread along highways, and rural spaces are urbanizing in-situ as villagers
increasingly shift away from agriculture towards consumer cultures’.

2.4: Social and Economic Change and the Demographics of Rural-
Urban: Considering that there is a socio-spatial equivalence of agriculture with
‘rural’ and concomitantly the village in the institutionalized system of
demographic classification in India, it raises pertinent questions about potential
transformations in the rural sphere in line with transformations in agriculture
and related activities. What also needs to be relooked at are the classifications of
what constitutes the urban and the rural according to the state’s system of
demographic classification. This has implications for not only how settlements
are recognized but also for the delivery of planning and governance in these
areas which may otherwise be out of sync.

Therefore, it is equally significant to address the socio-spatiality of what are
popularly known as ‘small towns’ whether census or statutory. In the context of
India, where “urban? is often specifically defined while “rural? is treated simply
as a residual category (Bhagat 2005), it is also important to ‘examine the criteria
and limitations of the rural-urban classification followed by the Census, its
congruence with the dynamics of state-accorded municipal/non- municipal
status and some implications for municipal governance in India’ (Bhagat 2005:
61). According to Bell and Jayane (2006) ‘there is a growing awareness that cities
further down the urban hierarchy have as much to tell us about contemporary
urban change’, necessitating a need for alternative practices or ways of doing


                                         10
urban and regional research that go beyond ‘metrocentricity’ (Bunnell and
Maringati 2010).

For example, the ‘geopolis approach’ (Eric and Marius-gnanou 2011) and the
‘agglomeration index’ (Uchida and Andrew 2010) rework the existing
classification of ‘urban’. The geopolis approach identifies as ‘urban’ all physical
agglomerates, no matter where, with at least 10,000 inhabitants along with a
study of the morphological profiles of individual agglomerates. According to the
results thrown up the application of such an approach, there is a greater spread
of the country’s metro and secondary cities than had been believed up to now,
which is far from a dual model of modern versus traditional, urban versus rural,
metro city versus small town (Eric and Marius-gnanou 2011).

Such an understanding is conceptualized by Denis et. al. (2012: 52) through
‘subaltern urbanization’ i.e. ‘the growth of settlement agglomerations, whether
denoted urban by the Census of India or not, that are independent of the
metropolis and autonomous in their interactions with other settlements, local
and global’. This point is further reinforced and extended by studies like Raman
(2014), which highlights that the role of the town’s entrepreneurs, local
landowners, and politics have been significant factors in shaping the evolution
and development of its economy. Similarly Jodhka (2014) during his revisit to
two villages in Haryana after twenty years found a significant socio-economic
transformations in the internal structure (caste and class relations) of the
agrarian economy; the nature of relationships of villages with the neighboring
urban settlements in terms of employment and aspirations; and in the emerging
nature of power relations in local political institutions’ (Jodhka 2014: 5).

Through their study of Mandi, Gobindgarh in Punjab, Kundu and Bhatia (2002: 8)
also suggest that ‘a number of small and medium towns in India have shown high
economic growth in recent years, despite their receiving no support from public
agencies. It considers socio-cultural factors as extremely important in the
development of small and medium towns, even when the market economy plays
the dominant role in determining the spatial structure of development’. Another
approach that has been used to understand such a phenomenon is that of peri-
urbanisation - ‘‘mixed spaces’’, midway between urban centres and rural spaces
– transitory spaces subject to rapid and multiple transformations (Dupont 2007).
Whether it is subaltern urbanization, in situ urbanization or peri-urbanization,
urban consumption growth contributes to growth in the rural non-farm
economy (Lanjouw and Murgai 2010).

2.5: Trends in the non-farm economy of Bihar: As mentioned above, Bihar
is among the poorest states in India. Its economy is predominantly agrarian with
low agricultural productivity and it has a relatively small manufacturing base.
However, as mentioned above (see section 1.1), over the past decades or so, the
growth rate of Bihar has picked up and many sectors of its economy have been
growing at a greater pace than the country as a whole. Reporting from the
findings of their studies carried out over the past three decades, Rogers et al
argue that the high growth rate of Bihar4 since 2011-12 could be attributed to
the significant expansion of primarily two sectors, (i) transport and
communication, and (ii) trade and construction. The core primary sector and the
secondary sector have shown very little growth in comparison to the (non-farm)
service sector. For instance, in the period between 2008-11, the contribution of
construction, and trade, hotels and restaurants to the GSDP moved to 10.1
percent and 29.3 percent from 3.8 percent and 16.8 percent respectively, having
surpassed the contribution of agriculture (Rodgers et al 2013).

Himanshu (2014) too suggests that ‘the spectacular increase’ in non-farm
employment in Bihar coincides with a high spending on rural roads construction
programmes undertaken by the state government as part of the Prime Minister
Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). Named after the Chief Minister, the state
government also initiated a similar programme of road building. In 2012-13,
Bihar with 174.88 km of road length per lakh population lagged much behind the
all-India (387.53 km) average as before but in terms of road length per 100
sq.km, it by-passed all-India (142.67 km) with a record achievement of 192.78
km and recorded a big jump by over 73 km over the previous year as against
only 15 km at all-India level.

Investments on building roads and expansion of transport and communication
infrastructure have also changed the village-town relationship, increasing the
possibilities of outmigration of the young male population. Datta (2014) in her
longitudinal study of migration from the village of Mahisham in Madhubani
district states that migration through ‘intermediaries and contractors to work in
agriculture have shifted to current rural-urban migration through private
individual contacts and network’ enabled particularly by ‘progress in
communications such as easier transport and widespread use of mobile phones
have changed the context of migration from source areas’.

Another study of migration from Bihar (Deshkingar et. al. 2006) reveals that
Madhubani has the highest rate of out-migration and it appears to have
increased significantly after the flooding and droughts of 1987 due to ‘poor
yields in farming and reduced job opportunities locally’ and ‘over time the

4   Bihar’s economy grew at 11.4 percent as compared to the national average of 8.2 percent.

                                                   12
proportion of non-farm labourers in the poorest quintile has increased and the
proportion of farm workers decreased’ (Deshkingar et. al. 2006: 12). The district
also witnessed closure of 18 sugar mills around the same time. As a consequence,
nearly 70 percent of the households had one to four male members of the family
working outside.

2.6: Beyond Agriculture: Diversification and Migration: The growth of
the non-farm economy has corollaries for social transformations at the level of
the individual, the household and the community. Even those who report or
remain primarily employed in agriculture tend to diversify through becoming
‘pluri-active’, where members of a household are engaged in different kinds of
occupations (Jodhka 2014: 5). Such diversification is undertaken due to a
combination of factors including seasonality in agricultural activities, reduction
of risks and imperfect labour markets among others (Wiggins and Hazell 2011).
According to Sharma and Bhaduri (2009) there is a ‘tipping point’ of the
transition in its agriculture-dependent population that India is witnessing as a
large proportion of the youth in the countryside are trying to severe their links
from farming, which is evident even in villages farther removed from towns.

However, moving out of agriculture is constrained by the nature of resources one
possesses – economic, social and cultural. While education, particularly a college
degree, ‘drastically increases the chances of long term migration’ (Rodgers et. al.
2013: 97), it may not always be the case. The number of desirable jobs in the
towns is limited and the educated rural young men are often confronted with the
prospect of being “all dressed up with nowhere to go? (Deuchar 2014) or just
engage in ‘time-pass’ (Jeffery 2010). Since the 1980s economic change has
typically failed to accelerate the generation of white-collar jobs within the
manufacturing and services sectors, which has created a crisis of educated
unemployment.

Migration towards the lower level of income and employment is relatively easier
and that is an important mode of diversifying the source of income for rural
households. Many of those who are not able to find employment locally, or find
their farms unviable, tend to go out to work, often to far off places, rural and
urban. Migration to an urban centre for work almost always implies moving out
of the agricultural economy. Even when a labourer migrates to rural Punjab for
agricultural work, he rarely works on land as tenant farmer. Further, once used
to migration, he easily moves between other forms of employment, in the village
and in town, at the site of destination.

Out-migration also has the potential for inducing other forms of non-farm
employment at the site of origin. Remittances induce a new form of consumer
behavior, creating a demand for consumer goods by migrant households, which

                                        13
could result in the growth of markets. Similarly, the surplus income generated
from working outside is often invested in construction and renovation of houses,
generating a further demand for non-farm activities.

According to Rodgers et. al. (2013), the NSSO data reveals that the rate of out-
migration from Bihar is the highest among major states in the country, at 31 per
1000 population. According to the IHD Bihar Survey 2009-10, on an average 18
per cent of the total population from Bihar migrates out. The levels of
outmigration are higher for the backward districts of North Bihar such as
Madhubani, Purnia and Araria than the better off districts of South Bihar like
Rohtas and Gaya. An overwhelming majority (73 per cent) of these migrant
workers are in the age group of 15-35 years. Deshkingar et. al. (2006) also report
that ‘young people are now consciously opting to migrate to explore other areas
and in the case of lower castes to break away from caste oppression in the
village’. Migration is hence also a strategic decision in case of the young and the
vulnerable groups who chose to move out of the rural agricultural economy.
Remittances that come back to the family left-behind generate its own dynamics
of development (Sharma 2005).

Another study by Dayal and Karan (2004 as cited by Deshingkar et. al. 2006)
covering 36 villages across six districts (Nalanda, Rohtas, Gopalganj, Gaya,
Madhubani and Purnia) in the north and central Bihar demonstrates that
approximately 12 per cent of males in the sample households were seasonal
migrants and 9 per cent permanent migrants. They also found the intensity of
migration to be the greatest in Madhubani district where 25 per cent of the
sample households reported at least one member of their family having out-
migrated.

While we have a good amount of literature on the broad trends emerging in the
non-farm rural economy and employment, mostly based on large data sets of
surveys carried out by economists, we know very little about the qualitative
aspects of the economic changes taking place in rural economy of different
regions and sub-regions of India.

3. The Fieldwork: Imagining the ‘rural’ is more than often synonymous with
imagining what is ‘agricultural’. Evoking ‘rural’ in Bihar is further attached with
attributes of poverty, underdevelopment and backwardness given the
performance of Bihar along economic and social indices. The ubiquitous
resonance of rural Bihar is therefore framed by a classic imagination of not just a
village but a backward village. Moving through the landscape of ‘rural’ Bihar,
however, conveyed to us a complex, and often contradictory social and spatial
reality.

If one were to travel from Patna towards Madhubani, a journey of around 200
kilometers by road, one can obtain a glimpse of everyday life in urban centers
and of the countryside sprawled in between them. State operated and private
buses as well as private taxis ply with a convenient frequency between Patna and
Madhubani. Madhubani is also well connected with urban centers like
Darbangha, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Hajipur among others both by road and by
rail. The taxi ride from Patna to Madhubani takes an average of 4 to 5 hours.
Situated in the northeast of Bihar, Madhubani is also connected by rail link to the
national capital and some other major cities of the country. The Census Town of
Satghara also has a rail link and a train station (Rajnagar). Madhubani is widely
known for its folk paintings, named after the region. Located close to the Nepal
border, the town is also popularly viewed as capital of the Mithila cultural region.

On the road stretch between Patna and Madhubani, the journey moves from one
cluster of markets and commercial activities to another, with contiguous
settlements at every ten to twelve kilometers. Sown agricultural land flanks the
road in between these commercial centers. A glimpse on the move reveals
brightly coloured and neon lit signboards for mobile shops, coaching and tuition
centers, grocery retail outlets accompanied by the hustle of cycle rickshaws, fruit
and vegetable vendors, auto-rickshaws and motorcycles. As one encounters
these recurring sights, it soon becomes difficult to distinguish where the ‘urban’
ends and ‘rural’ begins.

The arrival into Madhubani town is marked by heavy and unorganized
automobile traffic – buses, taxis, auto-rickshaws and motorcycles that crisscross
the market centre. Centered around the Madhubani railway station, movement
of people and vehicles radiates in all directions. Madhubani town houses the
district headquarters for the district of Madhubani and hence invites people from
surrounding villages and settlements for all public errands – a visit to the
hospital, to the RTO, students going to study in the colleges.

3.1: Field-sites: Given its popular image of being a backward state coupled
with interesting trends in the growth of non-farm activities, we decided to locate
our study in the state of Bihar and in a district that has large (populous)
settlements but a low urban population. By that criterion, Madhubani appeared
to be an interesting case for such a study. On the scale of urbanization, with only
6 percent of its total population being urban, Madhubani is officially ranked 36th
out of the total 38 districts of the state. The district is also known for its
relatively high levels of outmigration (see Rogers et. al. 2013), which provided us
with the opportunity of understanding the link between migration and the
growth of non-farm economic activity in a region with relatively backward
agriculture.

The selection of the sites was purposive and was guided by objectives of the
study. We decided to carry out the fieldwork at two sites. First, we looked for a
settlement that is still officially listed as ‘rural’ but has substantially changed,
both in terms of size (10,000 plus population) and the dominant mode of
employment (75 percent plus non-farm employment for the “male workers?),
which therefore classifies it as a Census Town (CT). For the second settlement,
we sought a relatively large village, which is visibly rural, with a similar
population size and where the process of change is evident, with around one-
third of the male workers employed in non-farm activity.

The idea was not to compare a Census Town with a rural settlement but to
capture the possible diversities that the growth of non-farm economy may
possess and try to answer questions such as: does the growth of non-farm
economy indeed produce an impetus for urbanization of a “subaltern? kind (see
Denis et al 2012)? Does it acquire the potential of transforming the region into a
modern social and economic formation? Is the social profile of those in non-farm
economy in the Census Town any different from those in the “rural? settlement?

After preliminary visits, we chose two large settlements for the fieldwork: (i) the
Satghara panchayat, which comprises of two contiguous revenue villages
(Satghara and Mirzapur) and (ii) Bhagwatipur, a village panchayat and a large
settlement made of four contiguous revenue villages (Bhagwatipur,
Bhagwatipur- Inamat, Nahar and Baluha). In order to capture social diversities of
the local communities and their involvement with the non-farm economy we
also interviewed respondents who technically lived in the neighboring
contiguous localities but actively interacted with economic life of the two
settlements.

Marked by intermittent clusters of shops and local markets (haat), with fields
and habitation in between, the stretch of road is busy during the daytime. In


                                          16
terms of how they are configured however, Bhagwatipur and Satghara represent
differences in the scale and density of activities and settlements.

 Both these settlements are located at a distance of around 12 to 13 kilometers
from the district headquarter of Madhubani. Of the two panchayats, Satghara
(block: Rajnagar) was declared a Census Town (CT) in the 2011 Census with
more than 75 percent of its male workers engaged in non-farm economic
activities. As per the decadal Census, its total population is 10,347 of which 481
or 4.64 percent are the Scheduled Castes.

With a share of a little above 32 percent of its male workers employed in non-
farm activities, Bhagwatipur panchayat represents a more typical rural
settlement. It has a population of 11,181 (2011 Census) with SC population of
814 (7. 28 per cent). The total number of households in each of the two
settlements is approximately 2000.

       Satghara




       Bhagwatipur




Satghara is located in Rajnagar block of the Madhubani district. It is also the
headquarters of the block with all its administrative offices located there. The
residents and those from the neighboring towns and villages also identify the

                                        17
settlement as a twin of Rajnagar and hence the popular us of the combination
Rajnagar-Satghara. Even though there is no settlement by the name of Rajnagar,
the local train station is called Rajnagar. Satghara also has a fort of the former
king of Darbhanga.

The scale of the market and the number of shops have seen a significant increase
over the past two decades with road network improving. Villagers from the
neighboring rural settlements regularly visit the local markets to buy a wide
variety of things, ranging from seeds and fertilizer bags to groceries and jewelry.
Satghara also has a settlement (Mahapatra tola) where the local women make
the famous Madhubani paintings.

Bhagwatipur is in Pandaul block of Madhubani district and is located on the
road from Madhubani to Jhanjharpur. Though the pucca road is quite active,
frequency of bus service is rather limited. However, besides private vehicle,
Bhagwatipur a large number of shared auto-rickshaws ply on the road
connecting the settlement with Madhubani town and other neighboring
settlements. Its nearest railway satiation is Madhubani. As is indicated above, the
market area in Bhagwatipur is much smaller than Satghara and it is mostly
spread along the main road.

Bhagwatipur has 4 government schools (high school 1, middle school 1, upper
primary 2) and 4 private schools. It has a branch of the State Bank of India with
an ATM, which, like Satghara, mostly remained ‘out of order’. Some of the local
residents also access banks in the neighboring settlement of Rampatti, located at
a distance of around 5 kilometers.

3.2: Data Collection: The fieldwork was conducted over a period of four
months. It began with an exploratory visit during the last week of August 2014 to
the districts of Patna, Samastipur, Darbhanga and Madhubani5. After preparing
the tools for research, which consisted of (i) a settlement schedule (Appendix 5),
(ii) a schedule for the survey of non-farm enterprises (Appendix 6) and (iii)
interview guides for qualitative interviews, we proceeded with a pilot visit for a
week during the second half of October 2014. The final phase of intensive
fieldwork was completed over a period of five weeks during the months of
November and December 2014 with two researchers staying in the field through
the entire period of fieldwork. In addition, a woman researcher and the principal
researcher also joined the fieldwork for around two weeks.

During the initial phase of the study we collected data on a wide range of
subjects through random interviews and a settlement schedule. This enabled us

5   This visit was in company of Partha Mukhopadhya of the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi

                                                 18
to map the settlements, their social demography, the range of economic activities
and their social and economic dynamics, patterns of migrations and the local/
regional level political dynamics, which have had significant implications for the
local economy, including the growth of non-farm economic activities. We
prepared a comprehensive list of non-farm activities covering the entire
universe of such economic activities in the two settlements (see Appendix 1).
This phase of the research also helped us to identify key informants and resource
persons for further research. In the second phase we undertook a purposive
survey of the non-farm economic activities.

This was followed by focused interviews with a wide range of relevant
respondents and group discussions. Simultaneously, we surveyed respondents
engaged in a wide range of economic activities. We filled-in a total of 300
schedules. The survey provides a robust and useful database on the social and
economic dynamics of non-farm activities in the two settings. Finally, we
conducted and compiled case studies for a better qualitative understanding of
the subject.

The purposive surveys of 300 non-farm activities/ respondents covered 189
respondents from Satghara and the remaining 111 from Bhagwatipur.
Respondents were selected randomly in the market area with a concentration of
shop clusters. We also make conscious attempt was to represent respondents,
engaged in a wide range of non-farm activities from traditional caste based
occupations as well as new occupations. Most of the workers engaged in non-
farm activity are relatively young. Those below the age 30 years make for 31
percent of the total respondents. Only 24 percent of them are above the age of 45
(see Table 2). All the respondents were classified among different caste
categories as Traditional Upper caste (12 %), Trading castes (20.7%), Other
OBCs (29.7%), SCs (16.7%), all of which were Hindus by religious background
(79 %). The remaining respondents were Muslim (21%) by religion.

3.3: Operationalizing ‘Non-farm’ Activity: For the purpose of this study, we
treated all those economic activities that did not involve direct employment in
agriculture, i.e. cultivation of land, as ‘non-farm’. We are aware of the significance
of pluri-activities, viz. a person or household involved in more than one
economic activity, including cultivation of land. In such cases, the dominant
activity, providing the highest income has been treated as the main activity.
Economic diversification appears to be an emerging feature not only for the
settlements, but also for the households and for individual workers.




                                         20
4. Changing Social Profile of the Settlements

4.1: Castes and Communities: As is the case with most rural settlements in
India, the households across both the settlements are divided into a wide range
of caste groups and communities (see Appendices 1 and 2; Table 3). In Bihar,
the caste groups are administratively classified into five categories – first, the
general category, belonging to the Hindu upper castes (Rajputs, Brahmins,
Bhumihars and Kayasthas). These upper castes have traditionally been big
landowners and part of the ruling establishments. They are spread across the
state but each sub-region typically has one or two of these present prominently.
The Brahmins and a few Rajputs have mostly been the big landowners in the
district of Madhubani.

In the second rung of the hierarchy are the “backward? castes, who are further
divided (officially) into two categories, the forward-Backwards or the OBC-II and
the extremely backward classes (EBCs) or the OBC-I. Situated within the social
hierarchy and according to the level of development, they are followed by two
categories of the SCs, the Dalits and the Maha-Dalits. These categories closely
mirror the traditional hierarchies and they have also come to be used in local
and state level development practices. While the categories of OBC and SC are
also used at the national level, their sub-classification has evolved locally, at the
state level, over the past two decades. The sub-communities within these
categories and their ranks in the local social hierarchy at the field sites are as
follows:

   1. Upper Castes: Brahmins, Rajputs, Kayastha.
   2. Backward Classes (OBC-II): Teli, Suri, Gupta, Sonar, Yadav, Kurmi,
      Kalwar
   3. Extremely Backward Classes or EBCs (OBC-I): Lehri, Halwai, Nai-
      Hazam, Badhai-Carpenter, Badai-Pan leaf grower, Mallah, Dhanuk-
      Mandal, Kumhar-Potters.
   4. Dalits (SC): Paswan
   5. Maha- Dalits (SC): Dom, Chaupal, Musahar Pasi, Dhobi and
      Mochi/Chamar.

Altogether, the categories of OBCs and SCs have many communities listed in
Bihar but not all of them live in these villages. Bihar has 131 communities listed
as OBCs and they make for around 65 per cent of the total state population.
Similarly, the state has a total of 22 communities listed as Scheduled Castes who
make for around 15 percent of its total population. Of these 21 (with the
exception of Paswan) are listed as Maha-Dalits, for whom the state government
has designed special development provisions.


                                         21
The two settlements also have a substantial Muslim population. Much like the
other categories, Muslims too are internally divided and differentiated, including
on caste lines. A substantial proportion of them are also included in the OBC list.

Caste based communities mostly live in their own localities, known as tolas or
paras. The tolas are also named after the titles of the community. While some
localities do have a mixed-caste inhabitant population, they are few. This was
particularly the case with Dalit and Muslim localities. Even among Dalit localities,
caste differences were quite visible. For example, the Paswan tola would have
almost only Paswans and the Mallah tolas, only Mallahs. These caste/community
tolas also reflect the level of economic well being of the social category. We did
not see any “secular? locality in any of the two settlements (for details see
Appendix 3).

For operational purposes and data analysis on a subject like non-farm activity,
we divide the available communities into five categories: the traditional Hindu

                                        22
upper castes, the trading castes (most of whom are listed in the OBC-II category),
other OBCs, Scheduled Castes and the Muslims. Wherever required, we have also
used women as a separate category of analysis.

4.2: Agriculture and Its Social Framework in the two Settlements: As
discussed above (2.1), the agrarian landscape of Madhubani district has been
marked by a kind of “backwardness?, which is both economic and social. Even
though the quality of land in the region is not very poor, frequent floods,
droughts and a lack of reliable irrigation has made it difficult for the local
cultivators to grow much more than their subsistence requirements. We also did
not find any effective or visible sign of state investments in agricultural
development. Even though rivers flow from and through the region, there are no
canals bringing water to the farms of these villages. Some farmers have bore-
wells but the supply of electricity is very erratic, which makes the pumping of
water quite expensive while using pump sets run on diesel by individual farmers.
Farmers in both the settlements complained for not having the benefit of state
subsidies for agriculture.

The region has also been known for its absentee but landlords, who not only
controlled most of the agricultural lands but also bonded labouring hands
through traditional structures of patronage and dependence, often mediated
through ties of debt and the normative frames of caste hierarchy, which included
the local king of Darbhanga. In the absence of effective implementation of Land
Reform legislations, holding structures remained very skewed even after
independence. The Brahmins and other upper castes, including some members
of the trading castes (currently listed as OBCs) owned most of the land. Satghara,
for example, had 4 big landlords, who controlled most the local land.
Bhagwatipur was also not very different. Those belonging to the so-called
backward castes worked as tenant cultivators, almost completely dependent
upon their patriarchs. The situation in our study sites would not have been very
different from the duration for which Rogers and Rogers write for their study
villages in Purnia district:

       In the 1970s and early 1980s, these villages were backward and stagnant,
       and poverty was intense. Wages barely sufficed to cover basic subsistence,
       and real incomes were if anything declining. Mortality was high and
       production relations “semi- feudal?, in the sense that debt bondage,
       tenancy and attached labour were widespread, served as mechanisms of
       labour control and exploitation, and were resistant to change.
       Communications were poor, facilities limited, education levels low. The
       government action was extremely weak (Rogers and Rogers 2011:43).



                                       23
However, given that the quality of land was not bad, a wide range of crops could
be grown. They ranged from sugarcane, paddy, wheat and lentils to potatoes and
a variety of vegetables. The region also has rivers and ponds, which provide
useful avenues for fishing, a traditional source of employment for members of
the Mallah community. Other caste communities located lower down in the
traditional hierarchy similarly had specialized occupations functionally tied to
the demands of the powerful patriarchs of the local village communities. Many of
them would have also been a source of labour power in the fields and tied to
their “patrons? within the normative frames of the caste system.

As in most rural settlements, keeping cattle for milk and ploughing has been a
popular practice in these villages. However, over the past two decades, the
villages have seen an increasing use of machines for cultivation of land. Given the
small and marginal size of most holdings, it is hard for individual farmers to
afford tractors, thrashers and other machines. However, both settlements have a
number of entrepreneurs who keep such machines and lease them out to small
cultivators, after they compete work on their own farms. Some could even be
keeping these machines purely for the commercial purpose of renting them out.
In Bhagwatipur, a Suri trader had two or three tractors and almost all other
machines used for cultivation, which he commercially leased out to local
cultivators and often to cultivators in neighboring villages. One or two
cultivators in each of the settlements also owned small-size tractors for their
exclusive use.

Some farmer did keep cattle for ploughing. However, many more kept cows and
buffaloes for milk. Most of them seemed to be using milk for the consumption of
their families. Some also sold it in the local market, to individual consumers and
to shops. However, keeping cattle for milk as a source of additional income is not
popular. There is no collection point of the state milk cooperative anywhere in
the two settlements. Nor did find any private trader collecting milk from these
villages.

The growing pressures of expanding national economy and fissures produced by
the democratic political process of the first three decades of India’s
independence created conditions for a gradual change in Bihar economy.
According to Rogers and Rogers, the “trigger of change? came sometime in 1970s
in the form of short-term migration to northwestern states of Punjab and
Haryana where the Green Revolution created demand for additional labour,
particularly during the peak seasons. This began to undermine,

       …feudal relationships, creating new perspectives, generating additional
       income sources and pushing up local wages (ibid: 44).


                                        24
Outmigration from the rural settlements of Bihar continued to grow over the
years. Writing on four decades of change in Mahisham village of Madhubani
district, on the basis of available data, Amrita Datta shows that by 1980-81, as
many 24 percent of the households had at least one migrant member in their
family. They went as far as Punjab and Calcutta in search of work. By 1999, this
had gone up to 54 per cent and in 2011 the village had 78 percent of its
households with a migrant member working outside. As she rightly argues:

       Outmigration for work has become a village norm. A key characteristic of
       migration is the predominance of youth in migration streams; about half
       of all male migrants were in the 15-30 years age group (Datta 2014:4).

Patterns and destinations of migration have changed over the years. It is no
longer short-term seasonal migration. The workers come and go through the
year. However, most migrations for work remain circular. Those who go out for
work leave their families behind in the village. They tend to come back, once or
twice during their active work life and return back to the village when they find
it hard to carry on with the life of a migrant worker outsider, generally when
they are 45 or 50 years of age (We will return to the subject of migration in a
following section).

In both the settlements, the significance and presence of agriculture had visibly
declined. Currently, Satghara and its sister settlement have a total of nearly 1600
acres of land. With a growing non-farm economy, only around 25 percent of the
total land is under cultivation. Bhagwatipur and its sister settlements however
demonstrate a different pattern. Given that the non-farm economy has not grown
in Bhagwatipur like it has in Satghara, nearly 70 percent of its land is still under
cultivation. Even though some of the land is still owned by upper castes, very few
of them work as cultivating farmers. In the case of Bhagwatipur more than half of
all the agricultural land is owned by the OBC trading caste of Suris. However,
most of them lease out their lands to small cultivators, mostly from EBC
communities. Cropping patterns have remained mostly unchanged except for a
significant decline in the cultivation of sugarcane, largely because of shutting
down of local sugar mills.

4.3: Decline of the “Semi-Feudal? Patriarch: The growing number of men,
from the erstwhile traditionally dependent communities, migrating out of the
village for work has brought about many changes in the social and political life of
the rural settlements. Along with out-migration from the rural areas, the region
has simultaneously experienced political assertions from “below?, initially led by
different shades of communist parties, and later, in the 1980s and 1990s, by
different brands of “backward? caste party politics. Most critical among these,
has been the leadership of Mr. Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was also the Chief

                                        25
Minister of Bihar from 1990 to 1997. He actively encouraged his constituency,
the backward caste electorate, to challenge the authority of the rural feudal
patriarch across the state.

Our experience of research in both Satghara and Bhagawatipur demonstrated to
us the lingering effect of Mr. Yadav’s politics and political style. Several of our
respondents, both from the “upper? and “backward? castes, underlined the
historical significance of Lalu Prasad Yadav’s politics of empowering and giving
dignity (izzat) to the backwards and Dalits. A significant number of our
respondents from the “low? caste communities credited him with having given
them bolne ka muh (literally, the ‘mouth to speak with’). According to an elderly
male in the Paswan Dalit tola in Satghara, unlike the Naxalites, Lalu had used
kanoon (law) in the interest of the underprivileged.

The traditional power of the feudal patriarch has declined from within as well.
With a limited amount of land available and the fragmentation of land holding
within the family as generations progressed, their economic strength declined.
Given the changing economic and political environment, the aspirations of the
younger generations, particularly since the introduction neo-liberal economic
policies in 1990s, too began to change. They now wished to move out of the
village, for education and from there to jobs in the urban economy, never to
return to the village.

In such a fast changing political, social and economic scenario, many of the
landlords simply sold their lands to the upwardly mobile from “forward-
backward? caste groups. Others moved to towns, while leasing-out their lands to
small farmers. Still others began to cultivate on their own. Studying the village of
Changel in 1996 in Bihar, Das (1996) too observed and documented the
emerging rural organization in relation to migration, according to which ‘many
of the zamindars have disappeared and the holdings of the landlords have been
severely fragmented, by and large, with the result that several former landlords
have been forced to take part in cultivation as middle peasants’ whereas ‘some
other upper and middle caste landowners have diversified into trade, selling
cloth, kerosene, milk , groceries and the like . The successful ones among them
have enhanced their economic position while others have treated their business
as an excuse for not being forced into direct agriculture work’ (Das 1996: 14-15).

Even those who still have large holdings within the village do not command
power and authority unlike their counterparts did a couple of decades ago. One
such person, whose family reportedly still owns more than 100 acres of land in
Satghara spoke quite defensively (though not apologetically) during his
interview. Referring to the stark difference between the past and present of his
family, he stated, with poetic melancholy:

                                        26
       Previously, if we called for one person, a hundred would come running to
       serve us. Now I have to ask a hundred to come and it is with great
       difficulty that one turns up…
       (Pahale eek ko bulate thhee to sao dodde aate thhe.
       Aab sao ko bulate hain to eek mushkil se aata hai).

Another respondent, a Suri shopkeeper in Bhagwatipur, who has several
business interests including sale of aluminum trunks, repair and recharge of
mobile phones also told us about the decline of old powers emanating from land
ownership:

       My grandfather had nearly 300 bighas of land. My father had two other
       brothers, and spread over his siblings and my cousins, I now only have 5
       bighas of land to my name. I now give my land to sharecroppers, and it is
       turning out to be so unprofitable that we find no point in cultivating our
       land.

       Previously, when the labour would come to till the land, they would leave
       their footwear at a distance, they couldn’t even speak up. Since Lalu’s
       time, the lower castes have had an opportunity to speak. Now all of them
       migrate and earn money from outside, hum zamindaar log kudaali kaise
       uthayega? (We are landlords; how can we plough the land with our
       hands?) The status of the zamindaar is only deteriorating. Those in the
       new generation, who are going out to study, are making it better for
       themselves. People like us are only bothered with somehow saving our
       dignity and pride and in the process not able to do much (hum log izzyat
       bachane ke liye na kuch kar rahe hain, na ji rahe hain, na mar rahein hain ).

Even though agriculture continues to be an important economic activity in these
settlements, it is no longer the primary source of livelihood for a large majority
or rural residents of the district. With the exception of a very small proportion
(not more than 5 to 10 percent), most land holdings have become very small
with an average size of around one to two acres, which can invariably be self-
owned and/or leased-in from an absentee landowner. Even in Bhagwatipur,
which only has around one third of its male workers primarily employed in non-
farm activity; most families manage their economies through a combination of
income generated from small plots of land and the remittances received from the
migrant members of the family. A part of the remittances was typically used for
investing in land, which, in turn enabled the families to produce grains for their
own consumption. Some of this was also sold to the local shopkeeper, often in
exchange for the groceries required for family consumption.


                                        27
Sharecropping has become quite common in both the settlements. Most of those
who still own large holdings, generally from the traditional upper and trading
castes, rarely cultivate land on their own. They prefer leasing it out to the
laboring households, who are mostly from EBCs and SCs. These laboring
households either do not own any land or own very small plots of land. While
younger members of their families tend to go out to work, their women and
older men find sharecropping a useful source of additional income. Those who
are not employed in the local non-farm economy cannot find a steady source of
employment within the village.

Cultivating land, even if it is a small plot, requires some initial investment.
Agricultural inputs have to be increasingly procured from the market: seeds,
fertilizers or hiring of tractors and other machines. Only rarely do they get the
landowners to give them money for such investments. Even if they do, it is on
high interest rates. Some of them also borrow from local moneylenders for such
investments. Many of the respondents told us about the value of remittances
received from members of their family who work outside in carrying out
agriculture. However, sharecrop farming is not only a useful source of
employment for the left-behind members of the poor households, but it also
provides critical supplement to the family income, required for its reproduction.

In this wider context of social and economic changes, we ought to see the rise of
non-farm economic enterprises in the two settlements, with outmigration
working as the critical trigger.

5. Mapping the Non-farm Economy

5.1: Listing the Activities: We began the fieldwork with a comprehensive
listing of the non-farm activities in the two settlements. We were able to
identify a total 1,680 individual activities, of which 1,384 were in Satghara
and another 296 in Bhagwatipur (see Box 1. Also see Appendix 1).

We also collected information about the social identity of those engaged in the
various non-farm activities and have listed it against the corresponding activity.
As is evident from the two tables, the range of these activities is very wide - from
traditional caste based occupations to mobile repair outlets; from being driver
on a daily wage to owning a brick-kiln or a jewelry shop; from running a school
or tuition-center to owning grocery shops or a medical store.

However, what we did not find in either of the two settlements was any kind of
modern manufacturing establishment. Manufacturing and technology led
establishments, where they exist (bhuja-puffed rice, jewelry, brick kiln, trunk
making) are traditional and small-scale activities that mostly use manual labour
and only occasionally mechanical and no electric power. They neither generate a
significant volume of employment nor require a high volume of investment. By
the way of their appearance and configuration too, the operation of these non-

                                         30
farm activities in rural Madhubani retain the semblance of the ‘rural’ i.e. a site for
the reproduction and sustenance of cheap labour, largely catering to local
requirements.

5.2: The Survey: As mentioned above, for a closer understanding of the
dynamics of the non-farm economy in the two settlements, we interviewed 300
respondents engaged/employed primarily or full time in a non-farm economic
activity. The sample was drawn purposively to ensure that we had enough
respondents from all of the significant social categories. Given that our
preliminary mapping suggested that the proportion of Scheduled Castes,
Muslims and women was lower compared to other categories, we expanded the
sample size across these categories. For example, the proportion of Muslims in
the total universe of non-farm economy in the two settings was a little less than
10 percent but we interviewed a total of 63 (21%). Of these 18 were upper caste
Muslims (Sheikhs) and the remaining 45 were “backward?, as listed in the state
list of EBCs. Similarly the SC population in the two setting was only around 6
percent and their proportion in the non-farm economy is perhaps less than 5
percent but we interviewed 50 (16.7%). They too are officially classified into two
categories, Dalits (10 respondents) and Mahadalits (40 respondents)

The third category where we purposely expanded our sample size is that of
women respondents in the non-farm economy. Even though they are not
completely absent, we could not interview any Muslim women employed in non-
farm activity.

The “others? (non-SC and non-Muslims) are also internally differentiated and we
tried to represent all the categories in our sample. Those from the traditional
upper caste make for 12 percent of our respondents, those from the trading
caste, listed among the upper OBCs, are 20.7 percent, other upper OBCs 4
percent and those from the Hindu EBCs are 25.7 percent of our total sample. The
proportion of women with an independent non-farm enterprise would be below
5 percent in the settlements but we approached whosoever we could and
managed to interview 28 (9%).

Most of our respondents, which appeared to be the case with the wider universe
of the non-farm economy in the two settlements, are young – those below the
age of 45 made up for 77 percent of all the respondents. Those who were below
the age of 30 constitute 31 percent of all the respondents. Less than 6 percent of
our respondents were above the age of 60. A majority of them (nearly 80%) are
educated though nearly 60 percent of them are only school educated
(intermediate or less). Nearly 20 percent of them have acquired a bachelor or
master degree, but very few amongst them are technically skilled with a formal
degree. Those who are employed in technical jobs or provide skill-based services

                                         31
have mostly learnt their skills informally, most commonly on the job or as an
apprentice.

5.3: Nature of Ownership of Non-farm Activity: A large majority of the
non-farm activities are typically individual centric and self-owned enterprises.
However, the proportion of those who reported working in a traditional family
occupation or jointly working with other family members is also not insignificant
(28% see Table 6). However, the proportion of those who reported to be
working alone is larger (68.7%). Even when they work in their traditional family
occupations, they work alone. However, some reported that members of their
immediate nuclear family, wife or children, often assist them (17%). A large
majority of them (above 90%) are married and live with their families. The
number of employed workers working with others is relatively small (only 3%).

Interestingly, a majority of them work from rented premises (51.7%). Only 24
percent of them own the establishments they work from. The rest of them work
from temporary structures with no formal title or ownership. Nearly three of
those who functioned from rented accommodations paid a monthly rent of up to
1000 rupees. The rest paid more. Two of them reported to be paying nearly 5000
rupees monthly for rent.

The nature of ownership of the shop or premises is not a random fact. It has a
close connection with social background of the respondents which data from our

                                       32
survey demonstrates rather starkly. Those who own the premises they operate
from are invariably from the upper castes or those castes, which have
traditionally been in business. As is evident from Table 6, those from the trading
castes (45.2%) and the traditionally upper castes (33.2%) own the
establishments from where operate. Almost all the remaining non-farm
establishments owned by these two categories are formally rented. In contrast, a
large majority of the Scheduled Caste respondents (80%) operate from
temporary structures, which also points to the fragile and temporary nature of
their commercial establishments. Only one of the SC respondents reported
owning the structure from where he worked. Table 7 also shows a good number
of Muslims and Other OBCs working from temporary structures, pointing
towards the fragility of their establishments too. However, their position is
clearly much better than the SCs.

5.4: How Old Are They? The practice non-farm economic activity does not
seem to be very old either of the settlements and appears to have grown during
the past 25 years or so, especially after 1990, and more so in the past 15 years.
As is evident from Table 8, as many as many as 79 percent of them reported
starting their work after 1991 and among them, 68 percent after 2001. This
pattern finds relevance across communities.

5.5: Communities and Non-farm Occupations: One of the obvious
underlying assumptions about the social dimension of economic change in the
process of a shift from farm to non-farm economic activity is the process of
“secularization? or “modernization? of occupational identities. Employment in
modern societies ought to be based on individual merit and choice and not on
one’s caste community identity. While the traditional agrarian economy is
structured around caste, non-farm economy is seen as more likely to be a matter
of individual choice and ability.

This, however, does not seem to be the case. As is evident from Table 4 above, a
little more than 15 percent of all enterprises were strictly, a continuation of the
old caste or community occupations, such as the barbers, shoe repairmen or
basket makers. However, a close look at the data (see Appendices 1 and 2)
shows that a large majority of those working in the non-farm economy come
from specific caste community backgrounds. For example, members of the Sonar
caste own nearly all the jewelry shops. Similarly the traditionally upper caste
and rich communities - Marwaris, Brahmins, Rajputs, and those from the trading
castes (Suris and Telis, officially listed as OBC) own almost all the upper-end
businesses in the two settlements. On the other end, a large proportion of daily
wage labourers are from the lower castes – Dalits and EBCs, low caste Muslim
communities and a significant number of women. In absence of men, who have
migrated out to work, women work both in the family farms and as wage
labourers, mostly to undertake local agricultural labour.

Interestingly, the proportion of Scheduled Caste respondents in the non-farm
activity who explicitly pursued caste based traditional occupation is much higher
(42%) than “others? (19.38%). If we also add daily wage labour in the category
of their traditional occupation, which it has been, it becomes as high as 60 per
cent. Among Muslims too, a large proportion (32%) pursue occupations that the
local community identified as traditional (such as tailors and butchers) (for
details see Table 9). Similarly, a large majority of women (74%) too are either in
traditional occupations or in jobs identified with women, such as food related,
vegetable and fruit vendors and beauty-cosmetics.

Interestingly, except for a few variables, patterns observed in two settlements
are not very different. Perhaps the most important difference reported by our
respondents between the two settlements is the proportion of them pursuing
traditional family occupations, which is much larger in Bhagwatipur (20%) than
in Satghara (11%). This would suggest that the proportion of new entrants is
much larger in the Census Town of Satghara than in the rural settlement of

                                        34
Bhagwatipur. A larger proportion of our respondents from Bhagwatipur worked
from self-own building (21%) than Satghara (21%). But the proportion of
respondents reported working alone is larger in Bhagwatipur (72%) than in
Satghara (61%). Given its rural character, a much larger proportion of the
respondents in Bhagwatipur (22.5%) reported being simultaneously active in
the local agrarian economy (as farmers/ sharecroppers/labourer) than in
Satghara (8.5%). A large majority of the respondents from OBC communities in
Bhagwatipur own some amount of agricultural land.

Community and caste diversity exists only in certain categories of non-farm
occupations. These include activities such as mobile repair, modern electronic
and communication related services, vehicle repair, medicine-related
occupations, vegetable and fruit sellers and driver/ transport. However, here
also we can easily observe community specific exclusions in some of these
occupational categories. For example, there is no SC respondent in the
technology, mobile phone or communication related occupations. Similarly, we
                                          35
find very few Muslims, SCs or women in relatively modern categories or high
investment oriented occupations, such as those related to medicine and health,
education or construction and hardware. Even though a range of communities
own grocery and other utility shops, they are dominated by relatively upper and
trading castes that have been traditionally involved with such work. The same
holds good for food related outlets, which tended to be from specific castes and
communities.

Apart from visible and not so visible divisions and differences of non-farm
activities in accordance with the logic of traditional hierarchies of caste and
communities, we also noticed active discrimination against some communities in
relation to certain occupations. For example, it is very difficult for a Muslim or a
person of ex-untouchable community to establish and operate a successful
restaurant or to sell processed food. Even though Muslims exclusively own all
the raw chicken and meat shops (butcher) and members of different Hindu
communities patronize these shops as clients, according to the Muslim
respondents, no one would come and eat if the Muslims were to run a restaurant
and sell cooked food. We could find only two Muslim respondents running
eateries - a paan shop and another one selling biscuits and cigarettes/ bidis in
Muslim dominated localities in Bhagwatipur.

The Muslim respondents were aware of such an exclusion and several of the
respondents told us that if they were to open a food related shop or a restaurant,
they would be unable to run it because it was most likely that they wouldn’t get
any customers. Catching and selling fish is also a community specific occupation,
an exclusive “monopoly? of the Mallah, an EBC caste group. Some of the Muslim
respondents also complained about not being able to get shops on rent in the
main market because of their community background.

5.6: Women in the Non-Farm Economy: As mentioned, the overall
participation of women in the non-farm economy remains low (9%). If we were
to take a look at the type of non-farm activity in which the participation of
women was registered (>0) among the respondents (see table below), it
becomes clear that they are predominantly engaged (30 percent) in caste based
and traditional occupations, closely followed by engagement in vegetable and
fruit selling (22.2 percent).

The existing literature on the subject tells us that in rural Bihar, women’s labour
force participation rate has increased to 67 percent in 2009-10 from 56 percent
in 1981-82, which may be accounted to the high incidence of male migration and
a change in social norms (Rodgers et al 2013). However women overwhelmingly
report agricultural work as their primary occupation (Rodgers et al 2013) as
compared to men who show a diversified pattern. Visaria and Basant (199) also
indicate that there has been an increase in the share of non-agricultural
employment in the rural workforce during the 1980s, with the bulk of
development being casual in nature and a higher participation of men. According
to Unni (1998), ‘both the absolute number and proportion of women in the non-
agricultural sector to the total is much lower than that of men’.

This appears to be case in Bhagwatipur and Satghara as well. The presence of
women among non-farm activities (except for agricultural labour and marginal
vending) is visibly low. The market area for Bhagwatipur is limited within a
stretch of less than a kilometre. Shops flank the main road on both the sides with
ample room in front of the shops for people to congregate, chat and share time
over tea. Along the edges of the road and before the entrance of the shops as well
as by the street corners, one could see a significant number of women fruit and
vegetable sellers. These are either operating on small carts stationed at one place
or on the ground with a basket of produce in front of them. Most of these women
are from the Mallah community, whose husbands have either migrated out or
perform daily wage labour to eke a living. Some of these women are also the
primary income earners of the family, living in the village, whose husbands are
either dead or unable to work due to a physical disability. Among the fruit sellers
operating through small carts by the road side, fruit supplies are bought on
credit, which is paid off or taken forward depending upon the volume of sales.

For a high number of women, such scale of vending goes towards contributing
towards the household income, whether in addition to the remittance sent in by
a migrant male member or in the absence of one. Shivkali Devi, a forty-year old
woman in Bhagwatipur manages a small make-shift arrangement from where
she shells packed consumer goods like biscuits, toffees, sachets of shampoo and
strips of soap. Her husband is a migrant worker in Chandigarh and has been
working there for nearly thirty years as a construction labourer. According to
Shivkali Devi, whose family is landless, the earnings from her business are very
meagre and only go towards some subsistence expenditure in the village, most of
which is met by the remittance that her husband provides for. According to her,

       I used to be at home, without much work. I thought why can’t I start
       something small and manage some of the household expenditure?

Reena Devi, who runs a fruit stall in the market area of Satghara however runs
her business as the sole income earner of her household. She told us that she has
been selling fruits for the last twenty years, her husband deserted her and she
had to assume the responsibility of the primary cash earner for her family, which
includes a fourteen-year-old son who helps her with her business.

       It is a lot of trouble, I run a household of four all by myself, and this is not
       even a regular or permanent source of income.

It is also clear that the above set of women respondents is from the EBC groups
(Mallah). Traditionally upper caste and Muslim are missing in action from the

                                          38
various activities within the non-farm economy and the SC (Mahadalit) women
are only represented in either agricultural labour or in the traditional caste
based occupation of weaving bamboo baskets and items (See Qualitative
Information: Case Study A IV).

         Box 2: Beauty Parlour and Female Enterprise in Bhagwatipur
In the comparatively smaller market area of Bhagwatipur, Apsara Beauty Parlour can’t be missed,
especially as its red signboard stands out among the scattered shops for eateries and groceries.
Part of a house, with a grocery shop for its neighbour, run by the same person as the beauty
parlour, Apsara beauty parlour is one of the few only women owned and run enterprises in
Bhagwatipur.

Savita is a twenty four year old woman of the Halwai sub caste. She has four sisters, two of whom
are married and two are studying in school and in college respectively. She herself got married
less than a year ago. According to Savita, her parents died very early and it was her elder sister
who took on the responsibility of raising the rest of the daughters. They own a small plot of land,
which they have given out for sharecropping. Most of the family’s earning comes from the
grocery shop that is next to the beauty parlour.

Savita opened the beauty parlour only six months before. It is a makeshift arrangement in one of
the open areas within the house, with minimum and basic utilities and equipment. ‘I always
wanted to be a beautician’, she said, ‘I always had a penchant for make -up and for dressing up
and wondered how I could turn it into a living’. She learnt the skills fro m a beauty parlour in
Madhubani town, and then opened one in Bhagwatipur

        This job is one of honour. The best part is that I can operate a business from within my
        home and I only have to interact with women, nobody can ever raise a question about
        my dignity

Savita is very hopeful about the prospects of her business. ‘Bhagwatipur is a small settlement but
there is a growing acceptance among women to turn out well, especially on occasions of
weddings and festivals. This will only grow further’, she said. The other two younger sisters, want
to study further and one of them wants to become a doctor. The eldest sister said, ‘we will
support her in whatever she wants to do. It is only good if she can study further and make a
decent life for herself’.



However, there are emergent activities within the non-farm activities, which
seem to be closely associated with women but they are marginal to the non-farm
economy as a whole. Interestingly, both of these activities have emerged in
response to the local demands of fashion and beauty related consumerism
among women – the business of a beauty parlour and of a boutique. Both, in
Satghara and in Bhagwatipur, beauty parlours and boutiques were recent
additions to the market, catering to a ‘ladies only’ clientele. It is equally
interesting to note that they are closely interwoven with the other non-farm
activities like tent, catering, DJ and sound service, photography and videography
that have come up due to the services required for organizing weddings within
the village. However, unlike the ‘men’s parlours’, which are an extension of the
                                                39
 traditional caste occupation of barbers (the Nais by caste), women in the
 business are from diverse communities and none from Nai caste.

 The context of aspirations for young women, therefore, is also changing, though
 with limitations. Even though there are very few families like Savita and her
 sisters’, which support independent female enterprise in the village, it is not
 altogether absent. There is a limited but existent entry of women in public
 employment like aanganwadi and ASHA workers, which are seen as being
 ‘dignified’ jobs for women, and also feminized to great extent. These
 developments also differ along the lines of caste and community backgrounds –
 even as traditionally upper caste women are more likely to study and pursue
 higher education, women and girls from Muslim, EBC and SC groups have a high
 rate of dropping out of school, higher than the men from their communities. Like
 a Suri male respondent in Bhagwatipur informed us

         Both boys and girls from the traditionally upper castes are no longer in
         the village; they go out, not to work but to study. Their parents are more
         likely to invest in the education of boys as well as girls as they see returns
         from it – job for a boy and a decent marriage proposal for the girl.

 The availability of capital is constrained for women, as much as it is for men
 depending upon their social background. However, the scale of operation for
 women run enterprises is smaller as compared to those run and owned by men.
 Given that women are marginal to the non-farm economy – they are represented
 mostly in activities like vegetable and fruit vending (Other OBC), traditional caste
 based occupations (bangle making, basket weaving) and a few new activities in
 the market like tailoring and beauty parlours.

 The income levels reported by women tend to be lower than men. If we were to
 look at the Table 12, it becomes clear to us that nearly one fourth (22.2 per cent)
 of the total women respondents report a monthly income of less than Rs. 2500 as
 compared to only 8 per cent of the male respondents. None of the women
 respondents in either of the markets reported a monthly income higher than Rs.


                                            40
10,000 per month whereas 13.6 per cent of the male respondents did. On the
whole, of the women reporting participation in the non-farm economy, 45 per
cent report earning less than Rs. 5000 per month and 41 per cent report merely
making ends meet.

The story of the participation of women in the non-farm economy is also appears
to be significantly influenced by their caste and community background. When
we refer to the large number of female vegetable and fruit vendors, we are
referring to Malha women. The Malha community has been traditionally engaged
in the role of cultivating and selling vegetables. Other than that, SC women, from
the Lehri and Dom community for example, engage in traditional occupations
like bangle making and basket weaving. However, Muslim women are
conspicuously missing from participating in the non-farm economy whereas
traditionally upper and trading caste women put together (33 per cent) are
lesser than other OBC and SC women put together (67 percent), in the non-farm
economy of Bhagwatipur and Satghara (see Table 13).

Therefore, not only is the participation of women in the non-farm economy
restricted to marginal activities at large, the returns from these activities are also
low. Typically, women are not solo migrants i.e. they do not migrate either for
work or for education by themselves but accompany their families, usually their
husbands after marriage, if at all. However this does vary across caste – for
example in the Brahmin dominated Nahar Bhagwatipur tola of Bhagwatipur,
most of the women had moved to the city with their husbands for good – which
was an exception when compared to other tolas where the families including the
wife stay behind. A detailed examination of the interaction of gender and
migration is however the subject matter for another investigation.

6. Migration and the Non-farm Economy

6.1: The Context: Outmigration is perhaps the single most important social
and economic process articulating through the rural landscape of Madhubani.
Not only has the out-migration of young men for work grown manifold over the
past three decades and more, it has also transformed the local dynamics of social
relations and of economic life. As mentioned above, scholars studying various
aspects and regions of Bihar see out-migration as a “trigger of change? (Rogers et.
al. 2013), with a marked onset in the 1970s in the form of short-term migration
to Punjab and Haryana, primarily for seasonal work in agriculture. Over the
years, it has continued to grow. As shown by Datta in her study of the village of
Mahisham in Madhubani, the proportion of households with at least one member
of the family as a migrant worker went up from 24 percent 1980-81 to 54
percent 1999 and to a further 78 percent in 2011 (Datta 2014:4).

Unlike three decades ago, migrant workers from Bihar no longer go only to rural
Punjab for seasonal agricultural work. Their choice and range of destinations has
since diversified – increasingly, they prefer going to urban centres and they work
there for most of the year. However, such movements remain circular in nature.

As mentioned above, migrants are mostly men. Even though they begin their
journey for work when they are quite young (15 to 20 years of age), most of
them are married and leave their wives behind, with their parents in the village.
They visit homes once or twice every year during their active work life. Once
they can no longer continue bearing the hardships of working outside, they move
back to the village when, mostly, when they are between 45 and 50 years of age.
For instance, Shyam Kumar Mandal, worked in Delhi for many years of his life
and has since returned to Satghara had this to say about his work in Delhi –

       The work that I did in Delhi was very tough. I never had time to rest.
       (Dilli ka kaam bahut kathin thaa, koi aaram hi nahi milta thaa).

The growth in the rate of outmigration has continued to increase for several
reasons. First, given the population density of the region, the local agrarian
economy has simply become unviable. Land holdings have mostly become very
small, with an average size of less than one acre. Many of our respondents
reported owning less than one-fourth of an acre. Those own more than 5 acres of
land are not be more than 5 to 10 percent of all those who have traditionally
cultivated land or identified themselves as zamindars (landlords).

Second, agriculture in the region has also remained less developed. There has
been very little investment in building agricultural infrastructure, such as canals
and tube-wells or creating capacities for marketing networks. The quality of soil

                                        42
is also not poor and the local farmers have adopted modern practices of farming
and increasingly use hybrid varieties of seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
However, they are not able to undertake intensive farming. Some of them
reported growing a single crop and being always worried about floods and their
lack of capacity to irrigate their crops in the absence of rains.

Third, there is virtually no local industry. On the contrary, Madhubani district
has seen some kind of de-industrialization over the past 30 odd years. The
district had several sugar mills, which not only procured sugar cane from the
local farmers but also provided employment to the locals. All of them have closed
down sometime during the 1980s. The only “industry? that survives in
Madhubani and the neighboring districts is the low technology intensive brick-
kilns. Even though their numbers have grown, they do not work all around the
year and hence do not employ many people.

Finally, social and political changes in the local structures have also played their
role in intensifying out-migration. Decline in the authority of the local semi-
feudal patriarch and changing land relations enabled the release of the erstwhile
tied labour from Dalit and lower OBC castes from bondage and dependency.
Even though they were freed from the ties or attachments of tradition, they were
not able to find casual employment, as free labour, in the local market. The
compulsions of economic survival and new aspirations hence pushed them out of
village. The old structure of caste hierarchy and the jajmani system, which tied
the local communities with their caste occupations, has almost completely
disintegrated. While some of those traditional occupations survive (such as
tailoring or barbers), albeit in a new commercial avatar, some of them have
become almost completely redundant (such as the traditional plough related
work)

At the other end of the social spectrum, are those who had occupied positions of
dominance in the traditional system, and also felt uncomfortable and often
insecure in the rapidly changing political environment in the village. Their
younger generation also began to look outwards, towards the urban life and
secure jobs. Given the economic and social resources at their command, many of
them moved out the village, at least partially. As a combination of these various
factors, those from the “backward? caste communities largely dominate rural
politics in the villages of Madhubani today.

6.2. Remittance Economy: The growth of the non-farm economy and the
increase in outmigration for work in rural Bihar appear to be closely related. The
number of villagers engaged in non-farm activities has increased along with an
increase in migration. As is evident from Table 7 above, nearly 80 percent of the
respondents reported having begun the corresponding non-farm activity after

                                        43
1980 and it is precisely during this period that the remittance economy of these
villages also appears to be growing. Cash coming into the villages in the form of
remittances induces demand for local consumption, which in turn leads to a
spurt in the growth of local markets in the form of a variety of shops and other
retail outlets.

Several of the respondents underlined the change that migration and associated
remittances have brought about in their life. A 75 years old Dalit man from the
musahar community had this to say to us during a conversation about migration
and its impact on personal and social life in the village:

       Thirty years ago, we could not eat three meals. If we ate one evening, we
       had to stay hungry the next evening. Now, we eat breakfast in the
       morning, lunch during the day, and dinner at night, everyday.

A woman respondent from the Lehri community, (EBC, bangle makers) seemed
to echo the old man:

       Earlier we counted grains and we ate; we no longer need to do that
       (Pehle anaaj ginkar khana padta tha, ab ginana nahin padta ).

Janaki Devi, a thirty year old woman from an EBC community, told us that her
husband works as a carpenter in Delhi and sent her around 5000 rupees every
two months. With an approval from her husband, she reported spending the
money on items of daily needs. Along with that, she also uses the money sent by
her husband to help her father-in-law in farming the land they have leased in.
From the remittance money, she also manages to keep a cow or a buffalo. Janaki
Devi also informed us that even though local people did not like educating their
daughters, she sends her daughter to the local school. The impact of remittances,
hence certainly extends beyond influencing the nature and patterns of
consumption; they also have a bearing on the social life of the individual and of
the village.

Other than the financial resources made available my migration, some of the
migrants also create additional human resources upon joining the non-farm
economy of the village once they return for good. Nearly half of our respondents
(48%) currently engaged in non-farm economy have been migrant workers at
least for sometime in their working life, before they started working locally or
set-up their own enterprise. Interestingly, most of these return migrants had
mostly worked in urban centres when they went out of the village.

6.3: Experience of Migration: The incidence and experience of migration
varies significantly across castes and communities. Even though members of all
class and communities migrate, they do so for different reasons. Those who still
have substantial land holdings (mostly from traditional upper castes) or have a
decent business in the village do not feel the need to go out for low-end work.
However, their children often go out to study and invariably move out of the
village for good as they take up well paying regular jobs, often in urban centers.
However, the poor from these communities do go with their fellow villagers for
low-end work. As is evident from Table 14, the proportion of our respondents
who have been migrant workers is much smaller among the upper castes and the
trading caste when compared with rest of the three categories.

Several of the respondents shared their experience of migration. We also spoke
to some who are currently working elsewhere and were visiting homes during
the fieldwork. One can say that the stories retold to us were a combination of
both positive and negative experiences of migration. For some of the migrants,
the experience of having lived and worked outside seemed to be an enabling, a
positive one - it provided them with some disposable income with which they
were able to support their families and meet household expenses, educate their
children and do business. These experiences certainly varied across caste and
communities. While those from the “upper? and the trading castes experienced
and spoke of migration as a positive experience of mobility, many of the poor
shared their encounters with hardships and difficulties. A large number of them
told us about the meagre amount they earned and saved as migrant workers, the
harassment they faced at the hands of the police during their return journey, the
withholding of their wages/salaries by employers, long working hours and much
more. A man who works in Delhi and happened to be in (Satghara/Bhagwatipur)
during the time of our visit told us:


                                       45
      I work in Delhi. I have no choice. If I could get a job here that pays me 250
      or 300 rupees a day, I will stay back. Why don’t you do something about
      opening a factory here, where we can get employment? I can’t even think
      of starting any business. I don’t have money (punji nahin hai). Even if I
      were to start a shop, will I get customers?

We also had the chance to speak to Shiv Kumar Mukhia (35 years) who too
works in Delhi, as an electrician, and was on a vacation in Bhagwatipur:

      Do you like staying in Delhi?

      I want to stay in the village. Who would want to leave his family, his
      mother and father and go out? I like the village (Humhe toh gaon achha
      lagta hai). I like the village because people know how to behave. They
      respect women. There is no respect (izzat) in Delhi. I go to work inside
      the houses in Delhi. I don’t like it. Women wear short clothes…

Another respondent who has been going to Punjab for seasonal agricultural
work told us about the compulsions for moving out of the village for work:

      I work here but can get employment only for around 10 days in a month. I
      have no choice but to go to Punjab for work unless I want to starve (agar
      garib mazdur yeha se Punjab nahi jayega to bhukh se marega). I save
      5,000 to 6000 rupees while working for 15 to 20 days during the
      harvesting season.

Shyam Kumar Mandal worked in Delhi for a few years selling toys on the
footpath. However, he soon returned to Satghara and set up his own sweet shop,
partly with the money he saved as a migrant in Delhi. Now, he and his brother
cater at local weddings and functions. According to him:

      Work in Delhi was tough. There was no time to rest. This job is better,
      easier.
      (Dilli ka kaam bahut kathin thaa, koi aaram hi nahi milta thaa. Ye kaam
      achcha hai)

Another respondent, a Dalit from a neighboring village narrated his experience
of humiliation and hardships that he had faced as a migrant worker:

      There is only one train from here that goes to Amritsar, Punjab. It is very
      crowded during the season. Some can’t even get in. However, once we are
      in the train, no one bothers us. It is when we are returning with some cash
      in our pockets that the police harass us. Even when we have a ticket, they

                                       46
       say it is not a proper ticket. They take money from us, 500 to 1000 rupees.
       They beat us if we refuse to pay.

The process of migration is by no means a singular event in time. For most of our
respondents who are currently engaged in the non-farm economy, the
experience of migration prior to this engagement was drawn over time. Some of
them had migrated and returned a few times, hoping to find a better opportunity
each time they moved out. Some of them still kept an eye and ear out for an
opportunity; their current non-farm occupations did not mark the end of their
migration story. However, there is a correlation of the desire and ability to move
back and forth with the age of the respondents. In our interview schedule, when
we asked the respondents a question about whether they had migrated prior to
starting their current occupation, we got the following set of responses, which
have been cross tabulated with the age of the respondent

As we can see in the Table 15, more than half of the respondents were among
those between 21 to 30 years old, and those between 31 and 45 years old
reported having worked as a migrant outside their settlement prior to their
current occupational activity. This indicates, firstly that the volume of out-
migration has increased with time as the percentage of migration reported
declines in age group older than that and secondly, a significant number are of
those above 40 years old which may constitute what are permanent return
migrants.

Similarly, the migration cycle does not run only between the origin and
destination, it would be befitting to state that it runs between origin and
destinations. The expansion of networks among migrants, the search for better
opportunities and increased connectivity has propelled migrants to go to more
than one destination in the time they spend as migrant workers. This too has


                                       47
abetted with time, the current generation of migrant workers deem it more
desirable, kismat aazamaana (to test their fate) in more than one place.

As we can see in the Table 16, it is notable that respondents in the 15-20 years
old age group were the ones who reported the highest percentage of having
migrated to more than one (2 or 3) destinations for work. Given that the oldest
respondents in this category are twenty years old, this number is likely to
increase.

6.4: Migration and Networks: The process and decision of migrations is
one that occurs when abetted by networks. Like the thirty-two years old
Mohammad Jafir told us:

       I work in Delhi where I drive a vehicle. I went there because other
       members of our community already work there. They managed to find me
       a job. I stay there for 8-9 months in a year. I make 10,000 to 11,000
       rupees every month of which I spend around 4000. The rest can be saved.

Whereas Mohammad Jafir found it convenient to rely on community networks to
help him find a job and home to stay in his place of destination, the experience is
not the same for everybody. Raj Kumar Mallick, a 16 year old Dalit boy of the
Dom community from (Bhagwatipur/Satghara) went to Gujarat and worked with
a contractor for a few months for a monthly salary of 6500 rupees. After having
worked for 2 months, when he asked for the due payment, the labour contractor
threatened him with violence. Even though some other workers from his village
worked there, none of them supported him in his demand for his wage. Raj
Kumar has since returned from Gujarat. He is not the only one who complained
of lack of support at the destination for work; he is one among many such


                                        48
migrant workers, most of whom belong to the Scheduled Castes. Several other
individuals from the Dom tola in Satghara informed us that they had gone to
Gujarat for work but came back because of the lack of friends and social support.
-they did not have anyone to fall back upon when ill or when they felt the need to
solicit support for any other reason.

Even though most of the migrant workers managed their own and their family’s
lives through the incomes they earned in combination with the work their wives
and other family members undertook in the village, a large number also narrated
their stories of hardship, both at the destination as well as at home in the village.
Most of them lived a life of “subsistence? and struggled to make ends meet. They
often had to borrow money from the local moneylenders, for which they paid
interest at high rates, ranging from 3 to 5 percent monthly. Jag Deo’s story is
emblematic of many others’ -

Jag Deo Mochi, a forty five year old resident of Satghara has three sons, all of
whom have been working in a hotel in Sonepat in Haryana for the last eight
years. He sent them away with his brother, who lives and works there. Jag Deo is
unhappy about the fact that his sons have to live away from their family and
village but he doesn’t have a choice since his sons’ income supports the entire
family resident in the village. He wishes to open a shoe shop in Satghara if they
are able to save money. But the ‘cycle of illness, marriage and of paying interest
on previous debt does not seem to come to a close’, he said.

Social identities also seem to matter for the kind of work that migrants are able
to find at the destination. A much larger proportion of SC (38%) and EBC (34%)
respondents reported being employed in casual work when compared with the
upper caste respondents (8%). However, even those from the upper castes often
do jobs at the site of migration, which they are unlikely to do in the village; they
perceive migration’s privilege in its anonymity. One of upper caste respondents,
condescendingly told us about the migrants and their attitude towards work:

       They feel embarrassed doing labouring job in the village. They find it
       shameful do certain kinds of job in the village. They will do anything
       outside. They will even sell ice-balls.
       (Gaon mein labour log kaam nahin karenge. Gaon mein sharam mante hain,
       Bahar jaayega to baraf ka gola bhi bechega!)

6.5. Migration, women and agriculture: Based on a research survey of
groups of women in 12 selected villages across seven districts of north and south
Bihar, Datta (2011: 12) reports that ‘the burden of work tremendously increased
for women who worked in family farms, and as sharecroppers, after male
members of their families migrated’. Such migrations are male dominant

                                         49
phenomena. As has been reported by Sharma for Bihar, only 3 per cent of the
seasonal migrants and 7 per cent of the long-term migrants are females (Sharma
2005). However, male predominant migration has ‘profound changes’ for the
range of work that women do within and outside the household (Rodgers et al
2013), especially an increase in the range of agricultural activities that they have
to perform. These include overseeing work in the farms, making decisions
related to sowing and harvesting, usage of seeds and fertilizers among others.
Women now constitute the dominant share of agricultural labour in both the
settlements and especially for activities like sowing, transplanting and
harvesting, which takes up most of their time during the peak seasons.

Shiv Kumar, an elderly farmer from the Mallah community in Bhagwatipur
confirmed our understanding when he told us:

        Agriculture has become women’s job, they are the ones who do most of
        the agricultural wage labour. Men also work as labour but they generally
        go out for construction or brick-kiln related wage labour. If there weren’t
        women, there would be no agriculture. Men also work on farms but only if
        they need to. In my assessment, 75 percent of all agricultural work is done
        by women.

It is also interesting to take note of the gendered division of wage labour that
emerged as a widespread trend in both the settlements. Like Shiv Kumar
indicated, wherever there is an opportunity for ‘brick kiln’ or ‘construction’
related labour, it is men who choose to go for wage labour whereas in the event
of requirement of agricultural labour, it is women who go6. This distinction has
emerged in response to the nature of remuneration associated with the two
different kinds of wage labour. Whereas non-agricultural wage labour is paid in
cash, most agricultural labour in both Bhagwatipur and Satghara continues to be
paid in kind i.e. in grains. Though the quantity may differ over farms and owners,
we gathered that the standard practice in both the areas was to pay 1 bojha
(approximately 15 kilo of grains) for every 12 bojhas they can harvest in the
field. Most women, in the Mallah community reported that it took them an
average of five days at least to be able to gather 1 bojha from the landowners
(See Qualitative Information: Case Study for the Mallah Tola).

However the pattern of women’s participation in the agricultural labour force
also differs across their caste and community backgrounds. Whereas women


6 However, elderly men may choose to go for agricultural wage labour in the village. Therefore
the constitution of the agricultural labour force in the villages is not only determined by gender,
it is also determined by age. Once men have returned to the village, having migrated previously,
and consider themselves old enough to not seek work actively on a regular basis, some of them
choose to do agricultural wage labour.

                                                50
respondents from both the Muslim Fakir Tola in Satghara and the Muslim Ansari
Tola in Bhagwatipur informed us that they did not go out of their settlements to
seek work, including agricultural labour, women from the Mallah (EBC), Badhai
(EBC) and Dom (Mahadalit) caste groups reported a fairly regular participation
in the agricultural labour force. Respondents from the Brahmin tola in Nahar,
Bhagwatipur stated clearly that women from their families did not perform any
work or labour other than their household chores. It can therefore be
determined, with a fair degree of certainty that whereas women from Muslim
and Brahmin groups did not undertake agricultural labour, most women from
both the EBC and SC groups did so, hence constituting a bulk of the total
agricultural labour force in both Bhagwatipur and Satghara.

The impact of the out-migration of men on the intra-household structure and
dynamics also seems to vary across the caste and community backgrounds of the
households. Across the sample, it is clear that nearly all migrant men migrate
alone i.e. they leave their families which, on average, includes their wife, children
and parents, in the village. ‘We can’t take our families with us, it is too expensive
to maintain a family in the city. Here in the village, we can be assured of their
safety and well-being rather than in the city’, said a young Dalit man in Satghara
who was visiting from Delhi, where he stays and works. He has a wife and an
infant child who stay with his parents in the village.

On the contrary, in the Nahar tola of Bhagwatipur, which is a Brahmin
settlement, both men and women were conspicuously missing. Most households
constituted a set of grandparents with school going grandchildren. The
grandparents preferred to live in the village, most of the men had a prior
experience of migration whereas the grandchildren studied in school in the
village and eventually moved out to stay with their parents in the city for further
education and work. Therefore, in the cycle of migration among the residents of
the Nahar tola, both the migrant man and his wife moved out, to be joined by
their children later, and then return to the village at a later date.

What do these different patterns of gendered migration and of ensuing
household structures mean for the agency of women in the household decision
making structure, given the historically patriarchal context of the agricultural
economy in rural Bihar? From our experience of research and analysis in
Bhagwatipur, two facets emerge with more clarity than others. Firstly, an impact
on women’s mobility within the village and secondly, on the performance of
caste based traditional occupations.

Remittances not only have an impact on the economic capital of a migrant
household, they also determined, to a great extent, its social capital. The absence
of a male member means that the range of tasks that women have to perform on

                                         51
a regular basis increase, including those outside the house – buying ration
supplies from the market, accompanying the elderly and children to the hospital
in case of ill health and discharging social obligations. Therefore in addition to
their household duties, women from migrant households reported keeping
busier in the absence of their husbands. This also means that women now have
to be more mobile than before – to be able to go to the market, the hospital or the
nearest town. Like a young mother of two from the Badhai tola in Bhagwatipur
told us, ‘A lot of us have begun to use the auto-rickshaws by ourselves to move
between Madhubani and Bhagwatipur. Sometimes, we have to go out to do what
must be done, we can’t just fold our arms and sit and wait for our husbands to
come, can we?’

However, financial literacy of most women continues to be low. It is interesting
to note that a large number of the migrant households reported receiving
remittance via banks, which means that someone in either the immediate or
extended family held a bank account. Though the institutionalization of sending
and receiving remittances can be the subject of a separate enquiry, it is
interesting for us to have a snapshot understanding of who withdraws them
from the bank? Most women respondents told us that they depended on another
male relative – a young nephew or brother-in-law or the ‘guardian’ (father-in-
law) to withdraw money from the bank rather than doing it themselves. It is also
interesting to note that Rodgers et al. (2013) report that ‘while not a single
upper caste group of women reported change in the management of money after
male migration, a majority of OBC II and Scheduled Caste groups, and all Muslim
groups, reported that women were more involved in the management of money
in the household’ (Rodgers et al 2013: 115) which merits further investigation.

Therefore, even though the physical mobility of women in the village may have
increased as a direct corollary of the absence of men, other forms of mobility
continue to be limited. Women’s physical mobility also varies across caste and
community – Muslim women respondents reported limited physical mobility and
a higher dependence upon male relatives.

The other element that has been significantly impacted due to the gendered
nature of migration for work in both Satghara and Bhagwatipur is the
performance of traditional caste-based occupations. Like we have discussed
before, the need for cash pulls out men from the village and women continue to
perform non-monetized forms of work like agricultural labour. However, in the
case of monetized but very small-scale caste - based traditional occupations
within the non-farm economy, women are the primary workers. Whether it is the
trade of making and selling bangles among the Lehri community, that of washing
and ironing clothes among the Dhobi community or that of making and selling
bhuja (puffed rice) among the Kanu community of Halwais – men move to higher

                                        52
paid or larger-scale activities like barber shops among the Nai community or
furniture shops among the Badhai community, and women perform most of the
other traditional occupations, at the margins of the economy7 (See Qualitative
Information: Case Studies C I & D I).




7An exception to women’s marginal participation in the non-farm economy through traditional
caste-based occupations is the case of the Madhubani painters. Women constitute the bulk of
Madhubani painters, the sale of which has taken on the form of a family business – with mostly
women involved in painting and men involved organizing sale and exhibitions (See Qualitative
Information: Case Study C II)

7. Mobility and the Non Farm Economy

7.1. Where Do They Come From? Interestingly, only around one-fifth
(20.3%) of those who reported being involved in non-farm activities currently,
appeared to have switched over from agriculture, as their previous livelihood.
Upon analysis, we understand that a substantial number of them had a member
of a generation prior to them from their families working in either the traditional
caste based occupations (23%) or another non-farm employment (26%) or a
salaried job (10.3%). The proportion of those respondents who had themselves
worked as full time cultivators or in a traditional occupation for their own family
before they moved to a non-farm economic activity is much smaller (12.3%). The
corresponding combined figure for the same set of activities (i.e. a traditional
caste based occupation and farming) for the prior generation of the respondents
(father) is higher (43.3%) (see Table 17).

Among the trends for a generation wise analysis of the involvement in non-farm
activities, we can see significant and interesting variations across caste and
communities. For instance, families of respondents from the traditionally upper
castes cannot be identified with any caste specific occupation, even for a prior
generation (See Table 18). Members of the traditionally upper castes in both the
settlements either reported to be directly pursuing farming or were already
engaged in a non-farm occupation. In contrast, a much larger proportion of OBC
and SC respondents reported that a prior generation of family members was
employed in traditional caste-based occupations (see Table 11). Not only did a
majority of these respondents’ families not pursue agriculture a generation
earlier, most of them also owned no or very small plots of agricultural land. In
the current generation, as many as 68 percent of all the respondents (94%
among SCs) reported owning no agricultural land and another 19 percent
reported owning less than one acre of land. Only around 4 percent of the total
respondents reported owning 5 or more acres of land. Thus, for a large majority
of those respondents who belonged to traditionally land owning caste and

                                        54
community groups, their holdings have increasingly become unviable (due to
fragmentation of holdings across generations).

Some of the respondents continue to practice farming (10.3%) along with a non-
farm activity but reported farming as a secondary source of livelihood. Most of
such respondents belong to the traditionally upper castes and both the OBC
categories. A large majority of the respondents (74.7) work full time in their
corresponding non-farm activity though some of them simultaneously engage in
more than one non-farm activity (6.3%). A good proportion of the respondents
(24.3%) also have another family member along with them in the (primarily)
reported non-farm activity.




                                       55
8. Motivations Sources of Funding and Income: From the discussion
above, it is discernible that more than 60 percent of those who reported being
currently engaged in a non-farm activity are first generation workers, i.e. their
fathers and other members of the family from the generation prior to them were
either employed in agriculture or in a traditional caste based occupation. It is
therefore both interesting and worthwhile for us to understand what was it that
motivated them to shift from such livelihoods to those that they are currently
employed in? How did they mobilize the initial investment required for starting
such enterprises? How much do they earn?

8.1: Motivations: Even though the decline of agriculture as a source of
employment and of social status is quite evident, few of our respondents seemed
to have consciously attributed their decision to start a non-farm activity to it.
Given the average size of land holdings in the area, agriculture is perhaps no
longer seen as a viable option of employment by villagers from across
communities (see Table 12). As one of the respondents put it:

       Agriculture is good. One can do many things with land. One can keep
       cattle and also do a poultry business. But only if we have enough land. We
       do not have much land here. We also have a serious problem with
       irrigation. Other inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and labour, everything is
       very expensive. Those who are doing agriculture are not doing well. There
       is no income from land. Agriculture is a lot of hassle (bahut lafda hai
       kheti)

Ram Yadav, an auto-rickshaw driver in Satghara, also felt similarly and argued
that agriculture could be a profitable and worthwhile activity, only if the
government provided facilities.

       In absence of electricity and assured irrigation, which ought to be
       provided by the government, we will only loose our money if we were to
       invest in agriculture.

Among those who own larger than average tracts of cultivable land, farming is
still not seen as a viable option for either current or future livelihoods.
Interestingly, such respondents complained of a shortage of labour. Pankaj
Kumar of the Suri caste in Satghara, had this to say to us -

       We have land and we used to cultivate it on our own. But with people
       going out for work, it is hard to find labour. We do not have a large
       proportion of SCs here. If they were around, farming would have been
       easier. It is better to give it on sharecropping.


                                        56
Agriculture is also seen as a stagnating work, with no future for progress. Sachin
Kumar Thakur, a twenty-year old man returned to his village after working as an
assistant in a dental accessories making unit in Amritsar for a few years. His two
brothers are still in Delhi and Mumbai respectively. Even though they own a
small plot of land, Sachin chose to work with his father as a barber. He expressed
his opinion on agriculture clearly and sharply:

       The world is progressing very fast. How long can we keep sitting with a
       shovel in our hand? Working in the shop is far more profitable than
       working on land. This work is also easier. Who would want to plough
       land?

Most of the respondents reported starting a non-farm activity because it made
sense to them as a possible source of employment. Many of them did so either
because it was their family business (nearly 30 percent) or they had been
exposed to it during their work outside the village (nearly 15 percent) and many
others reported assessing that they simply had no other options for employment
(12.3 %) or that there was a local need for the business they initiated (28.7%)
(see Table 19). Interestingly, we observe very similar patterns of aspirations
across communities.

An overwhelming majority (73 per cent) of migrant workers are in the age group
of 15-35 years. Deshkingar et. al. (2006) in their study of migration from Bihar
also state that ‘young people are now consciously opting to migrate to explore
other areas and in the case of lower castes to break away from caste oppression
in the village’. Migration is hence also a strategic decision in case of the young
and the vulnerable groups who chose to move out of the rural agricultural
economy.

8.2. Investments and Sources of Funding: As we have discussed in a prior
section on mapping the range of non-farm activities in both the settlements, the
range of such activities is fairly wide and diverse. However, a large majority of
these were self-owned enterprises (nearly 80%), which require an initial
investment. Given the diversity of caste/class/community in rural Bihar and the
nature of the non-farm activity itself, the volume and source of investments
associated with it vary considerably (see Table 20 and 21).

As we can see from Table 20, a significant share of the SC and EBC respondents
were in activities that did not require any investment, which also implies that
they tended to work for others. Even in cases where we can ascertain that they
set-up their own enterprise, the corresponding investments for SC, EBC and
Muslim respondents were relatively meager. For instance, we do not find any SC

                                         58
or Muslim respondent among those who reported investing more than 2,00,000
rupees.

Sources of investment also varied across social groups but not to the same extent
as the volume of investment. Personal and family savings coupled with loans
from local moneylenders constituted the source of investment for more than half
of the respondents in both Bhagwatipur and Satghara. One of the more
noteworthy features here is that of the negligible significance of remittances as a
source of investment in either of the settlements. Whereas it is the case that
money saved as a migrant worker constitutes a share of the personal savings of
the respondent, it is certainly not the case that money sent by a migrant worker
outside the settlement while he continues to work there, can contribute towards
the establishment and operation of a non-farm activity of his kin in the
settlement. Remittance, in the classic sense, therefore does not have a trigger
effect on investment, and as we shall understand in the course of our analysis, it
may do so only in the case of consumption and agricultural production.
According to Rodger and Rodger (2011: 46) in their recent study of two villages
in Bihar, ‘most respondents indicated that the primary use of remittances was
for food, clothing, health and house repairs – i. e., meeting basic needs – and
education’. Also, punji (capital), and the lack thereof continues to be a major
reason why a high set of the respondents believe that they don’t see a profitable
future for their activity.

8.3: Incomes from Non-farm Activity: As one would expect, incomes from
the non-farm enterprises would vary depending upon the investments one
makes. Even though the non-farm economy in rural Bihar has expanded, it does
not seem to be generating much income locally. A large majority of our
respondent across communities and caste reported near subsistence level
incomes from their business. From the total sample, only around 12 percent
reported earning more than 10,000 rupees per month, which diminishes for
specific caste/community members. Seventy percent of the SC respondents and
61.6 percent of the Muslim respondents reported a monthly income of less than
Rs. 7,500 per month (See Table 22).

It is therefore not surprising that the experience of struggling with subsistence
level of earnings for a significant share of respondents also manifests itself in
their perceptions and aspirations towards the future of the work they are
currently doing, and in terms of what they aspire for their children and how they
imagine their life beyond the ‘rural’.

9. Growing Non-farm Economy, Persisting Rural and Urban
Aspirations.

9.1. Absent Urban: Rural and urban are often viewed as two types of social
formations, representing different stages in the process of economic
development, or even human “evolution?. According to this popular common
sense, while the traditional or pre-modern societies are predominantly ‘rural’,
the modern societies are largely ‘urban’, with a very small proportion of
population living in rural settlements. Rural, in this perspective, is also viewed as
being predominantly agrarian, implying that those living in rural areas work on
land or earn their livelihood from other primary sources of income, such as
animal husbandry, fishery – activities that require earning livelihood through
direct engagement with “nature?.

As societies become modern, settlements grow in size. The new technologies that
use inanimate sources of power enable human beings to use technology to
multiply their productive ability. As it first happened in Western Europe, growth
of modern factory system after the industrial revolution resulted in a significant
decline in the working population engaged in agriculture. A large number of
people migrated from rural areas to urban centres in search of employment in
industry and a better life. Migration and urbanization were two sides of the same
coin. Similarly, decline of agriculture and move to non-farm occupation implied a
process of modernization, either through direct employment in manufacturing,
or related occupations such as in commerce or service sector, which tend to
expand with urbanization.

As mentioned above, our analysis is based on a comparative understanding of
non-farm economy in a Census Town and a large rural settlement. Among other
things, the study focused on exploring potentials of non-farm economy for
generating development dynamics at the local level. Does the growth of non-
farm economy indeed produce an impetus for urbanization, even if it is of a
“subaltern? variety (see Denis et al 2012)? Does the growth of non-farm
economy carry the potential of transforming the region into a modern social and
economic formation? Is the social profile of those in non-farm economy in the
Census Town any different from those in the “rural? settlement?

If we are to begin answering these questions by comparing the two settlements,
our evidence from the field does not seem to support the popular assumptions
about the development or urbanizing effects of the growing non-farm economy.

The nature and quality of infrastructure in the two settlements does not seem to
be very different. They both lack modern economy in terms of manufacturing or


                                         61
service sector. As is evident from the data presented in different sections above,
non-farm occupations do not use much of modern technology. Neither do they
require advance level skills. There is virtually no growth of any kind of modern
manufacturing, with almost no manufacturing units found using electric power,
in Satghara. The only source of modern/formal employment is in institutions
that provide services such as schools, banks or government offices. Much of this
employment has grown because of state initiative from above. Interestingly, a
large proportion of those employed in such activities come from other
settlements, often from the neighboring town of Madhubani.

In terms of urban infrastructure too, the markets and streets of Satghara do not
appear to be very different from the shopping areas of Bhagwatipur. The only
difference appears to be in the intensity and scale of the commercial activity.
Satghara has many more shops and other non-farm activities but their quality is
not very different from those in Bhagwatipur. Social dynamics of caste,
community and gender work almost exactly in the same fashion in the two
settlements. Even those employed in activities like the rickshaw pulling or the
auto-rickshaw driving come from the neighboring areas in both the settlements.

The story of infrastructure is also not very different in the two settlements.
Though Satghara has had a railway station (Rajnagar) for a long time, it is more
like a junction for the entire region. Its road network began to grow only during
the latter part of 1990s when the Central government initiated the process
through its Prime Minister’s Rural Roads Construction Project, which was
followed by Chief Minister’s Rural Road Construction Project. Use of cell phones,
televisions and banking services is also very similar in both the settlements.

Even though officially Bhagwatipur has a much larger proportion of its working
population formally employed in agriculture, disenchantment with agriculture is
also similar in both the settlements. As we have discussed in the section on out-
migration, a large proportion of households, including those surveyed have
either been themselves migrants or have the adult male members of their family
working as migrant labourers elsewhere. Much of this migration is circular in
nature. The migrant worker even though employed outside, in urban centres,
remains tied to the village and the rural identity.

Economic dynamics of the local non-farm economy also do not seem promising.
Most of the commercial establishments appear to be working at a mere
subsistence level, generating no surpluses or savings, and thus no possibility of
capital accumulation. Those who have economic surpluses prefer going out, to
Madhubani and other urban centres. The only trade that appears to be
flourishing in the two settlements is that of private and informal money lending.


                                        62
This becomes even more evident when we look at their attitude towards their
current non-farm occupations, their perceptions on the value of education and
their aspirations for their future generations.

9.2 Work and Economic Life: Perhaps, one of the simply communicable ways
of judging a respondent’s attitude towards their current livelihood is to ask of
them if they would want their children to continue with it or with the same kind
of employment. Quite interestingly, a large majority of the respondents (75.3%)
responded in the negative i.e. they’d rather not see members of the next
generation engaging in the same or a similar occupation as them. Only 17
percent of the respondents reported a clear preference for their children to
continue in the same job as them.

However, what emerges with great clarity is that non-farm activity is preferable
over agriculture to nearly all of the respondents for their children’s futures,
which finds favour with only a small 3 percent. Among those who reported a
preference for non-farm activity over agriculture, we can further sort their
reported preferences between a salaried job (79.7%) followed by business in a
town (36.3) (see Table 16) (It does not add up to 100 because respondents had
the option of saying more than one ‘yes’).

Interestingly salaried job is the most preferred occupation for the next
generation, across all the communities, and no other occupation comes close to it
in that order. However, in the case of those who reported agriculture as a
preferred occupation over a non-farm activity for their children, there happen to
be interesting variations across communities. None of the SC respondents
responded with a “yes? for agriculture and only 4 percent reported that they
would like their children to continue in their current occupation, which is

                                        63
significantly less than the similar category of responses from among the EBC
respondents (22.5%) and from those among the trading castes (19.4%). Those
from the “upper castes? also reported having no liking for agriculture (0%).
Besides reflecting a desire for a stable economic life, the cross cutting preference
for a regular salaried job also tells us of the perceived fragility and dissatisfaction
with the current occupation in the local non-farm economy, which to many is
simply a survival strategy.

Even though the contexts may differ, similarly reported disenchantment with
agriculture appears to be the pervasive in the county. When Jodhka revisited his
study village near Panipat in Haryana during 2009-10, the responses to a similar
set of questions, were strikingly similar (Jodhka 2012):

       When we asked our respondents about their preferences for agriculture
       as a means of livelihood for their children or grandchildren (Question:
       Would you like your children/grandchildren to practice cultivation?),
       only around 8% of our respondents answered in the affirmative.
       Surprisingly, the responses to the question were quite similar across
       caste and occupational categories. Dalits and upper castes (5-6%) were
       the least interested in their families staying in farming but even
       cultivating farmers of the dominant castes (9%) did not want their
       children to practice agriculture. Only among the BCs, there was some
       desire to continue with agriculture (11%) (Jodhka 2012: 13).

Abetted by a generational shift away from land-based work and a policy failure
to create more opportunities, young men are “All Dressed Up with Nowhere to
Go? (Deuchar 2014). According to Jeffrey et. al. (forthcoming), an increased
investment in schooling has led people to come to imagine education as a
pathway to economic and social mobility. But since the 1980s economic change
has typically failed to generate white-collar jobs within the manufacturing and
services sectors, which has created a crisis of educated unemployment. Rodgers
et al (2013: 97) also suggest that in the case of Bihar, a college education and
beyond ‘drastically increases the chances of long term migration’, a highly
educated worker is three times as likely to migrate than a worker with no
schooling, which according to the authors indicates that ‘there is a dire lack of
appropriate opportunities for educated people in the survey villages’.

9.3 Education: Across social categories, respondents recognize and
acknowledge the value of education, which alone, according to them can enable
their children to find regular salaried jobs and pull them out of agriculture, with
dignity. However, they also realize that the currently available education in the
local schools is unlikely to be of help.


                                          64
The story of educational aspirations in the two settlements is indeed one of
contradictions. Among the young, imagining the future appears to be a
despondent exercise. Given the low level and quality of education, most of them
do not allot any premium to education. Those who do and have, cannot see any
returns. To be educated and unemployed creates a protracted sense of the
future. A man in his early twenties in Satghara, in the second year of studying for
his B.A. degree and also managing a mobile repair shop along with his brother
said:

       I want to either be a policeman or go abroad. My brother can manage this
       business. I want a salaried job. Don’t know if I’ll be able to do that…But
       one thing I am certain about is that when I have my own children I will do
       my best to educate as much as possible. I would like them to become
       scientists or cricket players.

Dilip Kumar Ram, a twenty-one year old Dalit boy, who works as an assistant in
an electronic repair shop, locally known as a ‘fitter’ studied until class eight. He
has done this for four years and now wants to set up his own shop. He regrets
having not studied much. He also regrets not having capital (poonji) to start his
own business. His parents did not have the wherewithal to educate him after
class eight and now he feels there are no avenues from where he can seek
financial support.

Amarnath Thakur, also a young man, from the Nai sub caste works as a
compounder with a doctor in the Satghara market. His father has a makeshift
arrangement as a barber on the footpath and earns around 100 rupees in a day.
Amarnath studied until high school after which he left for Delhi but could not
find any gainful employment and hence returned to Satghara. Now he is back to
continue working as a compounder, something he is despondent about.

9.4 Private Education: During our visit to both Bhagwatipur and Satghara, the
growth of private tuition centers was evident. In the main market establishments
of the village and the town, and on the outward fringes too, a variety of private
education providers have emerged. Day tuition centers, evening tuition centers,
private English medium schools, residential coaching centers and schools – their
presence reveals a clamour for education among those in the village and towns,
distant from urban centers of education, to be able to procure and provide
compatible educational services for their children. There is an acute
disenchantment with government run schools.

       If it were not for tuition centers, how would there be any education? The
       government schools are no good.


                                         65
These coaching and tuition centers are seen as a respectable source of
employment for the educated but unemployed young men in the settlements.
Given the value of a permanent sarkari naukri (government job), many young
men obtain degrees and prepare for competitive examinations that can help
them obtain one. However given the combination of the large number of
applicants and few numbers of seats, a lot of them are unable to make it.

For instance, in the small market establishment of Bhagwatipur, there are two
private English medium schools – Parvati Progressive School and Mithila World
School. Mithilesh Kumar, a twenty six year old man of the Teli caste among the
Baniyas, expressed his preference for a coaching center over agricultural work.
He runs the ‘Brilliant Coaching Center’ in Satghara and is also preparing for the
Railways SSC examination. Having studied for a B.Com degree from Madhubani,
Mithilesh is enthusiastic about his coaching center. During our visit, he reported
teaching 7 students whom he charged up to Rs. 200 per student. His father
helped him set up the business and according to Mithilesh:

       I want to make it bigger. Agriculture is troublesome, I find running a
       coaching center better. The income from agriculture is very low, and it is
       difficult work, coaching is an easier job.

However due to the low returns on education, given the poor quality of
education and lack of availability of jobs, there is no particular premium on
education for a large number of people.

       A graduate earns a maximum of Rs 4000 per month in the market, as a
       shop assistant or petty salesman. A daily-wage labour, on the other hand,
       can make up to Rs 250 per day. What is then, the real value of education, if
       it can’t provide a decent opportunity for labour and decent wage?

Educational attainment has certainly increased with time. Among many
respondents, padhai-likhai (reading-writing) was the only way out of the
economic despondency in the village while also being aware of the lack of return
on education. Even so, if we were to look at the educational attainment of the
respondents by age, as listed below, it becomes clear to us that it has risen with
time. For example, whereas 41 percent of those who were sixty years old or
more reported having received no formal education as compared to only 12
percent of those between 21 and 30 years old, and 5.6 percent among those
between 15 to 20 years old. Similarly, higher education appears to also have
increased among the younger – nearly 30 percent of those between 20 to 30
years old and 22 percent of those between 15 and 20 years old reported having
received a minimum of graduate education, compared to only 1 respondent in
those above 60 years old.

                                        66
The government’s schemes of mid-day meals and right to education for all too
did not seems to garner positive support, for the prevalence of corruption and of
neglect seems to override the aims of providing good quality education.

        The teachers can’t hit the children, nor fail them… it is only on pen and
        paper … give them food, give them the money and uniform etc… or a
        cycle… they have ruined education. Even these shiksha mitras, they don’t
        even know how to sign their own names. The government only wants
        records of nobody having failed.

        The teachers have to go and do a census count or look at poultry. What
        will they do? All the food that comes in for the students, the contractors
        and teachers eat it up anyway. Teachers have motorcycles, that is how
        well they get paid.

Box 3


 Parvati Progressive is a residential school on the edge of the Bhagwatipur market
 settlement. During the evenings, as the display board on the façade of the school
 entrance proclaimed, it also ran a ‘remedial centre; i.e. tuition for English speaking
 and for ‘building self confidence’ targetted at school children and young college
 graduates. Upon entrance, we were greeted by a twenty year old woman, Alka, who
 eventually told us that she had come to the school to be appointed as an
 administrator and care taker (for the children in residence) and that she used to live
 with her family in Darjeeling prior to coming to Bhagwatipur. ‘Parents do not like
 local teachers, especially when it comes to English speaking’, she said. ‘In Darjeeling,
 a widespread culture of missionary led education means a good knowledge of
 English and of speaking in English, which is valued in Bihar’. Alka had studied till
 class 12 in Darjeeling and like her, many of her friends have also been recruited by
 school owners in Bihar to work in schools in Bihar through a system of networks
 between school owners, book dealers and teachers. We were soon joined by Mr.
 Roshan Kumar Jha, who is the school manager. Mr. Jha recently finished a bachelors
 degree in marketing from Madhubani and is also preparing to write exams for a
 Chartered Accountant, while he appears for other advertised public service exams.
 The admission fee for the school is Rs. 1000 per student along with Rs 300 as the
 tuition fee between nursery and class two, Rs. 500 between three and five and Rs
 800 until class 8. They also provide transport services to students with a monthly fee
 between Rs. 350 and Rs. 400 depending upon the distance.

9.5: Caste, Education and Aspirations: The story of aspiration is also a
story of caste. It is not without the promise of social networks and social capital
that one can hope to fulfill aspirations, both of which are determined to a large
extent by one’s location in the caste hierarchy.

It clearly emerges from our field interviews and the survey that higher
educational achievement was closely tied with traditionally upper castes, which
in turn makes them eligible for higher paid skill-based jobs in the contemporary
job market. As we can see in the Table 24, as many as 44 percent of those who
reported having received no formal education were members of the scheduled
castes followed by Muslims at nearly 21 percent, which precludes them from
white collar jobs or jobs in the contemporary service sector. On the other hand,
44 percent of those who reported having acquired education until the graduate
level and beyond belonged to the traditional upper castes in both the
settlements. According to Ajay Kumar Jha, a young principal of the Parvati
Progressive School, a private school in Bhagwatipur, children of the agrani
(forward) castes do not attend school in the village, most of them can afford to
seek education outside Bhagwatipur and do so.

S. K. Jha, a forty eight year old Brahmin is the local homeopathy doctor (BHMS) in
Satghara. He also has a PhD degree in Maithili language. His father was the
headmaster of an upper primary government school in Satghara. Of the other
two brothers he has, one works in a bank in Bokaro in the Bokaro Steel Industry
and the other worked in Delhi before he moved back to Satghara to take care of
the 15 acres of land the three brothers own.

The disenchantment of the young from agriculture, across India is widely
documented, whether by economists in terms of labour force participation, by

                                         68
sociologists and anthropologists in terms of the interaction of gender and
generation and processes of localization and globalization or by policy makers
who are facing the dilemma of employment generation for such a significant shift
away from the agricultural sector (see Section 2 above). Mehta (2014) in her
ethnographic study of peri-urbanization in Uttarakhand states of the current
young generation that, ‘this is a generation whose educational qualifications,
employment trajectories and, above all, aspirations for the kinds of lives they
would like to live that has moved them far out of the orbit of anything their
elders might ever have envisaged’ (Mehta 2014:2).

The promise of education has also contributed to a culture of aspirational
livelihoods in the region. However the material limitations of resources, of access
and of relevant networks create a simultaneous sense of despondency with
education. A Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) in Satghara put it thus:

       Previously, it was an agriculture-dominated economy over here. Nearly
       90 percent of the people here practiced agriculture in Satghara. Until
       fifteen to twenty years ago, even we were dependent upon agriculture,
       my father also used to practice agriculture. Now, once we started getting
       (educationally) qualified, it was difficult since our father didn’t have
       enough resources to send us out of Madhubhani. So we had to manage
       within our limited resources, I first finished doing my high school, and
       then inter, then a B.A. and finally a M.A. – sometimes of our own and
       sometimes with my father’s support – I persisted. I left my job within the
       army as I didn’t have the 50,000 I needed to relocate etc. I finally obtained
       a RMP certificate and got a license, here from the Madhubani office.

A shopkeeper in Satghara who also gives out land for sharecropping informed us
that he had been facing a shortage of labour to hire for agriculture. According to
him:

       We are facing a strange situation. How can we continue practicing
       agriculture? I am soon going to be sixty. I should retire. Normally the next
       generation should take it up. However, my children have studied outside.
       They have worn pants all their life. How can they work on land? People
       will laugh at them. We cannot here. There is not decent labourer left here.

This is also a story of the overall decline of agriculture, which we have discussed
earlier (see Section 4).

10. Social Dynamics of Rural Non-farm Economy: Concluding
Comments

As would be the case with most other states of India, Bihar has its diversity:
socio-cultural as well as economic and developmental. Economic and
developmental process are also influenced or shaped by the proximity of a
particular region/sub-region to power centers, the caste and community
composition of the area and the advantages and limitations of its given ecological
realities. The dynamics of emerging non-farm economy are thus likely to vary
across districts and sub-regions of the state of Bihar.

Notwithstanding its high growth rates over the past decade and more, Bihar
remains one of the least developed regions of the country with high poverty and
poor performance on most indicators of human development. Bihar has also not
witnessed any significant growth in the manufacturing sector of its economy
over the past two decades. In fact, industrial growth has been virtually absent in
the region. However, interestingly, its rural non-farm economy has grown,
almost at par with the pace at the national level (see Table 1).

What is then, the nature and reason for the growth of the non-farm economy in
rural Bihar? Through this research we have been able to identify three broad
factors that have contributed to the rise of the non-farm economy in rural Bihar.
First and foremost is the decline of agriculture. This decline has been all round:
economic, social and political. Given the growing density of population in the
region and uncertainty caused by frequent floods and drought, abetted by a lack
of investments in building agricultural infrastructure by the state, agriculture is
no longer a viable occupation for a large majority of the rural population. The
holdings have become so small that they can’t even fulfill the subsistence needs
of the local population. Agriculture has also declined socially. As is the case with
most other regions of the country, younger generations, even in families where
the land holdings are large, no longer view agriculture as an aspirational
occupation. The political churning that the region has experienced over the last
three decades has also made the agriculturally dominant groups marginal to the
local politics and power structure.

The second, and perhaps even more important, factor has been the growing
outmigration from Bihar. Motivated or compelled by “push? of the local
economic situation, young men began to move out, sometime in the 1970s, to far
off places for work. Initially a small proportion of them went to places like
Punjab and Calcutta, the trend continuing into the decades of the 1980s and
1990s. By turn of the century nearly three-fourths of the rural households in
districts like Madhubani had at least one male members of the family working
outside the village, mostly in far off cities and towns and some even abroad.

                                         70
Unlike the usual process of migration, which tends to be one way with people
moving from rural to urban centres, resulting in a steady process of
urbanization, most of the migration from Madhubani district and much of rural
of Bihar tends to be circular in nature. Consequently, despite such high rates of
migration, Bihar has seen no spurt in its urban population or desertion of it rural
settlements. However, the seasonal and circular out-migration of labour from
Bihar is changing many dimensions and dynamics of the region. The rise of the
rural non-farm economy is one such change.

The circular migration of working Biharis means that while the young men go
out for work, their parents and wives stay back in the village. A direct implication
of this is that not only do they regularly come back to the village to visit their
families every few months (generally twice in a year), most of them also return
for good at the end of their working life, when they are 45 to 50 years of age and
can no longer bear the hardships of life as a migrant worker. In the interim, they
send regular remittances to support their families. A share of these remittances
is invested in the land being cultivated by the family left behind; the rest is
available for meeting the consumption needs of the family. The remittances also
create a demand for a variety of goods and services, from groceries for domestic
consumption to medical stores and educational centers, schools and tuition
centers. The local entrepreneurs, many of whom have themselves been migrants,
open shops and other outlets to fulfill these needs.

The third important factor that has encouraged the growth of non-farm economy
is the recent expansion of road and communication networks. Not only are
towns like Madhubani well connected to the state capital and other towns of the
region through good quality highways, the local areas, the rural settlements, are
also well connected through pucca roads. Cell phones and digital networks have
also reached the interiors of Bihar. Besides making physical movement and
communication possible, they also make migration convenient and easier.

However, as mentioned above, our survey and close qualitative observations
demonstrate, the local non-farm economy, which has been steadily growing over
the past three decades, remains a subsistence economy. Even though the
traditional jajmani type relations have disintegrated, a good proportion of
occupational categories continue to be structured around caste lines. Many of
these caste related occupations also happen to be low-income, low-value
occupations. More importantly, those from the traditionally “low? status
communities, the SCs and EBCs, are more likely to be working in the low value
non-farm activities than the “others?. In other words, within the non-farm sector,
their occupations are often located at the lower end of the occupational
hierarchy. They also tend to work from temporary premises, which adds to their

                                        71
vulnerability. The activities that generate higher income and carry superior
status tend to be the monopolies of the traditionally upper castes or the upper
OBC, the trading caste.

The local non-farm economy is not based on modern technology, except where
technology itself is a source of employment, such as cell phone repair shops.
Even in such cases, their social organization remains low skill based and almost
universally informal. Even those dealing with things like modern medicine, are
likely to be working without any formal qualifications and licenses from the
relevant departments.

The non-farm economy of the two settlements also does not seem to be
generating any surplus. Its expansion is mostly horizontal and there is little
evidence of it acquiring any kind of dynamism of its own beyond its current form
of low-end commercial enterprises. Most of the enterprises are self-owned and
appear to be temporary in nature. Those involved with these activities also do
not see their current occupations taking them very far.

Decline of agriculture and disintegration of traditional power structure does not
seem to be giving way to a dynamic market driven economy of an equal society.
Expansion of non-farm economy has meant a growing economic dominance of
the trading castes, such as the Suris in Bhagwatipur. Money lending businesses,
which too are controlled by the traditional goldsmiths and those from the
trading castes, seems to be flourishing in the two settlements. The poor often
borrow money at high interest rates, ranging from 3 to 10 percent monthly
interest rates, which keep them trapped in the subsistence economy, even when
they go out for work or have their own petty business in the village.

During the last three decades, the rural landscape of Bihar has witnessed fairly
radical changes in its social and political relations. The decline, and near
disappearance of the semi-feudal patriarch has not only transformed the
dynamics of the local and regional levels of politics, it has also opened-up
possibilities of economic change. The ‘revolution of aspirations’ is not merely an
urban reality. The poor in rural Bihar also aspire for a better life, for which they
are willing to travel out of the village and to work hard, wherever they can find a
job. The discourse of “economic backwardness? generally tends to discount the
significance of social and political process. However, it is important to situate
economic changes in the larger historical processes, regionally, nationally and
globally.

11. Policy Implication of Study Findings

The limited nature of the study in two locations in one district of Bihar means
that drawing broad policy and project design inferences must be undertaken
with caution. More research across different locations are needed to further
explore some of the main themes and findings of this study. However, the results
of this study do have a number of policy and project design implications. Firstly,
the largely subsistence nature of non-farm enterprises observed in Satghara and
Bhagwatipur means that the assumption that growth of the non-farm sector is a
sign of economic potential and income growth may not be true across locations.
Therefore, government programs such as the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban
Mission that are seeking to use the size and rate of growth of the non-farm sector
as one of the indicators for selecting ‘economically dynamic’ sites for
intervention need to exercise caution.

Agriculturally vibrant locations with tradable surpluses may be more
economically vibrant than locations with rapid non-farm sector growth. Rather
than making an automatic dichotomy between farm and non-farm occupations,
and assuming that one is more productive and economically dynamic than the
other, it would be more prudent to focus on productivity and enterprise level
indicators such as, for example, growth in incomes, size of enterprises in terms of
number of employees and revenues; trade of goods and services with extra-local
markets; local skill base; growth in use of institutionalized credit; and use of
electrically powered machinery.

Secondly, existing non-farm enterprises may not be appropriate targets for
policies and programs seeking to enhance non-farm growth in a location. 97% of
non-farm enterprises across both locations studied were self-owned without any
employees. A bulk of these enterprises had a low-skill base; used no ‘modern’
technology or powered machinery; and generated no surplus or savings. More
enterprise specific research is required to understand the dynamics at an
enterprise level, but the findings of this study suggests that investing in such
enterprises would not necessarily lead to enterprise growth without
introduction of new, more productive technologies and enhancing the skill base
of the owner-entrepreneur to be able to use these technologies.

Thirdly, growth of the non-farm sector may not automatically result in inclusion
of marginalized groups. Targeted interventions are needed to ensure inclusion
marginalized castes and communities in specific non-farm occupations. Areas of
focus for potential interventions include reducing barriers of entry of
marginalized groups to non-traditional occupations; enhancing access to credit


                                        73
and ownership of productive assets. Fourthly, women seem to be severely
underrepresented in non-farm occupations and also face gendered access to
specific sets of occupations traditionally associated with them. Again, targeted
interventions are needed to change aspirations, mindsets and barriers to entry
to ensure greater access and inclusion of women to a wider set of non-farm
occupations.

Lastly, the wide prevalence of migration, its central role in rural households’
coping strategies, and its circular nature in the two locations studied points to
the need for further research to identify intervention points that could enhance
outcomes from migration for poor rural households. Remittances from migrants
are playing a key role in enhancing household income and consumption levels,
and driving demand for new products and services in sending areas. Also,
approximately half the respondents currently engaged in non-farm activity in the
two study locations reported having been migrant workers earlier. Intervention
that seek to reduce costs of migrations and adjustment in destination locations,
and build the skill-base of such migrants have the potential not only to enhance
outcomes for migrants in destination areas, but could also have a positive impact
on the sending locations as well.

Appendix 2. Descriptive Accounts of Non-farm Occupations
2.1 Drivers and Transport:

2.1.1: Rajnagar Railway station, Satghara and Autorickshaw stand,
Bhagwatipur: The growth in automobiles and in road connectivity is also
strikes one’s sight while movong around the landscapes of Bihar. While in
Satghara, alighting at the Rajnagar railway station from Madhubani, we were
greeted by the sight of half a dozen autorickshaws lined up outside the entrance.
The drivers were sat inside them, waiting for passengers to get on board.
However most of those who got off from the train on the railway station took to
cycle rickshaws or headed out into town on their own. Even as we walked
around the complex circumscribing the railway station, the autorickshaws
stayed put, and the drivers seemed to loiter around the complex with the
knowledge that no one would actually get on to them. For the few hours that we
spent there, not one autorickshaw drove out. And that, according to the drivers,
was how most of their days went.

However, on the specific occasions when the long distance train from Punjab and
Delhi arrives, business for them looks up. People from Satghara and nearby
villages, who move to various destinations outside Bihar in search for work and
livelihoods, use the autorickshaws to go home when they arrive. ‘It is usually on
such occasions that we get customers, nobody who lives in Satghara uses the
auto (rickshaw) ordinarily’. All of these autorickshaws were purchased on loans
by various banks – the Indian Overseas Bank, the State Bank of India, which have
been paid off. Most of these drivers are former migrants, who have since
returned to Satghara and now eke a living as autorickshaw drivers. Out of a
nearly dozen drivers we spoke with, the set represented a varied mix of caste
and livelihood backgrounds. ‘Drivery’ hence emerges as one of the more (caste)
secular professions in the contemporary non-farm economy.

The Rajnagar railway station also has a parking stand for motorcycles and
bicycles. Daily and frequent commuters park their vehicles for the day at this
stand for a fee of five rupees. During our visit, the parking lot was full with over a
hundred and fifty bicycles and a dozen motorcycles, which belonged to the
frequent commuters. As the day of our visit coincided with a Sunday, the


                                               77
contractor told us that these numbers increased during other days of the week
when all the shops in the main town are open for business.

Bhagwatipur does not have a rail line connecting it, unlike Satghara. Also, unlike
Satghara, there is no defined autorickshaw stand within or without the market.
Towards the two ends of the stretch of the main road that marks the spread of
Bhagwatipur, autorickshaw drivers gather at the beginning and the end of the
day to collect passengers. Conversations at these two junctures revealed a high
proportion of Muslim autorickshaw drivers (considering the higher proportion
of Muslim population in Bhagwatipur), most of whom were former migrants and
had also bought the autorickshaws through loans via banks. Most of the current
drivers had also worked as drivers as migrants in cities like Delhi and Mumbai
and wanted to make use of the skill once they returned. Thirty year old
Mohammad Noor Alam said,

       I learnt the skill of ‘drivery’ while I was outside, that is all I know. I don’t
       have any agricultural land. So what would I think of doing if I were to
       come back to the village? Buying an autorickshaw seemed like the most
       probable option, and that’s what I did.

However, the paucity of regular/daily passengers is a problem that all of the
drivers at the Satghara station complained of. ‘We can stand here all day without
moving’, said one of the auto drivers.

2.1.2: Taxi stand, Madhubani, towards Bhagwatipur: Situated at a distance of
13 kilometers from Madhubani, Bhagwatipur is easily accessible by shared taxis
and autos that charge a maximum of Rs. 20 per passenger. They queue up near
the railway station, on the other side, and are regulated by an informal
arrangement that allows each vehicle a maximum of 25 minutes to fill in
passengers after which it must leave so that the other taxis have a chance to do
business as well. As we waited in the regutted jeep that we would take to
Bhagwatipur, we got talking with a young man.

Zakir (name changed) is a young Muslim boy, all of 16 to 18, who learnt the trade
of ‘drivery’ on the go. Given that he and his father are the only two able bodied
men in the house, the other members of which constitute his mother and three
sisters, the need to meet their financial requirements has fallen upon the two of
them. His father currently lives in Delhi and works as a watchman. According to
Zakir, he began working, first as a helper and then as a driver in Madhubani,
which got him a chance to do so in Patna and Mumbai, once he moved from being
a helper to a driver. As he said, ‘I went to Mumbai with a clan relative from the
village but came of my own, once in the city’. He claimed to have had a fake
driving license (as he was underage), which he used to work as a driver in

                                          78
Mumbai. Currently, Zakir owns and drives Tata Sumo Magic between Madhubani
and the next 40 km at the most, and hopes to move back to the big city once
again to be able to earn better.

Most of the drivers had moved from regutted jeeps and vans towards Tata Magic,
financed by banks or by auto finance companies on an average EMI of Rs 12, 700
per month over a period of 36 months. As drivers at the stand told us, it meant
that they had to earn a minimum of Rs. 450 per day to be able to pay off the loan
over the required period of time. Previously, the jeeps were owned by the higher
castes and rented out to the drivers. However there is a high increase in the
numbers of owners-cum-drivers across a wide spectrum of castes. Most of these
drivers are young men, who have lived and worked as drivers outside Bihar in
areas like Mumbai, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab - only to
return to the village once they are married and have a family and leave once
again when they have the choice and need to.

2.1.3: Madhubani Bus Stand: Madhubani is well connected to other towns and
cities with an elaborate and frequent network of buses, both private and public.
There are two bus stands in the town, public and private respectively. Among
public buses, two air-conditioned Volvo buses leave Madhubani for Patna daily,
once in the morning and once after noon. Most of these passengers are made up
of students, tradesmen and government officials, the ones who can afford to pay
for the comparatively expensive bus tickets. Reservations can also be made
online as well, a facility provided by the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation
(BSRTC), which is increasingly becoming popular among passengers.

However, it is the private bus stand, less than a kilometer away from the public
bus stand that represents the extent of movement and mobility between
destinations in Bihar. While we walked towards the bus stand, we were greeted
by an uninterrupted supply of buses moving out of the stand towards their
respective destinations, clearly marked out by tin sheets at the bottom right
corner of the windscreen – Chhapra, Pandaul, Patna, Darbangha, Muzaffarpur,
Samastipur, Hajipur. Packed with passengers, a bus left every couple of minutes,
creating heavy traffic on the adjacent road, in the supply of a steady stream of
buses. Local estimates had it that roughly 80 buses moved into and out of the bus
stand each day, exacerbated on occasions of festivals and marriages. Frequent
passengers were made up of those who lived and worked outside Madhubani but
at a distance that they can travel over for a couple of days each week, students,
those coming for official needs to the court and district head office, those in
needs of health care and medical advice, among others.

These buses are owned and operated by private transport companies, dominated
by a handful companies that control the ownership of most of them. It is

                                       79
interesting to note that the ownership of these transport companies was
controlled among the social and political elite of the region i.e. among Bhumihars
and Brahmins with a modest entry made by the Yadavs in the past decade.

2.2. Traditional Occupations

2.2.1 Bangle making and selling, Lehri community, Bhagwatipur: Manju, a
40 years old mother of four girls and two boys, belongs to the Lehri community
of Bhagwatipur. The Lehris are traditional bangle makers and sellers who make
bangles out of lac. Manju Devi is married to a man, 6 years older than her who
sells bangles on his bicycle at the local haat (market) and from door to door
within the village. According to Manju Devi,

       We have no idea of how to do agriculture. We inherited the business of
       selling bangles from our ancestors and have been landless over many
       generations.

Some of the Lehri families continue to make bangles, however most of them only
sell them. A large number of the families among the Lehris has given up making
bangles, they merely sell them. They usually take the bangles from wholesalers
on credit and pay them back at a later date, after the sales. Manju Devi informed
us that she and her family purchased bangles from Darbangha, Muzaffarpur and
Ferozabad and then sold them within the local market. Some of them also sell at
the weekly haat (market). But she was also wary of the prospects of such a trade
and asked, rhetorically,

       Who wears bangles any more? Glass bangles are cheaper to buy and wear,
       they come in more colours that the lac ones. We only do good business on
       occasions of weddings and festivals when people buy from us, else it is
       hopeless.

Out of her two sons, neither has gone to school. She was anxious about the fact
that the younger one, who is sixteen years old, wants to go out of Bihar to make
some money but knows no skill or trade. According to her, it would be better if
he had the opportunity of learning something within the settlement without
having to leave the home and family, ‘cities are a bad influence on young men’,
she said, ‘and its hard to shake off that influence’. Her elder son, who is twenty
years old works as an apprentice in the collar making unit of a textile factory in
Mumbai and now that one of her sons has already left, she doesn’t want the other
one to leave too.

All of Manju Devi’s daughters have studies until high school. She got the educated
with the motive of finding suitable grooms for them, but in the absence of her

                                       80
capacity to be able to pay the kind of dowry that would find her daughters a
suitable groom, she is anxious. ‘We don’t want to incur a loan for our daughter’s
dowry, we don’t have the capacity to pay it off’. She hopes that her daughters will
be married into ‘good’ families and that their being educated is an advantage that
can get them there.

Most of these families are also landless. According to one of the respondents,
they neither have the promise of agriculture nor prospects for their current
trade. They’d rather not have their children (especially boys) enter the trade.
Badrinath Shah, an eighty year old member of the Lehri community, whose
family has been engaged in the trade for at least six generations said –

       If the children feel like discontinuing this line of work, they may do so. But
       we are confronted by a lack of capital. We only try that they are able to do
       something else.

2.2.2. Madhubani Paintings: Named after the region where it is practiced,
Madhubani is a folk style of painting that draws from local stories and legends
about gods and goddesses, both vernacular and universal to Hinduism.
Communities and villages, which practice it are dispersed across the Madhubani
district and the one that our research team had a chance to visit was the
Mahapatra Tola in the Satghara area. The Mahapatras are a Brahmin community
of the region, traditionally ordained to perform rituals at funerals and at
shraddhas (remembrance ceremonies for ancestors). Compared with men, a
higher number of women are involved in learning and doing the artform.

According to Basuki Nath Jha, a thirty year old male resident of the Mahapatra
Tola in Satghara, there are nearly 350 Madhubani artists in the Satghara and
neighbouring panchayat of Chichadi. In the Mahapatra tola alone, there are
approximately 150 households, all of which are involved in producing
Madhubani paintings. Most of these artists are recognized by the Government of
India by the way of an identity card issued by the Ministry of Textiles. Various
support projects in the form of the Planning Commission, international
organizations and non-governmental organizations have been extended to the
community of artists. Meera Devi, Basuki’s mother and the leading artist in the
area told us that she has had the opportunity to go to various cities – Delhi,
Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Ranchi, Jaipur and Singapore to attend exhibitions
with her own paintings and also to train people in the art of Madhubani at
institutes like the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad and the Srishti School
of Art, Bangalore. She also trained women in her own village and they often hold
training workshops, with the support of organizations like Bangla Natak and
they have website www.banglanatak.com.


                                         81
The business of painting is highly feminized whereas the business of marketing
and linkages has a high male participation. Among the men of the village, there
was great anxiety about their importance and requirement as rite performing
Brahmins.

       Young men have moved out in search of jobs. The respect and
       requirement for Brahmins is not like what it used to be. Out of the 150
       households in our tola, at least 50 households have sent one man out for
       work. My own son did a B.A. but he has no job. But what is the point? We
       have managed to buy a taxi for him, he now takes care of that. We are
       poor Brahmins, one day we will die poor

All of the households in the Mahapatra tola are landed, they cultivate it under a
sharecropping system. However, their diminished ritual importance is a source
of anxiety for the community and its patriarchs. Some young men have acquired
the knowledge and skills to be ritual performing Brahmins, however most of the
others have moved towards more secular jobs in the city and within the
settlement.

As far as the skill of Madhubani painting is concerned, it is passed along
generations within the family and caste community, mostly to women but also to
men. Families, which have been able to link up to market networks of exhibition
and distribution, have made the form of painting a family business and aim to
cultivate it to a more profitable venture. Under the Jeevika program of the World
Bank in Bihar, in collaboration with the state government, women artists have
also formed a self-help group, which they can make use of to buy raw materials
and tools needed for their paintings. According to Meera Devi, it can only become
lucrative as a source of income, once it is well marketed and has more chance to
be showcased at exhibitions and fairs.

2.2.3: Jewelry and Money Lending: Jewelry shops are a common sight in the
Satghara market area. In the narrow market streets that run parallel and meet
frequently at intersections, jewelry shops are the most commonly sighted. Large
boards advertising the name of the shop and the owner mount the entrance of
the fairly large shops, compared to other establishments. Flyers and posters
advertising the most popular and big shops announce themselves right from the
exit at the railway station and accompany one through the market. The first
impression that one carries from these sights is that of jewelry making and
selling being a big business in town.

The jewelry shops in Satghara range from small outlets for jewelry makers-cum-
sellers (traditionally of the Sonar caste) to medium scale shops with more than
one jewelry maker (Sonar) and owner-cum-seller (Baniya) to large ones, which

                                       82
have jewelry making workshops and material they get from elsewhere. The
largest shop in the town of Satghara is that of a jeweler. Mahadev Shah
Baidyanath Prasad Jewelers belies its presence and location. Set amidst the
narrow market lanes, the shop dwarfs the other establishments nearby. Flashing
contemporary architecture, design and interiors and a large board in golden
letters on the outside, announcing its name, Mahadev Shah, jewelers could well
have been in one of the metropolitan centers. The shop belongs to one of the
sons of Mahadev Shah Amarnath Jewellers, one of the biggest jewelers that
contemporary Satghara has seen. After his death, his business was distributed
among his sons, who have now opened up their own jewelry shops in various
parts of the settlement, bearing the prefix of Mahadev Shah. While walking
around the Satghara market, therefore, it is not surprising to come across nearly
half a dozen shops that bear the prefix ‘Mahadev Shah’ for a jewelry business.

Bhagwatipur, too, has its share of such jewelry shops, though perhaps not as
densely distributed. However it is interesting to note the combined function that
these jewelry shops perform, doubling up as centers for moneylending too. One
of the biggest buildings in Bhagwatipur is one that doubles up as a jewelry and
moneylending center. The structure wears a serene look, each time that one
passes it by, one wonders what is actually happening behind the doors? All
activities are hushed up, curtains drawn tight as people queue up outside the
main room giving it the impression of a local dispensary. A peep through the
window reveals serious negotiations over items of jewelry between the
moneylender and the customer. Some men stand guard at the door and don’t
appreciate the prying about. Neighbouring shops and local shopkeepers will tell
you that it is the largest money lending business within Bhagwatipur and in
areas nearby. The owner is a man from the Suri sub caste of Baniyas and is also a
jewelry seller.

Therefore, both in Bhagwatipur and in Satghara, a large part of the money
lending business is controlled by the jewelry shop owners. Unlike the Sonar caste
group, i.e. the goldsmiths, which is an artisan caste group – those who make
items of jewelry, these shops and business is controlled by the Baniya sub castes
of Suri and Teli both in Bhagwatipur and in Satghara. These moneylenders
provide loans at high rates of interest - anything between 3 to 10 percent per
month, depending upon the duration and nature of the loan. They also act as the
financiers for the newly established businesses in the towns, a significant
percentage of the new business reported having taken a loan from the local
money lenders towards the investment costs.

It is also interesting to note that our fieldwork coincided with a robbery scandal
in Gurgaon that had connections to a jewelry shop in Bhagwatipur. In September
2014, the house of a jeweler was robbed by the domestic help, a man whose

                                       83
family lives in Andhathari, a bloc near Bhagwatipur. He was eventually nabbed
by the Haryana Police in December 2014, during the same time that our
fieldwork was being conducted, from his home in Andhathari. The accused had
sold some of the jewels and jewelry to a jewelry shop in Bhagwatipur, Nancy
Jewelers, which was the first commercial establishment we listed and
interviewed in Bhagwatipur.

Sanjay Soni, the proprietor of Nancy Jewelers, who was taken away by the police
for interrogation regarding the purchase of stolen jewels is a twenty eight year
old man of the Suri sub caste of Baniyas in Bhagwatipur. He is a graduate from
the R. N. College in Madhubani town and has been married for a few years. It was
his elder brother, who works as an accountant in a jewelry shop in Darbangha
who suggested that he open a jewelry shop and helped him establish one. Prior
to the jewelry business, Sanjay worked as sales agent in the ICICI credit card
wing in Saket, as he reported. According to Sanjay, his brother had opened up the
shop for him and he merely managed it. He’d rather do ‘multi level marketing’ as
he likes to call it, which he could not explain further but insisted that it was
better than a business in jewelry as there was no black money in ‘multi level
marketing’.

The family associated with Nancy Jewelers, including Sanjay’s aged father is also
the group of people who are devotees of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, a neo
religious movement with origins in Punjab. According to Sanjay’s father, whom
we spoke to at a later date, he was introduced to the group by Sanjay, who in
turn was introduced to it during his stay in Delhi. ‘He was a very restless person,
he could not put his mind at one place but the influence of Radha Soami was
good for him, he is better now and is handling the business’, he stated. He now
organizes a weekly Satsang in town, every Sunday and makes an annual trip to
Punjab to visit the ashram. Nearly hundred people gather in the local temple in
the town every week for a satsang, and the numbers have grown gradually,
according to Sanjay’s father.

In Satghara, most of the commercial activities and operators have organized
themselves into trading associations. The jewelers too have done so. According
to most of the respondents, from across trading groups and caste groups, doing
so is meant to assure to things- firstly, a near uniformity in pricing and of
selecting a day off per week.

2.2.4. Carpenter (Badhai): As a skill, of working with wood and related
material to fashion it into items of daily use and convenience, carpentry is the
traditional occupation of the badhai caste group. However unlike most of the
other traditional caste based occupations, which have either been displaced by
newer forms of material and processing or by diminished requirement, furniture

                                        84
continues to be a significant requirement. Even though it may now have
disintegrated from the jajmani system, it exists among other market activities in
a contemporary-commercial fashion. Therefore, those who continue to learn and
practice carpentry skills have opened up furniture shops in the market, which
require higher investments and labour.

2.2.5: Tailoring (Darzi): The Idris caste group among the Muslims in the region
have been tailors traditionally. All of the tailoring establishments in both
settlements are run by Muslim tailors. They are usually small establishments,
constituting a Master tailor, with a few apprentice tailors, all male. The business
of tailoring is a skill that is learnt through apprenticeship. Like a young tailor in
the Bhagwatipur market told us

       My maternal uncle had trained us how to do this, since then I began doing
       my own thing. Now I shall continue doing this, it seems appropriate to me.
       Now it is the time for readymade garments, the demand for stitching
       seems to have declined.

The skill of tailoring is hence acquired from a young age. Fifty-year-old
Mohammad Zakir told us that he had run his tailor shop for thirty years and now
his 16 year old son was also training as an apprentice under him and would take
over the shop from him. Fifty-five years old Abdul Mazeed has managed his
tailoring shop for nearly twenty-two years and presently his son also helps him.
Among other items, he also stitches bags and seat covers for motorcycles.
Abdul’s uncle had taken him to Kolkata when he was a young boy and he had
trained under him.

Some of the tailors also use their skills when they migrate, especially in garment
export factories in Delhi and NCR. Even in the textile power looms of Bhiwandi,
near Mumbai, there is a high presence of Muslim migrants from Bihar and from
Madhubani. The apprentice tailors who work in these establishments are paid on
a piece rate basis. Mohammad Raza used to work as a tailor in Badarpur, near
Delhi but did not earn much and decided to come back to Satghara and set shop.

Lack of capital –and lack of access to networks to procure capital – banks are also
not willing to give loans.

       They ask for papers, and they ask for land, to give a loan. I don’t have any l
       and, how will I ever provide them any papers?

2.2.6. Barbers (Nai): Among the remnants of the jajmani system, one of the
services that has sustained itself, albeit in a substantively transformed fashion, is
that of the barber, called Nai in Hindi. One only has to walk the length of the

                                         85
markets in both the settlements to notice the frequency with which they appear.
Signboards announcing their names are mounted at the entrance of the shops,
listing all the services they provide. Both the owners and the customers are
exclusively male and all the shop owners, without an exception are from the Nai
caste group. It is also interesting to note that apart from the regular nai services
– haircut, beard trimming and shaving – these ‘saloons’ as they are locally
advertised also provide contemporary meterosexual grooming services like
eyebrow shaping and facial massages for men. Though they are targeted at the
dulha (groom) for his wedding day, they seem to have a ready market among the
young male population.

Among those who have now set up commercial shops, there is an understanding
that the jajmani system of services could not be a support for their livelihood.
Kundan, a young man from the Nai caste who runs a ‘saloon’ in Bhagwatipur
apprised us –

       It is not economically viable to go from home to home, that can’t sustain
       me. That is why I set up a shop.

Even though the barber services have now become commercialized to a great
extent, some of our respondents also informed us how they went to the badaa
jaat (upper caste) households on occasions where the services of the nai are
required traditionally, for example upon the death of a family member. These
have however diminished. Chedi Thakur, thirty year old barber who has been
doing the business for nearly 15 years described to us how he still performed his
jajmani services as a nai –

       I go to the jajmaan’s house each week, for shaving. He gives me money
       once in a year.

But that is also not the only way they support themselves and their family. Not
only have the nais set up shop in the market, they are also members of the All
India Nai Association (see photo for Hindi name). According to Vinod Kumar
Thakur, Prakhand (Block) Secretary of the Nai Sangh in Satghara, mobilizing and
organizing people into an association wasn’t an easy task. There are currently 31
members, according to him but previously

       Everybody had scattered, it was very difficult to organize everybody into
       a body. The organization was running in nearly all villages, albeit by
       different names, now, since 2004, we are running under one banner – All
       India Nai Mahasabha.



                                         86
Upon the need for sangh (association), Vinod Kumar Thakur described to us why
the needs for an association was felt in the first place –

       Our caste (nai) had no place in the society. We worked as labour but
       wouldn’t get our dues, everybody used to suppress us. Anybody would
       come and hit one of the nai shopkeepers for no apparent reason. Nothing
       was organized – we were pressurized into working for low wages. Under
       the practice of landlordism, the jajmaans would bother us.

However, having organized themselves into an association now, Vinod listed to
us the benefits of having one:

       First of all, we emphasized upon internal unity. We also emphasize on
       education – we’d like that the forthcoming generation pay attention
       towards their education. Then rates for work, if we both have to work in
       the same market, and one of us works for 5 rupees and the other for two,
       then it will be a bad market for everybody. So we decided to fix a rate and
       make it enforceable. Once it is fixed, how can anyone not follow it?

However, the increasing number of barber -shops and saloons is also a source of
anxiety for the existing ones.

2.2.7: Butcher (Kasai): Muslims have traditionally held the occupation of a
butcher in both the settlements; meat butchering shops are exclusively owned
and managed by Muslims. During the course of our visit in and around Satghara,
which was nearly a month, Mohammad Irfan had already shut his butcher shop
for business. During a discussion with him, he had previously told us that he had
invested in this business out of his own savings as a migrant worker in Delhi.
However his business was now running into a loss and he soon saw himself shut
shop.

Some of the butchers also have their own poultry farms. Mohammad Ishrafil of
the Fakir sect among Muslims started a poultry farm as recently as two years
ago, where most of his family and an additional employee are engaged.
Mohammad Ishrafil sold two katthas of his roadside land to be able to raise Rs.
100,000 for his establishment – he has taken the land on lease for which he pays
Rs. 8,000 annually. Two of his sons are currently studying and one of Mohammad
Ishrafil’s primary motivation to start this venture was to be able to support his
son’s education. However he now feels that this business is ‘risky’, it depends
upon the season and if the poultry is able to remain disease free. He already feels
that he will be unable to make it run successfully and would need more capital to
do something with it, which he currently does not have.


                                        87
2.2.8. Cobbler (Mochi): One of the other traditional occupations that continue
to operate in the contemporary context along caste-community lines is that of a
cobbler (mochi). It involves the repair and mending, polishing and cleaning of
footwear. Currently designated as an SC group, cobblers were traditionally
integrated in the jajmani system. In the contemporary market however, they
operate commercially and have small units from which they operate in the
market place, mostly by the road, at turns without a formal physical structure.
Such arrangements require low investments and therefore seem do-able for
many. Bittu Mochi, fifty years old, has recently returned from New Delhi, having
worked in Mumbai and Nepal before that –

       I stay at home, didn’t have anything worthwhile to do, thought that I
       might as well start this. It requires the least amount of investment.

Shatrudhan Ram, a forty year old cobbler in the Satghara markey also spoke of
the limitation that the unavailability of capital posed for his business.

   There is a lack of capital, if I had it, I would have either expanded this work or
   taken up a new one.

2.2.9 Paan Sellers (Barai): Among the occupation based distribution of caste
and sub-castes, the group that identifies itself as ‘barai’ is the one associated with
the sale of paan leaves in wholesale to paan-shops as well as those operating
their own. Designated among the Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs), the barai
caste is traditionally involved in the growing and selling of paan leaves in the
region. A typical paan-shop is a small and informal arrangement in the market,
usually by the road, selling items like cigarettes, bidis, tobacco, sweets other than
paan. Some of these are owned by those who had migrated out of the settlement
and are now back.

2.2.10. Washerman (Dhobi): Like most other traditional occupations, the
practice of being a dhobi has also been feminized to a large extent, i.e. it is
practiced mostly by women of the sub-caste with which it has been traditionally
associated. According to Datta’s research (2011) on the impact of male migration
on women’s lives in rural Bihar, women of the dhobi community, ‘in addition to
washing and ironing clothes all by themselves, (they) were also involved in
delivering clothes to their jajmans, an activity, which was only done by men
earlier’. Similar to Datta’s (2011) findings in the district of Gopalganj, the
practice of jajmani among the dhobis in both Satghara and Bhagwatipur in
Madhubani district no longer exists.

Karu Devi is a fifty-year-old Dhobi woman who was widowed a few years ago. All
of her three sons have been working petty jobs in a hotel in Jaipur for the last

                                         88
three years. She had to sell whatever land they had for cash, which was required
for a court case that her husband was party to. She and her sons had to also incur
debt to start working as a laundry, from the bank, which they have managed to
pay off. However, they are still indebted to the local moneylender for the
expenditure for the court case. According to her, her sons would rather not work
as a dhobi in the village and chose to go to Jaipur instead.

2.2.11: Puffed Rice and Sattu (Bhuja and Sattu: Halwai): ‘Bhuja’ i.e. puffed
rice and sattu (mixture of ground pulses and cereal) are items of staple diet in
the Bihar region. Traditionally, women of the Kanu sub caste among the Halwai
would procure rice from the fields in return for labour, which she would then
roast and puff for sale. The activity has now become commercialized and even
ingenuously mechanized (photo of jugaad) and there are a significant number of
shops that make and sell both bhuja and sattu. These are exclusively owned by
those of the Halwai caste and among them, by the sub-caste of Kanus.

2.2.12: Bidi Makers: One of the other traditional occupations one could come
across in the market settlemt in Satghara was that of didi making. On further
enquiry, we gathered there were between 600 and 800 bidi makers in the
Satghara panchayat. However, there has been a sharp decline in the number of
bidi makers in recent time. Given the fact that none of the current generation has
joined the craft of making bidis coupled with the fact that many of the bidi
makers have aged and died or shifted to daily wage labourers, they are fast
diminishing. Numerically, there are more number of individuals from Muslim
community working in bidi making. Among Hindus, landless labourers such as
Chamar, Dhanuk and others have been working in bidi making.

According to an elderly bidi maker in the Satghara market settlement,

       There are no longer many bidi makers here… the ones who used to, only
       some of them continue to do this…there is no profit in this work anymore.
       How will we make any profit? We are only able to earn between Rs. 75
       and Rs. 100 per day, how shall we carry on? We are only doing this
       because we have no other choice. We don’t want our children to continue
       in this profession, when it can’t provide for our subsistence, why should
       they do it?




                                       89
2.3: New activities in the NFE

2.3.1: Garment Retail Shops: All across the country, the competitive pricing of
readymade garments has created a culture of buying and using stitched
garments like never before. Bhagwatipur and Satghara are no exceptions. One of
the highest in number, garment retail shops come in many sizes. Ranging from
owner as worker to the ones employing between one to three workers, majority
of these shops are owned by the Suri sub caste among the Baniyas.

2.3.2: Construction Material and Hardware: Apart from the traditionally built
mud and thatch roof houses, one can notice a few contemporarily constructed
structures in both the settlements, Bhagwatipur and Satghara. These are mostly
in the shape of commercial shops within the market place and a few government
purpose buildings. Even though residential properties continue to be old and one
cannot notice speedy reconstruction or rebuilding, one can certainly notice that
some of them have been renovated. In the case of the Indira Awaas Yojana, under
which the claimant is entitled to a subsidy of 50,000 rupees and more towards
the cost of building, people complained of the corrupt practices as a result of
which they would not receive the full share. Some of them have undertaken loans
to collate towards the amount they receive so that they can manage to build a
decent dwelling for their purpose.

All of the shops selling construction material and related hardware belong to the
Suri and Teli sub caste among the Baniyas. Such shops require investments, the
liquidity for which is usually available among the trading castes. Even though the
pace of construction and related activities is not very speedy, it has certainly
picked up in the last decade. According to Sunil, a young man who manages one
such shop in Bhagwatipur:

       The business for sand and gravel shall continue to do well, the demand for
       it is only increasing.

Though some of these shops are new generation ventures, a significant number
of them are also the kind that sons have acquired from their fathers and have
now extended or expanded upon.

   Case Study: In transition - the story of handlooms
   Ahmed Ansari is a 62 year-old resident of Satghara, and a member of the
   Ansari group, a backward caste among the Muslims of the region. He currently
   manages a cloth retail shop in the Satghara market along with his son, which
   he set up in 2004. According to Ahmed Ansari, he had 50 handlooms in
   Satghara prior to setting up shop in the market, all of which have now shut
   down. He undertook a bank loan to set up shop, which he has now been able
   to pay back. Mr. Ansari belongs to a family of weavers and learnt the trade
   from his father. However, Mr. Ansari informed us with regret, ‘There is no
   demand for handloom cloth anymore. The growing availability of power loom
   cloth from Bombay and other places has displaced khadi from the market’. Mr.
   Ansari was formerly an agent for twenty khaadi bhandars in the Madhubani
   district but has now chosen to run his own cloth retail shop in the market.




2.3.3: Items for storage: One of the items on sale along the road in the markets
of both Bhagwatipur and Satghara is an aluminium box designed for storage of
grains and other household items. Lined along the road, sometimes sheltered by
the roof of the shop and sometimes outside it, these boxes shine in the daylight.
Most shops sell them along with other items. One can often find these aluminium
boxes displayed alongside items of grocery or even of a cell phone sale and
repair shop, like in Bhagwatipur. Most often used as items of dowry gifts during
weddings, the market for them has grown consistently as the idea of storage in
non-earthen ware is a fairly recent one. Light to lift and carry, they have become
the popular choice among the settlement population. One of the shopkeepers in
Bhagwatipur told us

       During the time of the zamindars, people would mostly and only get a
       fistful of grain, one had to go to their homes to ask for it. Now everyone
       goes to a PDS shop to buy rice and grain, in kilos, one also needs storage
       space for that. That is when these come to use

Most of the shop owners selling these items are from the Suri/Teli sub caste for
Baniya.

2.3.4. Cell Phone Sale and Repair Shops: One of the most speedily emerging
enterprises in Satghara and in Bhagwatipur is that of a cell phone sale and repair
shop. The expansion of the IT market in India also includes small towns,
settlements and villages where cell phones have become an item of common
ownership. For example, in both these settlements, cell phones are the
significant link between the migrant and the family that stays behind. In a region,
where outmigration is very high, cell phones hence occupy a unique position of
providing connectivity between people and places. It is also interesting to note
what affects it has had on mobilizing migrants for seasonal agricultural labour
                                        91
for Punjab. According to many of the respondents, initially a contractor held
control over managing the demands of the farmer from Punjab; he organized
groups from the villages and settlement to travel to Punjab and also took a share
of their earnings as commission. However with the widespread use of cell
phones, individuals who are willing to go to Punjab can connect directly with the
farmer and avoid the middlemen. To that effect, they retain the share of their
earnings they would otherwise have to give away as commission and can
organize locally, to better effect.

The use of cell phones, especially among migrant families, is gendered. Wives of
migrant men in the Muslim Fakir Tola said:

       It is when my husband calls me that I am able to speak with him. How will
       I call him myself? Whenever I feel like talking to him, I dial a missed call.

Women rarely go to the shops to get their phone recharged with money; one of
the male members of the family does so for them. A cell phone shop owner we
spoke to told us that even though a lot of people who use cell phones may be
formally illiterate, they can use the interface with great ease. Young men also use
the cell as a device to access the internet, mostly to download songs and videos.
One young male shop owner told one of the young male researchers:

       The young boys ask for songs and videos to be downloaded on their
       phones, sometimes they also want ‘non-veg’ videos. If I have it, I do it for
       ten rupees.

The use of the cell phone, as a communication device, has therefore found a
widespread base – migrant men, young men and to an extent, wives of migrant
men. Consequently, services related to mobile phones –repair, recharge,
upgrading, accessories – also constitute a ready market for commercial activity.
Kundan, twenty year old owner of a mobile repair shop described how he was
unemployed for long time despite having studied for a B.A. degree from
Madhubani. ‘It was frustrating and there was no hope of finding one, so I decided
to train in repairing cell phones in Madhubani town and I did so for a year’.
Kundan believes he made a wise decision, now that he has opened up a shop and
is hopeful that it will do good business –

       The mobile is like a disease; it is difficult to live without it. As long as
       there are mobiles, there will be shops handling them.

Most of the owners of mobile repair shops are young men, for it is a skill that
their generation has acquired in the last few years, previous to which it wasn’t
around. Whether it is in the town center of Madhubani or in places like Delhi and

                                          92
Gurgaon, training in cell phone repair is viewed by them as something that they
can practice commercially and viably in their own village as they realize that
there is a growing need for such services. However they are also acutely aware of
the competition they face.

The lack of capital for expansion or investment also bothers them, they realize
that they can’t be commercially viable or successful if they concentrated on one
activity only and would like to either expand or add more to their establishment,
the lack of ‘poonji’ however is bothersome. Also, some of them reported that it
was difficult to find all the required spare parts required for repair within the
village or within Madhubani and that also undermined their repair business.

2.3.5: Medicine Store: Given the paucity of quality health related services in
rural India, health related services are at a premium. Between Satghara and
Bhagwatipur, the larger settlement of Satghara had more than 80 medicine
shops compared to around 10 in Bhagwatipur. Interestingly, more than half of
these are owned by the Suri sub-caste among the Baniyas in Satghara. Many of
them did not seem to have the required licenses for such shops.

One of the few medicine stores owned by a man from the Halwai caste group,
explained to us why he had thought of starting one. Shiv Kumar Shah, forty-one
years old had the experience of working as a compounder in a private clinic in
Delhi. Upon his return to Bhagwatipur, dealing in medicines seemed like an
occupational choice that he could undertake. He sold away some land to begin
this business, and now feels that business can be very competitive -

       Almost everyone in the village now runs a shop in the market.

Medicine store owners spoke of other kinds of challenges, mostly those related
to sale and regulation. Amar Kumar, who owns and manages a medical store in
the Satghara market said –

   Doctors don’t want to buy a differently named medicine even if it is the same
   composition. There aren’t very many doctors in town and those who are,
   prescribe medicine based upon the promise of commissions from the agents
   of pharmaceutical companies and exploit the patients. Those who are
   running medicine stores by themselves face a big challenge as the doctors
   make sure to write a differently named medicine so that the patients buy it
   from the shop, where the doctor’s commission is assured. Some of the
   doctors have their own medicine shops as well.

2.3.6: Digital photography studios: Brightly coloured posters and
advertisements, which stand out from among the other hoardings in the market
in Satghara are usually the ones inscribed with the name of a photo and video
studio. Adorned with images of Bollywood actors and actresses, and mostly,
newly constructed, they are manned by young men who sit in front of a display
of images, mostly from weddings. It is equally interesting to note the large
number of photographs of young women, attractively dressed and posing for the
camera to get what is popularly known as shaadi ke liye photo (matrimonial
photograph). The demand for these services is also built around weddings and
related photographs. According to Vikas Kumar, owner of one such shop in
Satghara, his average income increases during the wedding season in Satghara
and nearby areas. He is twenty-three years old and has been running the shop
for nearly six years. He partners with a friend for this business, and his father
runs a restaurant in the market.

       I went to Punjab as a young boy to work as a painter and worked there at
       Rs 60 per day. There, I came across a couple of men operate a video
       camera. I learnt how to use it, from them, in Punjab. Upon my return to
       Satghara, I bought a camera worth Rs. 40,000 with financial help from my
       father and opened this shop in a partnership with one of my friends.
       However, I now want to increase the scale of my business and invest
       more in my business – give up the partnership and do it alone.

2.3.7: Cyber cafes and Photostat: Like tuition and coaching centers, cyber cafes
are also establishments manned by educated and unemployed men. Raja Kumar
is twenty-six years old, holds a M.A. degree and has been running a photostat
cum cyber café for two years in Satghara. A member of the Halwai caste, he is
despondent about his business and about its prospects. He continues to prepare
for and write competitive examinations for government jobs as he does not see a
future for his business and is unwilling to carry on doing so. He established this
business partly by earning from private tuitions in the settlement –

       I collected money by teaching kids at home. I had to do so because I had
       no other source of employment. I didn’t have the money to study further.
       Even now, I don’t want to continue doing this, doing it because I have no
       other choice. There is no future for this business, if I get anything else, I’ll
       stop doing this.

2.3.8. Computer Service Centre: The usage of computers for either personal or
commercial purposes is limited in both Bhagwatipur and Satghara.
Arrangements like cyber cafes and rail ticketing providers are the kinds, which
make use of computers in the market, visibly so. Pappu Kumar Singh, a young
man of twenty years set up a shop providing computer maintenance related

                                          94
services three years ago, in 2011. One of the higher ends of investment
requirement – Rs. 250,000, he reportedly arranged it through a combination of
borrowings from local moneylenders and family members. Amongst the two
other brothers he has, one of them lives and works in Delhi, arranging medical
supplies for medical store retailers. ‘My brother advised me to start this
business’, he informed us. All of his other family members are engaged in
agriculture – they own between 5 to 6 acres of land. Member of the Koeri sub-
caste, he feels that business is better than agriculture.

2.3.9: Tent house: Given the rise in conspicuous consumption and expenditure
in weddings, there has been a concomitant rise in wedding related services,
which includes renting tent house services (canopy, utensils, decoration, light
etc.), which often double up as DJ services too. These establishments also hire
labour on a daily wage basis.

2.3.10: Beauty Parlour, Bhagwatipur: In the comparatively smaller market
area of Bhagwatipur (when compared to Satghara), Apsara Beauty Parlour
cannot be missed, especially as its red signboard stands out among the scattered
shops for eateries and groceries. Part of a house, with a grocery shop for its
neighbour, run by the same person as the beauty parlour, Apsara beauty parlour
is one of the only women owned and run enterprises in Bhagwatipur.

Savita is a twenty four year old woman of the Halwai sub caste. She has four
sisters, two of whom are married and two of whom are studying in school and in
college respectively. She herself got married less than a year ago. According to
Savita, her parents died very early and it was her elder sister who took on the
responsibility of raising the rest of the sisters. They have a very small amount of
land (how much?), which they have given under sharecropping. Most of the
families earning comes from the grocery shop that is next to the beauty parlour.

Savita opened the beauty parlour only six months before. It is a makeshift
arrangement in one of the open areas within the house, with minimum and basic
utilities and equipment. ‘I always wanted to be a beautician’, she said, ‘I always
had a penchant for make up and for dressing upon and wondered how I could
turn it into a living’. She learnt the skills from a beauty parlour in Madhubani
town, and then opened one in Bhagwatipur

       This job is one of honour. The best part is that I can operate a business
       from within my home and I only have to interact with women, nobody can
       ever raise a question about my dignity.

Savita is very hopeful about the prospects of her business. ‘Bhagwatipur is a
small settlement but there is a growing acceptance among women to turn out

                                        95
well, especially on occasions of weddings and festivals. This will only grow
further’, she said. The other two younger sisters, want to study further and one
of them wants to become a doctor. The eldest sister said, ‘we will support her in
whatever she wants to do. It is only good if she can study further and make a
decent life for herself’.

Radha Devi of Satghara, a member of the Sisodia-Rajput caste group, is a twenty
five year old married woman who also runs a beauty parlour. She lived in Nepal
before her marriage and trained as a beautician there before moving to Satghara
to live with her husband. She also aims to be able to expand her business, but is
afraid that there are no regular customers for such services as of now.

Neetu Devi, of the Suri sub caste among Baniyas also runs a beauty parlour in
Satghara. She had the chance to train in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh and once she
had, it occurred to her that she could use this in her own area as well. Like the
woman owner of the beauty parlour in Bhagwatipur, Neetu Devi is also of the
opinion that this is a profession that women can undertake without much
opposition as nobody objects to women running beauty parlours.

2.3.11: Small vendors, Bhagwatipur: The market area for Bhagwatipur is
limited within a stretch of less than a kilometre. Shops flank the main road on
both the sides with ample room in front of the shops for people to congregate,
chat and share time over tea. Along the edges of the road and before the entrance
of the shops as well as by the street corners, once can see a significant number of
women fruit and vegetable sellers. These are either operating on small carts
stationed at one place or on the ground with a basket of produce in front of them.
Most of these women are from the Mallah community, especially the ones selling
water chestnut. In the season that we conducted the fieldwork, water chestnut is
a popular item of consumption among the locals and one could spot several
women selling them in baskets either along or by the curve of the roads.

In the particular case of water chestnut, the woman selling it informed us that
she bought the produce at Rs. 30 per kilo from the cultivator and sold it for Rs 40
per kilo in the market. Her husband renders daily wage labour and it is with their
combined earnings that they run their household. Other water chestnut sellers in
the market also happened to be women, whose husbands had either migrated or
performed daily wage labour to eke a living. This business of selling water
chestnuts is also seasonal and during other times, she reported selling some
other local fare. Some of these women are also the primary income earners of the
family, living in the village, whose husbands are either dead or unable to work
due to a physical disability. Among the fruit sellers operating through small carts
by the road side, fruit supplies are bought on credit, which is paid off or taken
forward depending upon the volume of sales.

                                        96
On our way around Bhagwatipur, we also saw a Halwai woman, who is currently
a Panch of the village, runs a small eatery as well. Outside her partly constructed
mud house, she sat with a make shift frying pan and stove, which she used to
make pakodas (fritters) and chai (tea). Bechni Devi is nearly fifty years old and
the sole income-earning member of her house as her husband has been fighting a
long drawn legal dispute over land and does not find the time to work. She and
her mother-in-law manage their small business and reported having earned a
maximum of Rs. 100 per day.

Shivkali Devi, a forty-year old woman in Bhagwatipur manages a small make-
shift arrangement from where she shells packed consumer goods like biscuits,
toffees, sachets of shampoo and strips of soap. He husband is a migrant worker
in Chandigarh and has been working there for nearly thirty years as a
construction labourer. According to Shivkali Devi, whose family is landless, the
earnings from her business are very meagre and only go towards some
subsistence expenditure in the village, most of which is met by the remittance
that her husband provides for.

For a high number of women, such scale of vending goes towards contributing
towards the household income, whether in addition to the remittance sent in by
a migrant male member or in the absence of one. Reena Devi, who runs a fruit
stall in the market area of Satghara however runs her business as the sole
income earner of her household. She informed us that she had been selling fruits
for the last twenty years, her husband deserted her and she had to assume the
responsibility of the primary cash earner for her family, which includes a
fourteen year old son who helps her with her business.

2.3.12: Boutique: Even though tailoring and commercial stitching is a male
dominated trade, a boutique is distinguishable from a tailoring establishment by
its offer for exclusive tailoring of women’s clothes. Satghara has one such
boutique, which is owned and operated by Sarita Devi, who is thirty-six years
old. She has been running the boutique for the last four years along with two of
her daughters. Her husband works in Nepal, as a salesman for utensils. Sarita
Devi’s family holds 2 bighas of land, which they have given away in share-
cropping.

Sarita Devi acquired skills in tailoring through a training program, twenty years
ago. However, now that her children have grown up, according to her, ‘she has
found the fursat (time to herself) to do some business’. She wishes to be able to
expand it in the future as she doesn’t see a future in agriculture:



                                        97
It is difficult to practice agriculture alone, the fields can submerged under
the flood waters. There is no such fear in one’s own business.




                                 98
Appendix 3 Case Studies: Community and Caste based settlements

3.1. Muslim Fakir Tola, Satghara: The Fakir Tola, in Satghara, constitutes sixty
households, all of whom are Muslims. Set in the near center of the settlement, the
habitation wears a despondent look. Poorly constructed and clustered housing
opens into narrow lanes that run through the settlement, circumscribed by
construction material and waste. Children lurk around these lanes, some playing
with each other and some walking around with their elder siblings or mothers.
As we entered the tola, we spotted a half constructed house. A woman was sat
nearby and when we approached to speak to her, she was reluctant to respond.
Upon further explanation and discussion, she told us

       What can I tell you about myself? So many people like you come here, we
       fear that things may unnecessary travel. Giving out such information may
       be a cause of inconvenience for us.

Perhaps due to the popular sentiment of suspicion, and that of a malafide
sentiment associated with outsiders, the tension and reluctance to share
experiences in the tola, was palpable. Five members from the tola have migrated
to Saudi Arabia where they work as drivers. One of the family members of the
migrant drivers told us that it had taken over a lakh to organize the travel and
papers for migration, all of which had been covered through debt incurred from
the local moneylenders at a high rate of interest – between 5 to 7 percent at
least. According to them, a substantial part of their earnings and remittance went
away in clearing these debts, for at least a year of their jobs. The partly
constructed house that we saw upon our entry belonged to man who had
migrated to Delhi over twenty years ago and sold plastic stickers for a living. He
told us that it had taken him nearly a decade to be able to construct the partly
finished house but as he added, ‘I at least have a roof over my head now,
however it is. And can be assured that my family is sheltered’.

The rate of out migration from this tola is very high, other than those who have
gone to Saudi Arabia, at least 40 more members have migrated to different parts
within the country – Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. The remaining male members
work as cycle rickshaw operators within Satghara, as that requires the least
amount of investment and skills to begin. Most of these cycle rickshaw operators
were those who had returned since having migrated and now saw the rickshaw
as a source of livelihood.

While we talked with the residents of the settlement, it became evident to us that
the levels of daily poverty were high. One woman remarked that they had to
sometimes incur debts even to meet daily expenses, and they did so at high rates
of interest. Upon asking why was it that women could not contribute to the

                                       99
household income in the form of daily wage labour or other forms of livelihood
within Satghara, it became clear to us that women’s mobility was deeply
restricted. Neither could they go out of the tola to work nor to study. Most of the
tasks that they required of the market or of institutional facilities like banks and
healthcare were met by male relatives present in the settlement. They insisted
that if there were any kind of work that they could do from within their homes, it
would be of great help to them. One of the married women, whose husband
worked as a driver in Saudi Arabia said,

       We are married very young, and we have children at a very young age too.
       We never have the chance to study or to look after ourselves. Even now,
       my husband is away and there is no assurance that money will come in
       regularly, it depends upon how well he can keep his job. But I can’t help as
       I don’t make any money and neither can I hope to. Sometimes, I have to
       take a loan to meet daily expenses and the money that my husband sends
       is used up in paying them off, what can I do?

3.2 Muslim Tola, Bhagwatipur: Zarina Khatoon is a twenty four year old
woman who belongs to the Ansari community among the Muslims in
Bhagwatipur. As we approached the tola, Zareena was busy spreading the wheat
grain she had purchased from the market in the sun. Her two children loitered
around her as she worked in silence. She has been married to her twenty eight
year old husband for eight years, meaning she got married as young as sixteen
years of age. Zarina is illiterate and so is her migrant husband. Zareena’s memory
of her husband is that of a migrant, even before she was married to him, he had
been away in Mumbai, working as a tailor and in her estimate, he has been away
for nearly ten years which means that he, like many other Ansari Muslims of the
area, had moved to Mumbai as a young man.

Zarina spoke of her household’s poverty with a sense of despondency. Her
husband is able to save and send nearly Rs. 4000 every three months, all of
which goes towards meeting subsistence expenditures. Zarina has never worked,
neither as an agricultural nor as a daily wage labour.

       ‘We never had land to be able to do any agricultural work’, she echoes the
       sentiment of many other landless families, for whom agricultural work is
       not a skill they have acquired naturally. ‘I don’t have the time for daily
       wage labour, I have never done it’, she said. ‘My husband sends the money
       to my sister-in law’s son’s bank account, who withdraws and hands it
       over to me once it arrives’.

Zarina also told us that her husband had incurred a high amount of debt from the
local money lender in order to meet the expenses towards his sister’s wedding a

                                        100
couple of years ago. Given the high rate of interest, nearly 7 percent per month,
most of his savings go towards meeting the debt. While we were speaking to
Zarina, a young girl came and stopped by. She also belonged to the tola and was
curious to know what we were talking about. Nineteen years old, she had
recently failed her high school ‘matric’ examination, and was the most educated
girl in the tola.

       I want to study further but I can’t. My parents are now worried about my
       marriage and they are looking out for suitable boys for me. Once I am
       married, it will be all about the household and children, who will then
       have the time to think about education.

Aamina Khatoon, Zarina’s neighbor also came out upon hearing the conversation.
She agreed with the young girl as she had tried to do something after her
marriage, in the village but to no avail. Aamina is thirty-five years old and she
had lived in Delhi for between 10 to 12 years. She liked to stay in Delhi, though
they had to leave the house as her father-in-law did not get along with her
husband, she said that she was happy to have left.

       My husband worked as a carpenter and mason, and I learnt tailoring in
       Delhi. It was nice to be able to work and make some money. But now that
       we are back in the village, my husband does not allow me to work, it is
       very restricting, unlike the city, where I could do what I wanted to.

3.3. Mallah Tola, Bhagwatipur: Mallahs are the traditional fishing community
in the region. In addition to fishing, they also render labour as agricultural
workers on other’s fields as well to eke out a living. As we moved around the
settlement, it was clear to us that men were conspicuous by their absence
whereas women were copious. Of the men, mostly young boys and old men were
present, and loitered about the settlement to make themselves useful. Of the
young men who were present, all were migrants who had returned to the village
for a brief while, to go back to their city of work yet again.

Looking around for a place to sit and talk, we were led to the house of two young
women, Pinky and Rinky, who are sisters to each other. Pinky is nineteen and
Rinky is eighteen years old, and they are widely popular in the settlement and
among the Mallah community for having studied the most. Pinky has recently
enrolled herself in class 12 and Rinky in class 10, and both of them are hopeful
about being able to complete it. Their father is one of the more prosperous men
among the Mallahs and is credited with respect for having educated his
daughters well.



                                       101
However, all is not well with Pinky and Rinky having studied ‘so much’. Women
who had gathered in the settlement, near their house, spoke eloquently of how it
was become increasingly difficult to find suitable grooms for Pinky, the elder
one. ‘She is so educated, more than the usual Mallah boy. Who will marry her’? As
the discussion progressed, it became clearer that Pinky’s educational status was
a problem as far as her ability to get marriage was concerned.

       A good match for an educated girl is very difficult (to find). The more
       educated a girl, the more educated the groom, which means a higher
       amount of dowry. How will they find so much money? One of the
       prospective groom’s family asked for a motorcycle in dowry. If we were to
       fulfill the demand, we would have to incur debt from the money lender.

A higher educational status for girls, was hence, not desirable. Also, the value of
education per se was not highly estimated. ‘Only one of the men from the
settlement has a naukri (job) in town. When men don’t have a job, what will
women do after studying? It only creates further problems for their marriage
and with their in-laws’, said a 50 year old Mallah woman.

       The men are not around anyway, they move to the city. It is women who
       have to do most of the work, whether it is within the house or on the
       fields. Even if men lived in the village, they wouldn’t go for agricultural
       labour. Agricultural labour wage is low and men would rather do
       something else for more money. Agriculture wouldn’t sustain itself in this
       village if it weren’t for the women, we do it because that’s the only source
       of money we have, while in the village.

Migration is a ‘culture of livelihood’ for Mallah men, typical of the general trend
in the region. As a traditional occupation, fishing has diminished, even though it
continues to remain a caste based one. However the absence of men within the
village has also reduced the scope for the continuity of this activity; men are the
ones who go fishing and women are the ones who sell, along with men. With a
decreasing number of men within the village, few are available to go fishing and
hence dependence on other forms of income generating activity has increased,
especially for women who stay behind the village. But more than often,
agricultural labour does not get paid in cash, they are paid in kind, the common
practice being 1 bojha (approximately 15 kilo of grains) for every 12 bojhas they
can harvest in the field. It takes them an average of five days at least to be able to
gather 1 bojha from the landowners.

Women rarely accompany their husbands to the city, it is expensive to maintain a
household in the city and therefore the family stays behind. Men regularly remit
the money to the village, and the use of institutionalized financial services, like

                                         102
banks, has increased. However, low financial literacy disables women from
operating on their own, they are usually dependent upon elder male relatives,
‘guardians’, to withdraw and use money from the bank.

3.4: Badhai Tola, Bhagwatipur: The badhais are traditional carpenters, most of
whom are now engaged in commercialized carpentry i.e. a diminished
involvement in the jajmani system. The settlement is clustered in a limited
expanse of land, with narrow patches of land distributed between households.
Carpentry tools were flung about – saws and axes and variously sized blades
could be seen stored outside the house. Men were about their business in the
day, those who had not migrated worked in the market establishment and some
of them even worked from within the tola.

During the busy time of the day, women were going about their household
chores –washing clothes at the common hand pump, feeding children, cleaning
and cooking. One of the first female residents we spoke to was Geeta Devi, who
had lived in Delhi for a few years with her migrant husband. Her son required
medical attention due to a physical disability and she has hence accompanied her
husband. Her son died soon afterwards and she returned to the village. Due to
her stay and experience in Delhi, as Geeta Devi reported,

       I feel confident in going about the market on personal errands. I can take
       my children to the doctor and also use the bank to withdraw the money
       that my husband sends. However, most of the other women in the tola are
       dependent upon their male relatives for most things

Geeta is literate, and one of the only women of her generation in her tola to be so.
She complained that education was not important in their community, for both
men and women. ‘There are no jobs to go around, so there is no incentive to be
educated. And if men can’t get jobs, how will women find them, especially when
they are not educated’. Once she said that, other women who were standing
about joined in the discussion. One of them, an over sixty year old woman told us
that her son and daughter-in-law lived in Delhi, and both of them were educated.
‘My daughter-in-law is finishing her B.A. in Delhi. She is looking for work in the
city, and if she can find it, she’ll do it too’. Others marveled at how she was the
only woman from their tola to be so educated. Also, it was unusual for women to
study after marriage and it won’t be misplaced to say that most of them looked at
the older woman with an eye for suspicion!

Like women from the Muslim Fakir tola, Badhai women reported not doing any
daily waged labour in the village. However, they do go about their ordinary tasks
like buying vegetables and ratio and can also travel up until Madhubani in a
shared auto rickshaw to buy medicines and other essential supplies, if needed.

                                        103
3.5. Brahmin Tola, Nahar (Bhagwatipur): The Brahmin settlement is in the
area known as Nahar-Bhagwatipur. It is interesting to note that the generation of
parents/couples between the age of 40 and 60 years were conspicuously missing
from the village. Whereas, in other settlements, only the men were not around, in
this case, there were disjointed households present – most commonly, a set of
grandchildren living with their grandparents. Women have accompanied their
husbands to their city of work and have established functional households there.
Young children however stay on in the village, given the high costs of education
in the city and join their families once they can find an avenue to work and earn.

However the set of jobs and work that migrants from the Nahar-Brahmin tola
went out for are qualitatively different from those we found in other settlements.
They have usually migrated for more skilled jobs like construction supervisor,
mid-level manager and semi skilled technicians. Their wives, whether they stay
with them in the city or without them in the village, are not allowed to work
outside the household. Like a young man in the tola, who is studying in class 11
told us:

       Women from the Brahmin household do not ‘work’, they only do work
       that is required within the house. Even if women may study and work
       before they get married, they can only undertake household
       responsibilities once they are. We have still retained our traditions. Most
       of the households have given away their agricultural land under
       sharecropping and women don’t attend to the fields. If it were not for old,
       over 60 year old men in the village, we would not be able to manage our
       fields as there is nobody else to look after them.

Young men aspire to move out of the village as soon as they can, some of them
are already looking forward to jobs in the town and city that their families and
social networks are trying to procure for them. They attend nearby colleges, in
Madhubani, and some of them have also moved with their families to places
within Bihar. A young boy, in class eight, told us with abundant confidence

       I live in Patna with my father and mother. My father has a small shop
       there. I study in a convent. I think it is better than studying in the village
       where the quality of English teaching is very poor and students are not
       that bright. English is very important for the future.

3.6. Dom Tola, Satghara: The Doms constitute the category of Mahadalits
among the Scheduled Castes in Bihar8. Dispersed as the settlement is, the Dom
tola lies on the outward margins from the center of Satghara. The entrance of the
settlement is framed by a stagnant water pond, which is used as a source of
water for daily use by the residents – washing and cleaning. Unpaved paths
define the entry into the settlement, flanked by mud-thatched huts on both sides.
Men and women can be seen busy with weaving bamboo baskets – their
traditional occupation. These baskets are then sold in the market for use on
various occasions like marriages and festivals, to pack fruits and for other
household storage. Working with bamboo is perceived as a defiling occupation
by the so called upper castes and hence the Doms are also considered
‘untouchable’ by caste groups without and even within the Scheduled Caste
category.

Even among the Scheduled Castes, degrees of untouchability are practiced
against the Dom members. For instance, the Paswan caste members, who are
themselves a part of the Scheduled Castes consider Doms ‘untouchable’ as they
rear pigs. The distorted stigma of untouchability, lack of political empowerment
and the paucity of social and financial capital hinders the Dom community to a
great extent. While discussing the sources of their livelihood, one of the male
members who used to work as chair-weaver and rickshaw puller in Calcutta and
has since returned to his village complained:

           We only know the trade of making these bamboo baskets. Initially, we
           could also weave through and mend the chairs, which are now entirely
           out of making. It is too expensive to make it to the city for other kinds of
           work, we don’t have those kinds of resources. These bamboo baskets
           hardly fetch a price. Most of us who had gone out to work have returned,
           we can never earn or save enough, what can we really do?

Both men and women are involved in the business of making baskets. Male out
migration from this settlement is near negligible, even if men move out, they are
unable to stay out and work for long for the sheer paucity of resources. The
anger in their voices was evident:

           We get cornered from all directions. If we stay in the village, there is no
           work to do, and if we go outside, we can never earn enough. Even though
           we got an employment guarantee card made for ourselves in the village,
           the village headman (mukhia), who is from the Paswan community does
           not get us any work. What about our children’s education or our own

       futures can we think of when it is difficult to sustain ourselves each day,
       by day.

Even their traditional occupation is facing diminishing prospects. There are
cheaper substitutes to bamboo, available in the market – fibre, plastic – which
sell more readily than bamboo. Also, increasingly, they have to go out further and
across longer distances to be able to procure bamboo for their use. All of these
families are landless and have never had any representation in waged
employment either. They are therefore entirely dependent upon the craft of
making the bamboo baskets. Given the low price it fetches in the market, families
complained about how they had to live off debt for many months. They go out
into the villages and local markets to sell the bamboo products, but without hope
of high sales.

The levels of debt driven subsistence consumption is also prevalent among the
Dom basket makers in Satghara. As the sale of the baskets is concentrated over
certain periods in the year – during festivals like Chhath and during the season of
weddings, a significant number of the households have to incur debt to meet
consumption needs for the rest of the year, which takes the form of kind (in
grain) from the local sahukaar (grocer). Like an elderly male basket maker of the
community put it -

       Each year, hum karja kar kar ke khatey hain, koi jiwan nahi hai, hum sabka
       jiwan bekaar hai (we live out of debt, this is no life, our lives are of no
       worth).

Shanti Devi is an over fifty years old Mahadalit woman leader of the Rashtriya
Janta Dal (RJD), who lives in the Dom tola in Satghara. Clad in a bright red
synthetic sari and with an assured presence and confident voice, Shanti Devi
articulated the complexities of work, migration and local politics with the ease of
a seasoned leader. She explained to us how they had to buy bamboo from places
like Samastipur, Barauni, Hajipur and Darbangha before they fashioned it into
different items of use; how their traditional occupation was threatened in the
face of plastic and fibre. According to her, members from the Dom community
never rendered any agricultural labour, they have stuck to their traditional
occupation along with failed attempts to make a life in the city. The jajmani
system too, according to her, has withered away and it is only in the market and
across villages that they sell the dagra (sieves) that they make out of bamboo.

Among the other women, was Sunita Devi, who is a member and local leader of
the Janta Dal (United). Both she and Shanti Devi had been trained in political
mobilization and work during the Lalu Prasad Yadav headed government and


                                        106
spoke of their training and work with high regard. ‘We even went to jails’, said
Shanti Devi, ‘and we aren’t afraid of anyone, what is there to be scared of’?

Heralding Lalu Yadav’s political legacy, Shanti Devi was proud of the fact that
with the help of Lalu and due to the kind of political empowerment that the
lower castes received, they had been able to voice their concerns.

       Lalu is gone, but he have us aaloo (potato). From a potato, you can make
       many things –sabzi, curry and even chips. Sir (addressing the principal
       investigator), we used to be very fearful – if we didn’t go the malik, what
       would he do to us, we used to be constantly worried. But since Lalu ji took
       birth, he made life much better for us. Now the malik comes to us and
       requests us to work for him – and if we have the time, we go and we also
       have the capacity to refuse

Shanti Devi is also anxious about the future of the community, according to her,
things have marginally improved since before for they at least have a ‘voice’.
However, that alone is not sufficient. She believes that though the government
may have categorized them into ‘Mahadalits’ but to no avail. ‘There is nothing to
show for it. And we have not gained anything out of it’, she said. Shanti Devi
recently lost the panchayat elections to a Paswan woman leader. Paswans too
are members of the Scheduled Caste, but not Mahadalits. ‘I will fight elections a
second time too’. Shanti Devi informed us, ‘I have to take care of my community
and people’. She believes that the betterment of the next generation lies in jobs
and employment but the level of education is very low and they are not even
interested in studying.

4.1: MGNREGA and Public Welfare Programmes: The MGNREGA seemed to be
almost non-functional in both the settlements. During the course of the fieldwork
for the research, several respondents informed us of the instances of corruption
and other administrative problems they associated with it. A young SC male
respondent from the Dom tola in Satghara said:

       The mukhia manipulates. He makes us work and put our thumb
       impression but does not pay. I worked for 5 days but did not get paid.

Three visibly poor respondents (Muslims) showed to us their job cards, which
had no job entries (See Pics below)

       Even though we seek employment, we have not been given any job even
       for a day under the MGNREGA scheme during the past three years or so
       …only in the first year that we were given the job cards were we
       employed for a few days.

Some of the other respondents complained about the authorities not hiring
manual labour and choosing to do the work with machines instead, for according
to them, it enables the Mukhia and other functionaries to make money for
themselves.




Two of the Mukhias from the two settlements, both of whom are members of the
“lower? castes, SC and EBC respectively, agreed that MGNREGA is not functioning

                                      108
very well in these settlements. However the reasons they offered are very
different. One of them complained about not getting adequate funds from the
state government for commissioning local work. According to him, the nature of
work allowed under the programme is limited and they often found it hard to get
local workers to come. Though most of the labourers who come and work under
the scheme are SCs, a significant number of non-SC villagers also carry cards and
use them as identity proof for availing other schemes. The wage differentials
between MGNREGA work wage rate and those prevailing in the local market or
what once can earn outside as a migrant worker also makes it difficult for them
to get labourers to work. Most young men go out to work and only women
workers seek employment in the scheme.

The local farmers and richer respondents complained about growing labour
shortage in the village, partly due to high out migration and party due to the
higher wage rate for MGNREGA.

4.2: Banks and Financial Institutions: Both Bhagwatipur and Satghara have
banks and other financial institutions. Satghara houses branches of four
commercial banks the State Bank of India, the Punjab National Bank, the Gramin
Bank and the Cooperative Bank. It also has three ATM machines. Bhagwatipur,
on the other hand, has only one bank, a branch of the State Bank of India with an
ATM. Some of the villagers also travel to neighboring settlements and the town
of Madhubani to avail banking and ATM facilities. Some private banks have also
put up their stalls to attract investments and offer loans in these villages.

Thanks to the flow of remittances constantly arriving from the large number of
outmigrants, banks and ATMs have become very popular among the local people
in both the settlements. We interviewed some of the beneficiaries of bank loans,
mostly those who had been successful in obtaining a loan for purchase of a motor
vehicle - taxis and auto-rickshaws, which they drive commercially. Many of the
respondents complained about the corruption in the banking institutions that
they encountered while applying for loans - “Everyone has to pay some
commission to the manager?, is a common response we received from a wide
range of respondents. Even some of those who had been successful in getting
loans claimed that they paid 10 to 20 percent of the entire loan as bribe
to/through the middlemen. The problem, according to the respondents is not
that of need and awareness but that of the nature of functioning of these
institutions.

We could not contact any officials from the banks for their side of the story.

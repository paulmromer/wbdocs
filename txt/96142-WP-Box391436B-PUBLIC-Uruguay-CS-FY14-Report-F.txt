I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Uruguay perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Uruguay regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Uruguay;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Uruguay;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Uruguay;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Uruguay.
    Use data to help inform Uruguay country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In May-June 2014, 331 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Uruguay were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors
working on WBG-supported projects/programs; implementation agencies overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 156 stakeholders participated in the survey (47% response rate).
Respondents received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform
and filled out the questionnaire electronically. Respondents were asked about: general issues
facing Uruguay; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results;
the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in
Uruguay; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing in Uruguay.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were not compared to those in an earlier Country
Survey conducted in FY’04, as survey instruments in the two years were largely different and the
last survey was done almost a decade ago.
A. General Issues Facing Uruguay: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Uruguay is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty, and how
   “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
   Uruguay, WBG staff preparedness to help Uruguay solve its development challenges,
   WBG’s local presence, its capacity building in Uruguay, their agreement with statements

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses and
   in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Uruguay, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Uruguay’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in twenty six development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across these areas, such as education, infrastructure development,
   public sector governance/reform, and social protection.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the LAC Flagship Report, including whether it raised
   substantive new information, and whether it provided them with useful information in terms
   of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Uruguay: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Uruguay, and which services the
   Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has moved to the
   right direction, and the future role international development cooperation should play in
   Uruguay.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of
   its social media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Uruguay, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Respondents across stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of familiarity with
        the World Bank Group.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the World Bank Group were significantly,
        strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in
        Uruguay, and their perceptions of the Bank Group’s relevance to Uruguay’s
        development, and significantly, moderately correlated with their perception of the Bank
        Group’s ability to help achieve development results in Uruguay.

Familiarity with Other Organizations
       Respondents had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the World Bank Group and

        from the private sector/financial sector/private banks were significantly more familiar
        with it than respondents from other stakeholder groups.

     “When thinking about how the World Bank Group can have the most impact on development results
        in Uruguay, in which sectoral areas do you believe the World Bank Group should focus most
                 of its attention and resources in Uruguay? (Choose no more than THREE)?
                                (Respondents chose from a list. Responses combined.)

 When more than 10% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of specialized
 areas in question H2 in Appendix F), analyses are done to see these respondents’ views about which areas the
 World Bank Group should focus its attention and resources on.

        believe that the WBG should focus most of its attention and resources in Uruguay in
        “equality of opportunity? than respondents who specialize in sectoral areas.

       Respondents who primarily specialize in “public sector governance/public financial
        management/anti corruption? (10% of the sample) gave significantly lower ratings for
        the WBG’s effectiveness in “water and sanitation? than respondents from other areas of
        specialization.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 51) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
        “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
        areas.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups can be found in the Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Uruguay, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Uruguay.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Uruguay, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at infrastructure development; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.

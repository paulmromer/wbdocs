I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Lao PDR perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Lao PDR
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Lao PDR
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From June to July 2015, 657 stakeholders of the WBG in Lao PDR were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Presidential Office; the Government’s Office; the National
Assembly; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/
programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the
financial sector/private banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the
media; independent government institutions; trade unions; youth groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; non-profit associations (NPAs); and other
organizations. A total of 296 stakeholders participated in the survey (45% response rate).

Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Lao PDR; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s specific projects/programs in Lao PDR; the WBG’s future role in Lao PDR; and the
WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 52%, N=532). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 101).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the Presidential Office were
       combined with those from the Government’s Office; respondents from ministries/
       ministerial departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants working on
       WBG projects were combined; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
       combined with those from private sector organizations; respondents from non-profit
       organizations/community based organizations, non-profit associations, trade unions, and
       youth groups were combined in the “CSO? category. Few respondents from local
       government and independent government institutions were included in the “Other?
       category. Note that there were no respondents from the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’12 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 6.30; weighted mean in FY’12 = 6.07)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Lao PDR, the extent to which the
        WBG achieves development results in Lao PDR, and the extent to which the WBG plays
        a relevant role in development in Lao PDR.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to the following:
       “reforms are not well thought out in light of country challenges? (41%) and “there is not
       an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation? (34%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from CSOs were
       significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to that
       “there is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation? compared to
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Lao PDR, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Lao PDR. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Lao PDR, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year22
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

 7    A growing middle class
 8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
 9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas

   POVERTY IN IRAQ,
         2012 - 2014
                                                                                   World Bank and
                                                                                   Government of Iraq
 This note describes the methodology used for estimating trends in poverty
rates for Iraq using the 2012 Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey and the         and Kurdistan
   2014 Continuous Household Survey; and presents the findings. The 2014           Region, 2015-16
survey was designed to provide comparable and more frequent estimates of
    poverty, but fieldwork was disrupted in the second half of 2014 due to a
   deteriorating security situation. The methodology described in this note
   implements adjustments to weights and re-estimates the poverty line to
  establish poverty trends between the first half of 2012 and the first half of
    2014 for all 18 governorates of Iraq; between the first and second half of
  2014 for 13 governorates of Iraq; and between 2012 and 2014 for these 13
      governorates. The first set of estimates show that the pace of poverty
      reduction in Iraq was accelerating until the first half of 2014, while the
  second and third set of estimates quantify the adverse impact of the 2014
                                  crisis on welfare in 13 governorates of Iraq.

    1. The 2014 Continuous Household Survey: Design and Challenges in
       Implementation
The 2014 Continuous Household Survey (CHS) was implemented by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Iraq and
the Kurdistan region Statistics Office (KRSO) to provide more frequent estimates of poverty for the country. Iraq‚Äôs
national poverty estimates are currently based on two large scale surveys, the Iraq Household and Socio-Economic
Surveys (IHSES) from 2007 and 2012. These very larger and comprehensive surveys are implemented roughly every
five years, because of the costs of the survey in terms of budget but also in terms of logistical preparations and
personnel.

In order to get more frequent poverty estimates in-between IHSES years, the CHS was fielded in 2014. It was
envisaged that CHS would be implemented in between IHSES years to provide representative estimates of poverty
and a range of other socio-economic indicators at the level of governorates or provinces. The design of the CHS by
the statistical agencies in Iraq was careful and deliberate to preserve comparability. The CHS surveys a sub-sample
of IHSES clusters or PSUs, and contains a subset of IHSES modules. In particular, key modules for the construction
of a comparable welfare aggregate were identical to the IHSES ‚Äì the household roster, education modules, modules
on labor market outcomes, food and non-food consumption expenditures, consumption and expenditures on
rations or PDS items, and incomes from earnings and public and private transfers. Fieldwork began in November
2013 and was supposed to run for 12 months. The intended sample of 13,834 households was drawn to be
representative at the governorate level. The sample was temporally and spatially stratified, with each month or
wave of the sample designed to be nationally representative.

However, fieldwork and data collection for the 2014 CHS was disrupted beginning in June 2014 due to the
deteriorating security situation in some areas and the growing influence of Islamic State (IS) militants in the
northwest of the country. As a result, in five governorates, fieldwork could not be completed as planned ‚Äì Nineveh,
Anbar, Salahadin, Kirkuk and Baghdad. In Baghdad the last quarter was severely affected in terms of response rates,
and no household in rural Baghdad could be interviewed. In the remaining 13 governorates, fieldwork continued as
planned. In the second half of 2014, the sharp decline in oil prices also severely cut the government budget. While
this did not affect fieldwork, together, these two simultaneous and exogenous shocks in the middle of 2014 provide
a natural experiment setting for the 2014 CHS, with the first half being characterized by ‚Äúnormal‚Äù conditions and
the second half by crisis conditions, at least for the 13 governorates where data collection was completed as planned.


    2. Analytical Approach
Despite the sudden disruption of fieldwork, the 2014 CHS contains a lot of critical information that can be revealed
by undertaking careful analysis, in large part due to the careful attention paid ex-ante to the design of the CHS.
First, it can provide a benchmark or counterfactual for the country for 2014 prior to the crisis. In other words, the
first half of the survey, covering the period until May 2014, covers all governorates in the country, and can provide
an estimate of pre-crisis welfare measures. However, there are some challenges. While the intended sample size of
households was surveyed as intended in the first half of the CHS, it was not balanced across urban and rural areas.
As a result, survey weights needed to be adjusted to redress this imbalance. The details are in Annex 1. Moreover,
in order to establish trends and comparable welfare estimates, it is necessary to identify the comparable population
in 2012. To do that, households from rural Baghdad had to be excluded from the first half of the 2012 IHSES, the
welfare aggregate needed to be re-estimated for this sample, and a consistent poverty line needed to be estimated.

Secondly, the 2014 CHS can provide an estimate of the Twin crises of Islamic State militancy and the oil price shock
on the 13 governorates for which data collection was completed. For these governorates, a comparison of first half
and second half welfare measures provides an estimate of the oil price shock impact as well as the ‚Äúindirect‚Äù impact
of hosting people displaced by the IS crisis and the accompanying economic disruptions.

Thirdly, we can monitor the trend in poverty between 2012 and 2014 by considering the set of 13 governorates with
complete information in 2014. A comparison of the welfare measures provides insights both on the evolution in the
incidence of poverty and the impact of the twin crises in these governorates.


    3. Pre-crisis trends in poverty: 2012 1st half and 2014 1st half, 18 governorates
The first step in estimating pre-crisis trends in poverty is to recalculate the poverty line for Iraq (excluding rural
Baghdad) based on 2012 IHSES welfare aggregates for the comparable period, i.e. January to May 2012. These are
presented in Error! Reference source not found., and as is evident, there is little indication of seasonality. The 1st
half poverty line is only slightly higher (1.1 percent) relative to that for the whole year. The welfare aggregate is then
calculated for the first half of 2014, excluding rural Baghdad, in a manner consistent with the official methodology,
then converted to 2012 prices using the inflation rate implied by the official CPI between January-May 2012 and
January-May                                                                                                         2014.

The results of this exercise indicate a secular improvement in welfare across the distribution, implying a reduction
in poverty for all reasonable poverty lines (Error! Reference source not found.). There was a shift to the right of
the whole per capita expenditure between the first half of 2012 and first half of 2014.

In fact, there was a faster drop in poverty between the first half of 2014 relative to the 1st half of 2012 than had been
recorded during the 2007 to 2012 period. Compared to the 1st half of 2012, poverty fell by 5.7 percentage points in
the 1st half of 2014, i.e. from 17.5 percent to 11.8 percent. This reduction in poverty was experienced not only in rural
areas (a decline by 8 percentage points) but also in urban areas (a decline of 4 percentage points). The poverty gap
and the squared poverty gap also fell, although this decline was larger in rural areas. Overall, Iraq was on a better
trajectory than in the recent past before the crisis hit, with welfare improving across the country.

Governorate level estimates and trends in poverty should be interpreted with caution because the lower sample
sizes imply that not all changes are significantly different at standard confidence intervals. However, in five
governorates, we can be confident of significant declines in poverty ‚Äì these are Anbar, urban Baghdad, Missan, Thi
Qar and Wasit (in bold, Error! Reference source not found.).

This large improvement in welfare reflects a shift in how the consumption distribution was growing, from pro-rich
growth in 2012 to pro-poor growth in the first half of 2014 (Error! Reference source not found.). Per capita
consumption grew much faster for the lower deciles of the distribution ‚Äì as high as 8 to 10 percent per year in the
bottom 2 deciles. This has also implied a decline in consumption inequality, especially in rural areas, where the Gini
coefficient fell by 2.5 percentage points (Error! Reference source not found.).

    4. Crisis impact: 2014 1st half and 2014 2nd half, 13 governorates
Except for five governorates (i.e. Anbar, Kirkuk, Nineveh, Salahadin, Baghdad), 2014 CHS data collection was
completed as intended. For these governorates, the first half of the year represents a ‚ÄòBusiness As Usual‚Äô case; the
second half incorporates the impact of the Twin Crises.

How can the impact of the Twin Crisis be measured? If there are no systematic differences between the first half of
the year and the second half of the year other than the shocks associated with the Twin Crisis, for instance, because
of differences in seasons or festivals such as Eid, then we can be fairly confident that the differences in measured
welfare are due to the shocks. To adopt this before and after approach, we need to first test whether Iraq‚Äôs
consumption data exhibits differences across the first and second half of the year, during ‚Äúnormal‚Äù years. If there
are measurable differences, then we would need to adjust the estimates of crisis impact by the seasonality effect.

2012 IHSES data suggests there is no seasonal effect across the first and second half of the year in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù years.
The difference between first half and second half 2012 poverty lines is less than 0.5 percent, and there is no
significant difference in estimates of poverty incidence, gap and severity (Figure 4). This suggest that a comparison
of 2014 first and second half estimates will not be affected by seasonality but will rather measure differences due
to the Twin Crises.

Relative to the first half of 2014, poverty in Iraq (excluding the five IS-affected governorates where fieldwork was
disrupted), increased 3 percentage points by the second half of 2014, from 12.9 percent to 15.8 percent (Figure 5).
This was driven by significant increases in headcount rates in Kurdistan and the South. In Kurdistan, the Twin Crises
increased poverty estimates from 1.5 percent to 6 percent; whereas in the South, poverty increased from 22 percent
to 26.4 percent. These trends were accompanied by an increase in the poverty gap in Kurdistan region. In the South,
the increase in poverty is likely to be driven by the decline in oil prices, whereas in Kurdistan, it is also due to the
influx of displaced persons from the rest of Iraq. These estimates are based on households who were included in the
sample of the 2014 CHS, so it is important to note that they do not include internally displaced persons, and are
therefore, an underestimate of poverty headcount rates of current residents in these parts of the country.

    5. Poverty between 2012 and 2014: 2012 and 2014 full year, 13 governorates
Another option for monitoring welfare and poverty over the 2012 to 2014 period is to restrict attention to the set of
13 governorates where complete data is available, considering them together as a ‚Äúcountry‚Äù. To undertake such a
comparison, a re-estimation of the real consumption aggregate is necessary based on a proper temporal and spatial
adjustment in 2014. For comparability reasons over time, these same adjustments have to be implemented in 2012.
This task comprises not only the recalculation of the real consumption measure but also the poverty line.

The population under analysis in IHSES 2012 includes only households that lived in the same set of 13 governorates
mentioned above. The resulting dataset covers 16,735 out of 24,944 total households in IHSES 2012. As the
population changes, households‚Äô expenditures need to be recalculated using temporal deflators that take into
account the average CPI in this subset of governorates. These expenditures are then spatially adjusted to account
for relative price differences in the 13 governorates. The final step is to estimate a poverty line based on this subset
of spatially-adjusted expenditures.

The value of the poverty line estimated for the 13 governorates is close to the one estimated based on the whole
country (105,500.00 ID) but not exactly the same ‚Äì precisely, it is 3.1% lower. This should not be surprising, as the
population of reference now excludes Baghdad, which accounts for about one fifth of the population and is
characterized by relatively high expenditures per capita.

It is important to highlight here that there are differences between estimates for 2012 based on the whole country
and estimates for 2012 based on 13 governorates. Even though these differences are not statistically significant
from zero for all governorates except for Missan, there are some reasons why these are not exactly the same.
The values of the Paasche index used to spatially-adjust the per capita expenditures depend on the relative prices
in the population of reference. As the population under analysis is now composed of 13 governorates instead of the
whole country, the values of the adjustment factor change and consequently the spatially-adjusted expenditures.
In particular, the exclusion of Baghdad significantly altered the structure of the relative prices. The re-estimated
expenditures are the basis of a new poverty line and the combined effect can determine a change in the levels of
poverty. The results of this re-estimation for 2012 are shown in Table 6.

Table 7 presents the estimates based on the comparison of these 13 governorates in 2012 and 2014 using the full
year sample. 8 out of 13 governorates had a significant change (i.e. positive or negative) in the headcount rate.
Duhouk and Basrah experienced an increase in their incidence of poverty of almost 6 and 7.5 percentage points.
The other 5 governorates experienced a decline in poverty rates of less than 3 percentage points in Erbil to more
than 20 percentage points in Thi-Qar and Qadisiya. The remaining 5 governorates had no significant changes in
their headcount levels.

When these results are compared with those for the first and second half of 2014, the conclusion is that
improvements in the first half of the year were partially reversed by the twin crises in the second half in governorates
like Erbil, Kerbala Wasit, Thi-Qar, and Missan; while the deterioration was exacerbated in some cases like Duhouk
and Basrah.
Annex: METHODOLOGY FOR ADJUSTING HOUSEHOLD WEIGHTS IN
CONTINUOUS HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ‚Äì JANUARY-MAY 2014
Background and Objective

The CHS was designed to measure the welfare aggregate comparably with the IHSES (full year survey data collection and
identical income and consumption modules) but to cover a smaller sample, one adequate for governorate level estimates. The
2014 CHS covers 13 months starting in November 2013 and finishing in November 2014. The survey was designed to be
representative at the governorate level, with the intention that each wave would be nationally representative, with an intended
sample size of 13,834 households, drawn equally from each of the 18 governorates. It included a subset of the IHSES 2012
modules, including the household roster, education, labor, consumption, income, and rations. Moreover, it was designed as a
sub-sample of IHSES 2012 in terms of the sample of districts or qadhas.

However, fieldwork was affected by the security situation in some governorates as a consequence of the influence of the Islamic
State (IS) in some of Iraq‚Äôs northern and western provinces beginning in June 2014. As a result, there are two groups of
governorates in the final sample of the CHS: those where data collection was successfully completed and those where it could
not be completed. Moreover, due to the evolving security situation, even in the first group of governorates where the intended
sample was visited (in terms of the number of households visited), the distribution of visits to certain primary sampling units was
delayed or advanced.

The CHS dataset included weights that had been already adjusted for non-response, in the sense that within each governorate,
the sum of the weights added up to the estimated population of that governorate. Given the circumstances, this was a
reasonable adjustment to make. However, estimates of socio-economic indicators such as education, labor market outcomes,
and welfare are likely biased if these weights are used as they are. While the sample was stratified on urban and rural areas, so
that each sub-sample could be used to make inferences to the population or urban and rural areas independently, national
estimates could be biased with these weights. For instance, seasonality in incomes and consumption will affect welfare
measures, as households in some governorates were interviewed in only the first half of the year, and these households get
twice the weight as households in the remaining governorates. Similarly, if only urban households were interviewed within a
governorate, estimates of employment and educational attainment will also be biased. Therefore, these weights need to be
post-stratified to known urban and rural population counts, so that each of the half year samples can be used for national
inferences.

Upon the request of the government of Iraq, the World Bank team explored alternative options to make full use of this data,
which covers a very important crisis period. One objective is to establish a benchmark for 2014, based on information from
roughly the first half of the year, prior to the crisis. In order to do this, a re-adjustment of household weights (as described above)
is necessary, to obtain ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù estimates for the first half, and also to be able to compare them with estimates based on the
first half of 2012 data. The methodology behind this re-adjustment is detailed in this note.

Table 8 below shows the distribution of households in the sample over the CHS survey year. 13 out of 18 governorates were
continuously surveyed over the entire period: Kurdistan (i.e Duhok, Sulaimaniya and Erbil); part of Centre (Diyala, Babylon,
Kerbela, Wasit and Najaf) and South (i. e. Qadisiya, Muthanna, Thi-Qar, Maysan and Basrah). In five governorates, fieldwork
was disrupted beginning in June: Mosul, Kirkuk, Anbar, Baghdad and Salahaddin. Beginning from June 2014, there is significant
or complete non-response in Salahaddin, Kirkuk, Nineveh and Anbar. In the case of Baghdad, only 65 percent of the intended
respondents completed the survey with the last quarter of the survey‚Äôs year being severely affected. Additionally, the number
of household interviewed within the same governorate per month varies in all governorates.

Household weights were ideally intended to be constructed according to the sampling design implemented by area within
governorate. In the first stage, 96 Enumeration Areas in each governorate ‚Äì 70 urban and 26 in rural areas- were selected with
probability proportional to size. In the second stage, a cluster of 8 households were selected by systematic, equal probability
sampling (SEPS) in each of the selected EAs. Formally, the probability phij of selecting household hij in PSU hi of area in
governorate h is given by

where nhi is the number of households in the PSU and Nh is the number of households in the governorate‚Äôs area. This formula
simplifies to phji =560 / Nh in urban and phji =208 / Nh in rural area which is a constant in each governorate‚Äôs area.

Table 9 reports governorate level values of weights by urban and rural areas as well as household counts (i.e. total number of
households interviewed in the time interval); and population counts (i.e. household weighted counts) ‚Äì these weights
incorporate non-response as described above so that the sum of the weights in each governorate adds up to the total population.
Across similar population governorates, the value of the weight increases when there are fewer households in the sample. For
instance, while both urban Wasit and urban Salahaddin represent about 110,000 households, but the weight assigned to
households in the latter are double those assigned to households in urban Wasit, to compensate for the non-response in urban
Salahadin in the second half of the year. Consequently, although incompletely interviewed governorates were surveyed for a
shorter period (e.g. seven months instead of thirteen); households in the sample fully represent their corresponding populations
over the year given that their weights were adjusted for non-response.

In the context of an incomplete survey over the year, the weighting methodology described above also leads to biased
population estimates when using a shorter time interval. In other words, the population of governorates in group 2 is
‚Äúcompressed‚Äù over a shorter period of time (i.e. seven months) while group 1‚Äôs population is spread over 13 months. Therefore,
the contribution of the households in group 2 will be disproportionally larger when the analysis considers time intervals smaller
than the survey year. For instance, in an interval of five months (January to May), households in groups 2 will approximately
represent 5/7 of the population of their governorates, while households in group 1 would represent about 5/13 of their underlying
population. Table 10 illustrates this problem for urban areas; while 55% of urban Duhok‚Äôs households are represented in the first
time interval ‚Äìi.e. January to May ‚Äì 100% of urban households are represented in Mosul, Anbar and Salahaddin during the same
period.

One objective of the current analysis is to make comparisons between 2014 and 2012 surveys on different statistics such as
average consumption, poverty indices, and inequality, among others; based on the time interval in which the survey was
completed in all governorates in 2014. Therefore, the analysis below considers only the sample of households interviewed from
January to May in each year2, excluding those months during which only a subset of governorates was surveyed in 2014 and
removing possible seasonal effects on the 2012 estimates. To do that we first describe how weights were constructed in IHSES-
II and then the strategy adopted to adjust weights in order to make weighted estimates comparable between surveys.

Construction of weights in IHSES 2012
The 2012 IHSES survey covers twelve months, from January to December 2012. In general, the same number of households is
interviewed in each governorate per month over the survey year. For instance, 126 households were successfully interviewed in
Basrah each survey month, while roughly 180 households in Baghdad were surveyed per month during 2012 (Table 11).




 T ABLE 11: NUMBER OF H OUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED PER MONTH IN IHSES 2012

2 November and December (2011 and 2013), although fully surveyed, are excluded as the evolution of consumption expenditures is based on the

chronological progression of the survey, which was administered from January to December in IHSES 2012 and November to November in CHS.
In other words, since IHSES II did not cover the months of November and December of 2011, we exclude November and December of 2013 from
CHS.

Household weights were constructed according to the two stage sampling strategy implemented by qhada.3 In the first stage,
24 Enumeration Areas were selected with probability proportional to size, using the number of households as a Measure of Size
(MoS), and with implicit stratification by urban/rural and the subsequent geographical codes; and in the second, a cluster of 9
households were selected by systematic, equal probability sampling (SEPS) in each of the selected EAs. The probability phij of
selecting household hij in PSU hi of qhada h is given by

                                                                    24 Ì†µÌ±õ‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ñ        9
                                                        Ì†µÌ±ù‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó =              √ó
                                                                      Ì†µÌ±Å‚Ñé          Ì†µÌ±õ‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ñ

where nhi is the number of households in the PSU and Nh is the number of households in the qhada. The two factors on the right-
hand side respectively represent the probability of selecting the PSU, and the conditional probability of selecting the household
within the PSU. This formula simplifies to phji = 216 / Nh, which is a constant in each qhada. In other words, the proposed strategy
provides an equal-probability sample of 216 households in each qhada.

The weight‚Äôs structure of 2012 IHSES at qhada level gives the possibility to scale-up to governorate‚Äôs area (urban/rural) in order
to make comparisons with the weights structure of 2014 CHS. Table 12 reports the values for IHSES 2012 weights aggregated by
urban and rural area. As shown before, the value of weights increases when there are fewer households in the sample for similar
population counts.

However, the main difference with CHS is that households were mostly uniformly interviewed over the year in 2012. Figure 6
shows that the distribution of weights between January-May and June-November for urban areas in IHSES 2012 are very similar.
However, for rural areas, the differences are larger within the first and second half of the year. In contrast, rural and urban
weights between governorates in CHS are identical between January-May and June-November. This difference between the
CHS 2014 and the IHSES 2012 stem from the differences in sample design, in particular, the stratification in the latter at the
qadha level.

CHS 2014: Post-stratification of weights

In this exercise, and given our objective of establishing a benchmark relative to 2012, we focus on the months between January
and May in 2012 and 2014. A possible solution then, is to transform the available sample/population distribution of 2014 so that
it replicates the one of 2012 along the two relevant dimensions of the 2014 survey - governorate and area.4 In this way, the
households interviewed over the period under analysis would represent the same percentage of their corresponding population
in both surveys. The adjustment formula for the weights is:

where h indicate the governorate‚Äôs area; and I indicates the time interval under consideration (in the present analysis, the period
from January to May). The Population Proportion is calculated as the population count (weighted household count) in the time
interval divided by the total population count. The Household Count is the number of households interviewed in the time interval.
For example, the adjusted weight for the urban area of Baghdad is 1872.75 for the period January-May, implying a population in
2014 of 1,144,773 individuals, a population proportion in 2012 of 45.15% and a household count of 277. The original weight is
2,188.86, which is larger than the adjusted value as Baghdad was not surveyed starting from October 2014, thus reducing the
base of households in the sample.5




4 Replicating the 2012 distribution along the two relevant dimensions of the 2012 survey ‚Äì governorate and qhada ‚Äì is also theoretically feasible,
given that the 2014 survey reports the qhada where the households live. However, this approach may lead to biased estimates as the 2014 survey
was designed by area and the population distribution across qhada‚Äôs vary significantly. For example, there may be no household interviewed in
a specific qhada in 2014 or there may be relatively too many/few households interviewed with respect to 2012, thus dramatically changing the
associated weights (i.e. the relative importance of these households when estimating statistics).
5 CHS does not include data on households living in rural Baghdad for the months between January and May 2014. As the analysis specifically

considers this time interval to establish a benchmark relative 2012, the observations for rural Baghdad (171 household, representing a population
of 34,701) should be excluded from the IHSES 2012 sample covering this interval when making comparisons.

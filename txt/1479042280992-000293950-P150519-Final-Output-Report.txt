                                        COMPLETION SUMMARY1

The first Social Protection and Labor (SPL) Programmatic Analytical and Advisory Assistance
(PAAA) in FY2012-14 successfully solidified the Bank’s role as the Government’s partner of choice
in delivering high quality technical assistance and advice related to the strengthening of the
Government’s flagship programs, such the Pantawid Pamilya Conditional Cash Transfer Program,
as well as to the policy and institutional capacity development aimed at efficient and effective
delivery of public programs to the population. The technical assistance provided by the Bank has
contributed significantly to the transformation of social protection in the Philippines.

Building on the achievements and the momentum of that first programmatic engagement, this
second phase of assistance to the Department of Social Welfare and Development continued the
support to (i) fine-tune the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, the
Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (Pantawid Pamilya), and Government’s household targeting
system, the Listahanan, and (ii) broaden the knowledge base to inform advancements in the
Philippine’s overall social protection system.

The assistance was provided through the second SPL PAAA that was implemented over
FY2014-17. The activities were significantly supported through a trust fund resources provided by
the Australian DFAT. This technical assistance program has contributed to the refinement of several
key implementation aspects of the Pantawid Pamilya CCT and the national household targeting
system, Listahanan. The CCT coverage was expanded from 3.8 million beneficiary households in
December 2013 to 4.4 million in December 2015, accompanied by an expansion to cover older
children (15-18 years old) beyond the original eligibility of 0-14 years old. By the end of 2015, the
CCT coverage reached 100% of households with children identified as poor by Listahanan. The
Impact Evaluation conducted undet this TA, as well as a Benefit Incidence Analysis using
household survey data showed that the CCT program is performing very well in delivering on its
objectives. The heightened attention received by the CCT program over these years from program
beneficiaries, partners, legislators, and observers has not only led to enhancements in the
program’s grievance redress mechanism but also to more and better articulation of evidence of the
program’s impacts. 2015 marks the first update of the Listahanan since it was first done in the
Philippines over 2007-2010. Overall, this program has contributed strongly to the client’s successful
achievement of remarkable results in implementing the CCT program and in establishing and
operating one of the most comprehensive national household targeting systems in the world.

I.     BACKGROUND
The Government of the Philippines has made significant progress in developing its social
protection sector over the last 10 years, which has been one of its main strategies to
address poverty and vulnerability. The most notable developments had been the
introduction of a national household targeting system (more popularly known as
Listahanan), a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, and the universal health care
(UHC) program that reaches out to the poorest Filipino families, i.e., those who belong to
the bottom 40 percent as identified in the Listahanan.

The flagship social protection program is the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, a CCT
program. It was introduced to support poor families’ investment in health and education of
children 0-14 and to alleviate their poverty. It has rapidly grown from 360,000 beneficiary
households at the time it was launched in 2008 to 3.8 million poor households in 2013. By
then, the Pantawid has become the world’s third largest CCT program – covering nearly 20
million people or 75% of the poor population and with a budget that reached 0.4% of GDP.
Free health insurance and access to primary health care has been extended to all the
Pantawid beneficiaries, as well as to other families that belonged to the bottom 40 percent
of the population, as part of the UHC program. Both the Pantawid and UHC programs
benefited from the Listahanan that was established in 2009. The Listahanan contains
information of 11 million households nationwide (about 60 percent of the population), of
which 5.2 million households were classified as “poor? and prioritized for various
Government assistance programs.

The World Bank, jointly with Australian Aid (DFAT), first supported the Government’s
ambitious social protection agenda through a series of discrete technical assistance grants
from 2006 through 2010. This was followed by the first Social Protection Programmatic AAA
(SP PAAA) that covered FY2010-FY2013. The Bank’s assistance throughout this
foundational period for the Philippine SP system has been instrumental, particularly in the
areas of poverty targeting, CCT implementation and monitoring, and rigorous analytical
work to inform the broader policy dialogue on social safety nets and poverty reduction.2

The second SPL PAAA built on the results achieved in the first seven years of close
collaboration with DSWD and DFAT. It sought to continue the technical support and advice
to the Government in further strengthening its flagship SP programs while at the same time
open new areas of engagement beyond social assistance and targeting. While the
foundational management information systems and procedures had already been
established and functioning in support of Listahanan and the world’s third largest CCT
program, the Pantawid Pamilya, to deliver on their respective objectives, DSWD was keen
to ensure that these systems continued to be strengthened and primed to meet evolving
demands. The Government remained keen on learning more about how to make its CCT
program more effective using rigorous evaluations and in-depth process assessments to
inform necessary recalibration of the current program design and implementation. In
2
  The achievements from the first SP PAAA (P118853) is summarized in the Completion Report in June 2015
(http://imagebank.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2015/07/29/090224b083032f5f/1_0/Render

                                                  4
addition, attention to other components of the social protection system was just as
important. Thus, the second phase of technical assistance was designed to continuously
provide high quality technical support to DSWD in its efforts to enhance the design of the
CCT program and Listahanan and strengthen their operation systems and business
processes. Also, the TA was designed to open the dialog in insurance/pensions and to
further Bank engagement in the labor, skills, and jobs agenda.

Relevance of the Program

This program was aligned well with the World Bank Group (WBG) twin goals of poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. It directly contributed to the achievement of the objectives
of the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for the Philippines, specifically in
Engagement Area 2: Empowering the Poor and Vulnerable. Besides contributing to the
achievement of better health and education outcomes for poor children, it also informed and
assisted DSWD and other policy making agencies in efforts to improve program’s
performance by taking actions to continuously improve its implementation. More
importantly, the PAAA was focused on strengthening the social protection as a whole - SP
played an important role in the Philippine Government’s overall strategy to reduce poverty
and boost shared prosperity.

With its long and excellent tradition and track record in social protection, the WBG was
uniquely positioned to conduct this PAAA. The program was a continuation of technical
assistance which laid the foundations for the core safety net program, and continued to
guide the dynamic evolution of the social protection system.


II.   OBJECTIVES AND INTENDED RESULTS
The SP&L PAAA primarily benefited the Department and Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD), the main implementing agency for the CCT program and targeting system. It also
benefited other government agencies involved in SP, such as the State Social Security
System (SSS), the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), NEDA, DBM and others

Specifically, the Concept Note (CN) for the SP&L PAAA articulated the following objectives:

(i)    Assist DSWD sustain the role of the CCT program as a well-established and
implemented backbone of the SSN in the Philippines. This will be achieved by further
strengthening of the CCT operations and management, including identification of
beneficiaries, eligibility and compliance verification, grievance and redress and payment
delivery, MIS integration, monitoring and evaluation capacity and expansion to cover poor
children in secondary education.

(ii)  Advance the implementation of the Government’s convergence agenda by
broadening and deepening the knowledge base for overall social protection policy
dialog to include social security and labor market policies.
In doing so, the program committed to contribute to achieving the following outcomes:

                                               5

To deliver on this ambitious program, a combination of just-in-time technical assistance on
the daily operation and troubleshooting of DSWD programs, discrete analytical products,
and capacity building workshops was designed over a 3-year period (FY14-FY16) to benefit
mainly DSWD management and technical staff. All activities in the programs have been
discussed and agreed on with the counterparts in DSWD and in consultations with DFAT
staff.


III. SUBTASK: CCT BUSINESS PROCESSES, GRIEVANCE REDRESS SYSTEM,
AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (P150519)

This subtask assessed existing system requirements and the necessary enhancements to
significantly improve the efficiency of the CCT program implementation. Specifically, it
assessed the following: (i) business process related to the CCT payment, and Grievance
Redress System (GRS); and (ii) the automated integration of the various components of the
CCT Management Information System (MIS) architecture. This subtask also supported
training of CCT field implementers (Municipal Links and Grievance Officers) to help them
perform more effectively and help resolve issues expeditiously. Assistance in developing
and rolling out a campaign was also extended to increase awareness of the general public
on the GRS process. This task was created at Mid-Term implementation, merging from
other existing subtasks (P150519, P150224, P150518, P150529, P150531, and P150533).
Specific activities under this sub-task are as follows:
GRS and overall CCT MIS (originally 150519): The TA was intended to improve the GRS
processes of the CCT for faster processing of complaints, and improve its MIS application
and integration with the rest of the CCT program delivery and information systems through
a    thorough    Business      Process    Review by a          highly    specialized   firm
(PriceWaterhouseCoopers). The activity focused particularly on: (i) reviewing the business
process related to the CCT’s GRS and its automated integration with other relevant
business processes such as Compliance Verification System (CVS) and processing of
retroactive payments; (ii) enhancing capacity of program front liners such as the Municipal
Links and Grievance Officers to processes grievance reports more effectively; and (iii)
assessing other CCT business processes, their automation, and related data management.

                                                6
Main outputs for this sub-task included technical reports on the CCT (Business Process
Review), GRS (IT and Business Processes), and consultations with relevant DSWD project
implementers, and trainings.

Strengthening of the CCT payment method (originally P150224): DSWD has
diversified payment delivery modes in order to reduce transportation costs, and travel and
waiting time borne by CCT beneficiaries when claiming grants. Beneficiaries collect grants
either through Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)-issued Cash Cards, LBP
over-the-counter (OTC) payments, or through LBP conduits (G-Cash, Rural Banks, etc.).
This activity intended to examine the efficiency of the payment processes, focusing on the
impacts of the diversification of payment delivery modes on program be neficiaries’ access
to payments, transaction costs, and accountability mechanisms associated with delivering
grants. Global good practice examples and technical advice on how to further improve and
strengthen the CCT payment system will be provided. As agreed with DSWD, this activity
focused on assessing current payment modes and payment procedures/timelines of the
Pantawid Pamilya and providing concrete recommendations from the perspective of
payment solutions, financial management, and financial inclusion. It sought to address two
research question defined jointly by WB and DSWD teams: (1) how to increase electronic
solutions (i.e., reduce manual transactions like OTC), and (2) how to make financial
processes and timelines more efficient and streamlined. It was intended that the outputs
and the close technical advice with the client will result in faster release of CCT cash grants
to beneficiaries that minimizes governance risks and transaction costs both to program
implementers and beneficiaries.

Spatial Differences in CCT Implementation (originally P150518): CCT implementation
follows a standard set of processes and procedures that applies to all program areas.
However, program monitoring data show regional variations in implementation and
performance. The National Capital Region, which is highly urbanized and has the lowest
poverty rate in the country, and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM),
which is predominantly rural and has the highest poverty rate in the country, stand out as
poor performers in program outcome indicators. To understand what drives these results,
this activity examined conditions, factors, and dynamics that affect the CCT implementation
in these areas. A process and risk mapping review assessed how the program was
implemented at each step of the program cycle using available administrative and survey
data. Other factors that may be beyond the control of the CCT operational processes but
affect service delivery were also explored, such as socio-cultural dynamics. This activity
delivered a technical note on spatial differences in the CCT implementation, which was
thoroughly discussed with the client. It was intended that these outputs will contribute to
improving the CCT implementation in underperforming localities.

Enhancing activation and transition from the CCT program opportunities (P150529):
The Government strategy to poverty reduction combines social assistance with a range of
programs aimed at human capita development and the enhancement of employment
opportunities to help poor and vulnerable households exit poverty on a sustainable basis.
The Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP) is a community-based capacity building
program of the DSWD that seeks to improve economic sufficiency of its target participants
through microenterprise development (Track 1) and employment facilitation (Track 2). The

                                                 7
program started in 2011 and was developed as a graduation program for beneficiaries of
the CCT Program. In 2015, the program has benefited over 1 million individuals from CCT
households. This activity examined the SLP as the DSWD’s existing activation, transition,
livelihood program. In particular, it reviewed the business processes of the SLP with a view
to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of its implementation and help it achieve its
desired result of improving the economic well-being of program participants. The study
intended to provide the SLP Program Management Office (PMO) with fresh perspectives on
how the program can be further developed to serve its objectives.

Capacity building for the social protection policy and system development
(P150531): This task supported the first ever WB SPL core course in a given country. This
activity was designed to provide training that is customized to the local requirements of the
Philippine Social Protection System by experts on social protection system development
and implementation. The SPL core course curricula was patterned after the World Bank
Social Protection courses. The course was intended to keep policy-makers and
practitioners abreast with the latest knowledge and global good practice in the development
and implementation of the social protection systems and their implementation. This highly
innovative approach was designed to provide counterparts with a solid understanding of the
basics of social insurance, social safety nets, labor market and skills, and social protection
(SP) systems. At the same time, the course addressed specific issues of program design
and implementation that applies in the Philippine context. Over seventy participants
comprising policy makers, analysts and technical staff from thirteen Philippine government
agencies participated in the course, including staff from DSWD, the Social Security
Institute, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), National Economic Development
Authority (NEDA), and Department of Finance (DoF). Representatives of UNICEF, ILO and
Australian DFAT attended as well.
Social Protection Benefit Incidence Analysis (P150533): The objective of this activity
was to enrich evidence base for the policy dialogue on the CCT Program and complement
results of the CCT impact evaluation. Using the latest national household surveys (FIES
2012, APIS 2013), a benefit-incidence analysis of the CCT program will be undertaken to
assess the performance of the CCT program in terms of targeting efficiency, benefit
adequacy, and its poverty impact. The main output was a policy note that was used by the
Bank and DSWD in its policy dialogs with legislators, partner agencies in the CCT program,
and other stakeholders, with results presented at several conferences and quoted in the
press.


IV.    OUTPUTS AND RESULTS ACHIEVED
The SPL PAAA, and this particular subtask, has successfully contributed in
informing policy and operational decisions of the Government in the continuous
enhancement of its core social protection instruments. The dialog around social
protection had been informed by high quality analytical products from this PAAA on topics
related to social assistance design (specifically on the CCT and SLP).

The Program has also maintained cultivating a culture evidence using M&E systems
and enhancing local capacity. Systematic monitoring and evaluation is not inherent in

                                                8
Government, and less so in agencies deluded with program implementation. However, in
the same vein, investing in M&E systems and the capacity of its workforce in systematic
monitoring is so much more important to enhance their effectiveness in implementing large
programs. This second phase of assistance allowed for continuing hand-holding with
DSWD to build staff capacity and appreciation in using M&E tools to improve their
effectiveness in implementing programs.

The GRS Assessment reports served as basis for DSWD to finalize changes in the
GRS procedures and timelines in responding to grievances. The GRS Assessment
Report was presented to DSWD in a workshop on November 10-12, 2014 in Manila.
Specifically, the report recommended redefining grievance typologies, enhanced GRS
flowchart (with clear accountability, feasible timeline and resolution indicators), simplified
and localized grievance uptake form, and decentralized strategy of grievance handing to
provide immediate advice to beneficiaries on queries regarding updates, compliance and
payment concerns. The PAAA provided financial and technical capacity to disseminate the
results of the assessment and to ensure continuous, efficient and effective implementation
of GRS operations.

A business process review of the CCT’s MIS led to a larger, more in -depth review of
the business process of Pantawid Pamilya. This study found that the CCT as a program
is able to accomplish its objectives by effectively reaching out to more than 4.4 million
beneficiaries. This means that the right beneficiaries are able to receive the appropriate
grants according to their degree of compliance with program conditionalities, and that
process controls are in place to ensure this. The report found that it still has significant room
for improvement in terms of enhancing controls and in ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
The report observed that the key vulnerabilities of the program relate to the multiple manual
conduct of tasks across the Pantawid processes coupled with its unintegrated information
systems. Furthermore, the inflexibility of the current information systems paired with the
regular changes being made in the processes and policies make it difficult for the systems
and processes to fully synchronize and nimbly adapt to any changes in direction. It
therefore recommended to further automate processes and integrate information systems.
This entails improving the Pantawid’s technological infrastructure, with primary focus on
upgrading its database. This upgrade would reduce bottlenecks experienced in data
processing, promote efficient processing, and strengthen internal controls. Implementing IT
service management practices will also help in ensuring that the Pantawid’s information
systems will become more responsive to the changing needs of the program. These
findings were discussed in depth with new authorities at DSWD, which are now taking
action for its implementation.

Findings from the assessment of the CCT payment system resulted in operational
changes in the payment procedures of the CCT program not only to improve speed
of delivering cash grants to beneficiaries but also to facilitate faster liquidation. This
task was completed in December 2015 with the delivery of a Technical Note on the findings
and detailed operational recommendations to strengthen the CCT Payment System and a
Social Protection Policy Note that summarizes the findings of the Technical Note. Under the
guidance of DSWD’s appointed focal, in the person of the Undersecretary for Finance,
several consultations were with partner agencies Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and

                                                  9
the Commissions on Audit (COA), as well as a series of consultations and presentations
with relevant units in DSWD at the central and field offices. The assessment mapped the
business process flow of the CCT program’s Payment System, identified its strong points,
and also highlighted several bottlenecks in the current procedures which ultimately resulted
in delays or miscomputations of CCT grants received by beneficiaries, delays in liquidating
cash, and adverse audit observations by the COA. Among others, the review
recommended to discontinue the use of an Acknowledgement Receipt and replace it with
payroll lists. This step is a low hanging fruit and can shorten payment liquidation by LBP and
it conduits who deliver grants to beneficiaries by up to 10 days. The review also
recommended to pilot three payment improvement options: (i) expanding cash withdrawal
network via POS terminals, (ii) linking to existing accounts (or new accounts) at financial
institutions (conduits), and (iii) Direct deposit through PhilPaSS Remit. DSWD new
authorities, in collaboration with LBP, are already moving forward with some of key
recommendations. The SPL team in Manila worked with local and international Bank staff in
the Finance and Markets Global Practice (GFMDR) and hired local consultants to
complement the task team. Internally to the Bank, this TA resulted in deeper collaboration
between the SPL and F&M Global Practices to meet client demand and deliver quality
output and expert advice to the client.

The review on spatial differences in the CCT implementation helped uncover
implementation blocks on the ground. The “Comparative Study of Regional Differences
in Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program Implementation ? was completed in October 2016
and presented to DSWD technical staff in September 2015. The qualitative study aimed to
uncover factors that affect high compliance rate in some regions (e.g., Ilocos Region and
CARAGA, which are the 2 regions with the highest average compliance rate on education
and health) and what hinders success in other regions (e.g., NCR and ARMM, which are
the poorest performers in complying with education and health conditions). The study
pointed to the following as factors that drive compliance in high-performing areas:
knowledge and proactivity of program implementers on the ground especially the Municipal
Links; beneficiaries understanding of the program and their responsibilities; active
engagement of the local government units and partners in the Departments of Education
and Health; and accessibility and adequacy of supply services. The study pointed out that
mainly the opposite are factors at play in low-performing areas. The study confirmed that
opportunity costs and conflict effected low compliance in NCR and ARMM, respectively. In
addition, due to local norms and political and geographic challenges in ARMM, the study
found deviations in program implementation and monitoring in the region. Findings of the
study is hoped to feed into further operational refinements of the CCT program to better
serve low-performing areas. Beyond learning about what works and what did not in
program areas, the study provided opportunity for DSWD technical staff to apply acquired
knowledge in program monitoring. Under the guidance of the Bank team, DSWD led the
conduct of the study, provided administrative data and orientation about the CCT program
to the study team. DSWD technical staff prepared the TOR, proposed the study
methodology, selected study areas, and monitored the study closely. Throughout the
process, available program data was used to validate the study’s preliminary findings,
confirm hypotheses of reasons for low or high compliance, and implications on potential
adjustments to the program.

Findings from the assessment of the SLP design and implementation open
opportunities for the Bank’s increased engagement in SLP of the DSWD as well as
its partner agencies. The “Business Process Review of the Sustainable Livelihood
Program? was presented to counterparts in DSWD and completed in September 2015 with
their feedback and inputs. The review highlighted a number of design and implementation
challenges of the program that need to be strengthened as well as processes that need to
be formalized and systematized. There is significant scope for improvement in the design
and implementation of the SLP. While there may be several areas to focus on, the
assessment pointed to four priority areas of assistance: (i) improving selection of program
areas; (ii) intensifying social preparation; (iii) strengthening capacity of ground
implementers; and (iv) improving effectiveness of field management systems. The Bank’s
continued involvement in these areas will also naturally increase the SLP PMO’s capacity to
implement and monitor the program. In addition, this open opportunities for DSWD and the
Bank to partner more formally on the SLP work with relevant government agencies
including Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Department of
Labor and Employment (DOLE), and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to determine
medium- to long-term strategic directions for the SLP and priority livelihood sectors and
support at the local level.

The benefit-incidence analysis of the Pantawid Pamilya has been useful in gaining
support to continue the program. This task was completed in October 2015 with the
public release of the print-version of the Social Protection Policy Note No. 8. Prior to the
release of the publication, results of the analyses have already been presented at various
public fora, first in November 2015 in Manila at the launch of the CCT’s second impact
evaluation results. This was followed by presentations to the National Advisory Committee
(NAC) of the Pantawid Pamilya Program in December 2015, the National Independent
Advisory and Monitoring Committee (NIAMC) of the Pantawid Pamilya Program in February
2016, and Monitoring and Evaluations (M&E) Officers and field office staff of DSWD in
various occasions. Evidence from the two rounds of rigorous impact evaluations of the CCT
already show the program has proved successful in improving health and educational
outcomes of children. However, given how much resources the CCT has received, there is
always pressure to show that the program has in fact reached poor households and made a
dent on overall poverty. Evidence from this report showed that despite the program’s fast
expansion, it has remained as one of the best targeted CCT programs in the world – with
82% of beneficiaries belonging to the bottom 40% – and a cost-effective means of
delivering assistance to the poor. The analysis also found that, while the cash assistance
from the CCT has declined significantly in real terms and represents only 11.6% of the
incomes of beneficiaries in the bottom 20%, it reduced income poverty among beneficiaries
by 7.4 percentage points and nationally by 1.4 percentage points. The analysis also found
that beneficiaries spend their CCT cash grants on basic commodities such as food,
clothing, and school and medical expenses. These results were consistent with findings
from the second impact evaluation of the CCT of improved schooling and medical attention
to children of beneficiary households. The policy note recommended that for the CCT to
maintain its poverty impacts, it needs to continuously use an objective and updated
targeting system such as the Listahanan, keep a sound monitoring and evaluation system,
and adjust the level of cash assistance to be provide adequate assistance to poorest
families. DSWD was able to use the results of the BIA to secure the Depa rtment’s budget

for the CCT program in 2016 as well as DSWD’s Medium -term Expenditure Plan for
2016-2019 that includes continuation of the CCT program in the next 4 years. Results of the
analysis was also used in preparing the Bank’s Second Social Welfare and Development
Reform Project (SWDRP II, P153744), which was approved by the WB Board in November
2015 and became effective in June 2016. The analysis also enriched M&E Officers’
knowledge of existing tools that they can use in monitoring performance of DSWD
programs on a more regular basis. During presentations, the Bank team went over the
technical principles behind it as well as the use of new tools developed by the Bank
(ADEPT) that are publicly accessible. The DSWD Policy Development and Planning
Bureau (PDPB) has committed to include in their Capacity Building Plan for 2017 a more
hands-on training on undertaking benefit-incidence analysis for technical staff in the field
offices and produce in-house the next report for the CCT once the full 2015 FIES data
becomes available.

Finally, the SPL core course has been a one-of-a-kind event, first time done in a
single country. Using the conceptual framework presented in the course, participants
teamed up to apply their learning and identify key issues in the areas of SP system, social
safety nets, social security and labor markets in the Philippines and proposed strategic
actions for short and long term implementation. The participants pointed out that these
inputs will be used and further elaborated as the Philippines moves forward to update the
Social Protection Operational Framework and prepare the SP strategy, as well as the new
Philippine Development Plan.

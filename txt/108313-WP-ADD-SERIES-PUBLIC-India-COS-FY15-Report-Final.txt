I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in India perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing India
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in India
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to May 2015, 580 stakeholders of the WBG in India were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/community based organizations (CBO); the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 263 stakeholders participated in the survey
(45% response rate).

Some respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in
person, and others received and returned the questionnaires via mail or courier. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing India; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in India; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s country survey were compared to those in the country survey conducted
in FY’12 (response rate is 19%, N=271). Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder
composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were
not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged
to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 15
data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the
original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, E, G, and H. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix F (page 121).

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY12 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 6.96; weighted mean in FY’12 = 6.81)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in India, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the perceived relevance of the WBG to India’s development
        and the WBG’s help to achieve the country’s development results.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in India, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the nineteen specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in India. The
       areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in India, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

Appendix F: Responses to All Questions by Year24
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 248  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 250

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

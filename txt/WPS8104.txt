1    Introduction

Among all the socioeconomic indicators developed during the last two centuries, the share of the
population living in poverty has become one of the most studied and monitored (Ravallion 2016,
chap. 1). A good poverty measurement and profiling identifies the poor and targets and monitors
all interventions designed to benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society. Thus, there is an
increasing interest from academics and policy makers to know the current poverty status at the
country, regional, and global levels to design policy solutions that alleviate the situation of the less
well-off.1 Nonetheless, due to data collection and processing time, poverty indicators are generally
released with one or more years of lag. This delay makes it challenging to provide real-time
poverty analysis and to strengthen the dialogue on the implementation of policies to mitigate the
poverty impact of shocks like economic crisis or natural disasters.2
        Departing from the basic intuition that the performance of poverty depends on the evolution
of national welfare aggregates like the GDP per capita, it is expected that poverty forecasting relies
on the accuracy of forecasted GDP. That is, if the forecasted GDP were off, the forecasted poverty
would be off as well. However, the main difference between nowcasting and forecasting poverty
is that the GDP per capita is actual for the former, while it is forecasted for the latter. By validating
three poverty forecasting methods with actual GDP information, this paper bridges the gap of
knowledge between the most recent poverty numbers available and the current calendar year.
Additionally, it provides empirical evidence for the reliability of such methods to enlighten the
current situation of poverty, rather than its performance in the future.
        Generally speaking, poverty forecasting provides a series of possible, future GDP scenarios
whose poverty outcomes are determined by the poverty forecasting method. That is, poverty
forecasting is an attempt to understand the performance of poverty if the GDP scenario
assumptions are met and the poverty forecasting method is accurate (Karver, Kenny, and Sumner

  For instance, extreme poverty reduction was among the most important indicators in the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), while the World Bank recently adopted the goal of ending extreme poverty at the global level by 2030.
The World Bank measures global overall poverty as life under a US$1.9 per person per day in 2011 Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP) (Ferreira et al. 2016, Dean and Prydz 2015). Similarly, the World Bank estimates the regional overall
poverty in the LAC region as having an income below the US$4 per person per day poverty line in 2005 PPPs
(Gasparini et al. 2013, Castaneda et al. 2016).
2
  For instance, the latest global poverty estimates produced by the World Bank are from 2013, while the most recent
Latin American and the Caribbean regional estimates are from 2014 (see Castaneda et al. 2016 for the 2014 LAC
regional estimates).
                                                             2
2012; Ravallion 2012; Ravallion 2013; Edward and Sumner 2013; Chandy, Ledlie, and
Penciakova 2013; Yoshida, Uematsu, and Sobrado 2014; and Poverty Research Report, The World
Bank 2000). In contrast, given that poverty nowcasting relies on actual GDP data, its accuracy
depends only on the features of each nowcasting method.
        The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of several methods for
poverty nowcasting to get real-time poverty estimates in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
To this end, the paper first documents existing methodologies for poverty nowcasting by
describing in detail their main assumptions, their information requirements, and their main
limitations. Then, it validates the performance of these methods by comparing nowcasted poverty
numbers with actual poverty estimates. In the particular case of the LAC region, National
Statistical Offices (NSOs) usually release poverty numbers with one year of lag. Thus, this paper
validates these poverty nowcasting methods one year ahead.
       Three contributions to the literature on poverty nowcasting‚Äîand forecasting‚Äîstem from
this paper. First, this paper develops a methodological framework to understand the errors of these
techniques for poverty nowcasting. Second, this analysis validates the methods using a set of about
180 harmonized micro household datasets available for 15 countries in LAC for the 2003‚Äì14
period. By using this comprehensive database, the paper minimizes the possibility of arriving to
conclusions based on biased samples of countries or spurious results. Finally, the paper assesses
the robustness of the results and quantifies the accuracy of each method by empirically testing the
magnitude of the errors in each methodology.
       Our results suggest that the three methods are promising for nowcasting both large poverty
reductions as well as poverty stagnation in the region one year ahead. In general, the two bottom-
up approaches that simulate the performance of each agent in the economy to nowcast poverty
perform better than the top-down approach that uses welfare estimates to explain the performance
of poverty at an aggregate level over time. The paper also provides evidence that the results are in
general stable to changes in the underlying parameters used for producing poverty nowcasts.
       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the three approaches for
nowcasting poverty and the theoretical framework of the nowcasting errors. Section 3 presents the
data used and the empirical approach. Section 4 presents the validation results of the poverty
nowcasting in LAC. Section 5 shows the stress and sensitivity analysis of the methods. Finally,
section 6 concludes.

2     Poverty forecasting methods in practice

The projection of poverty headcount is nothing else than ‚Äúnon-linear functions of underlying
changes in average income and measures of income inequality‚Äù (Kraay 2006, 200). That is, the
analysis of the performance of certain covariates that are assumed to have a significant and known
effect on the welfare distribution, so that we are able to estimate the new share of population under
a particular welfare threshold in a subsequent period for which there are no microdata available.
The literature presents several methods to identify the main determinants and forecast poverty,
though little is known about their level of accuracy and performance. These methods vary in terms
of their assumptions and level of sophistication, which can be framed under two general
approaches: ‚Äútop-down‚Äù and ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù methods.

2.1    Top-down approaches
These approaches use economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth to explain
the performance of poverty at an aggregate level over time. One of the top-down approaches most
widely used is the Poverty-growth Elasticity (PE hereafter) method. The simplest version of this
method consist of the ratio between the percent change in the poverty headcount and the percent
change of a welfare aggregate measure ‚Äìe.g., GDP per capita- in two moments in time, that is
                                                      ŒîÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±° /Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1                                 (1)
                                        Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±°,Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1 =
                                                      ŒîÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±° /Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1
where ŒîÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±° ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 is the change in the poverty headcount and ŒîÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±° ‚àí Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 is the change
in the aggregate measure of welfare. Assuming that the elasticity Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±°,Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1 has a unique non-stochastic
value over time for any poverty measure, poverty in period Ì†µÌ±° + 1 can be projected as follows
                                                        ŒîÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°
                                   Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±°+1 ‚âà Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±° (1 +         Ì†µÌ∞∏       )                            (2)
                                                        Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 Ì†µÌ±°,Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1


        Elasticities have proved to perform well for poverty forecasting in cross-country settings
(Bourguignon 2003, Klasen and Misselhorn 2006, and Yoshida et al. 2014). However, it can be
shown that the relationship between growth and poverty tends to decrease when poverty decreases
and therefore they may not work properly when forecasting poverty rates in long periods of time
(Yoshida et al. 2014).



                                                             4
         Kakwani (1993) proposes a methodology that assumes that the Lorenz curve shifts entirely
by an offset factor,3 which leads to a rigid structure of inequality but provides a useful
simplification. With these in hand, the author calculates elasticities of poverty with respect to both
changes in mean income and Gini coefficient. Results show that, for the case of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, the
measures of poverty are highly elastic to changes in income inequality and mean income, with the
income elasticity being considerably higher. Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Kraay (2006) find
different results for a large set of countries where the average income growth is the main and most
important driver of poverty reduction. Similarly, Datt and Ravallion (1992) decomposes changes
in poverty in Brazil and India in the 1980s, finding that the effect of growth on poverty
overshadows the redistribution effect for most of the pairs of years studied. This implies that,
depending on the country and its current characteristics, poverty might be determined either by the
growth of the economy or by the distribution of welfare in a particular period.
         By adding temporality to the analysis, Ravallion and Chen (1997, 360) suggest a simple
model in which the Lorenz curve may change from one period to another. In this case, the elasticity
can take any sign or magnitude and it has its own distribution, that is
                                      Log Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªº + B logYÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±°                                       (3)

where B is an empirical growth elasticity, Ì†µÌªº is a time-persistent effect, and Ì†µÌªæ is a time trend. Given
that it is impossible to observe the true mean of the GDP or consumption per capita Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àó , the
regressions must be done with what is actually observed, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±° .
         More sophisticated models attempt to incorporate other aggregate variables like inequality,
but given that several combinations of two or more aggregate variables may produce the same
poverty forecast, the exercise must be done by assessing the plausibility of different scenarios
(Ravallion 2012; Ravallion 2013).

2.2    Bottom-up approaches
These approaches simulate the performance‚Äîor even the behavior‚Äîof each agent in the economy
to generate a new welfare aggregate used to estimate poverty. The most basic model assumes that
all households‚Äô incomes are re-scaled by the same factor, say GDP per capita growth (Yoshida et
al. 2014). This method, known as Neutral Distribution Growth (NDG hereafter), usually performs

3
 Namely, Ì†µÌ∞ø‚àó (Ì†µÌ±ù) = Ì†µÌ∞ø(Ì†µÌ±ù) ‚àí Ì†µÌºÜ[Ì†µÌ±ù ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞ø(Ì†µÌ±ù)], where Ì†µÌ∞ø is the original Lorenz curve, Ì†µÌ∞ø‚àó is the shifted one, and Ì†µÌºÜ is the
percentage change of the Gini coefficient.
                                                                5
well as long as inequality remains stable. Karver, Kenny, and Sumner (2012) explain that poverty
forecast based on past trends is a na√Øve approach to forecasting due to the high volatility of poverty.
Instead, they select three different scenarios based on IMF growth projections and predict poverty
rates for all countries, assuming static inequality in a 20-year period. As explained by the authors,
the assumption of a neutral distribution is strong and it may bias the results in exercises that involve
long-run predictions like theirs. In this paper, in contrast, the validation of poverty estimates is
done from one year to another; a small period of time in which inequality changes are null or very
small, especially in LAC where income inequality has decreased considerably in the past decade
in most of the countries and then recently stagnated (Cord et al. 2017).
      Complex models in which income distribution is not assumed stable provide deeper
understanding of the relation between specific segments of the economy and the evolution of
poverty rates. Olivieri et al. (2014) developed a technique and software module‚ÄîADePT
Simulation‚Äîto forecast the distribution of incomes by incorporating projections of other
aggregates such as economic output and employment by sector; prices; and population growth.
Other methods disaggregate the country‚Äôs population into proportionally-augmented bands of
welfare aggregates in order to relax the assumption of static distribution (Edward 2006; Edward
and Sumner 2013), or simply assume different inequality scenarios by shifting the proportion of
economic growth from the top 10 percent to the bottom 40 (Chandy, Ledlie, and Penciakova 2013).
The main advantage of the method is that it produces income forecasts at the household-level and
allows predicting distributional measures besides poverty. However, data requirements are
significant and therefore it is costly to apply the method to several countries at the same time and
in a consistent manner, which is one of the main objectives of this paper.

2.3   The approach of this paper
The two approaches most widely used today to nowcast poverty are the PE and the NDG methods.
Although simple to implement, the PE method has limited application because it produces only
aggregated -as opposed to household or individual level- poverty extrapolations. On the other
hand, unlike the PE method, the main advantage of the NDG method is that it produces income
estimates at the household-level. However, since all household incomes are multiplied by the same
economic growth rate, the method cannot be used for distributional analysis.



                                                       6
        To overcome these limitations, we also analyze a generalized form of the NDG method, in
which different sections of the income distribution are assumed to grow at different rates,
following a specific and ad-hoc algorithm. This approach attempts to capture the heterogeneity of
growth across individuals or households by assuming that quantile-specific contributions to
growth during a known-data period remain similar during the unknown-data period. This
assumption is an extension of the ‚Äúshare of incremental income‚Äù definition of pro-poor growth
studied by White and Anderson (2001). The authors explain that if the share of total income growth
                                                                                Ì†µÌ±É
(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±° ‚àí Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 ) that corresponds to the income growth of the poor (Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±É ‚àí Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 ) from time Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí 1 to Ì†µÌ±° is
higher than from Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí 2 to Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí 1, the economy can be classified as pro-poor. Instead of studying
the contribution of the poor population, which varies over time, we analyze the contribution of
each quantile to total growth and assume stability over time. We refer to this method as Quantile
Growth Contribution (QGC).
        Two main assumptions are required under QGC. First, the method assumes that people
with similar welfare aggregates in one period will perform similarly in the next period. That is, we
expect that, after ranking the population by quantiles based on welfare, two households within the
same quantile in period t will belong to the same quantile in period Ì†µÌ±° + 1. Second, the method
assumes that the economy performs today as it did in the past.
        Data requirements needed to implement all these three methods are fairly reasonable and
therefore they can be applied in our setting: to nowcast poverty estimates in many countries and
years and in a consistent manner. In addition, all these methods have real-life applications and
have been extensively used to nowcast and forecast poverty estimates. For instance, the World
Bank uses the NDG method to extrapolate poverty estimates from the latest surveys available
(Yoshida et al. 2014), while it uses the PE method to produce poverty forecasts based on per capita
GDP forecasts (World Bank 2015; Yoshida et al. 2014).

3     Analytical assessment of measuring poverty in real time

3.1    Poverty measurement in the world and in LAC
Since the early 1990s, the World Bank has measured global poverty based on a comparable total
household per capita welfare measure and an international poverty line, both expressed in the same
purchasing power in all countries of the world (Ferreira et al. 2016). In the particular case of LAC,
income is the proxy for welfare most commonly used. Even when consumption is usually preferred
                                                           7
in the literature, income has been widely used in practice in the region since consumption is rarely
collected by the national statistical offices (NSOs) in LAC.
       Due to the time required for household data collection and processing, household surveys
are usually available only with a two or more years lag. This makes it extremely challenging to
provide real-time poverty analysis. Although LAC is the region with most frequent household
surveys, the region is not an exception; the latest data available are from 2014 in most of the
countries in the region. To address this knowledge gap, this paper provides validations of three
alternative methods widely applied to nowcast poverty estimates both at the country as well as at
the regional level and provides up-to-date poverty estimates in the region.
       Despite being outdated, poverty data in LAC are more up-to-date than most of other regions
in the world. In addition, the quality of the data is usually superior in many dimension. For
instance, surveys have in general more coverage ‚Äìi.e., over 90 percent of LAC‚Äôs population is
covered by poverty data since the 1990s -- data are more frequent ‚Äìi.e., about 60 percent of the
countries in LAC have more than three data points (Serajuddin et al. 2015)-, and surveys are
available for many years and usually comparable over time in most of the LAC countries. Having
several years of data offers at least two advantages. First, the years considered (2003-14) coincide
with a period of large poverty drops as well as poverty stagnation, which allows us to validate
methods under different scenarios of poverty changes. Second, having several years allows us to
test the robustness of some methods to the use of different past information. For all these reasons,
this paper focuses in the LAC region to validate existing poverty nowcasting methods.

3.2   Methods used for poverty nowcasting
This section presents the data environment and the three methods used to nowcast poverty
estimates. The analysis is performed in three periods of time: periods ‚Äì2, ‚Äì1, and 0; the first two
periods refer to the past when household surveys and national accounts information are available,
while period 0 refers to the present when only national accounts information is available. Notice
that the sequence in the nomenclature of the periods (i.e., ‚Äì2, ‚Äì1, and 0) does not imply that they
are adjacent or subsequent to each other; rather that the sequence is in a chronological order where
each period could be several years apart from the other. For the sake of simplicity we neglected
population growth in our estimations, as nowcasting generally implies very short periods of time
in which data availability is missing and for which population growth is usually negligible.

3.2.1 The Poverty-growth Elasticity method
The PE method computes the GDP per capita growth elasticity of poverty between ‚Äì2 and ‚Äì1 and
uses that information to nowcast poverty in moment 0. The World Bank currently uses this method
to produce poverty forecasts based on GDP per capita forecasts.4
         Let Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° be the total household per capita income for household i in moment t, Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ Ì†µÌ±° ) is the
corresponding poverty rate in moment t defined as the proportion of the population with household

capita growth rate between Ì†µÌ±° and Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí 1; and Ì†µÌºñ Ì†µÌ±°,Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1 the GDP per capita growth elasticity of poverty
between Ì†µÌ±° and Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí 1. Poverty in moment 0 is defined as:
                                                                             0,‚àí1

                                                                           Ì†µÌ±î     )                    (4)
         However, notice that the value of Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 is unknown, since it depends on the actual value of
poverty in period 0. However, if Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 is assumed to be a unique nonstochastic value over time
for any poverty measure, the elasticity between ‚Äì1 and ‚Äì2 is an approximation for the unknown
elasticity between 0 and ‚Äì1.6 Then, poverty nowcast in moment 0 is obtained as follows:
                                                                        0,‚àí1

                                                                      Ì†µÌ±î     )
                                                                                                       (5)
         where Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ 0 )Ì†µÌ∞∏ refers to nowcasted poverty in period 0 obtained from applying the PE
method.
         The PE method does not use household-level microdata; it only uses aggregated GDP per
capita and poverty indicators -i.e., there is no subscript i in equation (5). The level of accuracy of
the PE method depends on how similar Ì†µÌºñ ‚àí1,‚àí2 and Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 are -i.e., how accurate is the past
information used to estimate the unknown elasticity.

3.2.2 The Neutral Distribution Growth method
The NDG method assumes that all households‚Äô incomes are affected by the same factor‚Äîgenerally
GDP per capita growth‚Äîfrom period ‚Äì1 to period 0. However, given that GDP per capita growth
encompasses more economic elements than household income, its growth rate is usually different
from the household income growth rate. Let Ì†µÌºÉ be the adjustment factor that accounts for the

  Given that we are using a constant, real value for the poverty line, we ignore z in this analysis.

  Section 5 tests the sensitivity of the method to the selection of other periods.
                                                                 9
difference between GDP per capita and per capita household income growth -known as pass-
through. The NDG method produces poverty nowcasts in moment 0 as follows:
                                            0                           0,‚àí1

                                                                                                                        (6)

          where Ì†µÌ±¶

and Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶   ) the corresponding poverty rate. Unlike the PE method, the NDG method uses
household-level microdata to nowcast poverty ‚Äìi.e., subscript i is considered in the equation (6)-
and it does not use information between periods -1 and -2.
          The NDG method assumes that the total household per capita income growth rate is the
same across households7 and that the pass-through Ì†µÌºÉ is known.8 The more similar income growth
across households is and the more knowledge we have about the pass-through, the more accurate
the poverty nowcasting produced under the NDG method is. Nowcasting errors will occur
whenever per capita income growth differs across households and whenever we use a pass-through
value which differs from the actual one.

3.2.3 The Quantile Growth Contribution method
Unlike the NDG, the QGC method does not assume that the household per capita income growth rate
is the same across households. The QGC method captures the heterogeneity among households by
assigning different growth rates along the income distribution. Since we do not have panel data for
most countries, it is not feasible to determine the individual performance of each household
between two periods. Assuming that people with comparable welfare levels in one period will
perform similarly in the following one, the QGC method assigns individual growth rates in a two-
stage process.
          In the first stage of the process we group households into income-sorted quantiles and
calculate the contribution of each quantile to total growth between -2 and -1. Generally, the total
growth of the economy between t-1 and t may be seen as the sum of the growth of all quantiles Ì†µÌ±û ,

    The method assumes that          Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1         =         Ì†µÌ±°‚àí1        = Ì†µÌºÉ ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ü

consider two different approaches. The first approach assumes a democratic scenario in which all

of the total income within its quantile in period -1.

        This paper does not attempt to prove the goodness of fit of any of these methods. Each
method has its own assumptions and properties, which are validated under actual data scrutiny.
Notice that the QGC approach, in particular, is not an improvement of the NDG approach, but the
same methodology under different assumptions. The NDG assumes that all households‚Äîand
therefore quantiles‚Äîgrow at the same pace, whereas QGC assumes that each quantile grows
according to its contribution to total growth in a known-data period.

3.3     Theoretical framework for nowcasting errors
As discussed in section 3.2, all methods need to make some assumptions in order to produce
poverty nowcasts in period 0 ‚Äìi.e., knowledge of the elasticity, the pass-through, and the
contribution of every household to the change in total incomes. Therefore, errors will arise
whenever those assumptions are not met. This section presents the errors that arise from all these
assumptions.

3.3.1     Error under the PE method
The main assumption of the PE method is that the value of the elasticity between 0 and -1 is known.
However, that elasticity is unknown and needs to be estimated in reality. In this paper we use the
value of the elasticity between -1 and -2 as an approximation. Of course an error will occur
whenever this approximation is not accurate. The error can be expressed as:
                                                              0,‚àí1
                    Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ 0 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ 0 )Ì†µÌ∞∏ = Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ ‚àí1 ) ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ü
                                                            Ì†µÌ±î     ‚àó (Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 ‚àí Ì†µÌºñ ‚àí1,‚àí2 )
                                                                                                (12)
         According to equation (12), the size of the error depends on the past information used for
nowcasting -i.e., on how similar Ì†µÌºñ ‚àí1,‚àí2 and Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 are. The error will be zero whenever Ì†µÌºñ ‚àí1,‚àí2 and
Ì†µÌºñ 0,‚àí1 are equal. We will refer to this error as the Informational Error (IE).

3.3.2 Errors under the NDG method
The NDG method makes two assumptions: (i) equal per capita income growth across all

         Following the notation used by Datt and Ravallion (1992), since poverty changes only due
to changes in mean income relative to the poverty line or in the relative income inequality, then
poverty measures in moment t can be characterized by a poverty line z, the Lorenz curve Ì†µÌ∞øÌ†µÌ±° , and
                                                                           ÃÉÌ†µÌ±ñ0 and Ì†µÌ±¶

income growth evenly across all households in period -1. We will refer to this as the Distributional
Error (DE). The more similar is the income growth among all households, the closer to zero DE

the Pass-through Error (PTE). The closer to one is the actual pass-through, the closer to zero the
PE is. Since the NDG method does not use past information, there is no IE. Similarly, there is no
DE and PTE under the PE because the PE does not use household-level micro data.

3.3.3 Errors under the QGC method
There are three characterizations of the QGC. First, unlike the NDG, the method does not assume
that income growth is the same among all households. Second, like the NDG method, the QGC

the errors that arise from re-scaling all individual incomes by the GDP growth instead of actual household income
growth.

assumes that the pass-through Ì†µÌºÉ is known. Finally, like in the PE method‚Äîand unlike the NDG
method‚Äî, the QGC also uses past information (that does not necessarily reflects the present
situation). Therefore, all three errors are present under the QGC method: the IE, PTE, and DE.

4     Data and empirical approach for validating poverty nowcasts

4.1    Per capita household income from harmonized household surveys in LAC
In order to measure country-specific and regional poverty in this paper, we need to increase cross
country comparability of welfare measures and poverty lines. Since the LAC region is the focus
of the paper, we use the $4 per person per day moderate poverty line in 2005 PPP to measure
poverty. In addition, we use the SEDLAC micro data as the primary source of the comparable
welfare aggregate. The SEDLAC project is a harmonized micro database of LAC‚Äôs main
households‚Äô surveys produced by the poverty group at the World Bank in partnership with the
Center for Distributive, Labor, and Social Studies (CEDLAS, for its acronym in Spanish) at the
Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina.12 The main goal of this project is to increase cross-
country comparability of many socioeconomic indicators, including total household per capita
income, from more than 300 household surveys within 18 countries spanning more than 20 years
of surveys.13
        The SEDLAC project has been increasingly used by researchers in the analysis of poverty
and inequality in LAC. However, unlike many other past studies, this paper uses the micro data
instead of country-level indicators produced by SEDLAC. All nowcasting methods are validated
for all countries in LAC for which data are frequently collected during the 2003-14 period.14 Table
1 introduces all surveys (and their coverage) used in this paper.

   See Castaneda et al. (2016), Bourguignon (2015), and Gasparini, Cicowiez, and Escudero (2013) for a more detailed
description of the SEDLAC project.
13
   Since the main goal of the SEDLAC project is to enhance cross-country comparability, poverty measures in this
paper are not comparable to those published by NSOs in the region (Castaneda et al. 2016).

   Guatemala and Nicaragua have fewer than four years of data and therefore they are excluded from the validation
(section 3) and sensitivity (section 4) analysis.
                                                             15
4.2      Empirical approach for testing and improving poverty nowcasting methods in LAC
We select a default value for all parameters used in the estimations. First, we assume a pass-
through Ì†µÌºÉ = 1 for the NDG and QGC methods. Second, all past information is obtained from
                                                                                      ‚àí1,‚àí2
periods -1 and -2 when nowcasting poverty in moment 0 ‚Äìi.e., we compute Ì†µÌºñ ‚àí1,‚àí2 and Sq     in
the PE and QGC methods respectively. Third, we set the number of quantiles q = 20 under the
QGC method.
           In order to assess the validity of the three nowcasting techniques we compare the
nowcasted poverty rates in period 2005-14 with the actual poverty rates in all countries for which
poverty data are available more than three times in the period 2003-14. For instance, let‚Äôs assume
that we are interested in nowcasting poverty in 2005. Poverty nowcasted under the PE method is:
                                                                          2005,2004
                   Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ 2005 )Ì†µÌ∞∏ = Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶ 2004 ) ‚àó (1 + Ì†µÌºñ 2004,2003 ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ü
                                                                        Ì†µÌ±î          )          (19)
Similarly, nowcasted incomes under the NDG method are:
                                      2005                      2005,2004
                                   Ì†µÌ±¶
                                    ÃÉÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±î  = Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2004 ‚àó (1 + Ì†µÌ±ü
                                                              Ì†µÌ±î          )            (20)
Finally, incomes nowcasted under the QGC method are:
                                  2004
                    2005
                               Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±û         2004,2003      2005,2004
                 Ì†µÌ±¶
                 ÃÇÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±î   =      2004   ‚àó (Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±û        ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ü
                                                           Ì†µÌ±î          ‚àó Ì†µÌ±å 2004 + Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±û
                                                                                      2004
                                                                                           )     (21)
                               Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±û
           These results are compared with the actual poverty rate in 2005 in order to assess the
validity of the three methods. The same procedure is then repeated for all years in the 2006-14
period.15 Finally, we change the value of the default parameters ‚Äìpass-through, periods used to
compute past information, and number of quantiles- in order to test the sensitivity of the estimates.

5       Validation of poverty nowcasting methods in LAC

5.1      Country-specific validations
We start by comparing actual poverty estimates with the nowcasted poverty that is obtained from
applying all three methods described in previous sections. Figure 1 presents these comparisons for
all countries in LAC for which data are available between 2003 and 2014 on a regular basis (shown
in detail in appendix table A.1). In general, all methods perform reasonably well and all country-
specific poverty nowcasts are close to the actual poverty rates ‚Äìi.e., all estimates are neighboring
the 45 degree line. The NDG method performs better in most of the cases. We note that the QGC


15
     We compare with an interpolated mid-point value whenever there is no actual poverty rate available.
                                                                    16
and, in particular, the PE tend to be more dispersed around the 45 degree line and they have several
outliers in a number of cases.
        Table 2 and Figure 2 confirm these results. Table 2 shows a set of statistics of the
aggregated errors under the three methods, while Figure 2 presents the histogram of those errors.
Country-specific aggregate errors defined as the difference between poverty nowcasts and actual
poverty rates are quite small in general and the NDG tends to slightly outperform the other two
methods. On average, country-specific poverty nowcasts tend to be three percent higher than the
actual poverty rates under the NDG, while they tend to overstate actual poverty by about 5 percent
under the other two methods. As expected, the correlation between actual and nowcasted poverty
is higher under the NDG (0.98) than the QGC and PE methods (0.85 and 0.73, respectively).
        However, the QGC method outperforms the NDG once the outliers are taken into
consideration. The median of the nowcasting errors ‚Äìa measure more robust to extreme values and
outliers- is about three times higher under the NDG when compared with the other two methods.
Therefore, good use of past information is key to produce nowcasts of good quality ‚Äìi.e., to
minimize the IE- under the PE and QGC methods.16
        Table 2 and Figure 2 also confirm a higher dispersion of poverty nowcasting errors under
the PE and QGC methods; the standard deviation of country level errors is about four times higher
than those of the NDG method. However, even when having large dispersion, errors under the
QGC tend to be more concentrated around zero than the PE. More than 87 percent of the cases
analyzed have nowcasting errors lower than 20 percent in absolute terms under the QGC and the
NDG methods, while less than 79 percent of the cases under the PE method.

5.2    Regional and sub-regional level validations
At the regional and sub-regional levels, the performance of the methods differs from the country
level one. Table 3 shows actual and nowcasted regional and sub-regional poverty estimates under
the three methods for the period 2005-14, while Figure 3 shows the poverty nowcasting errors in
percentages. The three methods perform well in general terms. With the exception of Central



16
  Since errors and outliers cannot be inferred in advance, outliers cannot be removed ex-ante. However, presenting
the median highlights the fact that NDG outperforms QGC in absence of the outliers produced by the latter method.
In addition, the table also shows that Elasticity is outperformed by the other two methods even after considering
outliers. Moreover, Table 2 helps understanding the risks associated with both QGC and PE methods in terms of the
outliers that may result from using past information.
                                                           17
America, correlation between nowcasting and actual poverty estimates are above 70 percent under
the three methods, and over 0.90 for the NDG and the QGC.
        PE tends to be outpaced by the other two methods. Aggregate errors, defined as the
difference between poverty nowcasts and actual poverty rates, are quite small in general. In fact,
the QGC performs slightly better than the NDG method when computing regional poverty
nowcasts. For instance, the LAC average errors are about 1, 3, and 4 percent under the QGC, NDG,
and PE methods, respectively. Once again, the PE and the QGC are relatively more dispersed than
the GND.
        Results under the QGC and NDG methods are encouraging both at the country and the
regional levels. Validations show a good performance of both methods. The next section presents
a series of sensitivity tests to changes in the default underlying parameters.

6     Stress and sensitivity analysis of poverty nowcasting methods in LAC

In this section we test the robustness of the findings to changes in the underlying parameters ‚Äìi.e.,
past information, pass-through, and number of quantiles used when nowcasting regional and
country-level poverty rates. We perform all these test on the 15 countries for which data are
available on a regular basis and for LAC as a whole.

6.1    Sensitivity analysis of the Informational Error
The PE and QGC validation results use information on poverty elasticity and contribution to
growth from periods -2 and -1 when nowcasting poverty in moment 0. However, with few
exceptions, the 15 countries used in the analysis have micro data available on a yearly basis since
2003. This allows us to test whether the time span matters. For instance, we are interested in testing
whether results are improved when using poverty elasticity and quantile contribution to growth
between 2011-13 instead of 2012-13 when nowcasting poverty in 2014. The objective is to study
the sensitivity of the PE to changes in the length of the period used to estimate the poverty elasticity
and the quantile contribution to growth.
        Table 4 shows 2014 poverty nowcasts for a range of periods for QGC and PE and keeping
everything else unchanged. The table shows that the methods perform similarly irrespective of the
length of periods used to estimate elasticity and growth contribution. However, there are a few
exceptions for both QGC and PE, which can lead to outliers like the ones observed in Figure 1.
For instance, QGC nowcasts increase significantly from 7.6 percent to 55 percent in Chile when
                                                      18
using the 2013-11 period instead of the 2013-12 one. Therefore, as mentioned in the previous
section, these exceptions reinforce the idea that past information is key to produce nowcasts of
good quality under the PE and QGC methods.

6.2    Sensitivity analysis of the Pass-through Error
All previous poverty nowcasts under the QGC and NDG were computed using a pass-through Ì†µÌºÉ =
1. However, any value selected would be arbitrary since income growth from surveys tends to
differ from GDP per capita growth. Table 5 analyzes the sensitivity of 2014 nowcasts to the value
of the pass-through. The objective is to study the sensitivity of the PTE to changes in the pass-
through value keeping everything else unchanged. In general, the two methods perform similarly
irrespective of the value of the pass-through selected and results are robust to the underlying
assumption of the value of the pass-through.

6.3    Sensitivity analysis of Distributional Error
Poverty nowcasts in section 4 were done using 20 quantiles under the QGC method. A relevant
question is whether the QGC performs well at nowcasting regional and sub-regional poverty
estimates when changing the number of quantiles. Table 6 shows 2014 poverty nowcasts using a
large set of quantiles from 5 to 100 and keeping everything else unchanged. The objective is to
study the sensitivity of the DE to changes in the number of quantiles. In general, the QGC method
performs similarly irrespective of the number of quantiles selected.

7     Conclusions

LAC has witnessed an impressive poverty reduction since 2003. Unfortunately, given that data are
usually available with more than one year lag in the region, we cannot say much yet about the
poverty impact of the lower economic growth that the region is currently experiencing. There are
several methods to forecast and nowcast poverty estimates, however little is known about their
level of accuracy and performance. To overcome this limitation, we use a comprehensive set of
about 180 harmonized micro household surveys available in 15 LAC countries from 2003 to 2014
to analyze the performance of three different forecasting methods: (i) the Poverty Elasticity (PE),
(ii) the Neutral Distribution Growth (NDG), and (iii) the Quantile Growth Contribution (QGC)
methods.



                                                      19
       Results show that the three methods perform well at nowcasting large poverty reductions
as well as poverty stagnation in the region in the 2005-14 period. After comparing nowcasted with
actual poverty rates, in general we find the NDG and the QGC to be the best performers. However,
the PE and the QGC outperform the NDG once extreme values are taken into consideration,
meaning that good use of past information on poverty elasticities and quantile contributions to
growth is key for producing good quality poverty nowcasts under the PE and QGC methods. The
results are robust to a broad range of stress and sensitivity tests to changes in the underlying
parameters.
       The use of validated methods for poverty nowcasting by researches and international
organizations is scarce, which is surprising in light of the massive acceptance that some of these
techniques have in closely related areas (for instance, for nowcasting GDP estimates). For this
reason, we stayed as close as possible to the standard nowcasting literature, relegating more
sophisticated approaches, such as the use of satellite data to produce real-time poverty information,
for further research. Our validation results provide support to the implementation of these methods
for poverty nowcasting, which is for guiding the regional debate on poverty measurement in LAC.

figure shows poverty nowcasts on the horizontal axis and actual poverty
rates in vertical axis for all countries for which data is available in 2005-
2014. The 45 degree line shows actual poverty. Countries included are:
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Paraguay, El
Salvador, and Uruguay. Guatemala and Nicaragua are excluded due to
data limitations. A simple interpolation was applied when country data
were not available for a given year (see table 1 for a description of the
data gap and comparability across years). PE refers to Poverty-growth
Elasticity method; NDG refers to Neutral Distribution Growth method;
and QGC refers to Quantile Growth Contribution method. The figure
assumes a pass-through Œ∏=1 for the NDG and QGC methods. All past
information is obtained from periods -1 and -2 when nowcasting poverty
in moment 0 under de PE and QGC methods. The number of quantiles
is q=20 under the QGC method.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding of how
        stakeholders in Maldives perceive the Bank Group;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Maldives regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Maldives;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Maldives;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Maldives;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Maldives.

       Use data to help inform Maldives country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
Between April and June 2014, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Maldives were
invited to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country
opinion survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs overseeing
implementation of a project; atoll or island administration office; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 104 stakeholders participated in the survey (35% response rate).
Respondents received and returned questionnaires through courier services. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Maldives; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Maldives; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.


A. General Issues Facing Maldives: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Maldives is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Maldives, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved in Maldives.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Maldives, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Maldives solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity
   building in Maldives, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were
   asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments
   in helping reduce poverty in Maldives, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most
   of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what they would attribute failed or
   slow WBG-assisted reforms in Maldives.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Maldives, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Maldives’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty four development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness in eleven of these areas, such as law and justice, macroeconomic
   management/fiscal sustainability, anti corruption, and health.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to rate
   the effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality. They
   were also asked to indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and
   activities.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Maldives: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Maldives and which services the
   Bank Group should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Maldives, which WBG agencies they work with, whether they think that IFC and
   WB work well together, and their geographic locations.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, consultants/contractors working on WBG projects were combined
        with respondents from PMUs and ministries/ministerial departments, respondents from
        the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
        organizations; respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from
        multilateral agencies. Respondents from private foundations and NGOs were combined
        into “CSO.? Few respondents from the office of minister, atoll or island administration
        office, the media, academia/research institutes/think tanks and other organizations were
        included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the Office of

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Maldives, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the eleven specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Maldives.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at access to financial services;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at macroeconomic management/fiscal sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public expenditure/financial management; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Maldives, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at access to financial services;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at macroeconomic management/fiscal sustainability.

BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITIES: Measuring
national & sub-national economic growth
from outer space in Africa, with an
application to Kenya and Rwanda
By Tom Bundervoet; Laban Maiyo and Apurva Sanghi1

                                                  Abstract

                                              September 2015

We use the night lights (satellite imagery from outer space) approach to estimate subnational
2013 GDP growth and levels for 47 counties in Kenya and 30 districts in Rwanda. Estimating
subnational GDP is consequential for three reasons: First, there is strong policy interest in seeing
how growth can occur in different parts of countries, so that communities can share in national
prosperity and not get left behind. Second, sub-nationals themselves want to understand how
they stack up against their neighbors and competitors, and how much they contribute to national
GDP. Third, such information could help private investors to better assess where to undertake
investments. Using night lights has the advantage of seeing a new (and more accurate) estimation
of informal activity, and being independent of official data. However it may underestimate
economic activity in sectors that are largely unlit (notably agriculture). Indeed, we find that the
association between nightlights and GDP is stronger where unlit agriculture accounts for a
smaller part of overall economic activity.

With these caveats in mind, our analysis yield some interesting results. For Kenya, our results
affirm that Nairobi County is the largest contributor to national GDP. However, at 13%, this
contribution is lower (of 60%) as commonly thought. For Rwanda, the three Districts of Kigali
account for 40% of national GDP, underscoring the lower scale of economic activity in the rest
of the country. To get a composite picture of subnational economic activity -- especially in the
context of rapidly improving official statistics in Kenya and Rwanda -- we note the importance
of estimating subnational GDP using standard approaches (production, expenditure, income).

   1. Introduction
In recent years, the intensity of night lights as measured from space has increasingly been used to
estimate economic activity. The use of night lights as a proxy for economic activity rests on the
assumption that as almost all consumption and investment activities in the evening or night
require lighting, the intensity of night lights (or its growth over time) can be used as a proxy for
the intensity of economic activity (or economic growth). Data on night lights have been used to
estimate, among others, sub-national income per capita (Ebener and others, 2005), the size of the
informal economy in India (Gosh and others, 2010a), the global distribution of economic activity
(Gosh and others, 2010b), the global incidence of poverty (Elvidge and others, 2009), and
economic growth (Henderson, Storeygard and Weil, 2012).

One of the appealing features of night lights data is their availability on every level. Night lights
data are measured on the so-called 30 arc sec level, corresponding to roughly 1 square kilometer
at the equator. This means that night lights data can be used to estimate economic activity at
levels that are not usually captured in national accounts, such as sub-national administrative units
(provinces, districts, counties, cities etc.) or regions not coinciding with national borders (coastal
vs inland regions, connected vs unconnected regions, etc.). For instance, Henderson, Storeygard
and Weil (henceforth HSW) estimate, counter to intuition, that coastal areas in Sub-Saharan
Africa are growing slower than the hinterland.

In this paper, we replicate the analysis by HSW but focus only on countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa and use a slightly longer time-series (1992-2012 instead of 1992-2008). In line with
HSW, we find a strong and robust link between growth in night lights and growth in GDP, with
GDP estimated based on lights closely following GDP as measured from national accounts, for
most countries in most years. We apply the results to estimate sub-national growth in Kenya and
Rwanda, two countries who are increasingly devolving powers to decentralized units. To our
knowledge, this is the first time such an approach has been attempted to estimate GDP growth
and levels for subnational units for Kenya and Rwanda. We emphasize the fact that estimating
subnational economic activity is more than solely an inquisitive exercise. This is because in the
context of decentralized settings, there is a strong policy interest in seeking to see how growth
can occur in different parts of countries, so that communities can share in national prosperity and
do not get left behind. Second, subnational entities may themselves may want to know and
understand how they stack up against their neighbors and competitors, and how much they
contribute to national GDP. Third, such information would help private investors who shop
around for viable investment destinations, to assess more accurately where to undertake
investments. Incidentally, countries which have decentralized may consider including
subnational GDP as one possible criteria that could determine how funds transferred from the
national government are shared among subnational governments. If and when that were to
happen, then subnational entities stand to gain or lose depending on their contribution to national
GDP. This can have ramifications -- for example, one oft-cited “fact? in the case of Kenya is that
Nairobi contributes over 60% of Kenya’s GDP (Kenya Urban Areas Brief 2013). However, our
indicative results show that Nairobi’s contribution to national 2013 GDP, though still the highest,
stood at 13%. It bears emphasizing that our results come with caveats, in particular,
underestimating agriculture’s contribution to county level GDP, as detailed in the paper.



                                                                                                    4
In addition to affecting how including county-level GDP in the revenue sharing formula, in the
case of Kenya, can considerably affect resource allocation among individual counties, estimating
subnational economic activity also has other uses. For one, counties themselves may want to
know and understand what drives growth within their borders, and how they stack up against
others. And another important reason is that, with a better understanding of county-level growth
dynamics, such information would help private investors assess more accurately where to
undertake private investments.

This paper proceeds as follows: The next section summarizes the data and sketches the
relationship between nightlights and GDP using observations from the sample. Section 3
specifies the empirical model and presents the main results. Section 4 applies the model
estimates to subnational GDP growth in Kenya and Rwanda, while section 5 focuses on
subnational GDP-levels. The final section concludes.


   2. The Link between Night Lights and GDP
   2.1     Data
Data on night lights are provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
Operational Linescan System (OLS). The DMSP satellites circle the earth 14 times a day and
record the intensity of Earth-based lights. The data picked up by the satellites have been digitized
since 1992. We used stable light imagery of SSA derived from scores of orbits of the DMSP
OLS in from 1992-2013 since this product inter-calibrated where fires and other ephemeral lights
have been removed, although there are noteworthy blunders associated with over-glow effects
where lighting spreads to neighboring pixels (and hence economic activity is wrongfully
attributed to certain places). The stable lights imagery has annual quantized pixels with values
(Digital Numbers) with integers ranging from 0 to 63. This product is optimal especially for SSA
where ephemeral lighting is minimal during the night where gas flares are a rare phenomenon.
Gas flares are combustion devices used mainly in oil wells and big offshore platforms to burn
flammable gas (mostly methane) released during the operations of oil extraction.

There are other satellite sensors of the same resolution and scale but not appropriate for
economic activity studies. Landsat for instance depicts settlement expansion but not available for
frequent temporal coverage.
Data on GDP and other indicators used in the analysis (surface of country territory, electricity
consumption, etc.) are provided by the World Development Indicators (2014). Following HSW,
we use constant GDP in local currency units.

Night lights data are available for all 47 Sub-Saharan African countries between 1992 and 2012,
resulting in 987 country-year observations. South Sudan is not included since it only became an
independent country in 2011. GDP data are not available for Somalia, resulting in a final sample
of 966 country-year observations.




                                                                                                   5
       2.2            Night lights and GDP
HSW provide illustrative examples of the link between night lights and economic or political
events by focusing on the Asian financial crisis and changes in night lights in Indonesia, the
difference between the two Koreas, and the Rwandan genocide. Our sample includes many more
salient examples. The intensity of night lights closely tracks Zimbabwe’s economic decline
between 2000 and 2008, when real GDP contracted by almost 50 percent (Figure 1). When GDP
growth finally turned positive again after 2008, the intensity of night lights also reversed its
declining trend. On the other extreme, Equatorial Guinea’s phenomenal growth following the
discovery of vast amounts of oil (per capita GDP increased 27-fold between 1992 and 2012) is
reflected in the strong growth in night lights over the same period (Figure 2)2.

One can argue that the close relationship between GDP and night lights illustrated in Figures 1
and 2 is due to the sheer magnitude of the events. After all, we would expect the intensity of
lighting to respond to a halving of the economy (Zimbabwe) or a 27-fold increase of it
(Equatorial Guinea). Night lights however also seem to respond to events that impact economic
activity to a far lesser extent. To illustrate, take the Eritrean-Ethiopian border conflict of 1998-
2000. While for a country the size of Ethiopia the localized border conflict did not have a
discernible impact on the economy, GDP in Eritrea, a small country with less than four million
inhabitants at the time, contracted by six percent during the conflict. The intensity of night lights
reacted to the temporary contraction in GDP between 1998 and 2000, and picked up again after
2000 with renewed economic growth (Figure 3).

Overall, the average annual growth in GDP for the 46 countries in our sample amounted to 4.4
percent, a little lower than the annual growth in lights (4.8 percent). The three countries that
recorded the slowest GDP growth between 1992 and 2012 (Zimbabwe, Burundi, and DRC) are
also among the countries with the slowest growth in night lights (Table 1). The countries with
the fastest-growing economies (Cape Verde, Liberia, and Equatorial Guinea) also experienced
fast growth in night lights as measured from space. Overall, there is a strong positive relationship
between changes in lights and changes in GDP in the sample of Sub-Saharan African countries
(Figure 4)3.

   3. Methods and Results
   3.1      Statistical specifications

We use the same specifications as HSW to estimate GDP based on night lights, focusing on
growth formulations. The first specification is a fixed effects specification using the full sample
and can be written as:

                           (              )                              (1)

With               being the natural log of GDP of country i in year t (in constant local currency
units), (           ) the natural log of lights per km² in country i in year t, the country fixed-
effects, and       the year fixed-effects. The year fixed-effects control for differences in light
sensitivity across the different satellites and also for changes in economic conditions and lighting
                                                                                                  9
technology. Lights per km² is calculated as the sum of lights in a country in a given year divided
by the country’s total surface. Identification in specification (1) comes from within-country
variation in lights and GDP over time, relating growth in lights within countries to growth in
GDP.

The second specification adds a country-specific time trend to specification (1) to examine the
extent to which fluctuations around a country’s growth path can be explained by lights. This
specification focuses on annual fluctuations in GDP and can be written as:

                              (             )                                              (2)

Where             is the country-specific time-trend (the interaction between the country and year
fixed effects. The third specification, still following HSW, estimates (1) in differenced form to
focus on long-term growth between 1992 and 2012 and can be written as:

                                     (                        )                            (3)

Where                        is GDP growth in country i between 1992 and 2012 and
  (                  ) growth in night lights in country i between 1992 and 2012. The (time-
invariant) country fixed effects are swept out by the differenced form. We also estimate
specification (3) for the shorter 2000-2012 period.


    3.2       Results
Table 2 shows the results for a balanced panel of 46 countries over 21 years. Column (1)
estimates specification (1) with country and year fixed effects. We find a of 0.57, meaning that
a 1 percent increase in night lights is associated with a 0.57 percent increase in GDP, controlling
for the country and the year. The coefficient is highly statistically significant and twice as large
as the coefficient estimated in HSW (0.28 in a larger sample covering 188 countries and 17
years). The within-country R squared amounts to about 0.8.

In Column (2) we test whether there is a quadratic relation between lights and GDP. In contrast
to HSW, we find a modest and weakly significant quadratic relation in our sample, with the
association between lights and GDP being weakly concave. This quadratic specification is
however not robust to different sample definitions and is in large part driven by Equatorial
Guinea. Between 2006 and 2012, lights in Equatorial Guinea grew significantly faster than GDP
(see Figure 2), introducing a mild quadratic relation in the overall sample. The quadratic relation
disappears when Equatorial Guinea is dropped from the sample (21 observations dropped from
the total of 966). Given that the quadratic specification is not robust, we proceed with the linear
specification in further analysis.

In Colum (3) we replace lights observed from space by data on electrical power consumption (in
kilowatt hours, obtained from the World development indicators). As data on electricity
consumption is only available for 22 countries in SSA, the number of observations drops from
966 to 425 (not all 22 countries have data for all 21 years). We find a strong and statistically
significant association between electricity consumption and GDP in the reduced sample
(elasticity of 0.37). The coefficient is however considerably smaller than the one estimated
between nigh lights and GDP (0.58). This may potentially be explained by the relative high use
of generators in SSA, where power outages on the main grid are frequent. WDI data on
electricity consumption only encompasses output from power plants and hence may
underestimate the intensity and volume of night lights in countries with a strong reliance on
private generators. Indeed, if we estimate a panel regression of log lights on the log of electricity
consumption (with year fixed effects), we find that the within-country variation in electricity
consumption explains “only? 64 percent of the variation of night lights as observed from space,
hinting at the existence of other sources of lighting as well.

In the fourth column of Table 2 we include both electricity consumption and lighting as observed
from space (for the 22 countries with data on electricity consumption). Similar to HSW, we find
that both remain statistically significant, indicating that they may not capture the exact same
underlying economic activity. The goodness of fit somewhat increases when including both
electricity consumption and lights (within R-squared of 0.83 compared to 0.80 with lights alone
– column (1)). The elasticity between lights and GDP (0.36) remains higher than the one
between electricity consumption and GDP (0.23).

Table 3 explores the relation between night lights and two other types of GDP growth: Annual
fluctuations about a country’s growth path (specification (2)) and long-term growth between
1992 and 2012 and 2000 and 2012 (specification (3)). Column (1) in Table 3 adds a country-
specific time-trend so that lights now only explain fluctuations of GDP about a country’s longer-
term growth path. The size of the coefficients falls to 0.11 (from 0.57), but is still highly
statistically significant, indicating that short-term fluctuations in GDP are picked up to some
extent by changes in lights. The second column of Table 3 examines the within-country
association between growth in GDP and growth in night lights between 1992 and 2012. In line
with HSW, we find a strong and statistically significant association between long-term GDP
growth and long-term lights growth. The long difference estimate of amounts to 0.55, similar
to the fixed effect value of 0.57. The R-squared remains high at 0.76, indicating that 76 percent

                                                                                                  11
of the within-country variation in GDP between 1992 and 2012 can be explained by the variation
in night lights.

Finally, the last column in Table 3 estimates growth in GDP between 2000 and 2012 based on
growth in night lights over the same period. While the association remains strong and
statistically significant, the coefficient (0.36) is considerably lower than the one for the full
period (0.55), suggesting that the association between night lights and GDP has become weaker
over the past decade.

To summarize, we are able to replicate all HSW findings using a sample of 46 Sub-Saharan
African countries and a 21-year time period (1992-2012). Compared to HSW, we find a stronger
elasticity between night lights and GDP, which may perhaps be explained by the low level of
development in SSA relative to the rest of the world. In rich and highly lit places of the world, an
increase in GDP may not produce much more lighting. In poor and largely unlit places however,
an increase in economic activity could have a larger impact on lighting4. In the preferred
specification (specification (1)), a one percent increase in night lights is associated with a 0.57
percent increase in GDP, an effect strongly statistically significant.

How does the estimation method perform out of sample? Based on the growth of night lights in
the whole of SSA, specification (3) (the long differenced form) estimates that real GDP in SSA
increased by 3.2 percent per year between 1992 and 2012 and by 4 percent per year between
2000 and 2012. This substantially underestimates the national accounts based growth rates of 4.1
percent and 5 percent, respectively. The importance of agriculture in SSA could potentially be
the reason for the underestimation. A substantial part of Africa’s population is engaged in small-
scale subsistence agriculture. Since this activity is largely unlit, one can argue that night lights
only pick up economic activity in the secondary and tertiary sectors. The next section will
elaborate on this.

    HSW also find suggestive evidence of a lower elasticity between lights and GDP in high-income countries.


                                                                                                               12
What about the economy of Somalia? National accounts data for Somalia have been non-existing
since 1991, when the country sunk into chaos following the toppling of the Badre regime.
Somalia, still according to the long differenced form, grew by 4.8 per year between 1992 and
2012, with this however largely driven by a rebound effect following the heavy fighting of 1990-
92 (night lights increased more than six-fold between 1992 and 1993). Focusing on a more recent
period, growth in Somalia is estimated (based on night lights) at 4 percent per annum between
2000 and 2012.


    3.3        The role of agriculture
In many countries in SSA, a large part of the population is engaged in small-scale subsistence
agriculture. Since this activity is largely unlit, it will not show up in night lights. This means that
estimating GDP levels in SSA based on night lights would likely result in an underestimation of
“true? GDP. In Liberia for instance, agriculture accounted on average for 67 percent of GDP
over the 1992-2012 period. Estimating Liberia’s GDP based on night lights would fail to capture
two thirds of Liberia’s economic activity. If growth in agriculture accounts for a sizable part of
aggregate GDP growth, growth in night lights would also tend to underestimate GDP growth. In
Rwanda for instance, agriculture accounts for about 25 percent of total GDP growth. Estimating
growth based on nightlights would hence underestimate true growth.

To what extent does the importance of agriculture underestimate GDP growth? Linking the
residuals of specification (1) to the share of agriculture in GDP, we find a positive but weak
correlation. Countries where GDP growth is underestimated by nightlights have on average a
higher share of agriculture in GDP (29.7 percent) than countries where GDP is overestimated
(26.1 percent), though the difference is relatively small. In Table 4, we divide our sample into
two based on whether the country has an above or below-average share of agriculture in GDP
(average for the countries in the sample).

As expected, we find that the association between nightlights and GDP is stronger in countries
where unlit agriculture accounts for a smaller part of overall economic activity (column (2) in
table 4). In these countries, manufacturing and services account for the bulk of GDP, and growth
in these sectors is more likely to turn up in lights. The association between nightlights and GDP
remains however strongly significant for the agrarian countries as well.

The preceding discussion suggests that estimates of GDP growth based on nightlights could, at
least for countries in SSA, be improved by controlling for the importance of agriculture in the
economy. However, specifying a control variable for which national accounts or survey data is
needed (such as the share of agriculture in GDP or the share of the population engaged in
agriculture) would run counter to the purpose of this study, which is to see whether proxies such
as nightlights can be used to estimate growth in areas (sub-national or supra-national) for which
there are no national accounts or survey data. One option is to use rainfall or vegetation data,
which share many of the desirable features of nightlights data, to proxy the performance of the
agricultural sector. This is something to explore in future work.


   4. Application to Kenya and Rwanda: GDP Growth
In this section we use the results from the long-differenced specification to estimate sub-national
GDP growth in Kenya and Rwanda based on the evolution of night lights.


   4.1     Kenya
Kenya’s 47 county governments came into existence at the March 2013 election. Transfer of
staff and functions from around 280 de-concentrated district administrations and 175 local
authorities was largely completed by January 2014 when counties took over management of
payroll for all their staff. Funding for devolved functions is provided for through an
unconditional equitable share, allocated among counties on the basis of a formula proposed by
the Commission on Revenue Allocation and approved by the National Assembly in November
2012. The formula is due for revision after three years, and thereafter every five years. The
formula incorporates four proxy measures of expenditure needs: population, equal shares
(reflecting diseconomies of scale in smaller counties), poverty and land area. At present, the
formula ignores the very different fiscal capacity between counties, particularly those in rural
and urban areas. An important question for the future is whether to also include a measure of
revenue-raising capacity, so as to achieve more effective equalization. To generate the right
incentives for maximum fiscal effort by the county governments, such a component in the
formula should be based on an objective measure of each county's potential to raise revenue, not
how much is actually raised. In the absence of detailed information on the size of the tax base in
each county, one approach might be to use county GDP as a proxy measure.

Focusing first on Kenya as a whole, how do night lights perform in predicting aggregate GDP
growth? The short answer is: not too bad. For Kenya, GDP as predicted by night lights closely
tracks GDP as measured by national accounts, in particular since the start of the 2000s (Figure
5). Based on the growth of night lights and using the long differenced specification (last column

                                                                                                14
of Table 3), we estimate an annual GDP growth of 4.0 percent between 2000 and 2012, slightly
lower than the actual national-accounts based growth rate of 4.2 percent.

Estimating county-level GDP growth based on growth in county night lights since 2000, we find
that the lakeside county of Siaya has grown fastest (estimated GDP growth of 10 percent per
annum between 2000 and 2011), followed by Elgeyo Marakwet (8.8 percent per annum) and
Tharaka Nithi (8.6 percent – see Figure 6). While these counties are still poor compared to the
national average, the intensity of their night lights as picked up from space grew strongly since
the turn of the century: The sum of lights seven-folded in Siaya and almost five-folded in
Tharaka Nithi and Elgeyo Marakwet. At the other end, Bomet grew slowest of all counties (1.2
percent per annum), followed by Kericho (2.4 percent) and Marsabit (2.9 percent). Nairobi
county grew at an estimated 4.1 percent and Mombasa at 3.8 percent. Based on night lights,
Nakuru and Kisumu grew at 5.1 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively5.

   4.2      Rwanda
For Rwanda, nightlights-based GDP also tracks measured GDP, though the level of
correspondence is lower than for Kenya (Figure 7). Night lights tend to substantially
overestimate GDP up until the early 2000s, driven in particular by the rapid recovery of lights
(compared to GDP) in the wake of the genocide. Growth in lights stagnated between 2000 and
2005, leading to an underestimation of GDP growth during this period. Based on night lights, we
estimate an annual growth rate of 5.4 percent between 2000 and 2012, substantially lower than
the national accounts-based true growth rate of 8 percent. This difference may potentially be
explained by the relatively large importance of agriculture for the Rwandan economy: Between
2000 and 2012 agriculture accounted for about 2 percentage points of aggregate growth on a
yearly basis. As agriculture is largely unlit, the part of growth accounted for by agriculture would
not be picked up by nightlights.

Since 2006, Rwanda is divided into 30 Districts, which are the main service-delivery units. All
household surveys are representative at the District level, but there is no information on district-
level economic growth. Estimating district-level growth based on nightlights is however
complicated by the low intensity of lights: Four districts did not emit any observable lights at all
during 2000-2011, and ten districts only have nonzero observations towards the end of the 2000-
2011 period. As a result, we can only estimate nighlights-based GDP growth for 16 districts.

Figure 8 shows estimated average GDP growth for the 16 districts with sufficient lighting.
According to the estimates, Kamonyi, Nyanza, and Musanze Districts grew fastest between 2000
and 2012, with annual growth rates of 9.9 percent, 8.3 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively.
Rubavu, Karongi, Gicumbi, Nyamagabe, and Rwamagana also grew at more than 5 percent per
year. Within Kigali city, Gasabo district grew at 4.8 percent per year, Kicukiro at 3.8 percent,
and Nyarugenge at 3.3 percent. The two slowest growing districts (among those with data) were
Huye (3.1 percent) and Nyarugenge (3.3 percent).

       5. Application to Kenya and Rwanda: GDP Levels
In this section we estimate sub-national GDP levels for 2013 based on the spatial distribution of
night lights and the rural population. Following Ghosh and others (2010), we assume that the
within-country distribution of nightlights (across the subnational units) only proxies the within-
country distribution of secondary- and tertiary sector economic activity (given that agriculture is
largely subsistence and unlit). As such, the spatial distribution of nightlights within a country is
used only to distribute the part of estimated GDP resulting from industrial and service activities.
The part of estimated GDP accounted for by agriculture is distributed across the subnational
units in proportion to their share of rural population6.

Our methodology consists of three steps. In the first step, we estimate national GDP based on
specification (1). The estimated GDP is divided into two parts based on the share of agriculture
in the economy (based on actual national accounts data): Agricultural GDP and industrial and
services GDP. In the second step, we distribute industrial and services GDP among the
subnational units in proportion to their share of national nightlights. In the third step, we
distribute agricultural GDP among the subnational units in proportion to their share of the rural
population (we assume that urban populations do not produce agricultural output). Finally, we
sum estimated industrial and services GDP and estimated agricultural GDP to arrive at an
estimate of subnational-level GDP.

6
 This is in contrast to Ghosh and others (2010) who use the Landscan data to distribute agricultural GDP among
sub-units.


                                                                                                                 18
   5.1     Kenya
Table 5 and Figure 10 show the county-level GDP estimates for Kenya. Based on specification
(1), we estimate total 2013 GDP for Kenya at $26.8 billion (2005 USD), close to its actual level
of $26.9 billion (WDI, 2014). On county-level, we find that Nairobi had the highest overall GDP
in 2013 ($3.4 billion), followed by Kiambu ($3.0 billion), Nakuru ($2.3 billion), Nyeri ($1
billion), and Kilifi ($1 billion). Counties with the lowest GDP are the sparsely populated counties
of Isiolo ($56 million), Lamu ($58 million), Samburu ($67 million), Elgeyo Marakwet ($108
million), and Tharaka Nithi ($109 million). Nairobi has the highest contribution to national GDP
(13 percent), followed by Kiambu (11 percent), Nakuru (9 percent) and Nyeri (4 percent – see
Figure 9).

When we control for population by looking at GDP per capita, there are substantial changes
(Figure 11). Kiambu is the best-off county, with a per capita GDP of $1,785 (2005 USD),
followed by Nyeri ($1,503), Kajiado (1,466), Nakuru ($1,413), and Kwale ($1,406). Due to its
large population, Nairobi does not make it to the top five with an estimated per capita GDP of
$1,081 (ranked 8th among the 47 counties, one spot in front of Mombasa). Note that Nairobi and
Mombasa have zero agricultural GDP because the 2009 census classified these counties as 100
percent urban. This may underestimate their GDP if agricultural activity does take place in these
counties.

At the other end, Mandera has the lowest GDP per capita ($267), followed by Bomet ($282),
Elgeyo Marakwet ($293), Samburu ($298), and West Pokot ($307). Turkana, Busia and Wajir
also have low per capita GDP levels. Lamu, while having one of the lowest GDP levels of all
counties, ranks higher on GDP per capita (15th spot) thanks to its small population.

   5.2      Rwanda
Table 6 and Figure 12 show the District-level GDP estimates for Rwanda. Based on specification
(1), we estimate total 2013 GDP for Rwanda at $4.58 billion (2005 USD), only slightly higher
than the national-accounts estimate of $4.57 billion (WDI, 2014). On the District-level, we find
that Gasabo District had the highest GDP in 2013 ($925 million), followed by the two other
districts of Kigali (Kicukiro at $538 million and Nyarugenge at $371 million). Districts in the
secondary urban centers come next: Rubabu ($219 million), Rusizi ($186 million), Huye ($166

                                                                                             23
million), and Musanze ($143 million). Districts with the lowest estimated GDP are the largely
unlit Districts of Nyabihu, Nyaruguru, Burera and Kirehe. Overall, the three Districts in Kigali
city account for 40 percent of total GDP, despite only accounting for about 10 percent of the
population. Adding Rubavu and Rusizi, five Districts (out of 30) account for half of overall GDP
(Figure 9).

When we control for population by looking at GDP per capita, there are only few changes
(Figure 8). The Districts in Kigali city remain the wealthiest (in the same order), while Rubavu
remains the wealthiest district outside Kigali. Huye comes fifth ($507 per capita), followed by
Rusizi ($463) and Rwamagana (408).

As evident from the title of this paper, we also tried to estimate poverty levels and changes based
on nightlights data. The estimated associations were however not robust, and more time and
effort would need to be invested in examining this relationship in a more detailed fashion. This
will be pursued in further work.


    6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have adapted the methodology of Henderson, Storeygard and Weill (2012) to
examine the association between night lights and GDP for a sample of 46 countries in Sub
Saharan Africa. Overall, we find a fairly strong correlation between the intensity of night lights
as measured by satellites and country-level GDP, with even small and temporary economic
downturns being reflected in the intensity of lighting. As expected, we find that the association
between lights and economic activity is stronger in countries where agriculture is a smaller part
of GDP (where more economic activity is lit). We apply the regression results to estimate
subnational GDP levels and growth in Kenya and Rwanda. To our knowledge, this is the first

                                                                                                     25
time such an exercise to estimate county-level GDP levels and growth for Kenya and Rwanda
has been attempted.

Our first-approximation results yield some interesting findings. In the case of Kenya, our results
affirm that Nairobi county contributes the maximum to national GDP. However, at only 13%,
this contribution is significantly lower (of 60%) as commonly thought. Controlling for
population, Kiambu is the best-off county, with a per capita GDP of $1,785 (2005 USD),
followed by Nyeri ($1,503), Kajiado (1,466), Nakuru ($1,413), and Kwale ($1,406). Due to its
large population, Nairobi does not make it to the top five with an estimated per capita GDP of
$1,081 (ranked 8th among the 47 counties, one spot in front of Mombasa). In the case of Rwanda,
the three districts of Kigali account for 40 percent of overall GDP, and, adding the secondary
cities of Rubavu and Rusizi, only five districts account for half of national GDP.

While the results from the analysis in this paper show promise, there is ample room to improve
on the methodology. Several issues in particular stand out: first, the accuracy of the sub-national
estimates is likely to be affected by over-glow, meaning that lights (and economic activity) could
be attributed to the wrong sub-national unit. This is particularly a worry in heavily lit areas in
urban agglomerations. Second, given the importance of agriculture in the economy of many
countries in our sample, the estimates could be improved by including proxies for agricultural
performance, such as rainfall or vegetation cover. Also, subnational variation in rainfall or
vegetation cover could be used to allocate agricultural GDP across subnational units, rather than
the units’ share of total rural population. Future work will address this (for an application, see
Rogers, Emwanu and Robinson, 2006). To get a more composite picture of subnational
economic activity, it is also important to estimate subnational GDP through the standard
approaches (production, expenditure, income) that have their strengths and limitations. This is
however outside the scope of this paper that we propose for future investigation.

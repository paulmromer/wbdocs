UNESCO together with UNICEF, the World
Bank, UNFPA, UNDP, UN Women and UNHCR
organized the World Education Forum 2015 in
Incheon, Republic of Korea, from 19 – 22 May
2015, hosted by the Republic of Korea. Over
1,600 participants from 160 countries, including
over 120 Ministers, heads and members of
delegations, heads of agencies and officials
of multilateral and bilateral organizations, and
representatives of civil society, the teaching
profession, youth and the private sector, adopted
the Incheon Declaration for Education 2030, which
sets out a new vision for education for the next
fifteen years.
Incheon Declaration
Education 2030:
Towards inclusive and equitable quality
education and lifelong learning for all




Preamble
1.	 We, Ministers, heads and members of delegations, heads of agencies and
    officials of multilateral and bilateral organizations, and representatives of civil
    society, the teaching profession, youth and the private sector, have gathered
    in May 2015 at the invitation of the Director-General of UNESCO in Incheon,
    Republic of Korea, for the World Education Forum 2015 (WEF 2015). We
    thank the Government and the people of the Republic of Korea for having hosted
    this important event as well as UNICEF, the World Bank, UNFPA, UNDP, UN
    Women and UNHCR, as the co-convenors of this meeting, for their contributions.
    We express our sincere appreciation to UNESCO for having initiated and led
    the convening of this milestone event for Education 2030.

2.	 On this historic occasion, we reaffirm the vision of the worldwide movement for
    Education for All initiated in Jomtien in 1990 and reiterated in Dakar in 2000
    — the most important commitment to education in recent decades and which
    has helped drive significant progress in education. We also reaffirm the vision
    and political will reflected in numerous international and regional human rights
    treaties that stipulate the right to education and its interrelation with other human
    rights. We acknowledge the efforts made; however, we recognize with great
    concern that we are far from having reached education for all.




                                                           Education 2030: Towards inclusive and
                                                                                                        5
                                            equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all
     3.	 We recall the Muscat Agreement developed through broad consultations and
         adopted at the Global Education for All (EFA) Meeting 2014, and which
         successfully informed the proposed education targets of the Open Working
         Group on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We further recall the
         outcomes of the regional ministerial conferences on education post-2015 and
         take note of the findings of the 2015 EFA Global Monitoring Report and the
         Regional EFA Synthesis Reports. We recognize the important contribution of the
         Global Education First Initiative as well as the role of governments and regional,
         intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in galvanizing political
         commitment for education.

     4.	 Having taken stock of progress made towards the EFA goals since 2000 and the
         education-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as the lessons
         learned, and having examined the remaining challenges and deliberated on the
         proposed 2030 education agenda and the Framework for Action as well as on
         future priorities and strategies for its achievement, we adopt this Declaration.




     Towards 2030:
     a new vision for education
     5.	 Our vision is to transform lives through education, recognizing the important
         role of education as a main driver of development and in achieving the other
         proposed SDGs. We commit with a sense of urgency to a single, renewed
         education agenda that is holistic, ambitious and aspirational, leaving no one
          behind. This new vision is fully captured by the proposed SDG 4 “Ensure inclusive
          and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for
          all” and its corresponding targets. It is transformative and universal, attends to the
          ‘unfinished business’ of the EFA agenda and the education-related MDGs, and
          addresses global and national education challenges. It is inspired by a humanistic
          vision of education and development based on human rights and dignity; social
          justice; inclusion; protection; cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity; and shared
          responsibility and accountability. We reaffirm that education is a public good,
          a fundamental human right and a basis for guaranteeing the realization of




6   Incheon Declaration
    other rights. It is essential for peace, tolerance, human fulfilment and sustainable
    development. We recognize education as key to achieving full employment and
    poverty eradication. We will focus our efforts on access, equity and inclusion,
    quality and learning outcomes, within a lifelong learning approach.

6.	 Motivated by our significant achievements in expanding access to education
    over the last 15 years, we will ensure the provision of 12 years of free, publicly
    funded, equitable quality primary and secondary education, of which at least
    nine years are compulsory, leading to relevant learning outcomes. We also
    encourage the provision of at least one year of free and compulsory quality pre-
    primary education and that all children have access to quality early childhood
    development, care and education. We also commit to providing meaningful
    education and training opportunities for the large population of out-of-school
    children and adolescents, who require immediate, targeted and sustained action
    ensuring that all children are in school and are learning.

7.	 Inclusion and equity in and through education is the cornerstone of a
    transformative education agenda, and we therefore commit to addressing all
    forms of exclusion and marginalization, disparities and inequalities in access,
    participation and learning outcomes. No education target should be considered
    met unless met by all. We therefore commit to making the necessary changes
    in education policies and focusing our efforts on the most disadvantaged,
    especially those with disabilities, to ensure that no one is left behind.

8.	 We recognize the importance of gender equality in achieving the right to
    education for all. We are therefore committed to supporting gender-sensitive
    policies, planning and learning environments; mainstreaming gender issues in
    teacher training and curricula; and eliminating gender-based discrimination and
    violence in schools.

9.	 We commit to quality education and to improving learning outcomes, which
    requires strengthening inputs, processes and evaluation of outcomes and
    mechanisms to measure progress. We will ensure that teachers and educators
    are empowered, adequately recruited, well-trained, professionally qualified,
    motivated and supported within well-resourced, efficient and effectively
    governed systems. Quality education fosters creativity and knowledge, and
    ensures the acquisition of the foundational skills of literacy and numeracy as well

                                                                                                       7
                                           equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all
          as analytical, problem-solving and other high-level cognitive, interpersonal and
          social skills. It also develops the skills, values and attitudes that enable citizens to
          lead healthy and fulfilled lives, make informed decisions, and respond to local
          and global challenges through education for sustainable development (ESD)
          and global citizenship education (GCED). In this regard, we strongly support
          the implementation of the Global Action Programme on ESD launched at the
          UNESCO World Conference on ESD in Aichi-Nagoya in 2014. We also stress
          the importance of human rights education and training in order to achieve the
          post-2015 sustainable development agenda.

     10.	 We commit to promoting quality lifelong learning opportunities for all, in all
          settings and at all levels of education. This includes equitable and increased
          access to quality technical and vocational education and training and higher
          education and research, with due attention to quality assurance. In addition, the
          provision of flexible learning pathways, as well as the recognition, validation
          and accreditation of the knowledge, skills and competencies acquired through
          non-formal and informal education, is important. We further commit to ensuring
          that all youth and adults, especially girls and women, achieve relevant and
          recognized functional literacy and numeracy proficiency levels and acquire life
          skills, and that they are provided with adult learning, education and training
          opportunities. We are also committed to strengthening science, technology and
          innovation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) must be harnessed
          to strengthen education systems, knowledge dissemination, information access,
          quality and effective learning, and more effective service provision.

     11.	 Furthermore, we note with serious concern that, today, a large proportion of
          the world’s out-of-school population lives in conflict-affected areas, and that
          crises, violence and attacks on education institutions, natural disasters and
          pandemics continue to disrupt education and development globally. We commit
          to developing more inclusive, responsive and resilient education systems to meet
          the needs of children, youth and adults in these contexts, including internally
          displaced persons and refugees. We highlight the need for education to be
          delivered in safe, supportive and secure learning environments free from
          violence. We recommend a sufficient crisis response, from emergency response
          through to recovery and rebuilding; better coordinated national, regional and
          global responses; and capacity development for comprehensive risk reduction
          and mitigation to ensure that education is maintained during situations of conflict,
          emergency, post-conflict and early recovery.




8   Incheon Declaration
Implementing our common agenda
12.	 We reaffirm that the fundamental responsibility for successfully implementing this
     agenda lies with governments. We are determined to establish legal and policy
     frameworks that promote accountability and transparency as well as participatory
     governance and coordinated partnerships at all levels and across sectors, and to
     uphold the right to participation of all stakeholders.

13.	 We call for strong global and regional collaboration, cooperation, coordination
     and monitoring of the implementation of the education agenda based on data
     collection, analysis and reporting at the country level, within the framework of
     regional entities, mechanisms and strategies.

14.	 We recognize that the success of the 2030 education agenda requires sound
     policies and planning as well as efficient implementation arrangements. It is
     also clear that the aspirations encompassed in the proposed SDG 4 cannot be
     realized without a significant and well-targeted increase in financing, particularly
     in those countries furthest from achieving quality education for all at all levels.
     We therefore are determined to increase public spending on education in
     accordance with country context, and urge adherence to the international and
     regional benchmarks of allocating efficiently at least 4 - 6% of Gross Domestic
     Product and/or at least 15 - 20% of total public expenditure to education.

15.	 Noting the importance of development cooperation in complementing investments
     by governments, we call upon developed countries, traditional and emerging
     donors, middle income countries and international financing mechanisms to
     increase funding to education and to support the implementation of the agenda
     according to countries’ needs and priorities. We recognize that the fulfilment
     of all commitments related to official development assistance (ODA) is crucial,
     including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of
     0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for ODA to developing countries.
     In accordance with their commitments, we urge those developed countries that
     have not yet done so to make additional concrete efforts towards the target
     of 0.7 per cent of GNP for ODA to developing countries. We also commit to
     increase our support to the least developed countries. We further recognize the
     importance of unlocking all potential resources to support the right to education.
     We recommend improving aid effectiveness through better coordination and

                                                                                                        9

           harmonization, and prioritizing financing and aid to neglected sub-sectors and
           low income countries. We also recommend significantly increasing support
           for education in humanitarian and protracted crises. We welcome the Oslo
           Summit on Education for Development (July 2015) and call on the Financing for
           Development Conference in Addis Ababa to support the proposed SDG 4.

      16.	 We call on the WEF 2015 co-convenors, and in particular UNESCO, as
           well as on all partners, to individually and collectively support countries in
           implementing the 2030 education agenda, by providing technical advice,
           national capacity development and financial support based on their respective
           mandates and comparative advantages, and building on complementarity.
           To this end, we entrust UNESCO, in consultation with Member States, the WEF
           2015 co-convenors and other partners, to develop an appropriate global
           coordination mechanism. Recognizing the Global Partnership for Education as a
           multi-stakeholder financing platform for education to support the implementation
           of the agenda according to the needs and priorities of countries, we recommend
           that it be part of this future global coordination mechanism.

      17.	 We further entrust UNESCO, as the United Nations’ specialized agency for
           education, to continue its mandated role to lead and coordinate the 2030
           education agenda, in particular by: undertaking advocacy to sustain political
           commitment; facilitating policy dialogue, knowledge sharing and standard
           setting; monitoring progress towards the education targets; convening
           global, regional and national stakeholders to guide the implementation of the
           agenda; and functioning as a focal point for education within the overall SDG
           coordination architecture.

      18.	 We resolve to develop comprehensive national monitoring and evaluation systems
           in order to generate sound evidence for policy formulation and the management
           of education systems as well as to ensure accountability. We further request the
           WEF 2015 co-convenors and partners to support capacity development in data
           collection, analysis and reporting at the country level. Countries should seek to
           improve the quality, levels of disaggregation and timeliness of reporting to the
           UNESCO Institute for Statistics. We also request that the Education for All Global
           Monitoring Report be continued as an independent Global Education Monitoring
           Report (GEMR), hosted and published by UNESCO, as the mechanism for
           monitoring and reporting on the proposed SDG 4 and on education in the other
           proposed SDGs, within the mechanism to be established to monitor and review
           the implementation of the proposed SDGs.




10   Incheon Declaration
19.	 We have discussed and agreed upon the essential elements of the Education
     2030 Framework for Action. Taking into account the United Nations summit
     for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda (New York, September
     2015) and the outcomes of the Third International Conference on Financing
     for Development (Addis Ababa, July 2015), a final version will be presented
     for adoption and launched at a special high-level meeting to be organized
     alongside the 38th session of the General Conference of UNESCO in November
     2015. We are fully committed to its implementation after its adoption, to inspire
     and guide countries and partners to ensure that our agenda is achieved.

20.	 Building on the legacy of Jomtien and Dakar, this Incheon Declaration is an historic
     commitment by all of us to transform lives through a new vision for education, with
     bold and innovative actions, to reach our ambitious goal by 2030.

                                            equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all
“
                      This Declaration is a huge step forward. It reflects our determination
                      to ensure that all children, young people and adults gain the
                      knowledge and skills they need to live in dignity, to fulfil their potential
                      and contribute to their societies as responsible global citizens.
                      It encourages governments to provide learning opportunities through
                      life, so that people can continue to grow and be on the right side of
                      change. It affirms that education, a fundamental human right, is the
                      key to global peace and sustainable development.
                                                                                       Irina Bokova

                      Education is the key to a better life for every child and the foundation
                      of every strong society – but far too many children are still being left
                      behind. To realize all our development goals, we need every child in
                      school and learning.
                                                                                      Anthony Lake

                      To end poverty, boost shared prosperity, and achieve the Sustainable
                      Development Goals, we must use development financing and
                      technical expertise to effect radical change. We must work together to
                      ensure that all children have access to quality education and learning
                      opportunities throughout their lives, regardless of where they are born,
                      their gender, or their family’s income.

                      Together we must promote and protect every person’s right to
                      education, and ensure that quality education reaches all, and instils
                      values of peace, justice, human rights and gender equality. We are
                      proud to have been a co-convener of the World Education Forum and
                      pledge to take forward the new action agenda on education for all
                      by 2030.

12   Incheon Declaration
In our world, knowledge is power, and education empowers. It is
an indispensable part of the development equation. It has intrinsic
value – extending far beyond the economic – to empower people
to determine their own destiny. That is why the opportunity to be
educated is central to advancing human development.

The Incheon Declaration rightly commits us to non-discriminatory
education that recognizes the importance of gender equality and
women’s empowerment for sustainable development. This is a crucial
opportunity for us to work together, across sectors, towards the
fulfilment of the Education for All promise of peaceful, just and equal
societies. A world where people are equal can only be achieved if
our education also universally teaches this.

Déclaration d’Incheon
Éducation 2030 :
Vers une éducation inclusive et équitable
de qualité et un apprentissage tout au long
de la vie pour tous




Préambule
1.	 Nous, ministres, chefs et membres de délégations, chefs d’institutions et hauts
    responsables d’organisations multilatérales et bilatérales, représentants de la
    société civile, de la profession enseignante, des jeunes et du secteur privé,
    nous sommes réunis en mai 2015 à l’invitation de la Directrice générale
    de l’UNESCO, à Incheon, en République de Corée, à l’occasion du Forum
    mondial sur l’éducation 2015 (WEF 2015). Nous remercions le Gouvernement
    et le peuple de la République de Corée d’avoir accueilli cette importante
    manifestation, ainsi que l’UNICEF, la Banque mondiale, l’UNFPA, le PNUD, ONU
    Femmes et l’UNHCR, co-organisateurs de cette réunion, pour leurs contributions.
    Nous exprimons également nos sincères remerciements à l’UNESCO, qui a
    pris l’initiative et la direction de l’organisation de cet événement majeur pour
    l’Éducation 2030.

2.	 En cette occasion historique, nous réaffirmons la vision qui est celle du
    mouvement mondial en faveur de l’Éducation pour tous, lancé en 1990 à Jomtien
    et renouvelé à Dakar en 2000, qui représente l’engagement le plus important
    pris dans le domaine de l’éducation au cours des dernières décennies, et qui
    contribue à la réalisation de progrès considérables en matière d’éducation.




                                    Éducation 2030 : Vers une éducation inclusive et équitable de
                                                                                                      17
                                       qualité et un apprentissage tout au long de la vie pour tous
           Nous réaffirmons également la vision et la volonté politique reflétées dans de
           nombreux traités internationaux et régionaux relatifs aux droits de l’homme, qui
           consacrent le droit à l’éducation et ses liens réciproques avec d’autres droits
           fondamentaux. Nous prenons acte des efforts déployés, mais nous constatons
           néanmoins avec une vive préoccupation que nous sommes loin d’avoir atteint
           l’éducation pour tous.

      3.	 Nous rappelons l’Accord de Mascate, issu de vastes consultations et adopté lors
          de la Réunion mondiale sur l’Éducation pour tous (EPT) 2014, qui a permis de
           guider avec succès la formulation des cibles proposées en matière d’éducation
           par le Groupe de travail ouvert sur les Objectifs de développement durable
           (ODD). En outre, nous rappelons les résultats des conférences ministérielles
           régionales sur l’éducation post-2015, et prenons note des conclusions du Rapport
           mondial de suivi sur l’EPT 2015 ainsi que des rapports de synthèse régionaux
           sur l’EPT. Nous sommes conscients de l’importante contribution de l’Initiative
           mondiale pour l’éducation avant tout, ainsi que du rôle des gouvernements et
           des organisations régionales, intergouvernementales et non gouvernementales,
           pour mobiliser l’engagement politique en faveur de l’éducation.

      4.	 Ayant dressé le bilan des progrès accomplis depuis 2000 en vue de la réalisation
          des objectifs de l’EPT et des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement
          (OMD) relatifs à l’éducation, ainsi que des enseignements tirés, et ayant examiné
          les défis qui subsistent, et délibéré sur l’agenda pour l’éducation 2030 qui est
          proposé et sur le Cadre d’action, ainsi que sur les priorités et les stratégies
          futures pour sa réalisation, nous adoptons la présente Déclaration.




      Vers 2030 : une nouvelle vision
      de l’éducation
      5.	 Reconnaissant le rôle important de l’éducation en tant que vecteur principal
          du développement et de la réalisation des autres objectifs de développement
          durable (ODD) proposés, notre vision est de transformer la vie grâce à
          l’éducation. Conscients de l’urgence, nous nous engageons en faveur d’un
          agenda pour l’éducation unique et renouvelé qui soit holistique, ambitieux et




18   Déclaration d’Incheon
    mobilisateur, qui ne laisse personne de côté. Cette nouvelle vision trouve sa
    pleine expression dans l’ODD 4 proposé, «              Assurer une éducation inclusive
    et équitable de qualité et promouvoir des possibilités d’apprentissage tout au
    long de la vie pour tous », et dans les cibles correspondantes. Transformatrice
    et universelle, elle permet de s’atteler au « chantier inachevé » de l’agenda de
    l’EPT et des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement relatifs à l’éducation,
    en relevant les défis de l’éducation aux niveaux mondial et national. Elle est
    inspirée par une vision humaniste de l’éducation et du développement fondée
    sur les droits de l’homme et la dignité, la justice sociale, l’inclusion, la protection,
    la diversité culturelle, linguistique et ethnique, ainsi que sur une responsabilité et
    une redevabilité partagées. Nous réaffirmons que l’éducation est un bien public,
    un droit humain fondamental et un préalable à l’exercice d’autres droits. Elle
    est essentielle à la paix, à la tolérance, à l’épanouissement de chacun et au
    développement durable. Nous reconnaissons que l’éducation est un facteur clé
    pour parvenir au plein emploi et éliminer la pauvreté. Nous concentrerons nos
    efforts sur l’accès, l’équité, l’inclusion, la qualité et les résultats de l’apprentissage,
    dans la perspective d’un apprentissage tout au long de la vie.

6.	 Encouragés par les progrès considérables que nous avons réalisés dans
    l’élargissement de l’accès à l’éducation au cours des 15 dernières années, nous
    assurerons 12 années d’enseignement primaire et secondaire de qualité, gratuit
    et équitable, financé sur fonds publics, dont au moins 9 années obligatoires,
    débouchant sur des acquis pertinents. Nous encourageons également la mise en
    place d’au moins une année d’enseignement préprimaire de qualité, gratuit et
    obligatoire, et recommandons que tous les enfants aient accès à des services de
    développement, d’éducation et de protection de la petite enfance de qualité. En
    outre, nous nous engageons à offrir des possibilités pertinentes d’éducation et de
    formation aux très nombreux enfants et adolescents non scolarisés qui requièrent
    une action immédiate, ciblée et suivie, afin que tous puissent aller à l’école et
    apprendre.

7.	 L’inclusion et l’équité, dans l’éducation et à travers elle, constituent la pierre
    angulaire d’un agenda pour l’éducation transformateur. C’est pourquoi nous nous
    engageons à lutter contre toutes les formes d’exclusion et de marginalisation, ainsi
    que contre les disparités et les inégalités en matière d’accès, de participation et
    de résultats de l’apprentissage. Aucune cible relative à l’éducation ne saurait être

                                                                                                          19
                                           qualité et un apprentissage tout au long de la vie pour tous
           considérée comme atteinte tant qu’elle ne l’est pas par tous. Nous prenons donc
           l’engagement d’apporter les changements nécessaires aux politiques éducatives
           et d’axer nos efforts sur les plus défavorisés, en particulier les personnes en
           situation de handicap, afin que nul ne soit laissé pour compte.

      8.	 Nous reconnaissons l’importance de l’égalité des genres dans la réalisation du
          droit à l’éducation pour tous. Par conséquent, nous prenons l’engagement de
          soutenir les politiques, la planification et les environnements d’apprentissage
          attentifs au genre, d’intégrer les questions de genre dans la formation des
           enseignants et dans les programmes d’enseignement, ainsi que d’éliminer les
           discriminations et la violence fondées sur le genre à l’école.

      9.	 Nous nous engageons en faveur d’une éducation de qualité et d’une amélioration
          des acquis de l’apprentissage, ce qui nécessite de renforcer les ressources,
          les processus et l’évaluation des résultats, ainsi que de mettre en place des
          mécanismes pour mesurer les progrès. Nous ferons en sorte que les enseignants
          et les éducateurs aient les moyens d’agir, qu’ils soient recrutés de manière
          adéquate, qu’ils reçoivent une formation et des qualifications professionnelles
          satisfaisantes, et qu’ils soient motivés et soutenus au sein de systèmes gérés de
          manière efficace et efficiente, et dotés de ressources suffisantes. Une éducation
          de qualité favorise la créativité et les connaissances, et garantit l’acquisition des
          compétences fondamentales en lecture, en écriture et en calcul, ainsi que des
          compétences en matière d’analyse et de résolution de problèmes, et d’autres
          aptitudes cognitives, interpersonnelles et sociales de haut niveau. Elle développe
          également les compétences, les valeurs et les attitudes qui permettent aux
          citoyens de mener une vie saine et épanouissante, de prendre des décisions
          éclairées et de relever les défis locaux et mondiaux, grâce à l’éducation en vue
          du développement durable (EDD) et à l’éducation à la citoyenneté mondiale
          (ECM). À cet égard, nous appuyons vigoureusement la mise en œuvre du
          Programme d’action global pour l’EDD qui a été lancé lors de la Conférence
          mondiale de l’UNESCO sur l’EDD tenue à Aichi-Nagoya en 2014. Nous
          soulignons également l’importance de l’éducation et de la formation aux droits
          de l’homme en vue de la réalisation du programme de développement durable
          pour l’après-2015.




20   Déclaration d’Incheon
10.	 Nous nous engageons à promouvoir des possibilités d’apprentissage tout au
     long de la vie de qualité pour tous, dans tous les contextes et à tous les niveaux
     de l’éducation, ce qui implique un accès équitable et élargi à l’enseignement et
     à la formation techniques et professionnels, ainsi qu’à l’enseignement supérieur
     et à la recherche, avec une attention particulière portée à l’assurance qualité.
     En outre, il importe de mettre en place des parcours d’apprentissage souples,
     ainsi que la reconnaissance, la validation et l’accréditation des connaissances,
     des aptitudes et des compétences acquises dans le cadre de l’éducation non
     formelle et informelle. Nous nous engageons, par ailleurs, à faire en sorte
     que tous les jeunes et tous les adultes, en particulier les filles et les femmes,
     atteignent un niveau pertinent et reconnu de maîtrise fonctionnelle de la lecture,
     de l’écriture et du calcul, et acquièrent des compétences nécessaires à la vie
     courante, et que des possibilités d’apprentissage, d’éducation et de formation
     des adultes leur soient offertes. Nous prenons enfin l’engagement de renforcer
     la science, la technologie et l’innovation. Les technologies de l’information et de
     la communication (TIC) doivent être mises à profit pour renforcer les systèmes
     éducatifs, la diffusion du savoir, l’accès à l’information, ainsi que l’efficacité et la
     qualité de l’apprentissage, et pour assurer une offre de services plus performante.

11.	 Par ailleurs, nous constatons avec une vive préoccupation qu’aujourd’hui, une
     part importante de la population non scolarisée à travers le monde vit dans des
     zones touchées par des conflits, et que les crises, la violence et les attaques contre
     les institutions éducatives, ainsi que les catastrophes naturelles et les pandémies,
     continuent de perturber l’éducation et le développement à l’échelle mondiale.
     Nous nous engageons à concevoir des systèmes éducatifs plus inclusifs, réactifs
     et résilients, afin de répondre aux besoins des enfants, des jeunes et des
     adultes qui sont confrontés à ces situations, notamment les personnes déplacées
     à l’intérieur de leur propre pays et les réfugiés. Nous soulignons la nécessité
     pour l’éducation d’être dispensée dans des environnements sains, accueillants
     et sûrs, exempts de toute violence. Nous recommandons de mener une action
     appropriée face aux crises, de l’intervention d’urgence jusqu’au relèvement et
     à la reconstruction, de mieux coordonner les réponses nationales, régionales et
     mondiales, ainsi que de développer les capacités en matière de réduction et
     d’atténuation globales des risques, afin que l’éducation continue d’être assurée
     pendant les situations de conflit, d’urgence et de post-conflit, et dans les premiers
     temps du relèvement.

      Mise en œuvre de notre
      agenda commun
      12.	 Nous réaffirmons que la responsabilité première de la bonne mise en œuvre
           de cet agenda incombe aux gouvernements. Nous sommes résolus à mettre
           en place les cadres juridiques et politiques qui favorisent la responsabilité et
           la transparence, ainsi qu’une gouvernance participative et des partenariats
           coordonnés à tous les niveaux et dans tous les secteurs, et à défendre le droit à
           la participation de toutes les parties prenantes.

      13.	 Nous appelons à instaurer une collaboration, une coopération, une coordination
           et un suivi solides, aux niveaux mondial et régional, en vue de la mise en
           œuvre de l’agenda pour l’éducation, fondés sur la collecte, l’analyse et la
           communication de données au niveau des pays, dans le cadre d’entités, de
           stratégies et de mécanismes régionaux.

      14.	 Nous reconnaissons que le succès de l’agenda pour l’éducation 2030 exige des
           politiques et une planification rigoureuses, ainsi que des modalités de mise en
           œuvre efficaces. Il est également évident que l’ambition reflétée dans l’ODD 4
           proposé ne pourra être réalisée sans une augmentation importante et bien ciblée
           du financement, notamment dans les pays les plus éloignés de la réalisation
           d’une éducation de qualité pour tous à tous les niveaux. Nous sommes donc
           déterminés à accroître les dépenses publiques en faveur de l’éducation, selon
           la situation des pays, et nous préconisons l’adhésion aux critères/indicateurs
           de référence internationaux et régionaux selon lesquels il convient de consacrer
           à l’éducation au moins 4 à 6 % du produit intérieur brut et/ou au moins 15 à
           20 % du total des dépenses publiques.

      15.	 Notant l’importance de la coopération pour le développement en complément
           des investissements des gouvernements, nous demandons aux pays développés,
           aux bailleurs traditionnels et émergents, aux pays à revenu intermédiaire et aux
           mécanismes de financement internationaux d’accroître le financement en faveur
           de l’éducation, et de soutenir la mise en œuvre de l’agenda selon les besoins
           et les priorités des pays. Nous considérons qu’il est primordial d’honorer tous les




22   Déclaration d’Incheon
    engagements concernant l’aide publique au développement (APD), notamment
    celui que de nombreux pays développés ont pris de consacrer 0,7 % de leur
    produit national brut (PNB) à l’aide publique au développement en faveur des
    pays en développement. Conformément à ces engagements, nous invitons les
    pays développés qui ne l’ont pas encore fait à s’attacher plus concrètement à
    atteindre l’objectif fixé, à savoir consacrer 0,7 % de leur PNB à l’APD en faveur
    des pays en développement. Nous prenons également l’engagement d’accroître
    notre soutien en faveur des pays les moins avancés. En outre, nous considérons
    qu’il importe de débloquer toutes les ressources possibles pour soutenir le droit à
    l’éducation. Nous recommandons d’améliorer l’efficacité de l’aide grâce à une
    meilleure coordination et à une plus grande harmonisation, ainsi que d’accorder
    en priorité le financement et l’aide aux sous-secteurs négligés et aux pays à faible
    revenu. Nous recommandons également d’accroître de manière significative le
    soutien en faveur de l’éducation en cas de crise humanitaire prolongée. Nous
    accueillons favorablement la tenue du Sommet d’Oslo sur l’éducation pour le
    développement (juillet 2015) et appelons la Conférence internationale sur le
    financement du développement (Addis-Abeba) à soutenir l’ODD 4 proposé.

16.	 Nous appelons les institutions co-organisatrices du Forum mondial sur l’éducation
     2015, en particulier l’UNESCO, ainsi que tous les partenaires, à aider
     individuellement et collectivement les différents pays à mettre en œuvre l’agenda
     pour l’éducation 2030, en fournissant des avis techniques, en développant les
     capacités nationales et en apportant un soutien financier, en fonction de leur
     mandat et de leurs avantages comparatifs respectifs, tout en mettant à profit
     leur complémentarité. À cette fin, nous confions à l’UNESCO la tâche de mettre
     en place un mécanisme de coordination mondial approprié, en consultation
     avec les États membres, les institutions co-organisatrices du Forum mondial
     sur l’éducation 2015, et d’autres partenaires. Considérant que le Partenariat
     mondial pour l’éducation constitue un pôle de financement multipartite de
     l’éducation à l’appui de la mise en œuvre de l’agenda, selon les besoins et les
     priorités des pays, nous recommandons qu’il fasse partie de ce futur mécanisme
     de coordination mondial.

                                                                                                       23
                                        qualité et un apprentissage tout au long de la vie pour tous
      17.	 Nous prions également l’UNESCO, en sa qualité d’institution spécialisée des
           Nations Unies pour l’éducation, de continuer à jouer le rôle qui lui incombe, en
           vertu de son mandat, à savoir conduire et coordonner l’agenda pour l’éducation
           2030, notamment en plaidant pour la poursuite de l’engagement politique, en
           facilitant le dialogue sur les politiques, le partage des connaissances et l’action
           normative, en suivant les progrès vers la réalisation des cibles de l’éducation,
           en réunissant les parties prenantes mondiales, régionales et nationales afin
           d’orienter la mise en œuvre de l’agenda, et en faisant office de point focal pour
           l’éducation au sein de l’architecture globale de coordination des Objectifs de
           développement durable (ODD).

      18.	 Nous décidons de mettre en place des systèmes nationaux de suivi et
           d’évaluation complets afin de produire des données factuelles solides pour guider
           la formulation des politiques et la gestion des systèmes éducatifs, et de garantir
           la redevabilité. En outre, nous prions les institutions co-organisatrices du Forum
           mondial sur l’éducation 2015 et leurs partenaires de soutenir le renforcement des
           capacités en matière de collecte, d’analyse et de communication de données
           au niveau national. Les pays devraient s’employer à améliorer la qualité et les
           niveaux de ventilation des données, ainsi qu’à les communiquer en temps utile
           à l’Institut de statistique de l’UNESCO. Nous demandons également que le
           Rapport mondial de suivi sur l’Éducation pour tous soit maintenu sous la forme
           d’un Rapport mondial de suivi sur l’éducation (GEMR) indépendant, hébergé et
           publié par l’UNESCO, en tant que moyen d’assurer le suivi et de rendre compte
           de l’ODD 4 proposé, ainsi que des aspects relatifs à l’éducation dans les autres
           ODD proposés, dans le cadre du mécanisme qui sera mis en place pour suivre
           et examiner la réalisation des ODD proposés.

      19.	 Nous avons débattu et sommes convenus des composantes essentielles du
           Cadre d’action Éducation 2030. Compte tenu des résultats du sommet des
           Nations Unies consacré à l’adoption du programme de développement
           pour l’après-2015 (New York, septembre 2015), ainsi que de la troisième
           Conférence internationale sur le financement du développement (Addis-Abeba,
           juillet 2015), une version finale du cadre d’action sera présentée pour adoption
           et lancée lors d’une réunion spéciale de haut niveau organisée en marge de la
           38e session de la Conférence générale de l’UNESCO, en novembre 2015.
           Nous sommes pleinement résolus à mettre en œuvre ce cadre d’action, une
           fois adopté, afin qu’il guide et inspire les différents pays et partenaires dans la
           réalisation de notre agenda.

                       Cette Déclaration représente un immense pas en avant. Elle reflète
                       notre détermination à faire en sorte que tous les enfants, tous les jeunes
                       et tous les adultes acquièrent les connaissances et les compétences
                       nécessaires pour vivre dignement, réaliser leur potentiel et apporter leur
                       contribution à la société en tant que citoyens du monde responsables.
                       Elle encourage les gouvernements à fournir des possibilités
                       d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie, afin de permettre à chacun
                       de continuer à se développer et à être du bon côté du changement.
                       Elle affirme que l’éducation, qui est un droit humain fondamental, est
                       essentielle à la paix mondiale et au développement durable.

                       L’éducation est la clé d’une vie meilleure pour tous les enfants, et le
                       fondement de toute société forte – mais beaucoup trop d’enfants en
                       sont encore exclus. Pour réaliser tous nos objectifs de développement,
                       nous devons permettre à chaque enfant d’aller à l’école et d’apprendre.

                       partagée et atteindre les Objectifs de développement durable, il
                       faut mobiliser les financements pour le développement et l’expertise

                       unir nos forces afin que tous les enfants, où qu’ils soient nés, quel
                       que soit leur sexe ou leur condition économique, aient accès à une
                       éducation de qualité et qu’ils puissent avoir la possibilité d’apprendre

26   Déclaration d’Incheon
Dans notre monde, la connaissance apporte le pouvoir, et l’éducation
y contribue. Elle fait partie intégrante de l’équation du développement.
Elle possède une valeur intrinsèque – qui s’étend bien au-delà du
domaine économique – qui permet à chacun de décider de son
propre destin. C’est pourquoi la possibilité de recevoir une éducation
est essentielle pour faire progresser le développement humain.
                                                                   Helen Clark

La Déclaration d’Incheon nous engage à juste titre à garantir une
éducation non discriminatoire qui reconnaît l’importance de l’égalité
des genres et de l’autonomisation des femmes pour le développement
durable. C’est une occasion cruciale pour les différents secteurs
de travailler ensemble dans l’accomplissement de la promesse de
l’Éducation pour tous de construire des sociétés pacifiques, justes et
équitables. Un monde dans lequel toutes les personnes sont égales
ne peut exister que si notre éducation enseigne cette valeur de
façon universelle.

Nous avons la responsabilité commune d’assurer que les plans
d’éducation mis en place prennent en considération les besoins des
jeunes et des enfants les plus démunis dans le monde, notamment
les réfugiés, les enfants déplacés à l’intérieur de leur propre pays,

Mundial, el UNFPA, el PNUD, ONU Mujeres
y el ACNUR, organizó el Foro Mundial sobre
la Educación 2015 en Incheon (República de
Corea) del 19 al 22 de mayo de 2015, que fue
acogido por la República de Corea. Más de
1.600 participantes de 160 países, entre los cuales
se contaban 120 ministros, jefes y miembros de
delegaciones, jefes de organismos y funcionarios
de organizaciones multilaterales y bilaterales,
así como representantes de la sociedad civil, la
profesión docente, los jóvenes y el sector privado,
aprobaron la Declaración de Incheon para la
Educación 2030, en la que se presenta una nueva
visión de la educación para los próximos 15 años.

Educación 2030:
Hacia una educación inclusiva y equitativa

Preámbulo
1.	 Nosotros, ministros, jefes y miembros de delegaciones, jefes de organismos y
    funcionarios de organizaciones multilaterales y bilaterales y representantes de la
    sociedad civil, de la profesión docente, de los jóvenes y del sector privado, nos
    hemos reunido en mayo de 2015 por invitación de la Directora General de la
    UNESCO en Incheon (República de Corea) con motivo del Foro Mundial sobre
    la Educación 2015 (WEF 2015). Damos las gracias al Gobierno y al pueblo
    de la República de Corea por haber acogido este importante acontecimiento,
    así como al UNICEF, al Banco Mundial, al UNFPA, al PNUD, a ONU Mujeres
    y al ACNUR, coorganizadores de esta reunión, por sus contribuciones.
    Expresamos nuestro sincero agradecimiento a la UNESCO por haber puesto en
    marcha y liderado la convocatoria de este acontecimiento que marca un hito
    para la Educación 2030.

2.	 En esta histórica ocasión, reafirmamos la visión del movimiento mundial en pro
    de la Educación para Todos, que se puso en marcha en Jomtien en 1990
    y se reiteró en Dakar en 2000, el compromiso más importante en materia
    de educación en las últimas décadas, que contribuye a impulsar progresos
    significativos en el ámbito de la educación. Reafirmamos también la visión y

                                     de calidad y un aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida para todos
           la voluntad política reflejadas en numerosos tratados de derechos humanos
           internacionales y regionales en los que se establece el derecho a la educación
           y su interrelación con otros derechos humanos. Reconocemos los esfuerzos
           realizados, aunque observamos con gran preocupación que estamos lejos de
           haber alcanzado la educación para todos.

      3.	 Recordamos el Acuerdo de Mascate, elaborado mediante amplias consultas
          y aprobado en la Reunión Mundial sobre la Educación para Todos (EPT) de
          2014, que sirvió de fundamento para las metas de educación propuestas por el
           Grupo de Trabajo Abierto sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS).
           Recordamos también los resultados de las conferencias ministeriales regionales
           sobre la educación después de 2015, y tomamos nota de las conclusiones
           del Informe de Seguimiento de la EPT en el Mundo 2015 y de los informes
           de síntesis regionales sobre la EPT. Reconocemos la importante contribución
           de la Iniciativa Mundial “La educación ante todo”, así como la función de
           los gobiernos y de las organizaciones regionales, intergubernamentales y no
           gubernamentales para impulsar el compromiso político en pro de la educación.

      4.	 Habiendo hecho balance de los progresos alcanzados en la consecución
          de las metas de la EPT desde 2000 y de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del
          Milenio (ODM) relacionados con la educación, así como de la experiencia
          adquirida, y habiendo examinado los desafíos pendientes y deliberado sobre
          la agenda de la educación 2030 propuesta y el Marco de Acción, así como
          sobre las prioridades y estrategias futuras para lograrla, aprobamos la presente
          Declaración.




      Hacia 2030: una nueva visión
      de la educación
      5.	 Nuestra visión es transformar las vidas mediante la educación, reconociendo
          el importante papel que desempeña la educación como motor principal
          del desarrollo y para la consecución de los demás ODS propuestos. Nos
          comprometemos con carácter de urgencia con una agenda de la educación
          única y renovada que sea integral, ambiciosa y exigente, sin dejar a nadie
          atrás. Esta nueva visión se recoge plenamente en el ODS 4 propuesto




32   Declaración de Incheon
    “Garantizar una educación inclusiva, equitativa y de calidad y promover
    oportunidades de aprendizaje durante toda la vida para todos” y sus metas
    correspondientes. En esta visión, transformadora y universal, se tiene en cuenta
    el carácter inconcluso de la agenda de la EPT y de los ODM relacionados con
    la educación, y se abordan los desafíos de la educación en los planos mundial
    y nacional. La visión se inspira en una concepción humanista de la educación
    y del desarrollo basada en los derechos humanos y la dignidad, la justicia
    social, la inclusión, la protección, la diversidad cultural, lingüística y étnica, y
    la responsabilidad y la rendición de cuentas compartidas. Reafirmamos que
    la educación es un bien público, un derecho humano fundamental y la base
    para garantizar la realización de otros derechos. Es esencial para la paz,
    la tolerancia, la realización humana y el desarrollo sostenible. Reconocemos
    que la educación es clave para lograr el pleno empleo y la erradicación
    de la pobreza. Centraremos nuestros esfuerzos en el acceso, la equidad, la
    inclusión, la calidad y los resultados del aprendizaje, dentro de un enfoque del
    aprendizaje a lo largo de toda la vida.

6.	 Motivados por los importantes logros que hemos conseguido en la ampliación
    del acceso a la educación en los últimos 15 años, velaremos por que se
    proporcione educación primaria y secundaria de calidad, equitativa, gratuita y
    financiada con fondos públicos, durante 12 años, de los cuales al menos nueve
    serán obligatorios, consiguiendo así resultados de aprendizaje pertinentes.
    Alentamos también a que se imparta al menos un año de enseñanza preescolar
    de calidad, gratuita y obligatoria y a que todos los niños tengan acceso a
    una educación, atención y desarrollo de la primera infancia de calidad.
    Nos comprometemos también a proporcionar oportunidades de educación y
    capacitación significativas para el gran número de niños y adolescentes no
    escolarizados, que precisan medidas inmediatas, sostenidas y específicas, a fin
    de velar por que todos los niños asistan a la escuela y aprendan.

7.	 La inclusión y la equidad en la educación y a través de ella son la piedra
    angular de una agenda de la educación transformadora, y por consiguiente nos
    comprometemos a hacer frente a todas las formas de exclusión y marginación,
    las disparidades y las desigualdades en el acceso, la participación y los
    resultados de aprendizaje. Ninguna meta educativa debería considerarse
    lograda a menos que se haya logrado para todos. Por lo tanto, nos
    comprometemos a realizar los cambios necesarios en las políticas de educación
    y a centrar nuestros esfuerzos en los más desfavorecidos, especialmente aquellos
    con discapacidad, para velar por que nadie se quede atrás.

                                                                                                    33
                                     de calidad y un aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida para todos
      8.	 Reconocemos la importancia de la igualdad de género para lograr el derecho
          a la educación para todos. Por consiguiente, nos comprometemos a apoyar
          políticas, planes y contextos de aprendizaje en que se tengan en cuenta las
          cuestiones de género, así como a incorporar estas cuestiones en la formación
          de docentes, los planes y programas de estudios, y a eliminar la discriminación
          y la violencia por motivos de género en las escuelas.

      9.	 Nos comprometemos con una educación de calidad y con la mejora de los
          resultados de aprendizaje, para lo cual es necesario fortalecer los insumos,
           los procesos y la evaluación de los resultados y los mecanismos para medir
           los progresos. Velaremos por que los docentes y los educadores estén
           empoderados, sean debidamente contratados, reciban una buena formación,
           estén cualificados profesionalmente, motivados y apoyados dentro de sistemas
           que dispongan de recursos suficientes, que sean eficientes y que estén dirigidos
           de manera eficaz. La educación de calidad fomenta la creatividad y el
           conocimiento, garantiza la adquisición de las competencias básicas de lectura,
           escritura y cálculo, así como de aptitudes analíticas, de solución de problemas
           y otras habilidades cognitivas, interpersonales y sociales de alto nivel. Además,
           la educación de calidad propicia el desarrollo de las competencias, los valores
           y las actitudes que permiten a los ciudadanos llevar vidas saludables y plenas,
           tomar decisiones con conocimiento de causa y responder a los desafíos locales
           y mundiales mediante la educación para el desarrollo sostenible (ESD) y la
           educación para la ciudadanía mundial (ECM). A este respecto, apoyamos
           firmemente la aplicación del Programa de acción mundial de EDS presentado
           en la Conferencia Mundial de la UNESCO sobre EDS que se celebró en Aichi-
           Nagoya en 2014. Además, destacamos la importancia de la educación y la
           formación en materia de derechos humanos para lograr la agenda para el
           desarrollo sostenible después de 2015.

      10.	 Nos comprometemos a promover oportunidades de aprendizaje de calidad a
           lo largo de la vida para todos, en todos los contextos y en todos los niveles
           educativos. Ello incluye un mayor acceso en condiciones de igualdad a la
           enseñanza y formación técnica y profesional de calidad, a la educación superior
           y a la investigación, prestando la debida atención a la garantía de la calidad.
           Además, es importante que se ofrezcan vías de aprendizaje flexibles, así como
           también el reconocimiento, la validación y la acreditación de los conocimientos,
           habilidades y competencias adquiridos mediante la educación informal y no
           formal. Nos comprometemos además a velar por que todos los jóvenes y
           adultos, especialmente las niñas y las mujeres, alcancen niveles de excelencia

    en alfabetización funcional y aritmética que sean pertinentes y reconocidos y
    adquieran competencias para la vida, así como a que se les proporcionen
    oportunidades de formación, educación y capacitación de adultos. Nos
    comprometemos también a fortalecer la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación.
    Es preciso aprovechar las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC)
    para reforzar los sistemas educativos, la difusión de conocimientos, el acceso
    a la información, el aprendizaje efectivo y de calidad, y una prestación más
    eficaz de servicios.

11.	 Además, observamos con grave preocupación que, en la actualidad, una gran
     proporción de la población mundial no escolarizada vive en zonas afectadas
     por conflictos y que las crisis, la violencia y los ataques contra las instituciones
     educativas, los desastres naturales y las pandemias continúan perturbando la
     educación y el desarrollo en el mundo. Nos comprometemos a desarrollar
     sistemas de educación más inclusivos, que ofrezcan mejores respuestas y que
     tengan una mayor capacidad de adaptación para satisfacer las necesidades
     de los niños, jóvenes y adultos en estos contextos, en particular de las personas
     desplazadas y los refugiados. Subrayamos la necesidad de que la educación
     se imparta en entornos de aprendizaje sanos, que brinden apoyo y seguros.
     Recomendamos una gestión suficiente de las crisis, desde la respuesta de
     emergencia hasta la recuperación y la reconstrucción; respuestas nacionales,
     regionales y mundiales mejor coordinadas; y el desarrollo de capacidades para
     la reducción global del riesgo y la mitigación de sus efectos, a fin de que la
     educación se mantenga durante situaciones de conflicto, de emergencia, de
     post-conflicto y de recuperación temprana.




Aplicación de nuestra
agenda común
12.	 Reafirmamos que la responsabilidad fundamental de aplicar con éxito esta
     agenda corresponde a los gobiernos. Estamos decididos a establecer marcos
     jurídicos y políticos que promuevan la rendición de cuentas y la transparencia,
     así como la dirección participativa y las asociaciones coordinadas en todos los
     niveles y en todos los sectores, y a defender el derecho a la participación de
     todas las partes interesadas.

      13.	 Pedimos una sólida colaboración, cooperación, coordinación y seguimiento en
           los planos mundial y regional de la aplicación de la agenda de la educación,
           sobre la base de la recopilación, el análisis de datos y la presentación de
           informes en los países, en el marco de entidades, mecanismos y estrategias
           regionales.

      14.	 Reconocemos que el éxito de la agenda de la educación 2030 exige políticas y
           planeamientos adecuados, así como modalidades de aplicación eficientes. Está
           claro también que las aspiraciones comprendidas en el ODS 4 propuesto no
           pueden hacerse efectivas si no van acompañadas de un aumento significativo
           y bien definido de la financiación, en particular en aquellos países que están
           más lejos de alcanzar la educación de calidad para todos en todos los niveles.
           Estamos por tanto decididos a aumentar el gasto público en educación, de
           acuerdo con el contexto nacional, e instamos a que se cumplan los objetivos
           de referencia internacionales y regionales de asignar de forma eficiente a la
           educación al menos entre un 4% y un 6% del producto interno bruto o al menos
           entre un 15% y un 20% del total del gasto público.

      15.	 Observando la importancia de la cooperación para el desarrollo como
           complemento de la inversión de los gobiernos, apelamos a los países
           desarrollados, a los donantes tradicionales y emergentes, a los países de
           ingresos medianos y a los mecanismos de financiación internacionales a
           que aumenten los fondos destinados a la educación y apoyen la aplicación
           de la agenda de acuerdo con las necesidades y prioridades de los países.
           Reconocemos que el cumplimiento de todos los compromisos relacionados
           con la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo (AOD) es crucial, incluidos los
           compromisos de muchos países desarrollados de alcanzar la meta de destinar
           el 0,7% de su producto nacional bruto (PNB) a AOD para los países en
           desarrollo. De conformidad con los compromisos que han asumido, instamos a
           los países desarrollados que aún no lo hayan hecho a que hagan más esfuerzos
           concretos con el fin de alcanzar la meta de destinar el 0,7% del PNB a AOD
           para los países en desarrollo. Asimismo, nos comprometemos a incrementar
           nuestro apoyo a los países menos adelantados. Además, reconocemos la
           importancia de aprovechar todos los recursos posibles para apoyar el derecho
           a la educación. Recomendamos mejorar la eficacia de la ayuda mediante una
           mejor coordinación y armonización, y que se dé prioridad a la financiación y la
           ayuda a subsectores desatendidos y países de bajos ingresos. Recomendamos
           también que se incremente de manera significativa el apoyo a la educación en

    situaciones de crisis humanitarias y prolongadas. Acogemos con satisfacción la
    Cumbre de Oslo sobre Educación para el Desarrollo (julio de 2015) y hacemos
    un llamamiento a la Conferencia de Addis Abeba sobre Financiación para el
    Desarrollo para que apoye el ODS 4 propuesto.

16.	 Instamos a los coorganizadores del Foro Mundial sobre la Educación 2015
     y, en particular, a la UNESCO, así como a todos los socios, a que apoyen,
     tanto de forma individual como colectiva, a los países en la aplicación de la
     agenda de la educación 2030, mediante asesoramiento técnico, desarrollo de
    las capacidades nacionales y apoyo financiero en función de sus respectivos
    mandatos y ventajas comparativas, y sobre la base de la complementariedad.
    Con este fin, encomendamos a la UNESCO, en consulta con sus Estados
    Miembros, a los coorganizadores del Foro Mundial sobre la Educación 2015
    y a otros asociados que elaboren un mecanismo de coordinación mundial
    adecuado. Reconociendo que la Alianza Mundial para la Educación es una
    plataforma de financiación de múltiples interesados en pro de la educación
    para apoyar la aplicación de la agenda de acuerdo con las necesidades
    y prioridades de los países, recomendamos que sea parte de ese futuro
    mecanismo de coordinación mundial.

17.	 Encomendamos también a la UNESCO, en su calidad de organismo de las
     Naciones Unidas especializado en educación, que continúe con la función que
     se le ha asignado de liderar y coordinar la agenda de la educación 2030, en
     particular mediante: labores de promoción para mantener el compromiso político;
     la facilitación del diálogo sobre políticas, el intercambio de conocimientos y
     el establecimiento de normas; el seguimiento de los avances obtenidos en la
     consecución de las metas de educación; la captación de la participación de
     las partes interesadas en los planos mundial, regional y nacional para guiar la
     aplicación de la agenda; y la función de coordinación de la educación dentro
     de la estructura general de coordinación de los ODS.

18.	 Resolvemos desarrollar sistemas nacionales de seguimiento y evaluación
     integrales a fin de producir datos sólidos para la formulación de políticas y
     la gestión de los sistemas educativos, así como para velar por la rendición de
     cuentas. Solicitamos además a los coorganizadores y los asociados del Foro
     Mundial sobre la Educación 2015 que apoyen el desarrollo de capacidades
     de recopilación y análisis de datos y presentación de informes en el plano
     nacional. Los países deberían esforzarse por mejorar la calidad, los niveles
     de desagregación y la presentación oportuna de informes al Instituto de
     Estadística de la UNESCO. Solicitamos también que se mantenga el Informe

           seguimiento y presentación de informes sobre el ODS 4 propuesto y sobre
           la educación en los otros ODS propuestos, dentro del mecanismo que se
           establecerá para vigilar y examinar la aplicación de los ODS propuestos.

      19.	 Hemos debatido y acordado los elementos esenciales del Marco de Acción de
           la Educación 2030. Teniendo en cuenta la cumbre de las Naciones Unidas en
           que se aprobará la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 (Nueva York,
           septiembre de 2015) y los resultados de la tercera Conferencia Internacional
           sobre la Financiación para el Desarrollo (Addis Abeba, julio de 2015), se
           presentará una versión definitiva para su aprobación, que se hará pública
           en una reunión especial de alto nivel organizada de forma paralela a la 38ª
           reunión de la Conferencia General de la UNESCO en noviembre de 2015.
           Estamos plenamente comprometidos con su aplicación, después de que haya
           sido aprobada, a fin de que sirva de inspiración y guía a los países y los
           asociados para velar por el cumplimiento de nuestra agenda.

      20.	 Aprovechando el legado de Jomtien y Dakar, la presente Declaración de
           Incheon constituye un compromiso histórico por parte de todos nosotros para
           transformar vidas mediante una nueva visión de la educación, con medidas
           audaces e innovadoras, a fin de alcanzar nuestra ambiciosa meta para 2030.

de calidad y un aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida para todos
“
                      Esta Declaración es un enorme paso adelante. Refleja nuestra
                      determinación de velar por que todos los niños, jóvenes y adultos
                      puedan adquirir el conocimiento y las habilidades necesarios para
                      vivir dignamente, desarrollar su potencial y contribuir a la sociedad
                      como ciudadanos mundiales responsables. La Declaración también
                      alienta a los gobiernos a proporcionar oportunidades de aprendizaje
                      a lo largo de toda la vida, de modo que las personas puedan seguir
                      creciendo y desarrollándose positivamente. Además, reafirma que la
                      educación, como derecho humano fundamental, es la clave para la
                      paz y el desarrollo sostenible en el mundo.
                                                                                   Irina Bokova

                      La educación es la clave para dar a cada niño una vida mejor y
                      constituye el cimiento de todas las sociedades sólidas. Pero todavía
                      hay muchos niños que se están quedando rezagados. Para cumplir
                      nuestras metas de desarrollo, necesitamos que todos los niños vayan
                      a la escuela y adquieran conocimientos.
                                                                                    Anthony Lake

                      Para poner fin a la pobreza, fomentar la prosperidad compartida
                      y alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, debemos valernos
                      de la financiación para el desarrollo y de los conocimientos
                      técnicos especializados para producir cambios radicales. Debemos
                      colaborar para que todos los niños tengan acceso a oportunidades
                      de aprendizaje y educación de calidad durante su vida,
                      independientemente del lugar donde hayan nacido, de su sexo o de
                      los ingresos familiares.

                      justicia, los derechos humanos y la igualdad de género. Para nuestra
                      organización es un orgullo haber coorganizado el Foro Mundial sobre
                      la Educación, y nos comprometemos a impulsar la nueva agenda de

40   Declaración de Incheon
En nuestro mundo, el conocimiento es poder, y la educación
empodera. La educación es una parte indispensable de la ecuación
del desarrollo, y tiene un valor intrínseco —que va mucho más allá de
la dimensión económica— para brindar a las personas la capacidad
de decidir su propio destino. Por eso, la oportunidad de recibir
educación es clave para el desarrollo humano.

En la Declaración de Incheon asumimos el compromiso de promover
una educación no discriminatoria que reconozca la importancia
de la igualdad de género y el empoderamiento de la mujer para
el desarrollo sostenible. Tenemos pues una oportunidad única de
colaborar entre distintos sectores para hacer realidad el propósito de
la Educación para Todos: lograr unas sociedades pacíficas, justas e
igualitarias. Solo podremos construir un mundo donde haya igualdad
entre las personas si la educación también transmite universalmente
este mensaje.

    лица многосторонних и двусторонних организаций, а также представители
    гражданского общест­ ва, педагогической профессии, молодежи и частного

    образования 2015  г. (ВФО-2015). Мы благодарим правительство и народ
    Республики Корея за организацию этого важного мероприятия, а также
    выступивших в качестве соорганизаторов этой встречи ЮНИСЕФ, Всемирный

2.	 В этот исторический момент мы подтверждаем концепцию всемирного
    движения за образование для всех, которое было инициировано в
    Джомтьене в 1990 г., получило новый импульс в Дакаре в 2000 г. и стало
    самым значительным обязательством в области образования за последние
    десятилетия, способствовавшим достижению существенного прогресса в этой
    сфере. Мы также подтверждаем видение и политическую волю, отраженные
    в многочисленных международных и региональных договорах в области

                              качественного образования и обучения на протяжении всей жизни
          другими правами человека. Мы отдаем должное уже предпринятым усилиям,
          однако с серьезной обеспокоенностью признаем, что мы еще далеки от
          достижения целей программы «Образование для всех».

      3.	 Мы напоминаем о Маскатском соглашении, разработанном в рамках
          широких консультаций и принятом на Глобальном совещании по программе
          «Образование для всех»    (ОДВ) в 2014 г., которое внесло вклад в разработку
          целей в области образования, предлагаемых Открытой          рабочей группой
          по целям в области устойчивого развития (ЦУР). Мы также напоминаем о
          результатах региональных конференций министров образования после 2015 г.
          и принимаем к сведению выводы Всемирного доклада по мониторингу ОДВ
          2015 г., а также региональных сводных докладов по ОДВ. Мы признаем важный
          вклад инициативы «Образование прежде всего», а также роль правительств и
          региональных, межправительственных и неправительственных организаций в
          стимулировании политической приверженности вопросам образования.

      4.	 Оценив достигнутый с 2000 г. прогресс на пути достижения целей ОДВ
          и связанных с образованием Целей развития тысячелетия (ЦРТ), а также
          усвоенные уроки, изучив сохраняющиеся проблемы и обсудив предлагаемую
          повестку дня в области образования до 2030 г. и Рамки действий, а также
          приоритетные цели на будущее и стратегии их достижения, мы принимаем
          настоящую Декларацию.




      На пути к 2030 г.:
      новая концепция образования
      5.	 Наша концепция заключается в преобразовании жизни людей с помощью
          образования, признавая важную роль образования в качестве основной
          движущей силы развития и в достижении других предлагаемых ЦУР. Мы
          привержены делу срочного формулирования единой обновленной повестки
          дня в области образования, которая была бы всесторонней, масштабной,
          стимулирующей и охватывающей всех без исключения. Эта новая концепция
          всецело отражена в предлагаемой ЦУР 4: «Обеспечить инклюзивное и
          справедливое качественное образование и создать возможности для
          обучения на протяжении всей жизни для всех» и соответствующих целевых
          показателях. Эта преобразующая и универсальная цель направлена на
          завершение реализации задач повестки дня ОДВ и связанных с образованием


46   Инчхонская декларация
    ЦРТ и призвана содействовать решению глобальных и национальных
    проблем в области образования. В ее основе лежит гуманистическая
    концепция образования и развития, основанная на осознании значимости
    прав и достоинства человека, социальной справедливости, инклюзивности,
    защиты, культурного, языкового и этничес­кого разнообразия, а также общей
    ответственности и подотчетности. Мы подтверждаем, что образование является
    общественным благом, одним из основополагающих прав человека и основой
    для обеспечения других прав. Оно    является необходимым условием мира,
    терпимости, реализации человеческого потенциала и устойчивого развития. Мы
    признаем, что образование является ключевым элементом обеспечения полной
    занятости и искоренения нищеты. Мы сосредоточим наши усилия на работе
    в области доступа, равноправия и инклюзивности, качества и результатов
    обучения в рамках обучения на протяжении всей жизни.

6.	 Опираясь на достигнутые за последние 15 лет успехи в области расширения
    доступа к образованию, мы будем гарантировать предоставление 12-летнего
    бесплатного, финансируемого государством образования, обеспечивая
    доступ к равноправному качественному начальному и среднему образованию,
    причем продолжительность обязательного образования, обеспечивающего
    соответствующие результаты обучения, должна составлять не менее девяти лет.
    Кроме того, мы призываем обеспечить предоставление не менее одного года
    бесплатного и обязательного качественного дошкольного образования, чтобы
    все дети имели доступ к качественному дошкольному развитию, воспитанию
    и обучению. Мы также обязуемся создавать содержательные возможности
    в области образования и подготовки для обширного контингента детей и
    подростков, не охваченных школьным образованием, что требует принятия
    срочных, целенаправленных и последовательных мер для обеспечения того,
    чтобы все дети ходили в школу и учились.

7.	 Справедливость и социальная интеграция в образовании и посредством
    образования составляют фундамент способной к трансформации повестки
    дня в области образования. Таким образом, мы обязуемся бороться со всеми
    формами отчуждения и маргинализации, неравноправия и неравенства
    в области доступа участия и результатов обучения. Ни одна цель в сфере
    образования не должна, считаться достигнутой, пока она не достигнута всеми.
    В связи с этим мы обязуемся внести необходимые изменения в политику в
    области образования и сосредоточить свои усилия на образовании наиболее
    обездоленных групп населения, в особенности лицах с ограниченными
    возможностями, для обеспечения охвата всех без исключения.



                       Образование-2030: Oбеспечение всеобщего инклюзивного и справедливого
                                                                                               47
                               качественного образования и обучения на протяжении всей жизни
      8.	 Мы признаем важность гендерного равенства в обеспечении права на
          образование для всех. В связи с этим мы выражаем свою приверженность
          поддержке политики, планирования и среды обучения, учитывающих
          гендерные аспекты, учету гендерных вопросов в рамках педагогической
          подготовки и учебных программах, а также ликвидации дискриминации и
          насилия по гендерному признаку в школах.

      9.	 Мы обязуемся обеспечивать качественное образование и улучшать
          результаты обучения, что требует повышения затрат, эффективности процессов
          и усовершенствования способов оценки результатов, а также наличия
          механизмов, позволяющих оценить достигнутый прогресс. Мы будем следить за
          тем, чтобы учителя и воспитатели были наделены соответствующими правами
          и возможностями, их прием на работу осуществлялся должным образом,
          проводилась качественная подготовка, присваивалась соответствующaя
          квалификация и обеспечивалась мотивация и поддержка в рамках располагающих
          достаточными ресурсами, действенных и эффективно управляемых систем.
          Качественное образование стимулирует творческий дух и знания и гарантирует
          приобретение базовых навыков грамотности и счета, а также навыков анализа,
          умения решать проблемы и других ког­ нитивных, межличностных и социальных
          навыков высокого уровня. Оно также развивает навыки, ценностные ориентиры
          и поведенческие установки, которые дают гражданам возможность вести
          здоровую и полноценную жизнь, принимать обоснованные решения и
          реагировать на местные и глобальные проблемы посредством образования
          в интересах устойчивого развития (ОУР) и образования в духе глобальной
          гражданственности  (ОГГ). В этой связи мы решительно поддерживаем
          осуществление Глобальной программы действий по ОУР, о которой было
          объявлено на Всемирной конференции ЮНЕСКО по ОУР, прошедшей в 2014 г.
          в Айти-Нагое. Мы также подчеркиваем важность образования и подготовки в
          области прав человека для осуществления повестки дня в области устойчивого
          развития на период после 2015 г.

      10.	 Мы обязуемся содействовать созданию возможностей качественного
           обучения на протяжении всей жизни для всех, во всех структурах и на всех
           уровнях образования. Это включает в себя равноправный и расширенный
           доступ к техническому и профессиональному образованию и подготовке и
           высшему образованию и научным исследованиям, уделяя должное внимание
           обеспечению качества. Помимо этого, важное значение имеет наличие гибких
           траекторий обучения, а также признание, сертификация и аккредитация
           знаний, навыков и компетенций, приобретенных в рамках неформального и



48   Инчхонская декларация
    информального обучения. Мы также обязуемся обеспечить приобретение
    всеми молодыми и взрослыми людьми, в особенности девочками и женщинами,
    актуального и признанного уровня владения функциональными навыками
    грамотности и счета и жизненными навыками, а также предоставление им
    возможностей обучения, образования и подготовки для взрослых. Мы далее
    обязуемся развивать науку, технологии и инновации. Необходимо использовать
    информационные и коммуникационные технологии (ИКТ) для укрепления
    образовательных систем, распространения знаний, обеспечения доступа к
    информации, качественного и эффективного обучения и более эффективного
    предоставления услуг.

11.	 Кроме того, мы с серьезной обеспокоенностью отмечаем, что сегодня
     значительная часть не охваченного школьным образованием населения
     проживает в затронутых конфликтами районах и что кризисы, насилие и
     нападения на образовательные учреждения, а также стихийные бедствия и
     пандемии продолжают подрывать образование и развитие во всем мире. Мы
     обязуемся развивать более инклюзивные, оперативные и устойчивые системы
     образования для удовлетворения потребностей детей, молодежи и взрослых,
     проживающих в таких условиях, в том числе внутренне перемещенных лиц
     и беженцев. Мы заявляем о необходимости предоставления образования
     в безопасной, благоприятной и здоровой среде обучения, свободной от
     насилия. Мы рекомендуем разрабатывать необходимые меры реагирования на
     эти кризисы, включающие в себя чрезвычайные меры реагирования, а также
     восстановление и реконструкцию, повышать эффективность координации
     таких мер на национальном, региональном и мировом уровнях, а также
     развивать потенциал комплексных мер по уменьшению опасности и смягчению
     рисков с тем, чтобы обеспечить непрерывность обучения в условиях
     конфликтов, чрезвычайных и постконфликтных ситуаций и первичного периода
     восстановления.




                      Образование-2030: Oбеспечение всеобщего инклюзивного и справедливого
                                                                                              49
                              качественного образования и обучения на протяжении всей жизни
      Осуществление нашей общей
      повестки дня
      12.	 Мы подтверждаем, что основная ответственность за успешное осуществление
           этой повестки дня лежит на правительствах. Мы преисполнены решимости
           создавать правовые и политические рамки, способствующие обеспечению
           подотчетности и прозрачности, а также содействовать организации управления
           на основе широкого участия и заключению согласованных партнерств на
           всех уровнях и во всех секторах, а также отстаивать право на учас­ тие всех
           заинтересованных сторон.

      13.	 Мы призываем к укреплению международного и регионального сотрудничества,
           совместной работы, координации и мониторинга осуществления повестки
           дня в области образования на основе сбора данных, анализа и отчетности на
           страновом уровне в рамках региональных структур, механизмов и стратегий.

      14.	 Мы признаем, что успех повестки дня в области образования до 2030 г. зависит
           от рациональной политики и планирования, а также от наличия эффективных
           механизмов ее осуществления. Очевидно, что содержащиеся в предлагаемой
           ЦУР 4 задачи невозможно решить без значительного и целенаправленного
           увеличения финансирования, особенно в тех странах, которые наиболее
           далеки от обеспечения качественного образования для всех на всех уровнях.
           В связи с этим мы преисполнены решимости увеличивать государственные
           расходы на образование в зависимости от ситуации в каждой конкретной
           стране и настоятельно призываем следовать международным и региональным
           целевым показателям выделения на нужды образования не менее 4-6%
           валового внутреннего продукта и/или не менее 15-20% общих государственных
           расходов.

      15.	 Отмечая важность сотрудничества в области развития, дополняющего
           финансовый вклад правительств, мы призываем развитые страны, традиционных
           и новых доноров, страны со средним уровнем доходов и международные
           финансовые механизмы увеличить финансирование образования и поддержать
           осуществление данной повестки дня в соответствии с потребностями
           и приоритетами различных стран.      Мы признаем исключительно важное
           значение выполнения всех обязательств в отношении официальной помощи
           в целях развития (ОПР), в том числе принятого многими развитыми странами
           обязательства достичь к 2015   г. целевого показателя выделения по линии



50   Инчхонская декларация
    ОПР развивающимся странам 0,7 процента валового национального
    продукта (ВНП). Мы настоятельно призываем те развитые страны, которые
    еще не сделали этого, предпринять конкретные дополнительные усилия
    для достижения в соответствии с принятыми ими обязательствами целевого
    показателя в 0,7 процента ВНП на цели ОПР развивающимся странам. Мы
    также обязуемся увеличивать поддержку, выделяемую наименее развитым
    странам. Помимо этого, мы признаем важность использования всех ресурсов,
    которые потенциально можно направить на поддержку реализации права на
    образование. Мы рекомендуем повышать эффективность помощи за счет более
    эффективной координации и согласования и осуществлять в приоритетном
    порядке выделение финансирования и оказание помощи оставленным без
    внимания подсекторам и странам с низким уровнем доходов. Мы также
    рекомендуем значительно увеличить поддержку образования в условиях
    гуманитарных и затяжных кризисов. Мы приветствуем саммит по образованию в
    интересах развития, который пройдет в Осло (июль 2015 г.), а также призываем
    Конференцию по финансированию развития, организуемую в Аддис-Абебе,
    поддержать предлагаемую ЦУР 4.

16.	 Мы призываем соорганизаторов ВФО-2015, в особенности ЮНЕСКО, а также
     всех партнеров оказать индивидуальное и коллективное содействие странам
     в осуществлении повестки дня в области образования до 2030 г., включающее
     в себя техническое консультирование, развитие национального потенциала и
     оказание финансовой поддержки, на основе их соответствующих мандатов и
     сравнительных преимуществ, а также обеспечения взаимодополняемости. С
     этой целью мы поручаем ЮНЕСКО на основе консультаций с государствами-
     членами, соорганизаторами ВФО-2015 и другими партнерами разработать
     соответствующий глобальный координационный механизм. Признавая, что
     Глобальное партнерство в интересах образования выступает в качестве
     многосторонней платформы финансирования образования в целях оказания
     содействия осуществлению повестки дня в соответствии с потребностями и
     приоритетами различных стран, мы рекомендуем включить его в такой будущий
     глобальный координационный механизм.

17.	 Мы также поручаем ЮНЕСКО в качестве специализированного учреждения
     Организации Объединенных Наций по вопросам образования продолжать
     выполнять свою руководящую и координирующую роль в деле осуществления
     повестки дня в области образования до 2030 г. в соответствии с ее мандатом,
     в частности, вести информационно-пропагандистскую работу по обеспечению
     политической приверженности, содействовать диалогу по вопросам политики,



                       Образование-2030: Oбеспечение всеобщего инклюзивного и справедливого
                                                                                               51
                               качественного образования и обучения на протяжении всей жизни
          обмену знаниями и разработке стандартов, осуществлять мониторинг
          прогресса в области достижения связанных с образованием целей, приглашать
          заинтересованные стороны на мировом, региональном и национальном
          уровнях к руководству осуществлением повестки дня, а также действовать
          в качестве координатора по вопросам образования в общей структуре
          координации ЦУР.

      18.	 Мы преисполнены решимости разрабатывать всеобъемлющие национальные
           системы мониторинга и оценки для сбора качественной информации в
           поддержку разработки политики и управления образовательными системами,
           а также обеспечения подотчетности. Мы также предлагаем соорганизаторам
           и партнерам ВФО-2015 поддержать развитие потенциала в области сбора
           данных, их анализа и подготовки отчетности на страновом уровне. Страны
           должны стремиться к улучшению качества, совершенствованию степени
           разбивки данных и обеспечению своевременности представления отчетов
           Статистическому институту ЮНЕСКО. Мы также предлагаем продолжить
           выпуск Всемирного доклада по мониторингу программы «Образование
           для всех» в формате независимого Всемирного доклада по мониторингу
           образования (ВДМО), подготовкой и публикацией которого будет заниматься
           ЮНЕСКО, и использовать его в качестве механизма мониторинга и отчетности
           по предлагаемой ЦУР 4 и по вопросам образования в других предлагаемых
           ЦУР в рамках будущего механизма мониторинга и обзора осуществления
           предлагаемых ЦУР.

      19.	 Мы обсудили и утвердили ключевые элементы Рамок действий повестки
           дня в области образования до 2030 г. С учетом итогов саммита Организации
           Объединенных Наций, на котором должна быть принята повестка дня в
           области развития на период после 2015 г. (Нью-Йорк, сентябрь 2015 г.), а
           также ожидаемых результатов Третьей международной конференции по
           финансированию развития (Аддис-Абеба, июль 2015 г.), окончательный вариант
           Рамок будет представлен для принятия и оглашен в ходе специального
           совещания высокого уровня, организуемого параллельно с 38-й сессией
           Генеральной конференции ЮНЕСКО в ноябре 2015 г. Мы заявляем о полной
           приверженности выполнению этих Рамок после их принятия, что позволит
           странам и партнерам использовать их и ориентироваться на них для
           обеспечения осуществления нашей повестки дня.




52   Инчхонская декларация
20.	 Настоящая Инчхонская декларация, опирающаяся на наследие Джомтьена и
     Дакара, является для всех нас историческим обязательством, направленным на
     изменение жизни людей на основе новой концепции образования посредством
     решительных и новаторских действий, призванных способствовать достижению
     нашей масштабной цели к 2030 г.


                                                            Инчхон, Республика Корея,

                               качественного образования и обучения на протяжении всей жизни
“
                    Данная Декларация представляет собой огромный шаг вперед.
                    Она отражает нашу решимость обеспечить всем детям, молодежи
                    и взрослым доступ к знаниям и навыкам, которые им необходимы
                    для достойной жизни, реализации своего потенциала и участия в
                    жизни общества - как ответственных граждан глобального мира. Она
                    призывает правительства предоставлять возможности получения
                    образования в течение всей жизни, с тем чтобы люди могли
                    продолжать свой рост и не оказывались в стороне в результате
                    перемен. Она подтверждает, что образование как основное право
                    человека является ключом к всеобщему миру и устойчивому
                    развитию.
                                                                      Ирина Бокова,
                                                     Генеральный директор ЮНЕСКО


                    Образование является ключом к лучшей жизни для каждого ребенка
                    и основой любого прочного общества, но слишком много детей по-
                    прежнему остается в стороне. Для реализации всех наших целей
                    в области развития нам нужно обеспечить, чтобы каждый ребенок
                    ходил в школу и учился.

                    Чтобы покончить с бедностью, укрепить общее благоденствие и
                    достичь целей устойчивого развития, мы должны использовать опыт
                    и знания в области финансирования развития для осуществления
                    радикальных перемен. Нам необходимо объединить усилия, чтобы

                    Совместными усилиями мы должны поощрять и защищать право

54   Инчхонская декларация
В сегодняшнем мире знание является источником силы, а
образование расширяет возможности. Оно является неотъемлемой
частью формулы, определяющей развитие. Оно имеет внутреннюю
ценность, выходящую далеко за пределы экономических понятий –
давать людям возможность определять свою собственную судьбу. 
Именно поэтому возможность получить образование является
ключом к содействию человеческому развитию.
                            Элен Кларк, Администратор ПРООН


Инчхонская Декларация выражает нашу приверженность
образованию без дискриминации, признание важности гендерного
равенства и расширения прав и возможностей женщин для
устойчивого развития. Она воплощает собой уникальную
возможность действовать сообща, на межсекторной основе для
реализации задачи программы «Образование для всех» по созданию
мирных, справедливых и равноправных обществ. Мир, в котором
все люди равны, можно построить, только если наше образование
формирует такой подход в глобальном масштабе.

2030年教育：
实现包容和公平的全民优质教
育和终身学习




序言
1.	 我们，各国部长、代表团团长和成员、各机构首脑、多边和双边组
  织负责人、民间社会、教师职业、青年和私营部门的代表，应联合
  国教科文组织总干事的邀请，于2015年5月汇聚大韩民国仁川参加
  2015年世界教育论坛（WEF，2015）。我们感谢大韩民国政府和人民
  主办本次重要活动以及本次会议的共同召集者联合国儿童基金会、
  世界银行、联合国人口基金、开发计划署、妇女署和难民事务高级
  专员办事处做出的贡献。我们真诚赞赏联合国教科文组织倡议并牵
  头召集了此次关于2030年教育的里程碑式的活动。

2.	 借此历史性盛会，我们重申1990年在宗滴恩启动、2000年在达喀尔
  重申的世界范围全民教育运动的愿景，它是近几十年来最为重要的
  教育承诺，并且有助于推动了教育领域的重大进步。我们还重申对
  受教育权及其与其它人权相互关系做出规定的许多国际和地区性人
  权条约体现的愿景和政治意愿。我们承认付出了努力，然而，我们
  还极为关切地认识到我们尚远未实现全民教育。




                2030年教育：实现包容和公平的全民优质教育和终身学习   59
     3.	 我们忆及经广泛磋商制定并于2014年全球全民教育会议所通过、对
       可持续发展目标开放工作组拟议的具体教育目标提供了有益启发的
       《马斯喀特协定》。我们还忆及地区部长级2015年后教育会议的成
       果，并注意到2015年《全民教育全球监测报告》和《全民教育地区
       综合报告》的调查结果。我们认识到“全球教育第一倡议”的重要
       贡献以及各国政府以及地区、政府间和非政府组织为促成教育方面
       的政治承诺所发挥的作用。

     4.	 我们总结了2000年以来在实现全民教育目标和与教育有关的千年发
       展目标方面取得的进展以及吸取的经验教训，审议了仍然存在的挑
       战，讨论了拟议的2030年教育议程及行动框架和为实现议程而提出
       的未来优先事项和战略，我们通过本宣言。




     走向2030年：新的教育愿景
     5.	 我们认识到教育作为发展的主要驱动力以及它在实现其它拟议的可
       持续发展目标方面的重要作用，我们的愿景是通过教育改变生活。
       我们怀着紧迫意识，承诺要制定一个全面的、有雄心、有追求、不
       放弃任何人的单一和更新的教育议程。这一新愿景完全体现在了拟
       议的可持续发展目标4（ “为所有人确保包容、公平的优质教育并促
       进终身学习机会” ）及其相关具体目标之中。新愿景既具有变革性
       也具有普遍性，致力于全民教育议程和与教育有关的千年发展目标
       的“未竞事业”，应对全球和国家的教育挑战。它吸取了人文主义
       的教育和发展观，其基础是人权和尊严，社会正义，包容，保护，
       文化、语言和民族多样性，共担责任和义务。我们重申教育是一项
       公益事业、基本人权和确保实现其它权利的基础。教育对于和平、
       宽容、自我实现和可持续发展至关重要。我们认识到教育是实现充
       分就业和消除贫穷的关键。我们将从终身学习的角度，将工作重心
       放在获得、公平和包容、质量和学习成果上。




60   仁川宣言
6.	 过去十五年，我们在扩大 教育机 会方面取得了重大进步，我们将再
 接再厉，确保提供十二年免费、公立、公平、优质、学有所获的中
 小学教育，其中至少九年为义务教育。我们还鼓励提供至少一年的
 免费、义务、优质的学前教育，让所有儿童接受优质的幼儿发展、
 保育和教育。我们还承诺为广大失学儿童和少年提供满意的教育和
 培训机会，我们需要立即行动起来，有的放矢，持之以恒，确保所
 有儿童入学读书。

7.	 在教育领域并通过教育手段实现 包容和公平 是变革性教育议程的基
 石。所以，我们承诺反对在获取、参与和学习成果方面一切形式的
 排斥和边缘化、不平衡和不平等现象。除非所有人都达到目标，否
 则任何教育目标都不能被视为已经达到。我们承诺对教育政策进行
 必要改变，将工作重点放在最弱势者，尤其是残疾人方面，确保不
 落一人。

8.	 我们认识 到性别平等 对于实现全民教育权利的重要性。因此我们承
 诺支持注重性别的政策、规划和学习环境，将性别问题纳入教师培
 训和课程中，消除校园性别歧视和暴力。

9.	 我们承诺提供 优质教育 并改善学习成果，这需要加强教育投入、教
 育过程和成果评估，并建立衡量进展的机制。我们将确保教师和教
 育者在资金充足、有效和高效管理的系统内增强能力、足额招聘、
 享有良好的培训和职业资格、积极进取并获得支持。优质教育培养
 创造力和知识，使人获得识字计算的基本技能、分析和解决问题的
 能力以及其它高水平的认知、人际和社交能力。通过可持续发展教
 育（ESD）和全球公民教育（GCED），优质教育还培养让公民过上
 健康圆满的生活、做出明智决策、应对当地和全球挑战的技能、价
 值观和态度。在这方面，我们强烈支持实施2014年在爱知县名古屋
 举办的联合国教科文组织世界可持续发展教育大会上启动的《全球
 可持续发展教育行动计划》。我们还强调人权教育和培训对于实现
 2015年后可持续发展议程的重要性。




               2030年教育：实现包容和公平的全民优质教育和终身学习   61
     10.	 我们承诺在所有环境中以及在各级教育中促进优质的全民 终身学习
       机会 。它包括公平获取和扩大优质的职业技术教育与培训以及高等
       教育和研究，并适当注重质量保证。此外，提供灵活的学习途径，
       承认、验证和认证通过非正规和非正式教育获得的知识、技能和能
       力也很重要。我们还承诺确保所有青年和成人，特别是女童和妇女
       达到一定的、公认的实用识字和计算的熟练水平，获得生活技能，
       向他们提供成人学习、教育和培训的机会。我们还承诺加强科学、
       技术和创新。必须利用信息通信技术来加强教育系统、知识传播、
       信息获取、学习质量和效果，并提供更加有效的服务。

     11.	 此外，我们深为关切地注意到，今天世界上的失学儿童很大部分生
       活在受冲突影响的地区，而且教育机构遭受的危机、暴力和攻击以
       及自然灾害和流行疾病继续在全球干扰着教育和发展。我们承诺发
       展更加包容、更具反应力和复原力的教育系统，以满足这些局势下
       的儿童、青年和成人的需求，包括境内流离失所者和难民的需求。
       我们强调需要在安全、友好、有保障、无暴力的学习环境中施行教
       育。我们建议开展从紧急干预直到恢复和重建的适当的危机应对行
       动，更好地协调国家、地区和全球应对行动，开发全面减少和减轻
       风险的能力，在冲突、紧急、冲突后和恢复之初局势下确保教育的
       继续进行。




     实施我们的共同议程
     12.	 我们重申，成功实施该议程的首要责任在于各国政府。我们决心制
       定促进问责制和透明度、参与式治理和各级各部门协调伙伴关系的
       法律和政策框架，维护所有有关各方的参与权利。

     13.	 我们呼吁在国家层面数据搜集、分析和报告基础上，在地区性机
       构、机制和战略框架内，在全球和地区层面开展实施教育议程的有
       力的协作、合作、协调和监测。



62   仁川宣言
14.	 我们认识到2030年教育议程的成功需要合理的政策和规划以及有效
  的执行安排。也很显然，特别是在实现各级优质全民教育方面差距
  最大的国家，如果不大幅度、有针对性地增加资金，拟议的可持续
  发展目标4的蓝图就无法实现。所以我们决心根据各国的具体情况，
  增加对教育的公共支出，敦促遵守国际和地区基准，即将国内生产
  总值的至少4%-6%和/或公共总支出的至少15%-20%用于教育。

15.	 我们注意到发展合作对于补充政府投入的重要性，呼吁发达国家、
  传统和新兴捐助者、中等收入国家和国际筹资机制根据各国需求和
  优先事项增加教育供资，支持议程的实施。我们认为兑现所有官
  方发展援助（ODA）承诺至关重要，包括许多发达国家做出的向发
  展中国家提供占其国民生产总值（GNP）0.7%作为官方发展援助的
  承诺。我们敦促尚未采取行动的发达国家按其承诺作出进一步具体
  努力，实现向发展中国家提供占国民生产总值0.7%的官方发展援助
  的目标。我们还承诺增加对最不发达国家的支持。我们还认识到释
  放所有潜在资源支持教育权利的重要性。我们建议通过更好地协调
  和统一来改善援助的效益，并优先向受忽视的分部门和低收入国家
  提供资金和援助。我们还建议大幅增加对长期人道主义危机下的
  教育的支持力度。我们欢迎奥斯陆教育促发展峰会（2015年7月）
  的举办，呼吁亚的斯亚贝巴发展筹资会议支持拟议的可持续发展
  目标4。

16.	 我们呼吁2015年世界教育论坛的共同召集机构，特别是联合国教科
  文组织，以及所有合作伙伴，根据各自职责和比较优势并利用它们
  的互补性，通过提供技术咨询、培养国家能力以及提供财政支持，
  各自或共同地支持各国实施2030年教育议程。为此，我们委托联合
  国教科文组织与会员国、2015年世界教育论坛共同召集机构和其它
  合作伙伴磋商，建立适当的全球协调机制。我们认为全球教育伙伴
  关系机制是根据各国需要和优先事项支持实施议程的教育多方筹资
  平台，我们建议把它纳入这一未来的全球协调机制之中。




                 2030年教育：实现包容和公平的全民优质教育和终身学习   63
     17.	 我们还委托联合国教科文组织作为联合国主管教育的专门机构继续
       履行其牵头和协调2030年教育议程的职责，尤其通过以下方式：宣
       传兑现政治承诺；促进政策对话、知识共享和标准制定；监测实现
       教育具体目标的进展；召集全球、地区和国家有关方面指导议程实
       施工作；在可持续发展目标的总体协调架构内发挥教育协调中心的
       功能。

     18.	 我们决定建立综合性的国家监测和评估系统，为政策制定和教育系
       统管理提供合理依据，并确保问责制。我们还恳请2015年世界教育
       论坛的共同召集机构和合作伙伴支持各国加强在数据搜集、分析和
       报告方面的能力。各国应努力改进数据的质量和分列层次，及时向
       联合国教科文组织统计研究所报告。我们还要求《全民教育全球监
       测报告》继续成为一份由联合国教科文组织主持和出版的独立的《
       全球教育监测报告》（GEMR），在为了监测和审查拟议的可持续发
       展目标的实施情况而将要建立的机制中，作为监测和报告拟议的可
       持续发展目标4和其它拟议的与教育有关的可持续发展目标的机制。

     19.	 我们讨论并商定了《2030年教育行动框架》的主要内容。考虑到将
       要通过2015年后发展议程的联合国峰会（纽约，2015年9月）和第三
       次发展筹资国际会议（亚的斯亚贝巴，2015年7月）的成果，行动
       框架的最终版本将在与2015年11月联合国教科文组织大会第三十八
       届会议平行举行的特别高层会议上提交通过并启动。一旦行动框架
       获得通过，我们将全力付诸实施，为各国和合作伙伴提供启发和指
       导，以实现我们的议程。

     20.	 承自宗滴恩和达喀尔之基础，本《仁川宣言》是我们所有各方做出
       的一项历史性承诺，旨在通过新的教育愿景，采取大胆和创新行动
       来改变我们的生活，在2030年实现我们的宏伟目标。

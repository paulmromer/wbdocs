                                                   Abstract

The portability of social benefits is gaining importance given the increasing share of
individuals working at least part of their life outside their home country. Bilateral social
security agreements (BSSAs) are considered a crucial approach to establishing portability, but
the functionality and effectiveness of these agreements have not yet been investigated; thus,
important guidance for policy makers in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving countries is
missing. To shed light on how BSSAs work in practice, this document is part of a series
providing information and lessons from studies of portability in four diverse but comparable
migration corridors: Austria-Turkey, Germany-Turkey, Belgium-Morocco, and France-
Morocco. A summary policy paper draws broader conclusions and offers overarching policy
recommendations.
This report looks specifically into the working of the Belgium-Morocco corridor. Findings
suggest that the BSSA is broadly working well, with no main substantive issues in the area of
pension portability, except for the nonportability of the noncontributory top-up pension and
issues with widows’ pensions in case of divorce and repudiation, and in health care, the
pending introduction of portable health care for retirees with single pensions from the other
country. Process issues around information provision in Morocco and automation of
information exchange are recognized.

  The study was initiated at the World Bank International Labor Migration team at the Marseille Center for
Mediterranean Integration and led by Manjula Luthria—now back at headquarters in Washington, DC, and
working as international labor mobility team leader in the Global Practice on Social Protection and Labor.
Robert Holzmann served as conceptualizer and senior research advisor, and Axel Boersch-Supan and Ulrich
Becker (both Munich), Florence Legros (Paris), and Bernd Marin (Vienna) assisted in supervising the teams and
offered guidance in the study development. All corridor studies went through the Bank’s internal review
process.
The study profited enormously from interviews with representatives from public and social security
administrations and migrants’ nongovernmental organizations in Morocco and Belgium. Their experience and
views helped the team better understand the complexity of issues and task at hand. All errors are, however,
the authors’ own.

 1. Motivation, Purpose, and Key Results

The share of individuals residing outside their home country amounted, in 2015, to 3.3
percent of world population and is rising (United Nations 2015). Non-European Union (EU)
citizens residing in EU-28 in 2013 amounted to 4 percent of the EU population; the share of
the foreign-born population in 2013 was 7 percent, totaling over 11 percent of foreign
residents (Eurostat 2015). While impressive, these figures mask the much larger share of
individuals who will spend part of their working life outside their home country. For the EU,
the future scope of current workers with foreign residency experience is estimated at around
20 percent (Holzmann 2015).

During their stay abroad, international migrants often acquire rights to current social benefits
that they want to export to their families left behind or to future social benefits—particularly
old-age pensions and health care when old—that they want to take with them when they
move. It is this phenomenon that gives rise to the issue of portability of social benefits, that
is, the ability to preserve, maintain, and transfer vested social security rights independent of
nationality and country of residence.

Transborder portability of social benefits may be achieved in various ways. The most
prominent way is bilateral social security agreements (BSSAs), in which two countries agree
on which social security benefits they will offer mutual access to migrant workers and their
families in the residence and home country. BSSAs are the norm between most Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries but are used much less
frequently between developed and developing countries even when a major migration
corridor exists. Only about 23 percent of international migrants profit from BSSAs and their
functioning has not yet been systematically investigated.

This country corridor paper is part of a project to explore the working of BSSAs in four popular
migration corridors—Morocco’s agreements with Belgium and France, and Turkey’s
agreements with Austria and Germany. Each corridor study follows the same structure, is




                                               1
based on the same methodological approach, and draws country-specific conclusions. Each
paper offers a qualitative assessment based on available data and information, including
interviews with responsible parties in social security institutions and migrants’ organizations.
A summary policy paper was prepared as part of the project and is best read in parallel.

Findings suggest that the BSSA is broadly working well, with no main substantive issues in the
area of pension portability, except for the nonportability of the noncontributory top-up
pension and issues with widows’ pensions in case of divorce and repudiation, and in health
care the pending introduction of portable health care for retirees with single pensions from
the other country. Process issues around information provision in Morocco and automation
of information exchange to speed up benefit processing are recognized and are beginning to
be addressed.

    2. International Migration and Benefit Portability

In 2015, 244 million people worldwide, or 3.3 percent of the global population, were
international migrants, that is, they resided outside of their home country (United Nations
2015). The majority of migrants are from countries in the global south. They are slightly more
likely to migrate to other countries in the south than to countries in the north (82.3 million
versus 81.9 million migrants, respectively, though as a whole, developed countries are home
to a larger number of global migrants [United Nations Department of Economic and Social
Affairs and the OECD 2013]). The reasons for initial migration can include humanitarian or
political purposes, family reunification or education, or very importantly, economic
necessities and incentives, though movement often occurs between these categories (for
example, educational migrants may seek employment in their host country after
graduation).1

Contributing to rising economic and other migration is the strengthening of areas of economic
integration throughout the world, with prominent examples including the European
Economic Area, 2 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, MERCOSUR in Latin America,
and CARICOM in the Caribbean. As workers increasingly spend a portion of their careers
outside their country of birth, the number of workers acquiring pension insurance periods in
more than one country is on the rise (PVA 2013). Consequently, individuals and policy makers
are grappling with how to make acquired benefits portable between two or more countries.
As defined in Cruz (2004), portability is the ability to preserve, maintain, and transfer vested
social security rights independent of nationality and country of residence. It is predominantly
north-north migrants who enjoy access to and portability of social protection benefits,
whereas migrants moving within low-income regions, where formal social protection is less
developed, have little access to portability.

                                                       3
At its most successful, portability should render labor mobility, labor supply, and residency
decisions independent of social benefit considerations. Though little definitive research exists
on how portability, or the lack thereof, affects labor mobility, the inability to transfer acquired
rights is presumed to influence labor market decisions, as well as the capacity of individuals
and families to adequately manage social risks and life cycle planning (Holzmann and Koettl
2012). If benefits are not portable, individuals may decide not to migrate or return or may
offer labor in the informal sector instead, with implications for the overall tax revenues and
economic growth of both the host and home countries. Furthermore, insufficient portability
conflicts with individuals’ rights to social protection, as enshrined in various international
agreements. 3

A variety of methods are used to ensure portability of benefits, including multilateral
agreements, which establish a general framework for a group of countries, and bilateral
agreements between individual countries that offer specificities. The most elaborate
regulations on a multilateral level are the EU decrees 4 that establish the principles of design
and implementation of portability (Holzmann and Koettl 2012; Jousten 2012; Jacob 2015).
Social security portability rights within the EU are coordinated primarily through Regulation
(EC) No. 883/2004 and Implementing Regulation (EC) No. 987/2009, which update EU
provisions on social security coordination that have existed since 1958 (European
Commission 2014). While maintaining the sovereignty of national social security systems,
these regulations and their predecessors establish principles of social security coverage
within EU-28, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland and ensure benefit portability
and totalization of employment periods in different countries for vesting purposes. BSSAs
specify multilateral agreements, where they exist, or form the basic document that regulates
portability between two sovereign countries but with widely varying range of content and

  Including, among other things, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic on Social and Cultural Rights.

  Strictly speaking, within the EU there exists no multilateral agreement. There are respective EU decrees that
represent supranational EU law.




                                                       4
coverage across countries. Both multilateral and bilateral agreements are more common
between high-income countries, as seen in table 2.1.

Though these agreements are presumed to offer the best guarantee of portability of acquired
social benefits, little evidence exists of how they function in practice. To fill this information
gap, the World Bank International Labor Migration team at the Marseille Center for
Mediterranean Integration launched a study examining the implementation of BSSAs in four
popular migration corridors—Morocco’s agreements with Belgium and France and Turkey’s
agreements with Austria and Germany. This study examined the provisions in these four
agreements and their evolution over time and collected data and information from social
security institutions and experts, policy makers, and migrants’ associations who provided
their insights on BSSAs’ effectiveness in promoting portability.

To allow for comparability of outcomes, the study assessed each of these four BSSAs against
the same three criteria: 5

           •    Fairness for individuals: A successful portability arrangement will not result in a
                benefit disadvantage for migrants or their dependents (for example, via lower
                pensions or gaps in health care coverage).

           •    Fiscal fairness for countries: Neither the host nor home country should
                experience a negative fiscal effect or an unfair fiscal advantage at the expense of
                the other country.

           •    Bureaucratic efficiency: Administrative provisions should not cause a
                bureaucratic burden for the institutions involved and should be accessible to
                migrants.

This document summarizes detailed information on the Belgium-Morocco BSSA. Findings
from the other three corridor studies can be found in parallel documents in this series.
Common conceptual issues and broader policy lessons emerging from all four corridor studies
are presented in a document entitled ‘Do Bilateral Social Security Agreements Deliver on the
Portability of Pensions and Health Care Benefits? A Summary Policy Paper on Four Migration
Corridors Between EU and Non-EU Member States’ (Holzmann 2016). This summary policy
document is best read jointly with a corridor study.

Each corridor document in the series starts with a summary of the applied methodology to
provide a framework for further research on other corridors that will add to the knowledge
base on BSSAs. The next sections provide profiles of migration, relevant social protection
programs, and the BSSA for both countries in each respective corridor. A further section
assesses the BSSA against the three criteria outlined above. Each document’s final section
presents key findings for the corridor and outlines broader policy considerations.

Corridor studies are a useful tool for reviewing and comparing BSSAs to inform policy makers
and social policy researchers on issues, effectiveness, and areas for improvement. They
provide the opportunity to delve in substantial detail into the functioning of one particular
BSSA while providing a comparative review of the agreement against a common set of
criteria. For the present study, a multinational team of social security and migration experts
developed a standard methodological framework for studying and measuring the extent to
which BSSAs meet the three criteria (individual fairness, fiscal fairness, and minimal
bureaucratic burden) introduced in the previous section.

BSSAs in four corridors were chosen for this study and the selection of corridors was guided
by considerations of (a) proximity of sending country pairs, to allow for better comparability
of differences and (b) diversity with regard to experience. The Austria/Germany-Turkey
agreements are considered mature and advanced, as they included health benefits from the
beginning. The Belgium/France-Morocco agreements started with a more modest scope and
were only recently reformed to include health care benefits.

The research focused on each BSSA’s effectiveness in facilitating portability of pensions (old-
age, survivor’s, and disability) and health care benefits, as these are the core (or only) benefits
typically covered by BSSAs between developing and developed countries. Thus, the selected
corridors provide a useful starting point for understanding the functioning of BSSAs, as their
scope of coverage varies somewhat and over time, as do the history and relationship between
the signatories, but the principles on which they are based are largely similar. Furthermore,
one of the signatory governments (Morocco) specifically requested an analysis of the
functionality of its BSSAs.

The corridor study approach comprised preparation of three main sets of background
documents before the evaluation of each BSSA against the three criteria. The first set of
documents concerns country and corridor profiles on relevant topics. The second set relates




                                                7
to development of a relevant dataset and selection of key performance indicators. The final
set contains the minutes of in-depth interviews with key participants in the BSSA process.

For the first set of documents, the respective researchers established four types of profile
documents relevant to the BSSA:

       (a) A migration profile that sketches migration stocks and flows and key labor
            market characteristics for the corridor countries

       (b) Social insurance profiles of each corridor country, with a focus on portability-
            relevant contingencies

       (c) A profile of the BSSA, including benefits covered, rules/instruments applied to
            achieve portability, rules of coordination, motivation for the BSSA, trends and
            changes, and special issues

       (d) A profile of each country’s national social insurance institutions and their
            administrative support for BSSAs, with a focus on administrative arrangements
            and processes (for example, information and communication technology
            support, application, decision, and disbursement), compared to national
            applicants and international best practice

Work on the second set of documents started with identification of a wish-list of data
considered desirable and relevant for the analysis, with the intent to develop a results matrix
that would bring together the BSSA’s objectives and outcomes (as measured against the three
criteria) with the related inputs, including the BSSA’s regulations. It soon became apparent
that the desired data were extremely sparse and often simply not available or comparable
across countries, impeding researchers’ ability to implement this approach in full. For
example, most countries’ data do not distinguish whether host country nationals living
abroad (to whom pensions are distributed) are return migrants or temporary/seasonal
residents (snowbirds). Further, the level of naturalization across all corridors is remarkable,




                                              8
albeit not identical. All else constant, different levels of naturalization lead to different
numbers of people remaining with a foreign passport, while the number of those born abroad
is the same. As some countries do not allow collection of information about those born
abroad, determining who receives a pension abroad gets complicated. As a result, the initial
objective to develop and use key performance indicators needed to be dropped. 6

The third set of documents consists of in-depth interviews that were undertaken with two
types of participants in the BSSA process: (a) representatives from ministries and/or social
security institutions in charge of BSSA implementation and design and (b) nongovernmental
organizations involved in the topic, such as migrants’ associations. This qualitative research
proved very productive to gain major insights into substance, process, and issues around
portability and BSSAs. While the interviews are referred to in the corridor studies, for reasons
of confidentiality they cannot be made public.

Based on these country-specific documents and a first joint assessment of BSSAs in the east
corridor (Austria and Germany with Turkey) and in the west corridor (Belgium and France
with Morocco), 7 the individual corridor studies were prepared.

The applied methodology would have profited from a benchmark against which each corridor
could have been assessed. Such a benchmark could have been the best or an average BSSA
corridor between two EU countries or the best or an average south-north corridor between
an emerging and a highly developed country. Unfortunately, none of these benchmarks are
available and the project resources did not allow preparation of one. It may be conjectured
that, while internal EU BSSA corridors work well, it is far from clear that each of them would
get an A+ under each of the three proposed criteria.




6
  The project participants strongly hope that in a future BSSA assessment, data will be available that will allow
not only the elaboration of a full results matrix but also a rigorous quantitative evaluation.

  For the east corridor, see Fuchs and Elitok (2014). For the west corridor, see Legros et al. (2014) and Wels,
Bensaid, and Legros (2015, in French). For a recent and related corridor experience report for Moroccan and
Turkish migrants in Belgium, see Gsir, Mandin, and Mescoli (2015).




                                                        9
Despite all the restrictions in the implementation of the methodology, to the authors’
knowledge this is the first study of its kind, and the data and lessons learned should provide
a useful addition to the understanding of BSSAs and benefits portability. It is hoped that the
research methodology will be applied to other corridors with appropriate adjustments to test
the findings’ resonance and explore their broader applicability.

 4. Size, Composition, and Labor Market Participation of Migrants
      in the Belgium-Morocco Corridor

  4.1.   Moroccan Migration to Belgium

Moroccan immigration to Belgium has a long history. It began during the World War I, and
flows grew significantly in the early 1960s in the period leading up to the signing of the first
bilateral labor agreement between Belgium and Morocco (Ouali 2004). This bilateral labor
agreement facilitated the recruitment of workers in the booming Belgian industrial economy
(Frennet-De Keyser 2003). Between 1964 and 1974, 40,000 Moroccans migrated to Belgium
to live and work under the agreement. Early labor migrants were largely from northern
Morocco (Ouali 2004) and were predominantly young males. After the shift toward a family
reunification-based migration policy in 1974, the profile of Moroccan migrants became more
varied and the composition of the overall Moroccan migrant population gradually shifted.

In Belgium, the migration policies of the 1960s and 1970s and jus soli (right of the soil)
citizenship rights resulted in distinct first and second generations of migrants, so the
characterization of Moroccan migrants differs from one period to another. Differentiated
Moroccan generations in Belgium include both the first generation that arrived in the 1960s
(whose children are identified as second generation) and the first generation of more recent
Moroccan immigrants. Thus, a mix of migratory and post-migratory phenomena exists
(Bousetta and Martiniello 2008). In addition, under jus soli, the children and grandchildren of
the first generation that arrived in Belgium almost 50 years ago obtained Belgian nationality
if they were born on Belgian territory and if their parents resided permanently in Belgium.
Statistical analysis of migration phenomena in Belgium is complicated by this naturalization




                                              11
and by a partial prohibition on the collection of statistics based on ethnicity 8 (Rea and Tripier
2008).

    4.2.   Population Size and Composition

    4.2.1. Population Size

As shown in figure 4.1, the stock of Moroccan migrants in Belgium changed substantially
between 1997 and 2007; the number of Moroccan migrants decreased by 40 percent to
approximately 80,000 by 2007 (Direction Générale Emploi et marché du travail 2009).
However, this trend is not the result of a lower migration flow between the two countries.
Between 2001 and 2011, Morocco remained Belgium’s most significant source of migrants
from outside of Europe. Moreover, migration from Morocco to Belgium has risen
continuously in the past 10 years. The apparent gap between the stock of Moroccan migrants
living in Belgium and the flow of Moroccans moving to Belgium is due to a change in the law
on the procedure for naturalization of foreigners legally resident in Belgium in 2000.
Moroccan citizens in Belgium were heavily affected by the change in naturalization policy,
and the decline in Moroccan migrant stocks is directly correlated with an increase in
naturalizations.

 That is, information about the country of birth of persons holding Belgian nationality or the country of birth
of parents. For instance, public data provided by the Banque Carrefour de la Sécurité Sociale give information
about the continent of birth of Belgian people and not about the country.

As shown in table 4.1 and table 4.2, the trend of increasing Moroccan migration to Belgium
has not been accompanied by a concomitant increase in return migration. While overall
migration from Belgium to Morocco increased notably starting in 2010, an increase in return
of those with Moroccan nationality is not evident.

            4.2.2. Population Composition

 With regard to those concerned with old-age pensions and—by extension—portability of
 pensions rights, the Moroccan population older than 60 years living in Belgium comprised
 6,455 women and 4,385 men in 2010. Together, this group represents 13 percent of all
 Moroccan citizens in Belgium (15.7 percent of women and 10.75 percent of men). By contrast,
 23 percent of the total population living in Belgium (including all nationalities) was older than
 60 years (25 percent of women and 21 percent of men) (table 4.3).

Among the Moroccan migrant population, the proportion of men (49.78 percent) is almost
equivalent to that of women (50.21 percent). However, the proportion of women in the
active population (that is, the working-age population ages 18–59) is higher than the
proportion of men (69 percent versus 59 percent) and men dominate the oldest age group
(23 percent of men fall into this group compared to 12 percent of women).

    4.2.3. Return Migration

Due to a prohibition on the collection of data on ethnic origins in Belgium, it is not possible
to distinguish naturalized citizens from individuals born in Belgium; therefore, it is impossible
to accurately calculate the return rate of Moroccan migrants. However, according to
academic research on the Moroccan migration experience, Moroccans living abroad have, for
the most part, intentions to return to Morocco (Lahlou 2006), but returns tend to be lower
than expected. According to Schaeffer (2001), the apparent gap between the desire to return
and reality can be understood as a ‘myth of return’. Several practical and cultural reasons
explain this disconnect, including, among other things, differences in access to and quality of
health care in Morocco and Belgium, the difficulty of reentry to Belgium or loss of
noncontributory benefits, insufficient savings or low pensions, and a lack of relationships in
Morocco.

    4.2.4. Naturalization

As noted above, a modification and simplification of the Belgian naturalization law in 2000
led to a decrease in the foreign population with Moroccan nationality at the beginning of the

21st century. For example, in 1999, 9,133 naturalizations were recorded in Belgium, in
contrast to 21,917 in 2000 and 24,018 in 2001. Figure 4.2 shows the correlation between the
gross number of Moroccan migrants who have acquired Belgian nationality and the gross
number of persons of Moroccan nationality living in Belgium, by sex, between 1999 and 2007.
The peak of naturalization of Moroccan citizens was reached between 2000 and 2003. About
25 percent of total Belgian naturalizations in 2005 and 21.3 percent in 2010 (table 4.5) were
for Moroccan migrants.

 As shown in table 4.6, the percentage of the Moroccan inactive population in Belgium is very
 high: 75.2 percent of women and 39.1 percent of men in 2007 were not integrated in the
 labor market. The rates of inactivity among female Moroccan migrants are particularly high.
 These high rates of inactivity among Moroccans in Belgium are due in part both to their lower
 educational attainment than in the Belgian population as a whole and to discrimination in the
 labor market. However, as good, comparable data on the education level of Moroccan
 workers in Belgium are not available, it is impossible to establish a clear correlation between
 education and employment.

  5. Overview of Pensions and Health Insurance

      5.1.       Belgium

      5.1.1. Pension System Overview

In Belgium, the statutory pension system for employees is based on three elements (Devolder
and Maréchal 2007): a defined benefit scheme, an indexed annuity, and pay-as-you-go
financing. The amount of an employee’s pension is calculated on the basis of three criteria:
the length of service, the remuneration derived according to the pensioner’s career, and the
pensioner’s family situation at the time of retirement. The formula for calculating the pension
is:


                                              × 
                                                                   × ,
                                                    45



where

             •    TW = total wages

             •    RC = revaluation coefficient; RC upgrades the current annual compensation
                  according to the cost of living

             •    FS = family situation

             •    45 is the number of years worked by an employee to achieve a full career

In addition to the retirement pension, workers can access the following types of pensions:

             •    An early retirement pension is possible after a 40-year career and after age 60
                  for men and after a 38-year career and age 60 for women. However, some
                  exceptions are made, essentially related to the drudgery of work or to corporate
                  restructuring.




                                                             18
        •     A minimum entitlement per year worked was implemented to upgrade the
              pension benefits of low-wage workers. This minimum entitlement per year
              concerns employees who have worked at least one-third of a full-time
              employment position for at least 15 years. Under these conditions, the value of
              total wages (TW) taken into account in the pension calculation may be increased
              to match the minimum wage fixed by the law (€22,466 per year in 2015).

        •     A minimum pension guarantee for employed workers is possible when
              remuneration during the career is found to be below a given threshold; under
              certain conditions, the amount of the pension is increased to the minimum
              pension guarantee. More concretely, the minimum amount of the pension
              guarantee can reach €16,844.72 per year (household) or €13,480.03 per year
              (individual) 9, using two criteria:

              o     ‘Strict criterion’: An employee is entitled to calculation under the ‘strict
                    criterion’ if she/he is proven to have spent two-thirds of her/his full career
                    in the scheme for employees. In this case, the minimum pension is
                    calculated by multiplying the minimum amount guaranteed for a full career
                    by the fraction of the career under the scheme for employees. A full
                    (calendar) year is credited only if it has at least 208 full-time equivalent (FTE)
                    days.

              o     ‘Flexible criterion’: An employee is entitled to the ‘flexible criterion’ if
                    she/he is proven to have spent two-thirds of her/his full career in the
                    scheme for employees. In this case, the minimum pension is calculated by
                    multiplying the minimum amount guaranteed for a full career employee by




9
  As for the calculation of the pension, the minimum pension guarantee takes into consideration the family
situation. As a result, the value of the minimum pension differs according to the family structure.




                                                     19
                       the fraction of time spent 10 as an employee. A full (calendar) year is credited
                       only if it has at least 156 FTE days.

           •     A minimum pension guarantee for a mixed career is possible when remuneration
                 during the career is found to be below a given threshold; under certain
                 conditions, the amount of the pension is increased to the minimum pension
                 guarantee. More concretely, the pension guarantee reaches €15,152.82 per year
                 (household) or €11,452.34 per year (individual), again under two criteria:

                 o     ‘Strict criterion’: An employee is entitled to calculation under the ‘strict
                       criterion’ if she/he is proven to have spent two-thirds of her/his full career
                       in the scheme for employees or as a self-worker with a minimum of 208 FTE
                       days per year.

                 o     ‘Flexible criterion’: An employee is entitled to the ‘flexible criterion’ if
                       she/he is proven to have spent two-thirds of her/his full career in the
                       scheme for employees, with a minimum of 156 FTE days per year.

           •     A survivor’s pension is calculated based on the career employment of the
                 deceased spouse/pensioner. Originally, the survivor's pension was reserved for
                 widows, but as of 1984, it is also available to widowers. Under certain conditions
                 it is possible to combine a survivor’s pension and a remunerated activity.

           •     The Guaranteed Income for Seniors (Garantie de revenus aux personnes âgées,
                 GRAPA) is a benefit granted to seniors whose incomes are too low for
                 subsistence. It provides a base amount when the applicant shares the same
                 principal residence with one or more person and a grossed-up amount when the
                 applicant lives alone. Since 2014, a person who resides more than six consecutive
                 months abroad loses his/her right to GRAPA.

In 2012, the budget for the Belgian social security system was almost €66 billion. The three
sources of funding for this system are the following:

        •       Direct contributions on labor from workers and employers, which represented
                approximately 65 percent of revenue for social security in 2012.

        •       A payment from the federal government to the National Social Security
                Organization (Office National de Sécurité Sociale ONSS) and the National Social
                Insurance Institute for the Self-Employed (Institut National d'Assurances Sociales
                pour Travailleurs Indépendants INASTI), guaranteed annually. The share derived
                from public contributions increased from 28 percent to 34 percent between 2000
                and 2009.

        •       In effect as of 1995, a percentage of the receipts from the value-added tax and
                excise duties on tobacco, as well as bequests, loans, and interest capital. The
                share of alternative funding increased considerably from 2000 to 2009, although
                the contribution remains small overall.

Data on the contribution rates to social security from 2008 to 2012 are shown in table 5.1.

       5.1.2. Health Insurance for Pensioners

 Two compulsory contributions provide entitlement to health insurance: the contribution to
 sickness and disability insurance (Assurance maladie invalidité, AMI) and a premium to
 mutual insurances. The monthly contribution to AMI amounts to 3.55 percent of the gross
 monthly pension if the total gross amount of pensions, annuities, and other benefits exceeds
 a threshold set by law. 11 The contribution amount is deducted directly from the gross
 pension. Beneficiaries of a Belgian pension are exempt from contributions to the AMI if they
 reside in a country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland and if they are not
 dependents of Belgium for health care. However, the AMI does not allow health care
 reimbursement. To receive health care reimbursement, Belgian pensioners must be
 registered with a mutual insurance. Mutual insurance guarantees reimbursement (partial or
 total depending on the type of service) for medical and dental care, hospitalization, surgery,
 childbirth, and other services, according to specific pricing based on the type of service.

      5.2.     Morocco

       5.2.1. Pension System Overview

 Morocco’s pension system is based on four pension schemes: three compulsory (covering
 private and public sectors) and managed by public institutions and one complementary and
 only for private sector employees. Employees of the public sector are covered by two defined
 benefit schemes: the Caisse marocaine de retraite (CMR) for civil servants and the military
 and the Regime collectif d’allocation de retraite (RCAR) for contractual workers in the public

 11
      More than €1,413.84 for a single pension rate and more than €1,675.59 for a family rate.




                                                          22
 sector. The pension is calculated as 2.5 percent of the last salary received, raised by the
 number of working years for the CMR, and 2 percent of the average annual salary raised by
 the number of working years for the RCAR (see table 5.3 for the average monthly pension).

 Private sector employees, who represent the majority of active people in Morocco, are
 covered by a basic defined benefit scheme, the Caisse nationale de securité sociale (CNSS)
 and in some cases (approximately 14 percent) by a complementary scheme, the Caisse
 interprofessionnelle marocaine de retraite (CIMR). The CIMR is a scheme by points and
 pensioners can choose between several contribution rates ranging from 3 to 10 percent.
 Pension plan funding is provided by a combination of employer and employee contributions
 on wages. Contributions to sickness, maternity, old-age, and death insurance are paid within
 a ceiling of MAD 6,000 (approximately US$730 12 per month. However, the contributions
 payable toward family benefits are paid on all compensation, without a ceiling limit (table
 5.2).

 CNSS individual pensions are calculated as 50 percent of the average salary of the last eight
 years of employment (no revalorization applies) after a minimum contribution period of 15
 years and a minimum age of 60. For each block of 216 days (one year of work), 1 percent is
 added, up to a maximum rate of 70 percent. Early retirement is allowed after 55 years of age

with no penalties, but the employer pays the pension for those between 55 and 60 years old.
The contribution rate is 11.89 percent (7.93 for the employer and 3.96 for the employee). The
minimum pension has been fixed at MAD 1,000 (approximately €89)13 per month since June
2012. Though these schemes provide important retirement benefits, it is notable that they
cover just 30 percent of the active Moroccan population.

     5.2.2. Health Insurance for Pensioners

The AMO was created in 2006 to benefit employees of both the private and public sectors.
The CNSS manages the compulsory health insurance in Morocco for private sector employees
who are not covered by an optional insurance and for private sector pensioners. Those who
were already affiliated with an optional health insurance at the date of creation of the AMO
are permitted to keep their optional coverage, provided they submit proof of existing
insurance to the CNSS. For public sector employees, the AMO is managed by the Caisse
nationale des organismes de prévoyance sociale. Households with very low incomes (lower
than MAD 5,650 per person) are covered by a special scheme called the Régime d’assistance
médicale. As of 2012, the AMO pays for both in-kind and cash benefits. It covers illness (70
percent), maternity (70 percent), serious illness (90 percent), and hospitalization and
ambulatory care (70–90 percent).

Access to the AMO is subject to fulfillment of a contribution period of 54 consecutive working
days during the six months preceding the illness, payment of contributions to the CNSS, and

reporting of prolonged and costly treatment to the CNSS. In the case of work interruption,
the insured and his/her beneficiaries maintain benefits for up to six months. In the case of
divorce, if the former spouse is not covered by a health insurance plan, she/he will continue
to benefit from the AMO for one year. In the case of death, dependents of the insured who
do not have separate compulsory basic health insurance receive benefits from the AMO for
two years.

 6. Background and Content of BSSAs

The background of BSSAs is legal, both in their collective history and in the specific content
of each bilateral agreement. The following exposition provides a brief presentation of the
legal aspects of BSSAs.

  6.1.       Introduction to BSSAs

BSSAs serve multiple objectives, including

         •     defining which social benefits will be coordinated (‘material scope’)—for
               example, only pension and health care benefits or family and unemployment
               benefits also;

         •     defining the individuals covered under the agreement (‘personal scope’)—for
               example, only nationals or also assimilated persons with legal residence such as
               refugees;

         •     establishing the depth of coordination (from time-limited exemptions to
               contribute to the host scheme to exportability of benefits to full-fledged
               coordination); and

         •     establishing coordination on eligibility criteria, benefit calculation, disbursement,
               service delivery, financing, and processes of application, decision, and
               information.

Effective BSSAs should ensure, among other things, the following:

         •     Equality of treatment: This refers to the principle that all workers engaged in
               remunerated labor should enjoy equal provision of social security; this provision
               can also be extended to workers’ dependent family members.




                                                 26
       •    Payment of benefits abroad (exportability): The portability principle provides
            for any acquired right, or right in the course of acquisition, to be guaranteed to
            the migrant worker in one territory even if it has been acquired in another.

       •    Determination of applicable legislation: This principle ensures that the social
            security of a migrant worker is governed at any one time by the legislation of only
            one country; three basic rules apply:

            o    Employees are covered by the legislation of the contracting party in which
                 they work, even if they reside in the other contracting party.

            o    Self-employed persons are covered by the legislation of the contracting
                 party in which they perform their economic activity.

            o    Civil servants are covered by the legislation of the contracting party within
                 whose administration they are employed.

       •    Maintenance of benefits in the course of acquisition (totalization): This
            principle provides that when a right is conditional upon the completion of a
            qualifying period, periods of employment by the migrant worker in each country
            are taken into account.

       •    Administrative assistance: This principle aims to provide for mutual
            administrative assistance between the social security authorities and institutions
            of participating members.

Though these principles are largely observed, the content and implementation of BSSAs are
highly variable. The rest of this section presents a comprehensive review of the content of
the Belgium-Morocco BSSA.

     6.2.       Belgium-Morocco BSSA

      6.2.1. Area of Application

The objective area of application of the current Belgium-Morocco BSSA 14 includes the
following:

            •    Health insurance

            •    Family allowances for employees (for a maximum of four children)

            •    Occupational diseases

            •    Work accidents

            •    Unemployment benefits

            •    Disability benefits

            •    Sickness benefits

            •    Old-age pension

            •    Survivor’s pension

The BSSA applies to the following persons:

            •    Belgian and Moroccan citizens

            •    Belgian or Moroccan residents

            •    Survivors whose entitlements are derived from persons mentioned above




14
     As a new BSSA is under negotiation, this information is likely to change.




                                                          28
   6.2.2. Pensions

Portability of social rights between Belgium and Morocco is based on two main criteria: (a)
only contributory benefits can be transported and (b) the content of the BSSA is based on
the principle of reciprocity (that is, the benefit must also exist in the other country). In line
with the first criteria, old-age and survivor’s pensions are included in the framework of the
agreement, but GRAPA is not portable or exportable, and benefits may be suspended after a
29-day stay abroad. Noncontributory benefits are payable only to retirees resident in
Belgium. In keeping with the second criteria, portability of social benefits implies reciprocity
of social rights and no statutory equivalent of the Belgian GRAPA exists in the Moroccan social
security system. Since July 1, 2012, two criteria have been implemented for persons with
foreign citizenship: the recipient must be a long-term resident in Belgium (or in another
country member of the EU) or have a career of at least 312 full-time working days or the
equivalent. However, the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement (L 070 du 18.3.2000, 2000/204/CE)
concluded between the EU and Morocco in March 2000 enables family members of
Moroccan workers to claim GRAPA benefits in Belgium.

In addition to the contributory and reciprocity criteria, the Belgium-Morocco BSSA has some
specific features:

       •    The family allowance for recipients of a Belgian pension living in Morocco is
            limited to four children.

       •    The health care system currently covers only family members of persons resident
            in Morocco and/or those on temporary stays and not Belgian retirees with
            residence in Morocco. Furthermore, retirees living in Morocco with a Belgian
            pension cannot benefit from the Belgian health care system. Similarly, retirees
            living in Belgium with a Moroccan pension cannot benefit from the Moroccan
            health care system. However, mutual coverage for retirees will be expanded
            under the new agreement, which has not been implemented yet.




                                               29
       •      Benefits covered by the BSSA begin once the application is received and are not
              retroactive.

Portability of the pension is conditional on the following criteria:

       •      Access to pension benefits depends on the legislation of the country where the
              request is submitted.

       •      The calculation of the pension is made in the country where the pension claimant
              worked last.

       •      The ‘contact institution’ (Office National des Pensions [ONP] in Belgium and the
              CNSS in Morocco) in charge of the pension payment depends on the principal
              residence of the claimant when the request is made.

       •      Relevant employment periods (or the equivalent) are considered based on the
              countries’ national legislation.

       •      No benefits may be claimed if contribution periods are less than one year, with
              the yearly minimum number of working days (or the equivalent) provided by the
              relevant country’s legislation. In these cases, the counterpart institution in the
              other signatory country provides the claimant's entitlement to benefits.

   6.2.2.1.     Application Process

The pension application process in case of migration between Belgium and Morocco is carried
out in three steps. First, the pension claimant submits her/his request to the ‘contact
institution’ located in the country of residence. At this time, the contact institution identifies
the person (name and birthdate) and determines his/her civil status. The ONP in Belgium or
the CNSS in Morocco check the exact spelling of the name and look for possible homonyms
in the country of birth. Next, institutions of the pensioner’s country of birth examine the
validity of the birth date to verify entitlement to retirement benefits. This can sometimes be




                                                 30
complicated, as in some cases the complete birth date is not available in the national registry.
Where uncertainty about the birth date exists, Belgium determines a standard birth date of
July 1. Eligibility for retirement in this case generally occurs on August 1 of the 65th year
(except in the case of early retirement). Finally, institutions of the pension applicant’s birth
country examine his/her civil status. The pension amount may eventually vary depending on
household composition. Furthermore, divorce or repudiation in the case of death of the
spouse may cause variation in or redistribution of the amount of the survivor’s pension.

In the second step, the contact institution determines the period to be considered and the
calculation of the pension benefits. Each state applies its own pension regulation regarding
the periods taken into account (and equivalent periods) and calculates the value of the
benefits. The aim of BSSAs is not to harmonize but to coordinate transfers between the two
countries. However, the aggregation of periods of insurance ensures that all insurance
periods completed under the legislation of another state are considered to obtain access to
pension benefits (that is, for early retirement or the minimum pension guarantee). To ensure
this, the pension claimant must complete a ‘contact form’ (formulaire de liaison) 15 informing
the institutions of his/her personal information, civil status, and career in the other signatory
country. The social security institutions then verify this information before calculation and
payment of pension benefits.

The third step is for the contact institution to make the pension payment. Payment is
provided directly by the contact institution to the beneficiary either by international bank
transfer or postal check. The time lag between the request and the first payment depends on
the duration of these stages.

       6.2.2.1.    Calculation of Benefits

The Belgium-Morocco BSSA specifies that the beneficiary may choose between two types of
calculation. The first calculation (‘simple or direct calculation’) is based on the career in each


15
     http://www.cnss.ma/sites/default/files/conventions/bm_21.pdf.




                                                     31
country separately. If the request is made in Belgium, the calculation is based solely on the
Belgian periods completed in the employee’s scheme. If insurance periods have also been
acquired in Morocco, the calculation of the pension is based solely on the career in Morocco.
The second calculation (‘double calculation’) evaluates an amount considering all foreign
periods as completed in the country where the calculation is made. If the request is made in
Belgium, the double calculation provides for a proportional pension by totaling all relevant
periods as if the employment had been carried out in Belgium.16 In practice, the ONP chooses
the most advantageous pension possible without consulting the applicant. However,
beneficiaries can submit a request for the other method of calculation.

     6.2.2.2.    Transfer and Pay-out of Benefits

The benefits are computed by the contact institution in the country of application and then
transferred directly to the pensioner.

     6.2.2.3.    Taxation

For pensioners residing in Morocco, the two types of pension deductions are compulsory
health insurance and the withholding tax (précompte professionnel). 17 No additional taxes
are collected on the pension in Belgium or Morocco. According to the double taxation treaty
of 1972 between Morocco and Belgium (30/09/1976, n° E.E./84.909), social benefits are
taxed only by the source country. However, social benefits paid by Belgium or Morocco must




16
   This double calculation approach is part of the European coordination rules but is often not done as it is
cumbersome and in many cases provides results that are little different.
17
   Belgian pensions paid abroad are generally subject to withholding tax/source tax in Belgium. To avoid
double taxation, the treaty of 1972 between Belgium and Morocco restricts taxation of public pensions in the
source/disbursing country (Article 18 of the double taxation treaty). For the rules and tax schedule of the
withholding tax on pensions (and other revenues) as of January 1, 2014, see
http://finances.belgium.be/fr/binaries/regel151213_FR_tcm307-239484.pdf. Monthly pensions up to €1,150
have a zero tax rate, increasing to 38 percent for pensions above €3.500 (individuals). For the double taxation
treaty, see http://www.droit-

 be declared in the country of residence. As a result, pension benefits from abroad are untaxed
 but this may affect the marginal tax rate on other incomes, such as labor income.

    6.2.3. Health Care Benefits

     6.2.3.1.      Responsibility

 The original BSSA did not include health care because of the reciprocity principle: no system
 of compulsory health care insurance existed in Morocco when the first BSSA was signed.
 Some specific health care situations were nevertheless indirectly covered in the first BSSA
 and implemented gradually via administrative arrangements. Specifically, health care for
 ‘temporary stays in Morocco’ has been applied. Provisions relating to ‘family members of
 persons resident in Morocco’, ‘individuals in primary disability residing in Morocco’, and
 ‘Belgian employees (or assimilated) residing in Morocco and Moroccan employees (or
 assimilated) residing in Belgium’ have been implemented more recently, after the
 establishment of health care reform legislation in Morocco (see table 6.1 for more details).
 However, the first (still current) BSSA did not cover health care benefits for pensioners.

Despite a lack of portability of health care benefits in most circumstances, a compulsory
health insurance was automatically deducted from the Belgian pension benefits of Moroccan
residents unless they made an explicit request to the contact institution to halt the deduction.
In this case, a Moroccan resident with a pension paid by the ONP could be treated in Belgium
only under certain conditions: care would be delivered during a temporary stay in Belgium
and access to health care was subject to registration with a mutual insurance fund. If these
three conditions (AMI, mutual insurance, and temporary stays) were satisfied, pensioners
who were Moroccan residents could receive treatment and care in Belgium. However,
research suggests that due to the lack of health care coverage for pensioners, temporary
migrations for health care benefits were frequent, although the extent of this phenomenon
is difficult to estimate with precision (Institut National d’Assurance Maladie Invalidité 2014).

In the late 2000s, Moroccan authorities began looking to incorporate health care for
pensioners into the BSSA through an administrative arrangement, such as for temporary stays
and family members. This negotiation process is described in more detail under section 6.2.4.

   6.2.3.2.    Reimbursements

Two types of financial transfers for portable health care benefits currently exist between
Belgium and Morocco. The first is a transfer made on an annual payment, calculated on a
predetermined lump-sum basis. The lump sum is obtained by multiplying the average annual
cost per family by the number of families considered (a reduction of 20 percent is deducted
from the result). The second type is a transfer made on a quarterly payment based on actual
costs. Benefits provided to relevant persons in Belgium or Morocco are registered and
reimbursements are carried out at actual cost.

   6.2.4. Changes in the Agreement

To address gaps in the 1968 BSSA, Morocco and Belgium initiated a process of negotiation to
achieve a new agreement intended to reflect the new pension and health insurance situation



                                              34
in the two countries. Negotiations started between Belgian and Moroccan institutions in
2008, with the objective of modernizing and adapting the portability of social security
benefits. On February 18, 2014, a High Belgian-Moroccan Joint Commission met in Brussels
and the parties reached a joint declaration regarding eight agreements, including the
convention on social security between Belgium and Morocco and the administrative
agreement relating to its application. Under this negotiation, the two parties are expected to
modernize the BSSA to provide a better match with other BSSAs in place in the two countries.
Adaptation also aims to reconcile the BSSA with current migratory and social realities. Over
the past 40 years, the profile of Moroccans living abroad has changed dramatically, in
particular because of the aging of the first wave of immigrants, who now have a greater need
for health care. At the same time, Morocco developed the AMO (2006) and reformed the
Mudawana (Family Code) in 2004. These two reforms affect the possibility of concluding an
agreement integrating health care for more diversified categories (including pensioners) and
the distribution of a survivor’s pension between widows, in case of repudiation. The new
agreement is also expected to increase the number of persons covered by social security
portability by removing the current limit on the number of children used to calculate the
family allowance (Morocco limits this number to six children). 18

     6.3.   Comparisons with Relevant EU Decrees

The content of BSSAs is influenced by: the history and relations between the two countries;
migration policies; economic issues related to financial transfers of social security benefits;
and international legislation. Conditions of reciprocity of social security benefits may vary
from one agreement to another according to these criteria. As discussed in the preceding
section, the Belgium-Morocco BSSA is currently being revised. The review process is
particularly intended to standardize the content of the agreement with European Legislation


18
  The new bilateral agreement is currently still under negotiation. However, a new administrative
arrangement—elaborating on previous health care portability mentioned in the first bilateral agreement—has
been published on April 4, 2014. See annex A or
www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/binaries/coming_to_belgium/spfssfodsz/marokko/aa-du-18-02-2014.pdf.

(CE 883/2004 and CEE 1408/71), particularly in the areas of access to and the reciprocal
funding of health care. Hence, a comparison of the current (old) BSSA with the EU multilateral
framework agreement would not make much sense and is partly reflected above, and a
comparison with the new BSSA will have to wait until it is fully established and implemented.

  7. Pension Transfers

Compared to the substantial past and current migratory flow between Belgium and Morocco,
the current pension expenditure flows are surprisingly modest. As shown in table 7.1,
Morocco receives just 3 percent of the total transferred pensions from Belgium, compared
with 4.2 percent for Turkey and 80.9 percent for all European countries. However, the share
of monthly expenditure flows to Morocco is higher, constituting 4.25 percent of the total
expenditure paid by Belgium for pensions in the world. This disconnect is likely due to the
average Moroccan’s long employment history in Belgium.

 8. Findings on Criteria Fulfillment

  8.1.   Fairness for Individuals

   8.1.1. Repudiation and Distribution of the Survivor’s Pension

Moroccan civil law (Mudawana) allows two types of dissolution of marriage: divorce and
repudiation. Divorce requires spouses to go to the Tribunal to formally dissolve the marriage,
which can be very costly and time-consuming (Ouali, La convention belgo-marocaine de
coopération judiciaire en matière civile. 1992). Repudiation enables one spouse to
unilaterally break the contract, which limits costs and duration. This is why men, and in a
small number of cases women, use repudiation more often than divorce. However,
repudiation is not always recognized as valid in Belgian civil law for Moroccans resident in
Belgium. This can lead to a risk of polygamy and can also affect both pension rates and the
distribution of the survivor’s pension for spouses.

The BSSA’s implementation of this provision may be questionable under international civil
law. Two criteria can be used by courts to measure the impact and legality of repudiation:
proximity with the Belgian legal framework and the severity of the impact of repudiation on
Belgian law (Henricot 2012). According to private international law, polygamy’s impact is
considered attenuated, in the sense that it produces only pecuniary effects on the
distribution of pensions between widows. Courts use these two criteria to apply or exclude
the provisions of the BSSA concerning survivor’s pensions.

Article 24 of the first Belgium-Morocco BSSA stipulates that the survivor’s pension can be
shared and allocated between beneficiaries. However, the provision does not provide clear
guidance as to the nationality of the spouses. If both are Moroccan nationals, it seems evident
that Article 24 is applied as far as the national law permits polygamy. However, if one of the
spouses is not a Moroccan national and instead is a national of a country where both




                                              38
repudiation and polygamy are prohibited (which is the case for Belgian nationals), Article 24
cannot be applied.

   8.1.2. Noncontributory Benefits

According to European legislation, and as noted in the Belgium-Morocco BSSA,
noncontributory benefits are not exportable. Furthermore, the principle of reciprocity
prevents possible transfers of noncontributory pension benefits because no GRAPA
equivalent exists in the Moroccan social security system. The nonportability of
noncontributory benefits has been raised as a concern, as Moroccan residents of Belgium
have a shorter employment history, higher unemployment rates, and likely a lower overall
salary than Belgian nationals and are therefore more likely to qualify for access to
noncontributory benefits if they are living in Belgium. Moroccan women in particular are
likely to be affected by this provision, given their very short employment histories. Portability
of noncontributory benefits thus remains a fundamental concern and request of Moroccan
authorities.

   8.1.3. Retroactivity

Another concern for individual fairness is the lack of retroactivity for payment of social
security benefits. When pension applications are delayed—whether for reasons of late
submission, difficulties in verifying data, or any other reason—the pensioner loses access to
any benefits that would have been owed up until the application is authorized. Migrants’
organizations are therefore calling for a provision on retroactivity in the revised Belgium-
Morocco BSSA. Yet, from the Belgium side the alternative approach of reassembling the
contributory data well before the retirement date may prove more effective and in line what
other countries have done or are preparing.




                                               39
  8.2.   Fiscal Fairness for Countries

Evaluating fiscal fairness requires a benchmark against which to assess the impact of the
BSSA/full portability of benefits. The simple version of such a benchmark states that no
participating country should have a fiscal advantage or be harmed by the agreement, but the
meaning of this needs to be assessed in context. Fiscal neutrality for both countries does not
mean that both do not economically benefit from the agreement compared with the situation
in its absence (for example, through higher labor market formality).

   8.2.1. Financial Fairness - Pension Regulations

Portability of pensions means that income generated in one country is transferred to another
country, not dissimilar to remittances sent from migrant-receiving to migrant-sending
countries; that is, a shift in purchasing power (Jousten 2012). It corresponds to the export of
factor income (labor, and for funded pensions, also partially capital) from the factor-using to
the factor-providing country. As such, fiscal neutrality is not harmed. However, because tax
privileges have been granted to pensions during the accumulation phase (for example,
through nontaxation of contributions and interest earned) that would be recovered through
the taxation of benefits when disbursed, fiscal neutrality may be hurt but not under all
circumstances. Nontaxation of returns on retirement savings may not be a privilege but
merely the taxation principle under a consumption-type tax treatment. Furthermore, the
taxes levied in the new recipient country may simply pay for the public goods and services
provided. However, the tax transfer mechanism may include age-related transfers when
beneficiaries are young (for example, child allowances and housing subsidies) that are
recovered when they are older, including when drawing a pension. Then the pension-sending
country would lose and the pension-receiving country would gain.

In the Belgium-Morocco corridor, the situation is somewhat simplified as the pensions sent
from Belgium to Morocco are subject to a withholding tax in Belgium, with monthly pensions
below €1,150 free of tax and a tax rate that grows slowly thereafter. Given the size of the




                                              40
average pension of €579 sent to Morocco in 2012 (calculated from table 7.1), this withholding
tax is not likely to affect many return migrants. In Morocco, the transferred pension is exempt
from further income taxation through Article 18 of the Belgium-Morocco tax treaty of 1972.

   8.2.2. Financial Fairness - Health Care Regulations

The fiscal transfer regarding health care services is currently restricted to mutual
reimbursement for family members and health care treatment for migrants staying
temporarily in the other country. Nevertheless, health insurance contributions are deducted
from the pensions sent to Morocco, albeit migrants resident there do not have access to the
health care provisions based on their Belgian pension only. This clearly unfair fiscal treatment
has not yet been addressed but is expected to be resolved once coverage of retirees in
Morocco under the health care provision is enacted, as envisaged in the new BSSA.

It is unclear how much the future health care coverage of retirees will induce additional fiscal
unfairness. The outcome will depend on the reimbursement regime used: (a) lump
sum/across-the-board and applied family factors or (b) real-cost reimbursement and the
agreed rates. BSSAs typically do not consider the age profile for health care expenditure
compared to the typically flatter contribution profiles, which is bound to create fiscal
unfairness (Werding and McLennan 2011).

  8.3.   Minimal Bureaucratic Burden

   8.3.1. Available Information Sources for Migrants

Three types of instruments are currently used in Belgium and Morocco to inform potential
beneficiaries of the contents and coverage of the BSSA: institutional contact centers,
information sessions, and direct communication with beneficiaries. It is relatively easy for
pensioners to liaise with contact center staff. However, information sessions organized by the
ONP in the Moroccan cities with the largest population of returnees often struggle to reach
a large number of potential beneficiaries. Privacy concerns can exacerbate this; for example,




                                              41
past requests by Moroccan institutions to Belgium to share potential beneficiaries’ contact
details provided by the Belgian administrative database 19 have been rejected by Belgium for
privacy reasons. In the future, both countries will need to pursue avenues to ensure migrant
retirees’ access to social security rights without breaches of privacy.

      8.3.2. Delays in the Application Process

No data are available on the average processing time for a pension application under the
BSSA. In Belgium, the duration of this process varies depending on the complexity of the
pensioner’s individual situation (for example, civil status, working career in one or many
countries). When there are delays, they often result from challenges in verifying the data in
the contact form (formulaire de contact). In particular, it can be challenging to verify data on
identity (homonymy, name changes, unclear or erroneous birth dates) and civil status.
Pensioners are required to supply marriage, divorce, and related certificates that confirm
their civil status. If these certificates are lost or otherwise not available, the contact institution
may still calculate a ‘minimum entitlement’ using the information at its disposal. They may
occasionally grant advances (‘provisional decision’) pending finalization of the pension
application. Furthermore, contact forms (‘formulaires de liaison’) are not transmitted
electronically but by standard postal mail.

      8.3.3. Death

Belgian pension benefits for people residing in Morocco are paid through the CNSS. As a
consequence, an annual life certificate is not requested by the Belgian social security fund.
However, according to the Moroccan social security system, a compulsory declaration of
death is requested from relatives of the deceased. This declaration must be registered within
a maximum of 30 days after the death. Delays are subject to penalties (between MAD 300
and MAD 1,200).

 9. Conclusions

The review of the Belgium-Morocco migration corridor and its BSSA invites corridor-specific
conclusions as well as broader reflections on BSSAs for developing countries. The latter draw
on the summary policy paper (Holzmann 2016).

  9.1.       Corridor-specific Conclusions

The findings of the Belgium-Morocco corridor study suggest that the BSSA between these
countries is broadly working quite well, with only a few substantive issues in the area of
pension portability and the main task of implementing the access to health care for retired
migrants under the new BSSA in the coming years.

The pension issues cluster around the following points:

         •     Access to survivor’s pensions in view of civil law differences in addressing divorce
               and repudiation. While Belgium does not allow multiple marriages, it recognizes
               multiple marriages in case of death. This creates legal issues, particularly if the
               surviving spouses have different nationalities (for example, one is Moroccan and
               the other Belgian).

         •     The non-exportability of minimum pension guarantees in line with EU legislation
               and lacking reciprocity. This issue exists in other corridors but seems to be more
               strongly felt by Moroccan retirees—returned or staying in Belgium for this
               reason—and is reportedly a constant theme in bilateral negotiations.

         •     The request to grant benefits retroactively in view of administrative delays. As
               no electronic system with full records exists in Morocco, establishing eligibility
               (including date of birth) and benefit level is time-consuming and first pension
               benefits may be paid with substantial delay. Similarly, if Moroccan pensions are
               also paid to Belgium but a pension top-up is claimed, then initial verification and




                                                 43
            continuous update may lead to delays. Belgium (in contrast to France) does not
            pay retroactive claims, that is, before benefit eligibility has been established.

For the implementation of extended access to health care and thus portability for Morocco-
based retirees with a Belgian pension, the information base proved to be extremely slim. No
public information is seemingly available and approached authorities did not respond in the
expected manner.

The administrative issues were clustered around process issues with regard to information
and automated exchange of information with modern information technologies. The paper-
based process on insurance periods in Morocco and the nonelectronic exchange between
both countries do not lend themselves to quick determination of eligibility and benefit level.
While the problem is recognized, according to the information received, no date has been
established for when electronic files on both sides will become available. Such information
modernization, including the role of data security and personal data protection, will be the
main driver of a likely revision of the BSSA envisaged in the coming years.

Besides the main topics raised in this summary report and the background papers, a few other
minor issues may require attention:

       •    Availability of information sources concerning the portability of social security
            rights. While information provided about pension rights of Moroccans in Belgium
            seems to be effective, the information base for returned migrants to access
            Belgian social benefits seems slim and local authorities are neither well-informed
            nor trained.

       •    Potential delays in portability applications due to data verification needs and
            missing data.

This corridor study and the evaluation of the Belgium-Morocco BSSA are essentially based on
qualitative information, including some useful available data, comparison of regulations, and




                                              44
interviews with responsible bureaucrats and migrant representatives in Belgium and
Morocco. The original ambition of having an elaborate results framework with key
performance indicators—such as the average time between application submission and first
benefit payment, survey indicators on consumer satisfaction, and measures of fiscal fairness
that are all tracked over time—was abandoned rather quickly. It was not possible to establish
comparable data across the four corridor studies to produce simple performance indicators.
Yet, such a rigorous evaluation approach is needed to more objectively identify issues and
assess policy changes in agreements, while the discussion of such a results agreement and
the data should become part and parcel of the periodic meetings between countries. Even
without this ambitious goal, further corridor studies such as this one would be useful to
broaden the overall information base and to help identify emerging issues of increasing
importance.

  9.2.    Broader Reflections on BSSAs

From a policy perspective, a number of questions are not fully addressed in this paper (if at
all). Some are discussed in this section.

Does portability or its absence matter? If so, is it for labor mobility or social risk
management; for what phase of labor mobility—departing, staying, or returning—and for
what part of risk management—pension, health, and so on? The findings in the corridor
studies are consistent with sparse empirical evidence that departure consideration may be
little influenced by the presence or absence of portability (even if the reviewed BSSAs from
the 1960s were considered an important competitive element); for example, no BSSAs exist
between Mexico and the United States or between Asian and Gulf Cooperation Council
countries, although these have the largest migration corridors globally. This suggests
implications for the risk management of migrants (forcing own provisioning) and home
countries (offering special arrangements such as health care by Mexico and a range of
support programs by the Philippines).

Portability arrangements seem to have some but limited effect on return migration while
some specificity of pension and health care provisions may make many migrants stay on; for
pensions it is top-ups that seem to matter, while for health care it is access to high-quality




                                             45
care if needed. It would be interesting and relevant to experiment with limited portability of
top-ups and/or selective access to health care to former host countries for return migrants
(including visas) to explore the mobility effects.

What are the conclusions, if any, for low-income countries/minimum requirements? For a
BSSA to be worthwhile, a developing country needs to have a sizable migration corridor that
offers its migrants access to receiving countries’ social security systems (often not the case in
the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Malaysia, Singapore, and so on). However, the
developing country should also have a (perhaps small) functioning social security system or
at least one or two well-operating schemes. Similarity between host and home country
schemes also helps, or the host country will have limited interest in engaging in a BSSA and
no credibility with and interest by its own migrants to participate at home and abroad.
Furthermore, operation of the relevant scheme should be computerized (ideally with a
unique personal identification number), have birth and death certificates, and have an
institutional set-up that takes care of its migrants for departure, during their stay, and upon
return.

What should developing countries pursue a narrow or an ambitious approach to BSSAs? A
narrow approach with a focus on few benefits, particularly on pensions (old-age, disability,
and survivor’s), work injury, and health care for family members left behind and visiting has
higher chances of early success. Renegotiating the BSSA for broader benefits such as family
allowance and health care in retirement when the migration corridor intensifies and domestic
equivalents are created is possible but requires a more lengthy process. Striving from the very
beginning for a comprehensive BSSA and benefit coverage as within the EU may not be very
promising and would need to build on a very strong migration corridor. Current signals from
the EU indicate a reluctance to include health care in future third country agreements.

Are private sector provisions easier to make portable? Not necessarily, and in any case this
would only be relevant for long-term contingencies—retirement and health care. Private
saving offers a first defense against many financial risks in life, and money should be easy to




                                               46
carry along when moving from country to country. However, finding reliable financial
institutions at home and abroad to park the money is often a challenge. In addition, private
sector pension arrangements often profit from tax privileges during the accumulation phase
that countries increasingly take back when one leaves the country and the exit tax may be
sizable. Private health care insurance is not easily portable between countries (or even within
countries) so that sizable savings elements get lost when moving. Even within the EU, private
provisions (for pension and health care) are much less portable than public and mandated
ones. This has given rise to pan-European or international private programs in health and
preparation of a pan-European fund for supplementary pension benefits.

Abstract

The portability of social benefits is gaining importance given the increasing share of individuals
working at least part of their life outside their home country. Bilateral social security agreements
(BSSAs) are considered a crucial approach to establishing portability, but the functionality and
effectiveness of these agreements have not yet been investigated; thus, important guidance for
policy makers in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving countries is missing. To shed light on how
BSSAs work in practice, this document is part of a series providing information and lessons from
studies of portability in four diverse but comparable migration corridors: Austria-Turkey, Germany-
Turkey, Belgium-Morocco, and France-Morocco. A summary policy paper draws broader conclusions
and offers overarching policy recommendations.
This report looks specifically into the working of the Belgium-Morocco corridor. Findings suggest
that the BSSA is broadly working well, with no main substantive issues in the area of pension
portability, except for the nonportability of the noncontributory top-up pension and issues with
widows pensions in case of divorce and repudiation, and in health care, the pending introduction
of portable health care for retirees with single pensions from the other country. Process issues
around information provision in Morocco and automation of information exchange are recognized.

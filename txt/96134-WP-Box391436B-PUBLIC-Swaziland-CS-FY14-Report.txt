I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Swaziland perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Swaziland regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Swaziland;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Swaziland;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Swaziland;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Swaziland.
       Use data to help inform Swaziland country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In April—May 2014, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Swaziland were invited to
provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; central government officials; local government officials; bilateral
and multilateral agencies; private sector companies; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; state-owned enterprises/parastatal organizations; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 142 stakeholders participated in the survey (47% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier or email and returned it accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Swaziland; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank
Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Swaziland; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing in Swaziland.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Swaziland: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Swaziland is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Swaziland, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved in Swaziland.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Swaziland, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Swaziland solve its development challenges, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest
   values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in
   Swaziland, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which
   sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge
   services), and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Swaziland, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Swaziland’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across fifteen development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Swaziland: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Swaziland, and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Swaziland, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from the office of a minister were
        combined with respondents from central government; respondents from PMUs and
        consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs were combined
        with employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies;
        respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral agencies;
        respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
        private sector companies; respondents from NGOs, trade unions, and faith-based groups
        were combined into the “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the office of a
        parliamentarian and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other? category. There
        were no respondents from the office of the President, Prime Minister, independent
        government institutions, private foundations, and community based organizations.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Area of Primary Specialization




    When more than 15% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of specialized
    areas in question H2 in Appendix H), analyses are done to see these respondents’ views about the development
    priorities in Swaziland, the areas of development that would contribute most to poverty reduction and economic
    growth, which areas the WBG should focus its attention and resources on, and importance and effectiveness of
    the WBG’s work in specific sectors.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in the Hhohho region
        (which includes Mbabane and Lobamba). Because of the small number of respondents
        from other areas, these locations were combined under the “Other? category for all
        further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 92). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Collaboration with and Exposure to the World Bank Group
       Differences in responses to the indicator questions, based on levels of collaboration and
        exposure to the World Bank Group in Swaziland, can be found in Appendix F (see page
        128). Please note that where these two factors appear to have a significant relationship
        with overall views of the World Bank Group, it is highlighted in yellow in that table.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Respondents from local governments, the office of a minister/central government, and
        employees of ministries/PMUs/consultants on WBG-supported projects had the highest
        levels of familiarity with the WBG whereas respondents from CSOs and academia/
        research institutes/think tanks had significantly lower levels of familiarity.
       Respondents who collaborated with the WBG had significantly higher levels of
        familiarity with the WBG than respondents who did not collaborate.
       Respondents from the Hhohho region had significantly higher levels of familiarity with
        the WBG than respondents from other geographic locations in Swaziland.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the overall effectiveness of the WBG in Swaziland, and
        significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to
        Swaziland’s development, and the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in
        Swaziland.

IV. General Issues Facing Swaziland
Headed in the Right Direction
       While a majority of respondents across most stakeholder groups indicated that Swaziland
        is headed in the right direction, respondents from CSOs and academia/research
        institutes/think tanks indicated that Swaziland is headed in the wrong direction, and
        respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to indicate that they were not sure
        whether Swaziland is headed in the right or wrong direction.
       Respondents from the Hhohho region were significantly more likely to indicate that
        Swaziland is headed in the right direction than respondents from other geographic
        locations.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Focusing World Bank Group Resources
       Respondents who collaborate with the WBG and those who do not collaborate with the
        WBG both indicated that the WBG should focus most of its resources on public sector
        governance/reform in Swaziland.
       Respondents from the health sector were significantly more likely to indicate that the
        WBG should focus on health compared to respondents from other sectors.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were statistically significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings
        of the WBG’s effectiveness across four of these fifteen development areas in Swaziland.
        Ratings across all areas by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 71).
        Those areas with significant stakeholder differences were:
                “Health?;
                “Local governance and institutions?;
                “Public sector governance/reform?; and
                “Education?.
       Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher effectiveness
        ratings for “Regulatory framework?; “Public sector governance/reform?, “Education?,
        and “Social protection? compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG.
        Ratings across all areas by collaboration can be found in Appendix D (see page 107).
       Respondents from the health sector gave statistically similar effectiveness ratings for
        “Health? compared to respondents from other sectors. Ratings across all areas by sectors
        can be found in Appendix E (see page 122).
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 63) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Swaziland, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the fifteen specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Swaziland. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Swaziland, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at energy.

The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for four of these
        aspects of the WBG as an effective development partner: WBG’s collaboration with the
        Government, its straightforwardness and honesty, ease of access to the people at the
        WBG who are making decisions important to stakeholders’ work, and flexibility in terms
        of changing country circumstances (see Appendix B for details).

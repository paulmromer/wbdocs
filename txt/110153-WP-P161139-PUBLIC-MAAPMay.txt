 This document was prepared by DNV GL Energy for the World Bank Group and has been expert
reviewed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the New Climate Institute.


  It identifies a series of modules, indicators and methodologies for assessing different mitigation
  actions to contribute to achieving the goal of an internationally accepted system for comparing
                        carbon assets and eventually, their trade and exchange.


It is expected that the modules, indicators and methodologies outlined in this document will evolve
  based on discussions with stakeholders, further technical work, and practical application. This
                       document will be periodically updated and uploaded to:
    http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/brief/globally-networked-carbon-markets.

Executive Summary

The new international climate policy architecture that is
expected to emerge from the Paris Agreement, appears to
leave considerable discretion to Governments as to the
form and scope of their mitigation contributions. In           Short, Medium, and Long-Term Goals and the

significant transformation in an effort to enhance
transparency and compare a patchwork of different
approaches.

Kyoto Protocol mechanisms created a top-down system
for measuring emissions reductions in what could be
called the first generation of carbon markets. But the
current limited functionality of such mechanisms has led to
the development of several bottom-up approaches in local,
regional, and national climate policy frameworks. These
strategies promote emissions reductions through the
implementation of mitigation actions. The recent climate
change agreement reached in 2015 in Paris sets the pace
for the next generation of carbon markets.

3 The Networked Carbon Markets (NCM) initiative complements the World Bank Group's ongoing low-carbon development
activities and its efforts to promote carbon markets as critical to achieving climate mitigation at large scale and in an effective
and cost-efficient way. Its end goal is to collaboratively develop the post-2020 services and institutions needed for an
international carbon market that links climate actions in a way that is inclusive, transparent, efficient and has environmental
integrity.

The three key components of the Program are:
 1. Independent assessment framework to guide and assess the implementation of climate actions. The framework would
    provide countries with information needed to understand, compare, and eventually link heterogeneous climate actions.
 2. International Carbon Asset Reserve (ICAR) to help domestic regulators manage market risks or address market failures.
 3. International Settlement Platform to track cross-border trades and possible clearing house function.

These three key components of the NCM Initiative are to be introduced in a phased manner, initially supporting countries to
design robust climate actions and facilitating comparability and linkage of their own domestic climate actions, before being
extended to markets on a bilateral, regional and international basis.

As an illustrative example, assuming a user decides to apply the MAAP with the weights provided in this report, the graphs bellow show assessment results for
the design module. In this case, the program results in a low score in the risk area with the largest weight—the planning of the mitigation action. A closer look to the
specific key indicators can facilitate the process of identifying those areas with a lower score and define a process to improve the results of a future new assessment:

    Ex-ante and Ex-post Application of the MAAP

    An ex-ante assessment can occur during or after implementation of a mitigation action. It is helpful to evaluate the
    likelihood that the intervention will deliver emissions reductions, and to assess the environmental integrity and related
    risks.

    An ex-post assessment of a mitigation action occurs prior to achievement of any emissions reductions but ideally some
    degree of institutional implementation has already taken place and design is not limited to only documentation. It is
    helpful to measure the achievements and extent to which the intervention met its goals, and will assess the processes in
    place to ensure that future deliverables are met.

Annex 1: Modules, Modules Areas, Key Indicators and Level of Development

In line with the flexibility provided by the MAAP detailed below, the indicators that follow can be customized by the user to fit
the purpose of their application. These key indicators cover the main risk areas that should be taken into account to assess a
mitigation action. The user can add, eliminate, or edit them as appropriate, including the possibility of breaking each key
indicator into a number of more specific indicators to refine the assessment.

                                                  baseline assessment but there is no evidence on how the
                                                  different interventions planned are selected taking these
                                                  targets into account
                                                  The MA includes general objectives for mitigation but not
                                                  specific targets.
                                                  The MA defines, implements, and maintains a plan(s) for
                                                  achieving its objectives and targets. The Plan(s) include:
                                                  a) designation of responsibility for achieving objectives and
                                                  targets at relevant functions and levels of the Program
                                                  Managing Entity, and
                                                  b) the means and time-frame by which they are to be
                                                  achieved, and
                                                  c) benchmarks for selected policies and projects, and
                                                  d) an auditable process for stakeholder engagement,
                                                  including a reasonable public comment period.
                                                  The program establishes, implement, and maintain a

                                                  The program does not establish, implement, nor maintain a
                                                  plan(s) for achieving its objectives and targets.
                                                  The achievement of the MA's Objectives and Targets is
                                                  planned through the implementation of a portfolio of
                                                  interventions (policies and/or projects) over a defined time
                                                  period. The portfolio's components are clearly defined and

                                          During the planning of the MA implementation, there is
                                          evidence of the following aspects being taken into account:
                                          a) Timeline for the incorporation of the Projects and
                                          Policies in the Program,

                                          The Plan includes some aspects of the items a) to g) above
                                          for the planning of implementation of Policies and Projects
                                          but it is not complete.
                                          The Plan makes little or no reference to the topic of

                                          The MA clearly identifies the risks for implementation of the

                                          risks to happen or the actions proposed are not considered
                                          sufficient.

                                          The MA does not identify the potential risks for
                                          implementation.
                                          The MA design includes an evaluation of the investment
                                          requirements and possible investment structures. It
                                          includes a realistic investment plan based on justified and

                                          There is no investment plan; or the existing investment plan

                                          The MA processes include the evaluation of regulatory and
                                          legal compliance of the interventions proposed under the

                                          Regulatory and legal compliance has not been taken into

                         reduction transactions           MA 's interventions but it is not complete.
                                                          There is not a centralized record by the MAME of emissions
                                                          reductions.
                                                          The MA justifies that it faces barriers for its implementation
                                                          and that it would not take place without external financial
                                                          support. The barriers are justified based on independent
                                                          data that can be verified.
                                                          It is demonstrated that in the absence of the MA support:
                                                          i) the proposed voluntary measure would not be

                                                          exceeding the mandatory reductions required under
                                                          existing policy or regulations.
                                                          The MA argues that it faces barriers for its implementation
                                                          but it is not justified how additional support would assist in

                                                          The MA includes the implementation of interventions that
                                                          contribute to the MA objectives and targets. The MA has
                                                          defined and implemented a process to develop, approve,
                                                          implement and periodically evaluate those interventions,

                                           The MA uses internationally recognized methods for the
                                           emissions reduction estimation/calculation.
                                           The method includes a process for the identification of
                                           other policy and non-policy drivers that may affect the
                                           intervention and a process for deciding its inclusion or not
                                           in the emissions reduction (ER) estimations.
                                           The methodology allows for the ER to be calculated with a
              GHG estimation and

                                           recognized and approved methodologies but there is not a
                                           level of accuracy defined for the calculations.
                                           A methodology for the calculation of ER has been
                                           developed and the MA program includes a mechanism for
                                           the approval of the methodology that ensure the
                                           methodology is technically sound.
                                           The ER calculation methods set the basis for the
                                           calculation of a baseline scenario that represents the most
                                           likely scenario in the absence of the interventions included
                                           in the MA. The baseline methodology should take into

Annex 2: Review Process

This annex reflects the living nature of the MAAP and describes the evolution of the assessment over time. Despite its short
life, it has been subject of a three phase consultation process, a customization and application in Peru to evaluate and select
sector mitigation actions for crediting purposes (i.e., pilot initiatives to be supported as part of Peru’s Market Readiness
Proposal presented to the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR)), and an exhaustive analysis of the MAAP’s indicators to
assess environmental integrity by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The IISD also carried out two
pilot projects in which the MAAP was tested in a project and a program for climate change mitigation, respectively.

DNV GL

DNV GL’s MAAP went through a three phased consultation process before the final version was submitted. The feedback
received can be summarized in two areas:

The need to include other mitigation actions beyond Nationally Appropriated Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and develop a first
assessment framework not only focused on NAMAs and developing countries, as normally seen in an UNFCCC context, but in
mitigation actions in general and a system applicable to both developed and developing countries. An example would be the
application to mitigation action plans in cities, indifferently of the country.

The assessment of level of ambition at the country or jurisdiction level needs to be totally independent of the modules related
to the mitigation action itself.

This feedback was incorporated and explains why the present document refers to Mitigation Actions in general, and does not
discuss the assessment of level of ambition in detail. However, a set of indicators was proposed for initial discussion and can
be found in Annex 4.

The first phase of the consultation process was a series of stakeholder consultations held at various internal climate change
fora, such as Carbon Expo. In a second phase, progress was presented to a working group formed by experts from the
Networked Carbon Markets team during group working sessions and webinars. In addition, three technical peer reviewers
provided technical reviews to the draft report and components of the MAAP. These reviews were performed by representatives
of Asia LEDS Training Center, IdeaCarbon and FC2E Carbon Fund who were selected based on the presence in developing
countries, experience in ratings/assessments and ability to provide the point of view of the financial/private sector respectively.



International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)

The IISD has reviewed, commented and piloted the MAAP submitted by DNV GL in two case studies. IISD focused exclusively
in the assessment of environmental integrity risks and from this perspective created a Scorecard with indicators building on the
MAAP developed by DNV GL. DNV GL focused not only in the assessment of emissions integrity but also in the development
benefits and overall implementation risk of the MA. Therefore, IISD’s Scorecard is much more narrowly focused, borrows
some indicators form DNV GL’s MAAP and adapts others, and provides a more nuanced approach to assessing the
methodologies and calculations of emissions reductions and baselines of MAs.

To respect the idea of the evolving nature of the initial MAAP and its continuous adaptation to the needs and suggestions of
users and experts, the protocol in Annex I has been revised to incorporate some of the indicators and suggestions made by
IISD. This revision, however, has been done respecting the initial spirit of DNV GL’s higher level approach and keeping
manageable the number of indicators in the MAAP.

IISD piloted the Scorecard in two mitigation actions, namely Sri Lanka’s Renewable Energy Program and Costa Rica’s coffee
NAMA. The idea was to apply the Scorecard to both a project and a program that includes a portfolio of interventions.

The review process and the application of the Scorecard to the two MAs provided the following lessons learned:

There were significant challenges to obtain relevant information about both mitigation actions. This led IISD to develop a
completeness checklist prior to applying the Scorecard to assess if a mitigation action is mature or developed enough to be
assessed and that enough basic information is available. The completeness checklist can be seen in the table below:

The application of the Scorecard based on secondary information has a limited use and needs to be complemented with on
the ground assessments.

The findings were also limited and of little use due to the fact that both mitigation actions were in very early stages of
development.

Annex 3: Application and Customization of the Protocol in Peru— Lessons Learned

Peru used the MAAP to evaluate a portfolio of mitigation actions with the objective of prioritizing and selecting three of them
that would be then incorporated in the Partnership for Market Readiness11 proposal. To that end, Peru customized the MAAP
according to the country’s development and climate change mitigation and budgetary objectives, taking into account the
current level of development of the proposed mitigation actions in Peru and the adopted the Peru Mitigation Action Evaluation
Framework. Due to the participatory approach of the evaluation of the mitigation actions, in which the agencies responsible for
each mitigation action participated, the assessment proved not only useful to prioritize mitigation actions, but also to identify
areas of improvement according to the different scores obtained by each indicator. The Peru Mitigation Action Evaluation
Framework was not only intended to be used to evaluate these mitigation actions and the selection of those proposed to
receive further support from the PMR, the framework was established with a view to be one of the mainstays of a future
Mitigation Action Registry in Peru. The adapted framework is proposed to be a key component in selecting which future
mitigation actions will be accepted in the proposed registry and is formed by the Evaluation Protocol and the Assessor
Evaluation Guidelines. The latter includes a detailed explanation of the different concepts used in the MAAP, the mechanics
for the use of the evaluation protocol and the most common means of assessment sought after to confirm the level of
development of each key indicator.

As a preliminary step, up to 84 mitigation actions developed by various Ministries were evaluated. The result was the shortlist
of ten mitigation actions for a detailed assessment. The short list was based in 5 selection principles: scope, development
phase, mitigation action management entity selected, alignment with the sector and carbon credit potential. The evaluation
took place through an interactive process between the management entity for each mitigation action and a consulting team.
Consultations and interviews were supplemented by desk review of program documentation. The participation in the
evaluation process was presented as an opportunity for the management entities to identify areas of improvement by
analyzing the areas of the evaluation protocol where the score was not optimal. The Evaluation Protocol shows the
components required to achieve the highest score so a comparison with the actual result shows what is necessary to advance
to a higher level.

The ten mitigation actions short listed passed to a second phase of assessment based on the Peru Mitigation Action
Evaluation Protocol, and three were finally selected to be included in the PMR proposal, two NAMAs and another mitigation
action. The short listed actions were in different development phases. Seven of them were at concept stage, and three were
more advanced (at different stages of design, negotiation or implementation). As a result of this pilot, the consulting team
highlighted the need to develop a short tool for mitigation actions in the conceptual stage since design information was lacking
for the mitigation actions at the conceptual stage and only a few indicators were relevant to assess the level of definition of
these actions. Hence, two different versions of the MAAP were customized, one for each group of mitigation actions. The
indicators selected for the short tool can be found in table 2 below, which showcases its application to one of the selected
three mitigation actions.

As mentioned above, the extended version of the MAAP was adapted to the particularities of Peru and deviates slightly from
the MAAP initially proposed by DNV GL, thus reflecting its applicability to different uses via customization of the modules,
indicators and weights. In the Peruvian case the protocol reflects a similar structure to DNV GL´s MAAP. It is divided in 4
modules although the module Investment Environment has been eliminated and substituted by the new module Alignment with
budgetary priorities, to assess compatibility with “results based budgeting system”. Also, in module Mitigation Action Program
the scoring area Barriers in DNV GL´s MAAP was eliminated. A more detailed comparison at indicator level will also conclude
that some indicators have been eliminated and substituted by others in the scoring area Definition and scope, and in the
module Development Benefits. Table 1 below summarizes the final MAAP designed by the consultant team for the case of
Peru.




11PMR is a forum for collective innovation and action and a fund to support capacity building to scale up climate change
mitigation. It provides support to prepare and implement climate change mitigation policies in order to scale up GHG
mitigation. Serving as a platform to share lessons, countries work together to shape the future of cost-effective GHG

The resulting scores when applying the (extended) protocol to the NAMA Waste are summarized in the following graphs
below:




In conclusion, the pilot in the Peru case shows that the MAAP at its current stage can be applied ex-ante (design or
development stage) to mitigation actions as it was intended. It also shows that a certain level of development is required to be
able to obtain valuable information and more importantly, to provide results in a somehow broad scale so it is possible to
compare mitigation actions. This does not actually require that the mitigation action is already being implemented and
emissions reductions produced (ex-post assessment) but that the assessment team can evidence that the required
components are in place for when actual emissions reductions happen (as an example, the roles of responsibilities can be well
defined and documented, the implementation plan developed and in progress, etc. during this development stage). A good
number of key indicators places the score at the top assessment level only when there is evidence of implementation. As a
result, most key indicators for mitigation actions at the concept stage are scored, at best, within the middle assessment level
and, in the case of having to compare multiple actions at the concept stage, the conclusions are not easily noticed. In the case
of Peru, as already described, a short version of the MAAP was produced with sixteen key indicators what actually provided a
better picture of the status of those actions at the design stage. This short version could be used to generalize a MAAP for
similar cases.

Annex 4: Jurisdiction-level Assessment
As described in this report, in the case of carbon assets entering the international market, the goal of this assessment system
is to provide a framework for the assessment of the mitigation value of the carbon assets. In this context, it is necessary to
take into account the level of ambition of the jurisdiction where the assets originate and the level of commitment to climate
change mitigation, considering the reality and particularities of each jurisdiction. The MA program level assessment is then to
be complemented with additional inputs to assess the jurisdiction level of ambition and the likelihood that the combined set of
policies and implementation efforts will achieve the jurisdiction’s stated mitigation goals. Both the level of ambition assessment
and the assessment of the jurisdiction actions credibility are still concepts under development by the World Bank group for a
Networked Carbon Market. It is thought that the level of ambition can be factored in through a level of ambition index that
takes into account economic, social and political parameters. This index would then be a corrective factor to the jurisdiction
climate initiatives credibility accounting also for the expected level of effort of a jurisdiction compared to others.
The assessment of the jurisdiction climate mitigation efforts evaluates the effectiveness of the ongoing actions to achieve
voluntary or mandatory mitigation targets and seeks to confirm the alignment of the different initiatives with the climate change
strategy on climate change, taking into account the results of the jurisdiction GHG inventory and those sectors where more
effort is required. This assessment can be based, for example, on a protocol similar to the one developed for the assessment
at the program level. In this case the quantification of the net effect of the different policies and actions to achieve the climate
mitigation targets can be specially challenging and will broadly depend on the quality and availability of data in the jurisdiction.
In cases where quality data do not exist, the assessment exercise can become a lengthy process of data analysis coming from
very different sources. In better cases, the jurisdiction will have an overview of the different initiatives, its effect quantification
and a method to analyze the cross effects of different policies and actions.

                                      the implementation and MRV processes related to mitigation targets and
                                      interventions
Capacity building                     There are climate change mitigation capacity building actions and programs but
                                      those do not seem to be centrally coordinated or being planned taking into
                                      account the overall jurisdiction priorities

                                      There is no evidence of a capacity building program for climate change actions

                                      The jurisdiction has defined requirements and set mechanisms to ensure
                                      monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of its mitigation goals and targets,
                                      the GHG inventory and climate change mitigation interventions including the
                                      projects, actions, programs, policies. Resources (including financial, staff and
                                      capacity building) are planned and available.
Jurisdiction level MRV system
                                      The jurisdiction has set mechanisms but those seem to be partial, unreliable or
                                      not yet implemented, or there is no evidence of the availability of sufficient
                                      resources
                                      The jurisdiction does not have MRV system provisions in place
                                      The jurisdiction has a system in place for the registry of GHG emissions
                                      reductions from different initiatives under its jurisdiction. This GHG registry
                                      includes inclusion processes that evaluate possible double counting. The GHG
                                      registry is operational.
GHG registry and double counting
                                      A national level registry is designed. Nevertheless, it does not cover all actions
                                      ongoing within the jurisdiction’s jurisdiction or there are not criteria defined to
                                      avoid double counting.
                                      A national level registry does not exist or is not operational

                                 The jurisdiction has accepted a binding GHG emissions mitigation commitment

                                 The jurisdiction has periodically reported its performance against the agreed

                                 targets has consistently improved due to actions taken by the jurisdiction. The
                                 performance against those objectives and targets is periodically evaluated and
                                 deviations assess and a plan to correct the same over time is agreed upon and
                                 executed

Past performance of National     The jurisdiction has periodically reported its performance against the agreed
climate change commitments and   mitigation pledges. The jurisdiction has deployed different instruments to
pledges                          achieve those objectives and has agreed to specific targets. Nevertheless,
                                 there is no evidence of the continuous evaluation of the process and the actions
                                 taken to correct possible deviations.

                                 No mitigation commitments are set as part of the jurisdiction participation in
                                 international climate change negotiations or if exist, there is no evidence on the
                                 actions taken to reach the agreed targets, its planning, execution and
                                 continuous improvement process.

                                 The jurisdiction has designed and implemented a legal framework to ensure the
                                 implementation of actions/interventions towards reaching the agreed mitigation
                                 objectives and targets. The designed top-down framework contains policy and
                                 regulatory elements which has benefited from a bottom-up approach where
                                 inputs have been sought from different stakeholders.
Legal framework for climate      The legal framework includes provisions, as feasible as possible, to protect
change mitigation                these commitments from political changes.
                                 There is a legal framework but there is no evidence of its alignment with the
                                 jurisdiction goals.
                                 There is no evidence of the involvement of stakeholders in the process.

                                 There is not a legal framework yet.
                                 The legal framework has been deployed to different parts of the public and
                                 private sectors through strategy development, planning and evaluation
                                 processes. The jurisdiction goals and targets achievement has been planned
                                 using long term strategic planning (e.g. Multiyear strategy development) and
                                 shorter term implementation planning (egg. Annual or biannual planning
Strategic planning               processes). There is evidence of the deployment of these plans in the public
                                 and private sector.
                                 The planning exercise has been done but there is not a consistent approach to
                                 implementation of the actions agreed across the involved parties
                                 While there are specific goals and targets, these have not been planned at the
                                 long and short term to secure their achievement
                                 There is evidence of the enforcement of the legal framework and actions taken
                                 when there are deviations from the agreed objectives and targets.
Enforcement of legal framework   The enforcement of the legal framework is concentrated in isolated parts of the
                                 economy. Past deviations from critical sectors of the economy are consistently
                                 not addressed.

                                      The jurisdiction's GHG inventory is reported based on internationally accepted
                                      standards and/or UNFCCC standard; and is periodically updated.
Jurisdiction's GHG inventory          The jurisdiction's inventory is not done based on a reliable process or it has not
                                      been updated in the last 5 years
                                      A national inventory has not been updated in the last 10 years

                                      The GHG inventory is the basis for establishing specific mitigation targets.
                                      These specific targets cover different sectors which are the major emitting
                                      sectors as defined by the GHG Inventory. The National objectives and targets

                                      Mitigation targets exist but do not consider future growth scenarios.

                                      sustainable development beyond GHG emissions reduction and the views of

                                      It is possible to map the top down approach connecting the mitigation goals and

                                   The Interventions have been defined to a level that provides a reasonable level

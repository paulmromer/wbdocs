I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Senegal perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Senegal regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Senegal;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Senegal;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Senegal;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Senegal.
    Use data to help inform Senegal country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
Between April and July 2014, 2826 stakeholders of the WBG in Senegal were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; elected members of the
National Assembly; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working on
WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; financial sector/private banks; NGOs; the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks;
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 269 stakeholders participated in the survey
(10% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to face.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Senegal; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Senegal; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’11 (N=396; 54% response rate) and FY’07 (N=143; 34% response rate). Data
were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in three years, which allows for
comparisons among three years. Stakeholder groups which were not present in both fiscal years
were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the “other? stakeholder
category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14 data and the total number of
respondents in three years are slightly different from those of the original data reported in
appendices A, B, C, D, F, G. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison
results, please see appendix E (page 129).
A. General Issues Facing Senegal: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Senegal is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development
   priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): their familiarity with the WBG, its
   effectiveness in Senegal, WBG staff preparedness to help Senegal solve its development
   challenges, the WBG’s local presence, the WBG’s capacity building in Senegal, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the
   WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s
   greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in
   Senegal, and in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Senegal, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Senegal’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the extent
   Senegal received value for the WBG’s fee-based services, the importance for the WBG to be
   involved in thirty one development areas, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across these
   areas, such as public sector governance/reform, education, and agricultural development.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked to rate the contribution of the WBG’s technical assistance to
   solving Senegal’s development challenges.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Senegal: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Senegal and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Senegal, which WBG agencies they work with, their geographic locations, and
   whether they think that the IFC and the World Bank work well together.

  Given the large number of respondents specializing in education, information and communications technology,
and agriculture/rural development/food security, cross-sectoral analyses were conducted to examine if respondents
from these three sectors dominated the overall responses to the multiple choice questions about development
priorities and sectoral areas which can contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the country.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
          Respondents of this year’s Country Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity
           (mean levels of familiarity = 4.8) with the WBG as the respondents in the FY’11 Country
           Survey (mean levels of familiarity = 5.2). But they were significantly less familiar with
           the WBG than respondents in the FY’07 Country Survey (mean levels of familiarity =
           6.2)2.
          Among all stakeholder groups, respondents from ministries/PMUs and consultants were
           most familiar with the WBG, whereas respondents from the media and private
           sector/financial sector/private banks were significantly less familiar with the institution.
          Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of familiarity
           with the WBG.
          Respondents who professionally collaborate with the WBG were significantly more
           familiar (mean levels of familiarity = 6.3) with the institution than those who do not
           collaborate with it (mean levels of familiarity = 3.9).
          Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
           with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Senegal, and significantly,
           moderately correlated with the respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to
           Senegal’s development or its ability to help achieve development results in Senegal.

  NOTE: It is worth pointing out that in FY’07, FY’11 and FY’14, the ratings for effectiveness are significantly,
strongly correlated with the ratings for familiarity (r=.49, p<.001). Therefore, although respondents in FY14 gave
significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in Senegal than those in FY’07, the drop in ratings could be
related to the significantly lower levels of familiarity with the institution in FY14.

Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
      There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in almost all of the thirty one sectoral areas (except “gender equity,?
       “foreign direct investment? and “climate change?). For detailed ratings, please go to
       Appendix B (page 83).
      There were significant geographic differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in eight of the thirty one sectoral areas. Respondents from Dakar tended to
       give significantly lower ratings than respondents from other cities and rural areas for the
       WBG’s effectiveness in these eight areas. The eight areas include:
                Crime and violence;
                Environmental sustainability;
                Disaster management;
                Public sector governance/reform;
                Financial markets;
                Health;
                Rural development; and
                Education
      Respondents across sectoral specialization gave statistically similar ratings for the
       WBG’s effectiveness in all thirty one development areas.
      Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 69) that primarily
       informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
       “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
       areas.

           include: “health,? “domestic private sector development,? “natural resource
           management,? and “social protection.?
          Respondents from the FY’07 Survey had significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s
           effectiveness in “domestic private sector governance? than this year’s respondents.
          However, this year’s respondents gave significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s
           effectiveness in the WBG’s “anti corruption? effort in Senegal than respondents in
           FY’07.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Senegal, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Senegal.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and,
               The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Senegal, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
               The WBG’s effectiveness economic growth;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
               The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Senegal
      Respondents in FY’07, FY’11, and this year’s Country Survey had statistically similar
       ratings for all three aspects of the WBG’s work in Senegal.
      Respondents from ministries/PMUs and consultants working WBG projects had the
       highest levels of agreement with all three statements, whereas respondents from private
       sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower levels of agreement.
      Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
       with all the following three statements about the WBG’s work in Senegal.
      Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with WBG had significantly higher
       levels of agreement with all the following three statements about the WBG’s work in
       Senegal than respondents who do not collaborate with the institution.

The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner (continued)
      There were significant stakeholder differences in the respondents’ ratings for all of the
       WBG’s qualities as an effective development partner. In most cases, respondents from
       ministries/PMUs and consultants working WBG projects had the highest ratings, whereas
       respondents from private sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower
       ratings.
      It is worth mentioning that respondents from CSO gave significantly higher ratings for
       the WBG’s “openness? than respondents from any other stakeholder groups.
      Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar ratings for all of the
       thirteen qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner in Senegal.
      Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher ratings for some of
       the qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner in Senegal than respondents
       who do not collaborate with the institution. These qualities include:
           Being inclusive;
           Staff accessibility;
           Straightforwardness and honesty;
           Ease of access to the people at the WBG who are making decisions important to
             my work;
           Collaboration with groups outside of the Government; and
           The speed in which it gets things accomplished on the ground

Appendix E: Responses to All Questions by Year11
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.
FY’ 07 Number of comparable respondents = 129  FY ’11 Number of comparable respondents = 320
 FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 219
By weighting, FY11, FY 07 and FY14 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

World Bank Group’s effectiveness in Senegal.^
(1-Not effective at all, 10-Very effective) ^Significantly different between FY14 and FY07country surveys
NOTE: It is worth pointing out that in FY07, FY11 and FY14, the ratings for effectiveness are significantly, strongly correlated with the ratings
for familiarity (r=.49, p<.001). Therefore, although respondents in FY14 gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in
Senegal than those in FY07, the drop in ratings could be related to the significantly lower levels of familiarity with the institution in FY14.

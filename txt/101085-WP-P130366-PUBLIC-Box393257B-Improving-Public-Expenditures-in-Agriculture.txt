Foreword

We are pleased to share with you this review of public expenditures on the Mongolian agriculture
sector. The purpose of the review is to analyze the allocation of government resources within the
country’s agriculture sector in order to inform spending priorities and to provide the Ministry of
Industry and Agriculture and other agencies with empirical information that will enable them to
advocate for more and better targeted public funding for agricultural purposes.

This review was carried out under the guidance of the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, and
entailed an extensive analysis of available data and consultations with a variety of stakeholders. It
provides insights into the relative size of the agriculture budget, and the levels, composition,
effectiveness and efficiency of government agriculture expenditures.

The findings point to a number of serious issues inhibiting the effective and efficient management
of sector expenditures. These include limited capacity for planning and budgeting on the part of the
staff of the Ministry, as well as limited capability to monitor and evaluate budgetary performance or
outcomes. Agricultural research and extension is underfunded, and donor coordination is weak.
Local officials are insufficiently engaged in the planning and budgeting of sector programs. Based in
part on these findings, the report presents a number of recommendations for the government to
consider in resolving these issues.

The review is enriched by contributions from seasoned experts in the field of agriculture and public
expenditure management, including experts from major development partners operating in the
sector. It is comprehensive in its scope and content and can serve as a living document to guide
resource allocation and expenditure management decisions in the Mongolia’s agriculture sector.

The main message of the report is that as Mongolia continues to work towards achieving its
agricultural objectives, there is a need for policies aimed at increasing agricultural production and
productivity to be driven by sustained allocation of public sector resources to the sector. The World
Bank is committed to working closely with the Government of Mongolia to improve public
expenditures in agriculture. With continued attention to improving public spending in agriculture,
sustained progress in agricultural growth and poverty reduction can be achieved for the people of
Mongolia.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BACKGROUND

The objective of the agricultural sector public expenditure review (AgPER) was to examine the
efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural sector expenditures in Mongolia. It was carried out at the
request of the Department of Strategic Policy and Planning (DSPP), Ministry of Industry and
Agriculture (MIA). The World Bank Group (WBG) collaborated with the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the DSPP under the overall direction and oversight
of the Director General (DG) of DSPP.

The AgPER provides policy makers with a better understanding of: (a) trends in the level and
composition of public expenditures in agriculture over the past five to ten years; (b) the economic
and functional composition of agriculture expenditures; (c) the budget processes and performance in
the agriculture sector; (d) issues inhibiting the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures in
agriculture.

To achieve this objective a two dimensional (spending allocations and technical efficiency) analysis
of the efficiency of government expenditure on agriculture was conducted. The efficiency of
spending allocations was considered through an analysis of the economic and functional
composition of sector expenditures. Public spending on agriculture in Mongolia was also compared
with that in other countries in the region and elsewhere in the world, particularly countries with
similar climatic conditions.

KEY FINDINGS

Relative size of the agriculture expenditures

Agriculture has performed remarkably well over the past decade although a very small proportion of the national
budget is allocated to the sector. At the national level, agriculture’s contribution to gross domestic product
(GDP) measured in nominal MNT has averaged around 17.4 percent compared with other
important sectors in the Mongolian economy such as mining and quarrying (19.6 percent),
manufacturing (6.2 percent), wholesale and retail (8.2 percent), and construction (2.2 percent). At the
sector level, agricultural GDP (AgGDP) measured in nominal MNT increased by 80 percent from
2002 to 2012, spurred by a sustained increase in crop and livestock outputs. Despite this remarkable
performance, the share of the national budget allocated to agriculture (excluding forestry and
fisheries) averaged just 2.4 percent over the period 2003-2012. Over the same period, agriculture
expenditure as a share of GDP averaged only 1.1 percent.

Spending on agricultural research and development (R&D) is low. Public spending on R&D, (MIA and STF
combined) amounted to MNT2.86 billion in 2008, which represented 7 percent of total agriculture
spending, excluding fisheries and forestry. This figure decreased to MNT2.17billion in 2009 and

                                                      1
increased steadily to a peak of MNT5.04 billion in 2012. It then declined to MNT3.67 billion,
representing only 2.5 percent of total agriculture sector spending. As a share of agricultural GDP,
expenditure on agricultural R&D represented 0.4 percent in 2008 and 0.5 percent in 2012.

Level of agriculture expenditures

The basis for budgetary allocations to MIA departments are often unclear. Because the Ministry’s expenditure
statement does not break down budgets by department, it is difficult to determine on what basis
budgetary allocations to various departments within MIA are made. A bulk allocation is made to the
entire Ministry. For effective and efficient accounting and reporting of sector expenditures, this
allocation should be broken down to capture all departments and divisions within MIA. Also,
despite the increased fiscal responsibility following the recently approved Integrated Budget Law
(IBL), there are disproportionately small allocations to the decentralized agricultural units in the 21
aimags. The majority of the expenditures go to paying salaries and wages. In 2013, budgetary
allocations to the 21 aimags amounted to only MNT4.6 billion (1.6 percent) of the total sector
budget.

Annual growth in the agricultural budget in nominal terms has been volatile over the past decade. In 2004 the
agriculture budget grew by 11.7 percent. It grew by 0.9 percent in 2005, 36.4 percent in 2006, 112.6
percent in 2007, and 127.1 percent in 2008. It then declined by 24.6 percent in 2009, increased by 71
percent in 2010, and by 120.6 percent in 2011. It declined again by 24.6 percent in 2012, and
increased by 56.6 percent in 2013. Recent increases in subsidies and transfers expenditures
accounted for part of the volatility in the agricultural budget. Subsidies constitute the bulk of the
recurrent budget relative to other items such as goods and services.1

Limited information about donor off-budget expenditures (commitments) in the agriculture sector. Although a
number of donors support MIA agricultural operations, information about how these resources are
spent is difficult to obtain in the Ministry. Four donors in particular account for about 76 percent of
total donor expenditures in the agriculture sector; FAO, IFAD, the Swiss Development
Corporation, and the World Bank. Together, the four have commitments amounting to US$57
million out of total donor commitments of US$75 million between 2012 and 2016. This US$75
million in donor off-budget commitments amounts to about 26 percent of the total sector budget.

Mongolia spends a smaller percentage of its GDP on agriculture than comparable middle income countries in Asia
and elsewhere. Despite its relatively higher agricultural value added of 17 percent of GDP, Mongolia
spends proportionately less on agriculture than China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Cape Verde,
and Paraguay. Mongolia spends a lower percentage of its national budget on agriculture than India,
China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

Economic and Functional Composition of Agriculture Expenditures

Economic composition of agriculture expenditures shows the dominance of capital expenditures against current
expenditures. Capital expenditures have more than doubled compared with current expenditures over
the period 2003-2013. The increase in capital expenditures is driven largely by the GoM’s investment
in new construction (wells, water systems, veterinary and sanitary laboratories, disinfection facilities,
etc.), acquisition of equipment, feasibility studies, design, and capital repairs (operation and
maintenance). MIA earmarked MNT 157.8 billion for capital investments between 2012 and 2017.
About 49.9 percent of its budget was allocated for capital expenditures in 2013. Yet the 1.9 percent
of the capital budget that was allocated to operation and maintenance in 2013 is insufficient to
sustain these investments.

Allocations to current expenditures are skewed towards subsidies and transfers. Disaggregation of current
expenditures shows an imbalance between allocations to subsidies and transfers compared to current
expenditures such as salaries and wages, and goods and services. Expenditures on subsidies and
transfers grew from a modest 0.5 percent of total current expenditures in 2003 to 57.6 percent in
2013. This growth was driven by the government policy of supporting crop and livestock
production, including agro-based enterprises and wheat farmers.

Expenditures by functional categories show underfunding of core public goods in the sector. MIA allocated 16
percent of its 2013 budget to livestock disease control and 11 percent to planning and policy. Core
public goods such as research and development (R&D) and advisory services are comparatively
underfunded, together receiving 4 percent of the national budget. In Kazakhstan by comparison, 5
percent of the national budget went to research and extension services in the same year. Sector
budgets are not aligned with development priorities, and there is a significant divergence between
the activities funded by the MIA and those described in the Agriculture Sector Development
Strategy Paper (ASDSP). The ASDSP has not been fully referred to in the preparation of the annual
budget.

Agricultural research institutes and extension services are underfunded. The research institutes receive most of
their funding from the Ministry of Education and Science-managed Science and Technology Fund
(STF) rather than from the MIA. More than 59.2 percent of this funding is used to pay salaries and
wages, and proportionately very little is used as direct support to research. The disbursement of
funds to the research institutes is moreover sporadic owing in large part to the intermittent meetings
of the Inter-Ministerial Committee that is the approving body of the STF. This situation has
hampered the research institutes’ ability to undertake effective research for agricultural development.




                                                       3
Budget processes and performance

The basis for allocating budget to capital investment programs is hard to determine . It is difficult to ascertain the
basis on which the allocations to capital investment programs are made in the investment budget,
although most of the activities are sector priorities. Budgetary allocations are made on a historical
basis rather than on realistic costing of all investment activities in the sector. Moreover, it is unclear
whether the previous year’s investment activities are reviewed before the budget is prepared. MIA
needs to adopt a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) approach to help improve its
planning and budgeting.

Need to develop financial management capacity in MIA. The staff of the Ministry’s Finance and Investment
Division (FID) lack financial management and analytical skills and this has translated into
substandard documentation, recording, and accounting for sector expenditures. Available
expenditure data at FID show gaps with respect to planned and actual expenditures. Some years
have virtually no figures. This situation makes tracking sector expenditures extremely difficult. For
example, expenditure data on the important vaccination and animal care program are difficult to
obtain despite increased level of allocations to the program.

Underspending of the annual budget despite overall high budget execution rates. MIA’s budget execution
performance is quite good with an average of over 90 percent of the budget executed during the
2003-2011 period. However, a detailed analysis of budget outturns revealed widespread
underspending in individual expenditure categories, which suggests the existence of financial
management and analytical capacity constraints. FID does not carry out analysis of budget
execution. The division lacks staff with the analytical skills to properly examine budget execution
performance, including disaggregating the various components (obligations, commitments, and
payments) of budget execution. There is a need to strengthen the financial management and
analytical capacity of FID staff to enable them to effectively carry out activities related to
documentation, reporting, and accounting for agricultural spending.

Budget outcomes monitoring

Limited capacity for monitoring and evaluation in MIA. Sector programs and projects are not effectively
monitored and evaluated due to lack of human resource capacity in the Monitoring and Evaluation
and Internal Audit Department (MEIAD). The department has enormous responsibilities covering
the whole country, but it does not have the required number of staff with the requisite skills. There
are currently only 10 staff members, including the Director General. The situation does not allow
for proper evaluation of projects based on internationally accepted evaluation criteria: relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. The department can only perform spot checks with little or no
detailed performance assessment.




                                                          4
Lack of linkages between MEIAD and FID has had a significant impact on expenditure documentation, reporting,
and analysis. The limited exchange of information between the FID and the MEIAD has resulted in
poor documentation and accounting of sector expenditures. Improved interaction between the two
departments is required to ensure effective information flow for budget execution performance
analysis and impact evaluation. This will improve transparency, accountability, and budget outcomes.

Effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures

Inadequate mechanisms for monitoring the vaccination program. A review of the vaccination program
implementation showed that the program has helped increase livestock production through a
significant reduction in livestock mortality in recent years. However, there is little evidence of a
sound monitoring and supervision mechanism in place to track progress, and vaccination
expenditures have not been properly accounted for. This makes it difficult to assess impacts of
public expenditures on the disease control program.

Lack of coordination of various programs in MIA. Poor coordination, lack of local ownership of central
government programs, and weak communication and coordination between the central ministry and
its offices in the aimags and soums have contributed to poor implementation of programs at the local
level. Budget formulation and payment are made by the central government, which has little or no
information about the needs at the local level. This situation is due to top-down and vertical
reporting structure of the intergovernmental fiscal systems. It is expected that the new Integrated
Budget Law (IBL) will address most of these issues as the local governments are now given more
fiscal responsibilities.

Technical efficiency of public expenditures is constrained. The slow procurement process has led to delays in
the execution of infrastructural projects. In addition, technical staff at aimag and soum levels are
unable to undertake effective supervision of projects owing to a lack of resources. Despite these challenges,
significant progress has been made in the provision of infrastructure such as irrigation and wells, which have
helped increase crop production. To sustain development outcomes resulting from increased investment in
infrastructure, the MIA will need to improve management, supervision, and coordination, and establish
simplified procurement procedures to reduce delays. It will also need to increase number of staff who is
capable of performing quality appraisals.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

The outcome of the review reveals several constraints to effectiveness and efficiency of public
expenditures in the Mongolia’s agriculture sector, despite improved performance in recent years.
These issues include: (a) limited levels of funding for agriculture despite its significant contribution
to the economy; (b) limited O&M expenditures which are not commensurate with the overall
increase in investment and capital expenditures; (c) imbalance between allocations to subsidies and
transfers relative to goods and services; (d) lack of funding for research and development and
extensions services; (e) limited financial management and analytical capacity of staff of FID (f)

                                                      5
inadequate staff with skills in program evaluation in the MEIAD, which inhibits the department’s
ability to carry out effective monitoring and evaluation of sector programs; and (g) limited
involvement of the local authorities in the planning and budgeting of sector programs. The
following summarizes recommendations for policy consideration.

       Increase the share of the national budget used to support agriculture. Increasing
        agriculture’s share of the national budget relative to other key economic sectors will enable
        it to contribute more to national output and to better fulfill its catalytic role as a driver of
        economic development.
       Increase the operation and maintenance budget. Increasing budgetary allocations to
        operation and maintenance (O&M) budget relative to the overall capital budget will ensure
        the sustainability of capital investments in the sector. The current underfunding of the
        O&M budget threatens to undermine the sustainability of these investments.
       Strike a balance between budgetary allocations to subsidies and transfers and goods
        and services, and develop a clear framework for subsidies, including an exit strategy and
        ongoing review of how efficient those subsidies are in correcting market failures and in
        achieving other goals.
       Increase support to institutions responsible for agricultural research and extension.
        Increasing investment in these public goods will not only encourage the generation of new
        technologies and the adoption of new and existing technologies by producers, but can also
        help to create an enabling environment that encourages private sector investment in
        agriculture. This will require the GOM to address the bottlenecks that limit the flow of
        funds to the research institutes, by among other things, reforming the Science and
        Technology Fund (STF) committee, which is responsible for approving research funds in
        the country.
       Strengthen financial management capabilities and analytical skills of the staff of
        FID and budget managers in order to address current weaknesses in recording,
        analyzing, and accounting for sector expenditures in the MIA.
       Adequately resource the Department of Monitoring and Evaluation and Internal
        Audit with staff that possess skills and expertise in program monitoring and evaluation to
        improve monitoring of budget outcomes and performance. The staff will need the capacity
        to apply the widely-accepted standard monitoring and evaluation criteria of relevance,
        effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. This will entail sponsoring regular training and capacity
        building interventions to upgrade the skills of MEIAD staff in budget monitoring and
        evaluation.
       Carry out a value-for-money analysis to extensively document program impacts
        and outcomes through Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) or Benefit
        Incidence Analyses (BIA) to document detailed information on the movement of funds

                                                      6
    and program impacts on beneficiaries at all levels of the agricultural services delivery
    system.
   Improve planning and budgeting by developing and implementing a sector MTEF
    to detail the cost of programs at all levels and determine funding requirements,
    which will provide the basis for allocating sector resources to investment programs.
   Establish an effective mechanism for monitoring disease control and vaccination
    programs in soums to address the weaknesses in the current system of monitoring the
    vaccination program.

1     INTRODUCTION


1.1 Background, objective and rationale

1.        This agricultural sector public expenditure review (AgPER) was carried out as part of the
overall agricultural sector review under the auspices of the Department of Strategic Policy and
Planning (DSPP) of the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture (MIA) and the World Bank (WB) in
Mongolia. During the latter part of 2011, the Government of Mongolia (GoM) requested the World
Bank to assist it in carrying out a study of the various agricultural subsidy programs to enable it to
understand the impacts of the programs on agricultural development in the country. An initial
literature review revealed other issues and knowledge gaps throughout the entire sector. For this
purpose, the MIA and WB agreed to look beyond the subsidy issue and expand the scope of the
review to other related areas which may also constrain the development of the agriculture sector in
the country.

2.      The AgPER was, therefore, conceived as one of the studies of the overall agriculture sector
review. The WB collaborated with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations in carrying out this AgPER study. The study was, therefore, a collaborative effort of DSPP
of MIA, the WB, and FAO. It was undertaken under the overall direction and oversight of the
Director General (DG) of the DSPP.

3.      The AgPER2 study aims to provide policy makers with a better understanding of: (i) trends in
the level and composition of public expenditures in agriculture over the past five to ten years; (ii) the
economic and functional composition of agriculture expenditures; (iii) an overview of budget
processes and performance in the agriculture sector; and (v) issues inhibiting the effectiveness and
efficiency of public expenditures in Mongolian agriculture in order to make recommendations for
addressing them.

1.2 Approach, methodology and data limitations

4.      A two-pronged approach, involving stakeholder consultations and desk review, was used in
conducting the review. The study team engaged in consultations with public institutions within and
outside MIA, macro level public institutions and Development Partners (DPs) active in the sector.

2
   The AgPER was conducted in an exceptionally inflationary environment. Inflation pressures continue to build and have
averaged around 12.5 percent reflecting expansionary fiscal policy. Consumer price increases remained in double digits during
the early part of 2014. The national consumer price index in January 2014 increased by 1.7 percent compared to December 2013,
and by 12.3 percent compared to the same period in the previous year the increases in CPI were mainly due to the price increase
of food and non-alcoholic beverages by 3.4 percent, transport by 2.5 percent. (Source: National Statistics Office (NSO).
Expenditures used throughout the report are in nominal values.




                                                              8
Within MIA, the team interviewed departmental heads as well as two subnational (aimag) agricultural
institutions. At the macro level, key frontline officials of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), National
Statistics Office (NSO), Ministry of Economy and Development (MED), and National Procurement
Agency (NPA) were extensively consulted. The team also engaged in discussions with stakeholders
in the Ministry of Education and Science (MOES), particularly its Science and Technology Fund
(STF)3 department. The aim was to capture agricultural research expenditures managed outside MIA. In
Mongolia, all the agricultural research institutes are under the MOES, and therefore, receive a
substantial proportion of their funds from the MOES budget managed through the Science and
Technology Fund. They, however, work under MIA at the operational level.

5.      The methodology used in the analysis hinges on identifying evidence of the relative size of
the agriculture budget, levels of agricultural expenditures, the composition of agriculture
expenditures, and the execution of sector expenditures in order to determine their effectiveness and
efficiency. To this end, various key expenditure indicators were computed from different data
sources, mainly from the MoF and MIA. The expenditure indicators that were estimated include
agriculture expenditure as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), agriculture expenditure as a
share of agricultural GDP, spending on agriculture research and development (R&D) as a share of
GDP and of agricultural GDP, share of current and capital expenditures in total sector budget, share
of wages and nonwage recurrent expenditures to total sector budget, share of allocated funds to
approved budget etc.

6.       Against the backdrop of the above indicators, the analysis considered the efficiency of
expenditures by taking into account spending allocations across sectors through an examination of
expenditures on agriculture relative to the major key sectors of the economy. Efficiency of
government expenditure on agriculture was undertaken from two perspectives: (i) spending
allocations and (ii) technical efficiency. The efficiency of spending allocations was considered
through an analysis of the economic and functional composition of sector expenditures.

7.      With regard to the economic classification of expenditures, a disaggregation of expenditure
data was carried out to ascertain the important components of current and capital expenditures and
their respective shares of the sector budget. A functional decomposition of expenditures was also
undertaken to ascertain the extent of budgetary allocations to functions such as public goods and
other matters. Functional allocations were also aligned with sector objectives and priorities. The
approach to the analysis of technical efficiency was mainly based on discussions with the staff of the
monitoring and evaluation department of MIA, a review of existing literature, and observations of
the mechanism for the implementation of the disease control (livestock vaccination) program in two
aimags (provinces) of the country. This entailed a discussion with the aimag agricultural officials, and
the review of available documents on program impacts. Off-budget public expenditure on R&D and

several sectors, including agriculture.

expenditures for major donors in the sector was also reviewed. MIA’s budget preparation process
was reviewed in line with the GoM’s budget preparation guidelines and timelines. Finally,
international comparison of public expenditures was undertaken to allow for a comparison of
Mongolia’s public spending on agriculture with countries in the region and elsewhere in the world,
particularly countries with similar climatic conditions as Mongolia such as Kazakhstan and the
Kyrgyz Republic in order to draw practical lessons for Mongolia.

8.      The review was limited by a paucity of expenditure data and related information, particularly
at MIA level. At the Ministry level, available expenditure data was not only limited by period (2008-
2013), but also by several gaps in the figures provided. In view of this situation, the review relied
largely on expenditure figures obtained from the MoF and data from NSO official records, which
cover a period of ten years, and blended them with those of MIA. It must be noted that the period
of the analysis varies depending on whether data was obtained from MoF or MIA. Where data was
obtained from MoF, a ten-year period was considered, and a three-year period or a five-year period
was used for data obtained from MIA. Data limitations, coupled with the short duration of the field
work, also inhibited the team’s ability to undertake a thorough downstream analysis of budget
execution performance and outcomes as well as of the technical efficiency of expenditures.

1.3 Structure of the report

9.       The report is structured as follows. The Introduction followed by Section 2 provides an
overview of government policies and priorities. Section 3 reviews agriculture sector performance by
analyzing output by subsector, and the sector’s contribution to the national economy in terms of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including a comparison of agriculture’s share of the national
budget with those of other sectors of the Mongolian economy. Section 4 analyzes the level and
composition of agriculture sector expenditures by looking at trends in budgetary allocations to the
agricultural sector in terms of the national budget and GDP. The section also compares Mongolia’s
spending on agriculture with countries of similar per capita income both in Asia and other regions of
the world. Section 5 analyzes the economic composition of Mongolia’s agriculture sector
expenditures by disaggregating spending into current and capital expenditures and also by comparing
these two categories of expenditures to their share of the sector budget. Section 6 introduces the
reader to an analysis of the functional composition of sector expenditures from two dimensions (a)
the level of budgetary allocations by functional areas such R&D, extension services, and physical
infrastructure; subsidies and (b) the alignment of budgetary allocations with sector development
priorities. Section 7 provides an overview of the levels of spending on R&D and extension services.
Section 8 describes MIA’s budget process and performance, which include budget preparation,
budget execution, and budget outcomes monitoring. Section 9 provides an overview of the
effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures in agriculture. Section 10 outlines conclusions
and policy recommendations drawn from the findings of the review. The annexes provide data
sources for both program impacts and core expenditures use for the analysis.

2    OVERVIEW OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRIORITIES


10.     The GoM has positioned agriculture as one of the key pillars of its poverty reduction
strategy, as spelt out in the National Development Strategy (Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)-
based Comprehensive National Development, Strategy (MCNDS) of Mongolia.4

11.     The MCNDS aims to develop agriculture and the food industry into a modern agricultural
and industrial complex by making the two sectors more competitive and productive, increasing
overall production and ensuring a sufficient supply of food to meet the needs of the population. It
also aims to improve their ability to manage and mitigate risks. Phase1 (2007-2015) of the Strategy
outlines the following objectives for agriculture:

           Strategic objective 1: Develop both nomadic and intensive animal husbandries taking
            into account regional peculiarities, outbreak and spread of contagious animal diseases;
            increase production, processing and export of animal products.
           Strategic objective 2. Increase crop-farming production by improving land use,
            developing irrigation and introducing biotechnology.
           Strategic objective 3. Introduce advanced technology in food processing and products’
            competitiveness.
           Strategic objective 4. Improve water supply for crop-farming and pastures; increase
            water reserves to meet the needs of the rural population:
           Strategic objective 5. Revive and develop fodder production by improving fodder
            quality, nourishment, and increasing its supply and sufficiency:
           Strategic objective 6. Introduce advanced technology to protect soil erosion, preserve
            soil fertility, and reduce the loss of humidity in crop-farming.

12.     Phase 2 (2016-2021) builds upon the objectives of phase 1 with two main strategic
objectives:

           Strategic objective 1. Introduce biotechnology, improve livestock breeds, and increase
            the volume of crop yield; and
           Strategic objective 2. Set proper sanitary and hygienic standards for food production
            and services at all levels of food consumption; and increase the population’s access to
            safe and sufficient amount of foodstuffs.

                                                    11
13.      Based on these MCNDS objectives, the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy Paper
(ASDSP) 2006-2016 was developed. The objective of the ASDSP is to (i) achieve competitiveness in
changing markets, (ii) reduce vulnerability to risk, and (iii) ensure the sustainability of sector
resources. It also outlines key strategic programs and activities to promote growth, increase
productivity, and reduce vulnerability. The ASDSP classifies the programs and activities into three
main initiatives: (i) livestock subsector initiatives; (ii) crop subsector initiatives; and (iii) sector-wide
initiatives.

14.     In addition to the MCNDS and ASDSP, the National Program for Food Safety (NPFS) was
developed in 2011. The overall objective of this Program is to enable healthy livelihoods by ensuring
a sustainable supply of nutritious, hygienically assured, and accessible food to the population by
creating locally and internationally competitive food, and building new economic capacity through
the creation of a national organic brand of food. The Program consists of four components: (i)
create an enabling legal, economic, and organizational environment for ensuring food safety; (ii)
ensure a stable supply of nutritious, hygienically assured, and accessible food to the population, and
increase the proportion of processed food; (iii) improve the monitoring and information network to
ensure the quality of food products and drinking water; and (iv) improve quality of nutritious food
by supporting adequate healthy diets to reduce nutrition deficiency, and prevent non-communicable
chronic diseases.

15.      Finally, a Mongolia Livestock Program (MLP) was prepared recognizing the importance of
the subsector to the livelihoods of the herder population and to the overall economy. The objectives
of the NLP are to: (i) develop a livestock sector that is adaptable to changing climatic and social
conditions and create an environment where the subsector is economically viable and competitive in
the market economy; (ii) provide a safe and healthy food supply to the population; (iii) deliver
quality raw materials to processing industries; and (iv) increase exports.

16.     The above policies and priorities provide the basis for government spending in the
agriculture sector, which is the focus of this review.

3    REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE


3.1 Agriculture in the context of the national economy

17.     The agriculture sector’s contribution to the economy compares favorably with other
sectors of the Mongolian economy. Agriculture, including forestry and fisheries, has contributed
an average 17.1 percent of GDP, compared to sectors such as mining and quarrying (19.6 percent),
wholesale and retail (8.2 percent), manufacturing (6.2 percent), and construction (2.2 percent) over
the past decade. In 2002, agriculture’s
contribution to GDP (18.9 percent)
was higher than wholesale and retail by
8.4 percentage points; mining and
quarrying       by      9.6     percent;
manufacturing by 12.5 percent; and
construction by 16.1 percent. Although
fluctuating slightly between 2002 and
2005, the sector’s contribution
increased steadily from 17.6 percent in
2006 and peaked at 19.2 percent in

2008 but fell consistently to 12.3 Agriculture has contributed an average 17.1 percent
percent in 2011, driven by the effects of Mongolia's GDP.
of the dzud weather on livestock production (see annex 3 for details). Figure 1 reflects the contributions
of the respective economic sectors to GDP over the decade from 2002 to 2012.

18.     In absolute terms, agriculture, including forestry and fisheries, contributes an
average MNT 674.8 billion to GDP compared with mining and quarrying (MNT678.8
billion) and manufacturing (MNT237.6 billion). Between 2007 and 2009, agriculture overtook
these two sectors, but its contribution dropped significantly in 2010 as a result of the effects of the
dzud, which severely hit the sector. In recent years, agriculture has picked up markedly contributing
MNT 801.3 billion to GDP in 2012, compared with mining and quarrying (MNT861.5 billion) and
manufacturing (MNT295.2 billion) in the same year. Table 1 shows trends in absolute value
contributions, in nominal terms, to GDP by the five major economic sectors over the 2002-2012
period.

19.     Agriculture’s remarkable contribution to the national output has been spurred by
performance within the sector – and by livestock in particular. An analysis of the composition
of agricultural GDP reveals the dominance of the livestock subsector, which accounted for about
85.5 percent of total agricultural GDP (AgGDP) in 2011 as indicated in the trend line in figure 2
below. Livestock contributed 93.0 percent in 2005, but its contribution fell slightly to 91.8 in 2006
and then increased to 92.7 in 2007. Thereafter, livestock’s contribution has been declining steadily
from 90.7 in 2008 to 85.5 percent in 2011 as the crop sub-sector’s contribution increased. Crops
have shown a steady increase in their contribution to AgGDP relative to livestock since. The steady
growth in crop output also reflects the GoM’s current policy objective of achieving self-sufficiency
in food supply in Mongolia as stated in strategic objective 2 of Mongolia MDG-based Comprehensive
National Development Strategy (MCNDS 2008). The GoM has increased investments in irrigation
systems and agricultural machinery to support crop production in addition to subsidies. The total
number of irrigation systems established from 2008 to 2011 amounted to 215. This effort has led to
an increase of 19,800 hectares of area under irrigation over the same period (annex 2). This in turn
has also led to an increase in production and supply of major agricultural crops (annex 1). Figure 2
shows recent trends in the composition of AgGDP.

20.       In absolute terms, the livestock subsector has historically contributed substantially to
AgGDP compared with crops and fisheries subsectors. Livestock alone contributed MNT 557.8
billion in nominal values in 2005; thereafter, its contribution increased steadily to MNT 1,083.0
billion in 2008, but fell to MNT 999.7 billion and MNT955.7 billion in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
The fall in the livestock’s contribution to AgGDP was attributable mainly to dzud weather, which
killed an estimated 10.3 million animals in 2009 and 2010. Table 2 compares the composition of
agriculture sector GDP over the period 2005-2011.

national budget has been fairly stable over the period 2004-2013, and has averaged only 2.4 percent,
1.7 percentage points less than mining, manufacturing and construction (4.1 percent). It is higher or
equal to energy and heating (2.4 percent), greater than transport and communication and housing
and community amenities by 1.1 and 1.4 percentage points respectively. Table 3 shows percentage
allocations of the national budget by sector.

22.      Over the same period, agriculture’s share of the national budget, in absolute terms, has
averaged MNT 90.4 billion compared with sectors such as mining, manufacturing and construction
(MNT138.3 billion), energy and heating (MNT84.7 billion), transport and communication
(MNT53.8), and housing and community amenities (MNT42.9 billion). Table 4 compares the
allocation of the national budget by sector from 2004 to 2013.

23.     In spite of the limited investments, MNT90.4 billion (US$512.8million) as noted in table 4
above, compared with US$1.6 billion in Kazakhstan, agriculture continues to perform reasonably
well. Its contribution to GDP has remained stable and has even overtaken some sectors. More
investment is likely to spur additional growth.

3.2 Trends in gross agricultural output

24.      The Mongolian agriculture sector has witnessed a
remarkable performance in recent years after having been
hit by the dzud weather in 2009/2010 (see annex 1 for
detailed data on key agricultural outputs). As shown in
figure 3, gross agricultural output increased by 30.4 percent
from MNT 1,297.5 billion in 2007 to MNT 1,691.6 billion in
2008. Thereafter, growth in output slowed down by an
average 1.8 percent between 2008 and 2010. But it picked
up significantly by 17.2 percentage points from MNT
1,752.5 billion in 2010 to MNT 2,053.7 billion in 2011.
Overall, there has been a steady growth in output although
that growth was slow between 2009 and 2010 due to a drop
in livestock production from MNT 1,307.7 in 2009 to MNT
1,290.7 in 2010. The livestock subsector revamped after the
dzud as a result of the implementation of the GoM’s policy
measures through investments in animals and through the                                 Mongolia's agriculture sector has
                                                                                        witnessed a remarkable
implementation of the MLP(see annex 3), and targeted                                    performance in recent years.

Livestock Conservation Fund (LCF).5 Gross livestock output rose from MNT 1,290.7 billion in
2010 to MNT 1,505.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of about 16.6 per cent.

25.     The positive trend in gross agricultural output has also been boosted by a sustained
increase in crop production. Although crop production represents a smaller percentage of the
gross agricultural output than livestock production, it has grown steadily over the same period. Crop
output increased from MNT 172.7 in 2007 to MNT 548.4 in 2011 (figure 3). This performance of
the crop sector is attributable to the GoM’s recent agriculture support policies mainly through
subsidies and transfers to major crops such as wheat, managed through the Crop Protection Fund
(CPF) at MIA.6 Over the period, the GoM dramatically increased subsidies expenditures (see section
5.1 for a detailed analysis of composition of current expenditures). The GoM has also provided
technical support in the form of subsidized soft loans for the acquisition of machinery and inputs,
including adoption of new technologies to increase agricultural productivity all in fulfillment of the
Government’s objective of attaining food self-sufficiency (see Annex 1 for data on production and
supply of major crops supported by the GoM). Overall, these policies seem to be working well, with
positive trends in gross agricultural output of the two subsectors (figure 3).

4   LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF AGRICULTURAL EXPENDITURES


4.1 Trends in Agriculture Sector Expenditures

26.     A great number of government agencies and institutions benefit from public sector
resource allocation. In Mongolia, MIA is responsible for managing agriculture sector expenditures.
In addition, other autonomous and semi-autonomous agencies such as the State Property
Committee (SPC), the Department of Veterinary and Animal Breeding (DVAB), the National
Animal Gene Bank (NAGB), the Interprovincial Pastureland Management Authority (IPPMA), the
National Agricultural Extension Center (NAEC), the Crop Production Support Fund (CPSF), the
Livestock Conservation Fund (LCF), the State Central Laboratory for Veterinary and Sanitary
Service (SCLVSS), the State Veterinary Laboratory for Certification of Veterinary Drugs and
Vaccines (SLCVDV), and the Small and Medium Enterprises Agency (SMEA) received agriculture-
related public expenditures. Expenditures on these institutions go to support agricultural policy
development, management and coordination. Budgetary allocations to these activities, excluding
donor funding, increased from MNT 6.2 billion in 2008 to MNT 12.0 billion in 2013. The 21
provincial (aimag) agricultural departments (PAD) and 330 soums benefit from public expenditures in
agriculture (see section on paragraph 32 below).

27.      The total allocations to agricultural policy development, management, and coordination are
distributed among the agencies mentioned above. Of these agencies, the SMEA received an average
of 58.8 percent of the total budget for agricultural policy development, management, and
coordination over 2008-2013 period, followed by MIA (24.6 percent). These two agencies together
received an average of 78.6 percent of the total budget over the same period. The rest of the
agencies received an average less than 10 percent during the period under review.7 In 2013, the
highest recipients of the sector budget were SMEA (52.1 percent) and MIA (24.6). The largest share
of SMEA signifies the GoM’s policy direction of encouraging investments in small and medium
enterprises in the agricultural sector as stated in the MCNDS. Table 5 shows trends in budgetary
allocations to key agricultural institutions/agencies over the period from 2008 to 2013.

28.      MIA budget statements do not reflect how budget is allocated to the different departments
and divisions within the Ministry, which receives a single annual lump sum allocation. This makes it
difficult to establish how much was allocated to the various administrative departments and
divisions that constitute MIA. For effective planning, budgeting and expenditure management, and
to improve transparency and accountability of sector resources, MIA must show clearly in its annual
budgets the amount of budgetary allocations to its own departments and divisions.

29.    Over the past ten years (2004-2013)8 annual growth in budgetary allocations to MIA
have been largely positive. Aside from fiscal year 2009 and 2012, when the Ministry’s approved
budget decreased by 11.7 and 24.6 percent respectively, the annual growth rate of the approved
budget has been consistently positive, albeit volatile, with the highest growth occurring in fiscal year
2008. In 2004, the agriculture budget grew by 11.7 percent. This rate of growth declined to 0.9
percent in 2005, increased to 36.4 percent in 2006, 112.6 percent in 2007, and 127.1 percent in 2008.
In 2009, the rate of growth fell to 24.6 percent. Thereafter, it rose to 71.0 percent in 2010 and to

120.6 percent in 2011, fell to 24.6 percent in 2012, and rebounded to 56.6 percent in 2013. The
AgPER team could not obtain reasons for the volatile trend of the annual growth rate of the budget,
but recent increases in subsidies and transfers expenditures could be the key factor for this trend. An
analysis of agricultural sector subsidies conducted as part of the overall sector review shows that
subsidies to key subsectors averaged as follows: crops (15%), wheat (50%), and livestock (4%) over
the period 2008-2012 (see annex 3 for analysis table).9 Figure 4 shows the annual growth rate of
budgetary allocations to MIA.

30.      Budgetary allocations to agriculture are small relative to the national budget and
GDP. In 2012, the share of the national budget allocated to agriculture, excluding forestry and
fisheries, was about 1.4 percent. Between 2003 and 2012, agriculture’s share of the national budget
fluctuated, with the largest share (2.9 percent) occurring in 2011. Similarly, agriculture expenditure as
a share of GDP has been relatively low over the same period. In 2012, agriculture expenditure as a
percentage of GDP was only 1.7 percent, a decline from 3.2 percent in 2011. Figure 5 shows trends
in agriculture expenditure as a share of the national budget and as a percentage of GDP.

31.     Public spending on agriculture is low relative to comparable middle income
countries in Asia and elsewhere. To inform policy makers about the level and size of government
spending on agriculture by international standards, the AgPER team estimated Mongolia’s key
agricultural expenditure performance ratios and compared them with eight other countries in Asia
and elsewhere: China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Paraguay. Each of them
spends a higher percentage of their total
GDP on agriculture than Mongolia.
Also, Mongolia spends a lower
percentage of its national budget on
agriculture     than     India,     China,
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand
despite having relatively a higher
agricultural value-added.10 In relation to
AgGDP, Mongolia spends less on
agriculture than all the countries. Table

32.    Budgetary allocations are concentrated at the center. Total budgetary allocations to the
21 aimags and the city of Ulaanbaatar amounted to MNT 4.6 billion in 2013, representing 1.6 percent
of the total agriculture sector budget, compared with MNT 13.4 billion for MIA and the
autonomous agencies. Most of this budget will be executed by the aimags through the Local
Development Fund (LDF) as stated in the new Integrated Budget Law (IBL).11 Table 7 shows the
budgetary allocations to the 21 aimags and Ulaanbaatar in 2013.

33.      Over the medium term,
public spending on agriculture
is projected to fall. According to
the       Medium-Term        Fiscal
                      12
Framework (MTFF) figures for
2014 provided by the MoF,
overall government expenditure
on agriculture in 2014 is expected
to fall by 0.13 percent from 2013.
The reasons for the expected fall
in the agriculture budget were not
readily known at the time of the
review. But, several factors,
including the current fiscal
outlook of the Mongolian economy may have accounted for the projected decline in expenditures.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff report issued in November 2012, the
GoM’s overall fiscal balance deteriorated by 5.3 percent of GDP in 2011, to a deficit of 4.4 percent
of GDP.13 The World Bank Economic Update for Mongolia in April 2013 affirmed this decline in
the GoM’s fiscal balance. According to the report, the fiscal balance significantly worsened to a
record deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2012. Given the challenging fiscal outlook currently
confronting Mongolia, it is important for MIA to improve its resource allocation and expenditure
management to avoid further reductions of its budget by the MoF. MIA should also consider
reducing subsidies in favor of investments that enhance agriculture productivity.
                                       Given the challenging fiscal outlook confronting Mongolia,
                                       public spending on agriculture is projected to fall.

5       ECONOMIC COMPOSITION OF AGRICULTURAL EXPENDITURES

34.     Resources are said to be efficiently allocated when spending is directed to priority programs,
particularly those that spur pro-poor growth. The analysis of allocative efficiency is determined by
the assessment of economic and functional composition of expenditures. To determine the
economic composition of public expenditures in the agriculture sector, expenditures are classified
into current and capital expenditures in line with standard classification of expenditures by
Mongolian Ministry of Finance. The following two sections provide an analysis of economic
composition (current and capital expenditures) of agricultural expenditures in Mongolia, including
external support to agriculture in the country.

5.1 Analysis of current expenditures

35.      The GoM’s nomenclature for expenditure disaggregates current expenditures into the wage
bill (basic salaries, wages and supplementary, salaries for structural changes, wages for contracted out
services, compensation for transportation and meals, and performance bonuses) and non-wage
current expenditures (goods and services, employers social security contributions, other goods and
services expenditures etc.). An in-depth analysis of current expenditures show that MIA’s wage bill
increased steadily from MNT 0.55 billion in 2003 to MNT 9.29 billion in 2013, an increase of about
83 percent. This is fueled mainly by a steady increase in basic salary and salaries for contracted staff.
These two components of the current expenditure alone accounted for over 94.4 percent of the
wage bill in 2013. Table 8 provides trends in the composition of recurrent budget allocation over the
period 2003-2013.

36.     A closer examination of the major components of the current expenditures (salaries, goods
and services, animal care services14 and subsidies and transfers) reveals that in recent years current
expenditures have been geared more towards the provision of subsidies and transfers than for other
important current expenditures such as goods and services that would otherwise support
improvement in service delivery. In 2003, expenditures on goods and services constituted over 99.5
percent of total recurrent budget, compared with wages and salaries (5.8 percent) and subsidies and
transfers (0.5 percent). Between 2003 and 2013, the share of spending on goods and services
declined from 99.5 percent of total current expenditures to 42.4 percent. During that same decade,
expenditures on subsidies and transfers increased from 0.5 percent to 57.6 percent of total current
expenditures. Similarly, expenditures on subsidies and transfers for mainly wheat subsidies and
output-based payments and technical
assistance to wheat farmers through
loans and grants far outweighs the
wage bill, although the latter has been
increasing consistently over the same
period. Subsidies and transfers are also
higher than animal care services in spite
of the fact that the livestock subsector
is the largest agricultural sub-sector,
and disease prevalence is a major
constraint to the export of livestock
products – thereby limiting its potential
contribution to the economy. Figure 6 Animal care services are essential, as the livestock

37.     Figure 6 also shows that subsidies and transfers started rising in 2007, with the most
dramatic rise occurring in 2011. The increased subsidies and transfers are mainly due to the
government’s policy of supporting crop and livestock production, including providing support to
agro-based enterprises and wheat farmers, following the all-time low production of major crops such
as wheat between 2005 and 2007, and the impact of the global food crisis on Mongolia in 2008.
Taking into consideration the performance of the crop and livestock sector as indicated in section 3
above, and relatively higher agricultural output, the subsidy program has made a positive difference
(Figure 3 above). But, the GoM needs to strike a balance between spending on subsidies and
transfers and other important current expenditures, in particular those that address market
constraints and support the provision of public goods.

38.     Disease control and eradication expenditures are difficult to track. The disaggregation
of the three main expenditure categories for animal care services—vaccines, veterinary services, and
private service providers—reveals that funding for vaccines was discontinued after 2008. In fact,
according to available expenditure data in MoF there is no record of budgetary allocations for
vaccines between 2009 and 2013. The AgPER team uncovered no explanation regarding the gap in
figures for vaccines. But, weaknesses in financial management analytical capacity of the Finance and
Investment Division (FID) of MIA may account for the weaknesses in reporting expenditures to the
MoF. The division lacks staff with the requisite capacity to undertake expenditure analysis, thereby
impacting on documenting and accounting for sector expenditures.

39.     The underreporting and lack of proper documentation of expenditures on vaccines is more
pronounced when one compares trends in spending on vaccines with those of private veterinary
service and other providers. As shown in figure 8 below, allocations for vaccines were only recorded


                                                                                   28
from 2003 to 2008. Spending on veterinary services dominated animal care services expenditures
over the period under review, with the exception of 2009, when there were no records on veterinary
services expenditures. It was not clear whether there were allocations to private service providers
between 2003 and 2004. But, spending on private service providers continued, thereafter, and in
fact, was the only item whose expenditure (MNT17.7 billion) was recorded in 2009. In 2013, private
service providers were allocated (MNT13.1 billion) compared to MNT 3.1 billion for public
veterinary services. The AgPER team could not authenticate this pattern of expenditure at MIA due
to the dearth of expenditure data in the FID of the DSPP, which is mainly due to the reasons stated
above.

5.2 Analysis of capital expenditures

40.     MIA has witnessed a steady growth in capital expenditures over the past ten years.
The capital budget increased from MNT 560.0 million in 2003 to MNT 186.2 billion in 2013. Major
components of capital expenditures are (i) domestic investment; (ii) state reserves; and (iii) capital
transfers. In 2013 domestic investment alone amounted to MNT 76.2 billion (40.9 percent) of the
total capital budget, a significant increase from only MNT 0.10 billion (1.8 percent) of the capital
budget in 2003. State reserves, mainly wheat reserves, accounted for MNT 28.0 billion (15 percent)
of the total capital budget while capital transfers constituted only MNT 1.5 billion (0.8 percent) of
the capital budget in 2013. Figure 8 presents trends in the major components of the capital
expenditures over the period 2003-2013.

5.3 Capital expenditures vs. current expenditures

41.     Over time, capital expenditures have
more than doubled compared with current
expenditures. A comparison of capital
expenditures with current expenditures shows a
steady and significant growth in capital
expenditures over the past decade. In 2003, capital
expenditures amounted to MNT 21.4 billion (43.3
percent of total expenditure) while MNT27.9
billion (56.7 percent of total expenditure) was
allocated to current expenditures.15 From 2003 to
2013, and from 2009 to 2013 in particular, capital
expenditures more than doubled. In 2013, 74.9
percent of the total expenditures went into
financing capital expenditure items compared to
only 25.1 percent for current expenditures. In
absolute terms, capital expenditures amounted to
MNT 1,079.9 billion compared to MNT 362.4
billion for current expenditures in 2013. The
consistent increase in capital expenditures provides                                          Since 2008 the Government scaled up
                                                                                              investments for the construction and
the justification for the GoM’s commitment to                                                 rehabilitation of wells.

  For the purposes of this analysis, total expenditure is defined as current expenditures (including salaries and
wages) plus all capital expenditure items.

                                                                                         31
provide public goods to improve the future welfare of the society by investing now. Since 2008 the
GoM has embarked on scaling up investments for the construction and rehabilitation of wells,
including irrigation and other important capital investments. While these types of investments are
justifiable, it is unclear whether they are sustainable given the slow growth in rate of current
expenditures, and indeed in operation and maintenance (O&M)16 budget. Figure 9 compares trends
in capital and current expenditures over the 2003-2013 period.

     In MIA’s budget classification, O&M is referred to as capital repairs.

42.      External support complements government efforts, but very limited information is
available for donor spending on agriculture. Donor-off budget expenditures (expenditures that
are not part of the sector budget, but managed solely through a donor’s procedures), mainly
commitments, through implementation of investment projects at both national and local levels are a
very important component of the sector expenditures.17 A variety of independent projects are
implemented by various donors and NGOs in the sector. This analysis attempted to capture
expenditures of the most important donors, as it was difficult to collect and gather expenditures
from all donors in the sector. As shown in table 9 below, donors whose expenditures were readily
available at the time of the review include: (i) the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC); (ii) the
European Union (EU); (iii) the Asian Development Bank (ADB); (iv) the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC); (v) the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); (vi) the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); (vii) the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD); (viii) the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA); and the World
Bank Group (WBG).

     Trend analysis of donor budget expenditures was impossible due to the dearth of data for the period of review.

43.     As shown in table 9, four donors (SDC, FAO, IFAD, and WBG) are the major contributors
to the sector with a combined funding of US$57.0 million, representing 76 percent of total donor
expenditures (US$75 million) over the 2012-2016 period. The share of donor off-budget support in
total sector budget was 26.1 percent in 2013. This shows that external funding is currently very
important expenditure in the sector. None of the donors listed in table 9 channels its resources
through the GoM Public Financial Management (PFM) system, and donor coordination is weak,
although it is acknowledged that the Ministry has recently made some progress in bringing all donors
on board for planning and prioritization of investment programs in the sector. In some instances,
donors, particularly NGOs, operate with limited or no links to MIA. Improving donor coordination
would obviously help in the planning and prioritization of sector investments and hence
achievement of sector development goals. It would also eliminate duplication of efforts by
ensuring that each donor focuses on areas where it enjoys a comparative advantage, and the GoM
focuses on the provision of core public goods that are vital for agricultural development.

44.     The growth in capital expenditures has been spurred by increases in investment
activities in the provinces. The dramatic increase in capital expenditures is the result of the recent
government policy of increasing investments in agriculture, particularly in the provinces (aimags). For
example, MIA has earmarked about MNT 157.8 billion over the period 2012-2017 for targeted
projects and activities in the aimags as well as the districts in Ulaanbaatar. Key activities to be
financed under this program include construction of new wells, water systems, veterinary and
sanitary laboratories, disinfection facilities, etc.), acquisition of equipment, feasibility studies, design
and drawings and capital repairs (operation and maintenance). About 49.9 percent (MNT 78.8

                                                               34
billion) of the total budget has been
allocated for capital investments in
2013. Among the activities currently
receiving government funding are (i)
construction of a food testing
laboratory in Ulaanbaatar; (ii)
construction of water supply points
for livestock pasture land in all 21
aimags; (iii) construction of veterinary
and sanitary laboratory in Khan-Uul
district      in    Ulaanbaatar;     (iv)
construction of a national livestock
genetic fund complex in Khongor in
Darkhan Uul aimag; and (v)
installation of wind pump for pasture          A water supply point for livestock in Ulann Uul soum,
watering        in   Domogobi        and       Hovsgol aimag.
Gobisumber.

45.     However, allocations for operation and maintenance are especially low relative to
total capital investments. Although MIA has increased overall capital investments in the
agriculture sector, the increase is not matched by adequate funding of O&M, which remains
disproportionately small. Only 1.9 percent of the total capital/investment budget was allocated to
O&M in 2013.18 The AgPER team was unable to obtain the rationale behind the small proportion of
the capital budget being allocated for O&M. The GoM needs to consider increasing the budget for
O&M to about 10 percent of the total sector budget because this underfunding could undermine the
sustainability of investments in the sector.




18
   There is no fixed rule on ratio of capital spending in capital intensive expenditures (ARD-WB Practitioners’
Toolkit for Agricultural Public expenditure Analysis, p.12). But, it is important for GoM to maintain existing
infrastructure versus investing in new infrastructure if it wants to sustain growth in agricultural output in the
country.

6    FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF EXPENDITURES


46.        In the previous section, we analyzed economic composition of sector expenditures as an
important aspect of the analysis of allocative efficiency. This section delves into the functional
composition of sector expenditures as a determinant of the allocative efficiency of sector resources.
The analysis of functional composition of sector expenditures is based upon the premise that it is
not only the magnitude and size of the resources that comes into a particular sector that matters, but
the manner in which the resources are allocated to relevant sector programs and activities. The two
key questions that this chapter seeks to address are: (i) Are resources allocated to the right programs and
activities that provide significant social benefits and reduce poverty? And (ii) Are budgetary allocations in the sector
aligned with priority sector objectives?

47.      Empirical evidence has shown that public sector spending on productivity enhancing and
targeted pro-poor programs such as R&D, irrigation, rural infrastructure, and rural development has
impacted positively on rural poverty and agricultural productivity growth. Using an econometric
model to estimate the impact of additional spending by the Government of India on R&D,
irrigation, rural infrastructure and rural development, Fan, Hazell, and Throat (1998) found that
additional public spending on roads had the greatest impact on poverty reduction as well as
significant impact on productivity growth. They also found that additional government spending on
R&D and extension services had the greatest impact on agricultural productivity growth and led to
substantial benefits for the rural poor. Education had the third largest impact on rural poverty
reduction owing mainly to its potential to induce an increase in non-farm employment and rural
wages.19 Another, more recent study published by IFPRI in 2011, found that public investment in
rural infrastructure and extension services have significant impacts on the well-being of rural
households in Nepal, as measured by land values, consumption growth, poverty reduction, and
growth in agricultural incomes (Dillon, Sharma, and Zhang (2011).20

48.     Many countries, and industrialized countries in particular, invest a substantial proportion of
their public agriculture sector budget in areas such as research and development, and advisory and
extension services, which are seen as strategic priorities in increasing agricultural growth. Mongolia
in contrast allocates a disproportionately small percentage of its agriculture budget to these
important core public goods (see chapter 7 for an overview of R&D expenditures). R & D and
advisory services, including extension services, together received 4 percent of the functional
budgetary allocations compared with planning and policy (11 percent) in 2013 (Figure 10). Pests and
plant disease control received 13 percent of the functional budget, even though these functions are
among the important activities that help increase agricultural productivity. The function that
received the lion’s share of the functional budget is subsidies and transfers (62 percent), followed by
livestock diseases (16 percent) control program.21 This is not surprising given that subsidies and

   According to MIA’s program budget from the M oF, there are four main disease control programs: (i) preventive
measures for contagious diseases, (ii) preventive measures for parasitic diseases; (iii) preventive measures for
special contagious diseases; and (iv) treatment of chronic animal contagious diseases.

transfers now account for a substantial proportion of the sector budget due to government policy

49.    It is evident in figure 10 that the core public goods (research and extension) are significantly
underfunded by international standards. For example, while Mongolia spends 0.5 percent of its
AgGDP, Kyrgyzstan spends 2.2 percent of its AgGDP on these public goods. Thailand spends 12.9
percent of its AgGDP on research and extension. The underfunding of the core public goods is a
matter of concern because they are areas in which the private sector is reluctant to invest, even
though they are necessary for private investments in the sector.

50.     Another aspect of the functional analysis of allocative efficiency is to examine
whether resources have been allocated in line with government priority programs and
objectives. This section will focus on the extent to which the allocation of agricultural public
expenditures is aligned with sector development priorities. As indicated earlier, the key question that
the section seeks to address is as follows. Is the functional composition of expenditures aligned with the GoM’s
development priorities?

51.     The Agricultural Sector Development Strategy Paper (ASDSP) which outlines MIA’s
agricultural development priorities, provides the basis for allocating sector resources (see section 2
above).22 Key activities and initiatives of the ASDSP have been costed to ascertain funding
requirements for effective implementation of the activities. The AgPER team compared the costed
programs in the ASDSP with MIA’s budgetary allocations to functional categories from 2008 to
2011 to ascertain the extent to which budgetary allocations to various programs have been aligned
with the strategy objectives. However, it was difficult for the team to establish the alignment of all
the costed programs with MIA’s budget for functional categories because the ASDSP provides
broad areas of activities, which might include several other functions indicated in the MIA’s
22
   Note that only ASDSP was analyzed and compared with the functional categories budget. The other policies and
strategies in sector 2 were not costed.

functional categories budget. The only discernible functions in the ASDSP that could be aligned
with the functional categories budget are shown in table 10 below.

52.      MIA allocated an average of 23.0 percent of its total budget to disease management program
compared with ASDSP projections, followed by planning and policy (5.8 percent) in 2011. An
average of 14.8 percent was allocated for livestock diseases, 3.1 percent for R&D, and 6.7 percent
for physical infrastructure (irrigation wells, water systems, laboratory buildings, etc.) compared with
ASDSP average of 5.9 percent, 1.6 percent, and 8.5 percent respectively over the period under
review. Table 10 also compares MIA’s budgetary allocations to functional categories with ASDSP
priority programs projections over the period 2008-2011.

53.      A thorough examination of the ASDSP and the sector budget shows significant differences
between activities and functional categories in the MIA’s budgets and those of ASDSP, which
suggests that the ASDSP has not been fully utilized in the preparation of annual budgets. This
implies that the government has not allocated its budget according to the priorities identified in the
ASDP. There is, therefore, the need to utilize and align sector budget allocations to development
priorities when assigning resources to functional programs.

54.     Public agricultural research financing in Mongolia is channeled through the Science and
Technology Fund (STF), which is managed by an autonomous agency affiliated with the MoES. The
STF employs government funds to research in all relevant sectors, including agriculture. The STF
expenditures are outside MIA’s budget, but go to support the agricultural research institutions. The
agricultural research institutes that benefit from the fund include: (i) the Animal Husbandry
Research Institute (AHRI); (ii) the Plant Protection Research Institute (PPRI); (iv) the Veterinary
Research Institute (VRI); and (v) the Plant Science Agricultural Research and Training Institute
(PSARTI); and (vi) the Mongolia State University of Agriculture (MSUA).23

55.      The STF funds research institutions using a grants-based approach. At the beginning of each
calendar year, the fund publishes a Request for Proposal (RFP) in major newspapers. The research
institutes develop and submit their proposals based on the content of the RFP through their
respective operational ministries. There is an inter-ministerial committee headed by the Prime Minister
which is the highest approving body for funds to all beneficiary institutions. Between 2008 and
2012, the STF financed a total of MNT 24.6 billion to the various field of research, including
agriculture. As shown in table 12, over 50 percent of STF funding goes to technical and applied
research fields per year followed by environment (20.0 percent). Agriculture has received an average
of 5.4 percent of the total STF funding over the same period. Table 12 provides trends in the STF
financing of research activities by sector from 2008 to 2012.

56.    The selection and submission of agricultural research program of activities to STF is

to submit their draft project proposals to a committee headed by the Vice-Minister of MIA. The
committee prioritizes and selects the activities to be carried out by each research institute. The

selected activities/projects are then sent to STF at MoES for review and approval. Upon approval
by the STF approving committee, the STF management releases funds to the research institutes.

57.      An analysis of trends in funds received by the agricultural research institutes over the period
2003-2013 is shown in table 12 below. The table provides the cumulative expenditure of MNT 22.03
billion over the period under review. The table also shows that MSUA received the lion’s share
(27.0 percent) of the total agricultural research funds, followed by AHRI (220.30 percent) and
PSPARTI (20.1 percent), respectively. Together these three institutions received 69.4 percent of the
total allocations from the STF.

58.      Research funding from STF is woefully inadequate to meet the growing needs for
research. The allocation of research budgets among different categories of expenditure (salaries,
operating costs, and capital costs) has significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of
agricultural research and development. To this end, the AgPER team collected information on
expenditure categories from the finance departments of three research institutes (AHRI, PPRI, and
VRI) for which data was available. The analysis of expenditure categories of these research institutes
showed inadequate funding for research-specific activities. Worse still, most of this funding is used
to pay salaries, leaving a very limited amount available to undertake research per se. For example,
AHRI spent an average 55.2 percent on salaries compared to 16.5 percent on research-specific
activities over the period 2009-2013. The breakdown of the spending structure of the three research
institutes is given in table 13 below.

59.     The limited funding for research specific activities is aggravated by delays in the
release of funds to the research institutes. The inadequacy of funds is compounded by the delay
in the release of funds from the STF. Less-than-timely release of funds is a challenge to all the

research institutes. The STF approving committee does not meet regularly as required by law. For
example by April 2013, none of the research institutes had received funds for the first quarter of
2013. The operations and structure of the approving committee need to be reformed in order to
speed up the approval process and to ensure a regular and continuous flow of funds to the research
institutes.

60.      The current institutional arrangements also hamper the smooth operations of the
research institutes. In addition to funding issues, senior managers interviewed at the research
institutes described the disadvantages of operating under the aegis of the MoES instead of the MIA.
They are not able to participate in and take advantage of many agricultural related capacity building
interventions organized by MIA. The MoES does not organize agriculture-related capacity building
and other operational activities that would help improve their skills and expertise.

61.      MIA finances a number of research activities within the sector. In addition to research
funded by the STF, MIA allocates part of its agricultural budget for R&D activities. This amount
goes into the financing of investment activities, which include: (i) feasibility studies for construction
of new buildings; (ii) feasibility studies for the establishment of plant nurseries; (iii) feasibility studies
for the establishment of fish farms; and (iv) intensive research and testing of new quality seeds etc.

62.    Spending on research is exceptionally low compared to total spending on agriculture
and agriculture GDP. Public spending on R&D, (MIA and STF combined) in 2008 amounted to
MNT 2.50 billion, which represented 7.0 percent of total agriculture spending, excluding fisheries
and forestry in 2008. In 2013, although spending on R&D increased to MNT 3.67 billion, it
represented only 2.5 percent of total agriculture sector spending. As a share of agricultural GDP24,
expenditure on R&D represented 0.4 percent in 2008, which is lower than 1.01 in Malaysia, but the

respectively.26 Mongolia fares relatively well when compared with Kyrgyzstan (0.09 percent), which
has similar climatic conditions. Table 15 provides trends in agricultural research expenditures relative
to the national budget and agricultural GDP.

63.     Inadequate funding for research has had significant impacts on the delivery of
extension services. A discussion with the extension services policy unit of MIA revealed that
delivery of extension services has been ineffective due to lack of concrete research results,
particularly new technologies from the research institutes. The transfer of new technologies to
farmers and herders is practically non-existent. Lack of funds has constrained the research institutes
ability to conduct long-term research, which is essential for discovering and adapting new
technologies.

64.      Extension services delivery is also hampered by inadequate funding. Limited funding
affects extension services as well as extension activities. The National Agricultural Extension Center
(NAEC) is located in Ulaanbaatar and is responsible for operating and managing all extension
activities in the country mainly through MIA’s extension units in the aimags and soums. The NAEC
has 16 technical experts, 21 extension officers located in the aimags, and 330 extension officers in all
soums together, one per soum. NAEC is funded through budgetary allocations from MIA. In 2013, it
received about MNT300 million from MIA’s budget. 70 percent of this amount was spent on
administrative functions; 30 percent operational; and 10 percent for capacity building and field work.
Like the research institutes, NAEC is not adequately funded. As a result, the implementation of its
activities is significantly hampered by financial and logistic problems. As shown in table 16 below,
budgetary allocations to NAEC has averaged MNT0.22 billion over the period 2008-2013.
Agricultural extension expenditure as a percentage of AgGDP averaged 0.011 percent over this
period.

8       BUDGET PROCESSES AND PERFORMANCE


65.     The timely preparation, approval, and execution of budgetary resources largely determine the
effectiveness of public sector expenditures. Prompt approval and release of funds ensures that
public sector institutions have the means to procure goods and services that would allow smooth
implementation of their programs/activities. This section provides an overview of the budget
preparation process in Mongolia. It also analyzes MIA’s budget execution performance by
comparing the level of its actual and planned expenditures.

8.1 Budget preparation

66.     Mongolia’s budget cycle begins in the first month of the second quarter of the fiscal
year. Between April 15 and June 1 of each fiscal year, a Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) is
developed and approved. Socioeconomic development priorities are developed in April.27 And from
June 10 to July 5, annual budget ceilings for spending agencies are prepared and approved. Between
July 25 and November 15 the national budget proposal, social insurance fund budget, and the
human development fund budget are developed and approved. The remaining period of the fiscal
year is devoted to the development and approval of local government budgets. Box 1 summarizes
the budget preparation process and its timelines.

67.      MIA’s budget preparation process follows national timelines. At the sector level the
DSPP leads the budget preparation process through its Finance and Investment Division. At the
beginning of the budget preparation period, the Division collects budget proposals from all relevant
departments and agencies, including the aimags as soon as it receives the budget call circular from
MoF. It also reviews and consolidates the departmental and agency proposals by ensuring that the
proposals are consistent with the government’s agricultural development policy objectives. The
Division then convenes a stakeholder-meeting, which is attended by local NGOs, scientific research
institutions, and sector departments and agencies. At the meeting, participants discuss the
consolidated budget proposal, and stakeholders provide feedback and comments. The Division
finalizes the proposal by taking into account comments from stakeholders. It submits the proposal
to the MoF by August 15. The proposal then goes through the cabinet, audit service and finally to
parliament for parliamentary discussion and approval.




27
     Socio-economic development priorities are developed by the Ministry of Economy and Development (MED).

68.    While the process ensures a participatory approach, it is top-down with significantly
limited involvement of subnational administrative units. A key problem with agriculture sector
budget preparation is that the local administrative units in the aimags and soums are not actively
involved in the process, although they submit their respective proposals to MIA. During a

                                                        46
discussion with the aimags authorities, they complained that most of their needs are not taken into
account in the overall sector budget, when the AgPER team visited the aimags of Tuv and Bulgan. A
participatory approach with significant involvement of the heads of aimags would greatly strengthen
planning and budgeting at MIA.

69.    Development partners’ involvement in the budget process is non-existent. Another
drawback of the sector budget preparation process is that major development partners are not
involved – which appears to reflect the weak donor coordination noted above. Increasing their
involvement and fully taking into consideration their contributions when budget proposals are being
prepared will ensure that total sector expenditures are fully captured. It will also allow the
government to focus its investments in areas where donor support is limited.

70.      In addition to the budget process, the AgPER team examined the 2013 capital and
investment budget proposal and noted that all planned programs and activities, including those that
would be implemented thorough the LDF, had been allocated resources. However, the team did
not ascertain the basis for allocating resources to the programs, although most of the programs are
in sector priority areas. In order to ensure investment programs are well-resourced, all of the
activities that go into implementation must be properly and realistically costed. Medium Term
Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) are widely used for this purpose, and help to capture the cost of
all programs in the sector over the next three years. MTEFs are also used to determine the amount
of public sector resources which are required to implement government programs over the
medium term while taking into account the constraints imposed by the fiscal space of a country.
They will also help MIA to know its funding gaps, which could be an instrument for securing more
donor resources to fill those gaps. At the moment, there is no sector specific MTEF in place and
establishing one would greatly help improve resource allocation and expenditure management.

8.2 Budget Execution

71.      Budget execution involves all actions required to effectively and efficiently
accomplish programs/activities for which resources were requested and approved. The
budget execution process, therefore, establishes the relationship between planned and actual
expenditures, and provides a measure of effectiveness of public sector resources. The
planned/budgeted expenditures provide the basis upon which all government agencies and
institutions determine or develop the programs and activities they intend to implement. An analysis
of budget execution performance is, therefore, critical to achieving a government’s development
objectives.

72.     Overall MIA’s budget execution performance is quite good, with most of its annual
approved budgets executed. As shown in figure 11 below, trends in MIA’s budget outturns are
generally good when actual expenditures of the two main categories of expenditures (current and
capital) are compared with approved/budgeted expenditures, although there are predominately

under-spending in most of the years, except fiscal years 2005 and 2008, when MIA recorded
MNT3.3 billion and MNT23.9 billion overspending, respectively.

73.      Further breakdown of the two categories of expenditures provides a clearer picture
of MIA’s budget execution performance. Current expenditures are split into salaries and
operational expenditures, and are compared with capital expenditures over the period 2003-2011
(Table 17). Overall, the Ministry exhibited significant underspending of individual budget items. In
terms of budget outturns, an average MNT31.07 billion was underspent in most of the years under
review. However, the Ministry recorded high budget execution rates with an average of 94.5
percent of its total budget over the review period. The reasons for the causes of the underspending
were not clear, but they could be attributed to weak capacity for accounting and reporting of
expenditures at both MIA and aimag levels for current expenditures. For capital expenditures,
delays in the procurement of goods and services coupled with weak capacity at the local level could
be the underlying factor.28

     According to MIA’s 2013 capital/investment budget proposal, procurement activities commence in March 2013.

Authors’ own calculations based on expenditure data from MoF. Note: Actual expenditure figures for 2012 and 2013
were not available at the time of the review. Figures in parenthesis show under-spending. All figures are in nominal
values. Note: AgPER team could not obtain reasons for sharp increases in some of the GoM expenditure.

74.     As noted earlier, expenditures for the analysis of the above budget execution performance
were aggregate figures obtained from the MoF. The FID of DSPP does not have detailed actual
expenditure records by department and agency within MIA, or by program and subsector. This
situation made it difficult for the AgPER team to undertake an in-depth analysis of budget execution
performance by department, agency or subsector. No concrete explanation was given for the lack of
actual spending figures by department or agency. There is a need to document and analyze sector
expenditures by department, agency and subsector to allow for proper tracking and monitoring of
budget outcomes at all levels.

75.   New staff needs to be hired to work on day-to-day planning, budgeting, and
expenditure management in order to improve financial management and analytical

                                                                50
capacity. The inability of FID to carry out detailed analysis of budget execution performance is
attributable to lack of analytical expertise in financial management among the staff of the Division.
In addition to leading the sector budget preparation process, the FID is responsible for compiling,
documenting, reporting, analyzing, and accounting for actual expenditures from departments,
agencies and unit offices in the 21 aimags. However, it lacks staff with the requisite analytical skills
mix to analyze budget execution performance that would provide useful information to senior
management for decision-making. The lack of analysis of budget execution performance moreover
means that no execution issues are taken into account in the following fiscal year’s budget
preparation process. Evidently, the overall financial management capacity of the division is weak.
Staff currently consists of six members, including the head of the division working on various tasks
on planning, procurement, documenting, and otherwise accounting for actual expenditures.
Interviews with the Division staff found that annual planning and budgeting is fairly good compared
to documentation, accounting, and reporting of core sector expenditures. Linkages between the
planning staff and the staff who work on actual expenditures are limited, making it difficult to carry
out proper budget execution performance analysis (analysis of budget outturns and budget execution
rates). The lack of detailed analysis on budget execution performance also precluded the AgPER
team from obtaining information on key components of budget execution (obligation, commitment,
and payment).

76.     There is also limited information flow between the FID and various departments and
agencies, including the aimag units in terms of budgeting and expenditure management.
This situation has hampered reporting and accounting for actual expenditures resulting from
implementation of programs and activities at the departmental and aimag levels. Available
expenditure figures obtained from FID are not only limited by period (2008-2013), but also by
several gaps relating to actual expenditures, with some years virtually unrepresented by any figures.
Moreover, the Division documents most of its expenditures by economic classification. The
reporting and accounting for expenditures by economic classification is useful, particularly for the
purpose of reporting to the Treasury, but it does not provide incentives for ascertaining what has
actually been spent by departments and agencies in the sector and on which programs. The need to
include program budgets as well as departmental budgets in the annual budget proposals is of
paramount importance. There is also the need to document actual expenditures by department and
agencies in order to properly account for what has actually been spent by all departments and
agencies in the sector, and measure the impacts of programs’ implementation.

77.     Linkages between the FID and the Monitoring, Evaluation and Internal Audit
Department (MEIAD) are weak. There is no indication of clear linkages between the MEIAD
and FID in terms of sharing data on expenditures and on the physical progress of sector program.
This situation undermines proper documentation and accounting for expenditures; and therefore,
analysis of budget execution performance. The MEIAD should be in a position to provide the
requisite information on physical progress of projects to FID staff who works on analysis of budget
execution performance, and vice-versa. Ensuring that these two departments work in concert with
                                                  51
each other will improve transparency, accountability, and ultimately MIA’s budget outcomes and
performance.

8.3 Budget outcomes monitoring

78.      Budget outcome and performance monitoring and evaluation is inadequate.
International experience shows that the size of budgetary allocation (resource envelope) to a
particular sector ministry depends not only on the macroeconomic fiscal situation of a country, but
also on the spending levels and budget execution performance of the Ministry. Typically, if a sector
ministry underspends its budget and does not provide evidence of achievements of its programs’
implementation, the MoF reduces its budget for the following fiscal year. Against this backdrop, the
review sought to investigate MIA’s current budget outcome monitoring and evaluation situation by
engaging in discussion with senior management of the MEIAD. The review noted that overall the
implementation of programs and activities at all levels are not effectively monitored and evaluated.

79.      In principle, monitoring and evaluation of budget outcomes is carried out by the MEIAD.
The principal functions of the department are to: (i) conduct monitoring and evaluation of
implementation of all programs and activities in the sector; (ii) review policy documents and report
to the government on the status of implementation of policies and programs; (iii) monitor the
activities of all departments and agencies, the 21 aimags, and 335 veterinary units in the soums. In
addition to these functions, the department has been handed budget execution performance
monitoring as an additional function in 2013 following the implementation of the IBL.

80.        The AgPER team’s investigation revealed no significant budget performance/
outcomes/impacts assessment done by the department over the past year. The department is
constrained by the lack of the personnel required to effectively carry out the above-mentioned
functions. Currently there are only ten staff members, including the Director General, working in
the department. Field work is supposed to be carried out by the nine personnel, but given the
increased workload resulting from their additional mandate of covering every part of the country,
they are not able to effectively undertake the evaluation task. In this regard, they conduct what is
known as “spot checks? by selectively evaluating a few programs. This approach does not really
provide detailed and concrete evidence of budget outcomes and performance in the sector. Nor is
this approach based on the widely acceptable norms for evaluating programs: relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability. To enable the department to carry out its functions as required, additional
staff who are endowed with the requisite skills and expertise in conducting program monitoring and
evaluation is required. New divisions also need to be formed within the department in order for
responsibilities to be distributed rationally, and where possible, place program monitoring and
evaluation personnel in the aimags to carry out specific tasks in specific geographical areas to ensure
effective monitoring and evaluation of sector programs/activities.

9       EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF SECTOR EXPENDITURES


81.     A detailed analysis of technical efficiency of sector expenditures was not undertaken due to
the short duration of the field work, coupled with the dearth of data in MIA. To this end, the
AgPER team depended basically on expert opinion through discussions with sector authorities, and
a review of available literature on program outcomes, in particular those that pertain to livestock
disease control program and infrastructure projects (e.g. irrigation and wells).

82.      A visit to the aimags of Tuv and Bulgan clearly found that while the GoM’s spending
on vaccinations and animal disease response is in the right direction, the extent of spending
on these important interventions requires further assessment. The GoM uses a public-private
partnerships (PPP) approach to carry out its vaccination and veterinary services program at the soum
level. Government supplies the vaccines free of charge and the private veterinary units provide the
services. The agricultural authorities in the aimags establish contracts with the private service
providers in the soums (see annex 3). Upon successful completion of their services, the aimag
authorities approve and authorize payment for the services rendered. A discussion with the aimag
authorities to ascertain whether there is a proper monitoring mechanism in place yielded mixed
results. While in Bulgan, a monitoring system, which tracks progress down to the herders, has been
established, in Tuv aimag, there is no such a system in place.

83.      The vaccination program has helped increase livestock production, but spending
patterns have not been properly documented and accounted for. Available expenditure data
show that outlays on vaccines, veterinary services, and contracted services together constituted a
substantial proportion of current expenditures (about 11.2 percent in 2012 and 2013). The veterinary
services budget pays for infectious, parasitic, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), and disinfection and
sanitization. Vaccines, medicines, and service fees (payment to private service providers) are paid
centrally for the services of private veterinarians who are responsible for treating infectious diseases,
while herders pay for veterinary service fees for parasitic diseases. The increase in livestock
production in recent years suggests that this strategy seems to be working fairly well. For example,
gross livestock output/MNT has increased to MNT 1,505.7 billion in 2011, after falling from MNT
1,307.7 billion in 2009 to MNT 1,290.7 billion in 2010 due mainly to the dzud weather effect.
Average survival rates per 100 female breeding stocks have rebounded after falling from 376 per
head in 2009 to 212 per head in 2010 (see annex 1).29 But the increased output has not been matched
with proper documentation and accounting for vaccination program expenditures, making it difficult
to measure the real impact of public expenditure on the program. As shown in section 5.1 above,
vaccines expenditures, one of the components of animal care services, have not been properly
documented since 2008. The team could not track where those expenditures were recorded at either

MIA or MoF. This could be attributed to weaknesses in financial management and reporting
systems at MIA. MIA must improve its accounting, recording, and reporting systems to ensure that
expenditures of such important programs are well documented and accounted for.

84.     Lack of central-local accountability and coordination is a significant constraint to
technical efficiency. A review of available reports also unearthed the following issues: (i) lack of
central-local accountability; (ii) poor local ownership of central government programs; and (iii)
seemingly weak communication and coordination between the central ministry and its offices in the
aimags and soums. These factors have contributed to poor implementation of programs at the local
level. The budget is formulated and paid for by the central government, which usually do not have
the best information about the needs at the local level. This situation does not create incentives for
the local governments to be accountable for undertaking the tasks at minimal costs. This issue is
crosscutting as it is common in other sectors as well, and is mainly due to top-down and vertical
reporting structure of the intergovernmental fiscal systems (World Bank, 2009). It is expected that
the new IBL will address most of these issues as the local governments are now given more fiscal
responsibilities.

85.      Another constraint to technical efficiency that must be addressed by MIA and the
local governments is the delays in executing infrastructure projects. The execution of most of
MIA’s infrastructure projects is characterized by considerable delays. The procurement process does
not start early enough in the year and it takes some time before activities are accomplished. Delays
are caused by a lack of quality appraisals and feasibility studies, including a lack of proper
coordination between project design, preparation and implementation between MIA and t h e
aimags authorities. Limited operational expenditure allocations to technical staff at aimag and soum
levels also account for ineffective supervision of projects leading to low quality of work. In spite of
these challenges, significant progress has been made in the provision of infrastructure such as
irrigation and wells, which have helped increase crop production (see annexes 1 and 2 and section 3
above). To sustain development outcomes resulting from increased investment in infrastructure,
MIA must take corrective measures to reduce delays and improve project implementation.

10 CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS


86.     This review summarizes the key issues constraining effectiveness and efficiency of public
expenditures in Mongolia’s agriculture sector. These include, among others, limited levels of funding
for agriculture despite its significant contribution to the economy; limited O&M expenditures, which
does not match growth in capital/investment expenditures; lack of funding for R&D development
and extension services; limited financial management capacity of staff of FID; inadequate staffing
levels for the MEIAD, which has constrained the department’s ability to carry out effective
monitoring and evaluation of sector programs; weak donor coordination; and limited involvement
of the local authorities in the planning and budgeting of sector programs. Despites these
weaknesses, there is evidence of the impacts of government spending on some key programs such as
the livestock disease control program and investment in agriculture equipment and irrigation.
Livestock mortality has declined and continues to fall. Production of major crops, which has been
supported by government investment in irrigation and equipment, has increased consistently since
2008, and overall gross agricultural output continues to increase. MIA must urgently address the
aforementioned issues and constraints to continuously increase output, and hence achieve its
development objectives. Upon the basis of the above identified issues/constraints, we recommend
the following.

        Increase agriculture’s share of the national budget relative to other key sectors. The review showed that
         agriculture receives a disproportionately small percentage of the national budget relative to
         other key sectors, despite its huge contribution to the national output and GDP. The GoM
         needs to substantially increase agriculture’s share of the national budget to enable it to
         continue to play its catalytic role as a key contributor to national output.

        Strike a balance between capital and recurrent budget by substantially increasing the O&M budget. The
         review showed that the GoM has increased investments in the sector by significantly
         increasing capital expenditures, but noted that O&M budget is inadequate to sustain the
         current investments in the sector. While there are no standard levels of allocation for O&M,
         the GoM needs to consider increasing allocations to O&M because at current levels, the
         O&M budget could undermine the sustainability of investments in the sector.

        Strike a balance between budgetary allocations to subsidies and transfers, on the one hand, and goods and
         services on the other. A review of the components of current expenditures shows that subsidies
         and transfers constitute the bulk of current expenditures compared to salaries, goods, and
         services. To improve services delivery, the GoM should increase allocations to goods and
         services, while having clear strategies for subsidies, and an exit strategy and a review of the
         efficiency of those subsidies in correcting market failures to achieve the desired goals.

   Increase the budget for core public goods and improve funding flow to the agricultural research institutions
    and the extension agency. The review unearthed limited funding for R&D and extension
    services in Mongolia. Mongolia needs to substantially increase funding for these
    important public goods (R&D and extension services) because they are vital for new
    agricultural technologies, and they create the enabling environment for increased private
    sector investments in agriculture. The flow of funding to the research institutes also
    needs improvement by reviewing the composition of the STF approval committee
    members as well as its processes. The approval committee also needs to meet regularly
    and on time to ensure that research institutes are well-resourced to carry out their duties
    effectively.

   Strengthen the financial management capabilities of FID staff and budget managers. The review
    identified weaknesses in recording, analyzing, and accounting for sector expenditures. This
    has led to a lack of financial data on past expenditures, in particular actual expenditures
    that are needed for the analysis of budget and program execution performance. Actual
    spending by departments, agencies, and provincial offices are, by and large, not properly
    documented. MIA needs to organize frequent training programs, including on-the-job
    training, in financial management and expenditure data analysis to help improve and
    upgrade financial management and analytical skills and expertise of FID staff, including all
    budget managers and heads of aimag offices.

   Improve budget outcome monitoring and performance. The review identified the important role
    played by the MEIAD. The department has been overwhelmed with a heavy workload, but
    it has very limited staff to carry out such a huge task bestowed on it. In order to improve
    budget outcome and performance, the department must be adequately resourced with staff
    that possess skills and expertise in program monitoring and evaluation both at MIA and
    aimag levels.

   Sponsor regular training and capacity building interventions to upgrade the skills of MEIAD staffs. To
    improve budget monitoring and performance, MIA must build and maintain highly skilled
    staff able to conduct monitoring and evaluation of programs by using the widely-accepted
    standard monitoring and evaluation criteria: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.
    This will require it to organize frequent training programs, including on-the-job training
    for the MEIAD staff to deepen their monitoring and evaluation skills that would enable
    them to effectively carry out their duties and inform decision-making.

   Improve donor coordination and engagement in the sector. The review revealed that MIA has made
    significant progress in improving donor coordination and relations in recent years, but
    more efforts must be made on this front. This will require involving key donors in the
    planning and prioritization of sector investments, including the sector budget

                                                   56
    preparation process. An ideal approach is to establish a “Sector Working Group ? chaired
    by the DG of Planning and Strategic Policy Directorate of MIA. It will consist of
    representatives of all stakeholders, including development partners and the heads and
    managers of the aimag offices. The working group could be tasked with the
    responsibility of conducting annual sector reviews as well as leading and undertaking
    the annual planning and budgeting process. The annual sector review will inform the
    planning and budgeting process.


   Conduct a value-for-money analysis to extensively document program impacts and outcomes. In order to
    obtain a clear picture of the quality of spending, and to inform decision-makers about
    program impacts, a detailed technical efficiency (value-for-money) analysis, either through
    a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) or Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA) needs
    to be conducted. This will provide senior management with information about where the
    money is going and about program impacts on beneficiaries at all levels.

   Improve planning and budgeting by developing and implementing a sector MTEF that would detail the
    cost of programs at all levels and show funding requirements. The review found it difficult to
    determine the basis for allocating sector resources to investment programs. This problem
    will be resolved with the development and implementation of a sector MTEF that
    captures all funding sources and requirements. MIA, therefore, must develop a sector
    specific MTEF to enable it to improve its resource allocations.

   Establish an effective mechanism for monitoring disease control and vaccination programs in soums.
    The review identified weaknesses in the current system of monitoring the vaccination
    program at soum level, based on discussion with the authorities in two aimags. While two
    out of 21 aimags cannot be said to be an adequate sample, MIA needs to review the
    current contracting and monitoring mechanism in place in all aimags. The review should
    aim at ascertaining the effectiveness of service delivery, including the extent of
    documentation, recoding and reporting of program expenditures, particularly outlays on
    vaccines.

Annex 3. Livestock Disease Control Program

1.       A Government initiative to control livestock diseases has helped to improve livestock
production in recent years. The GoM has invested substantially in the provision of animal care
services through its nationwide livestock vaccination program. The Ministry of Industry and
Agriculture (MIA) partners with the private sector to implement the program at the soum level. The
Government supplies the vaccines free of charge and the private sector provides the services. The
agricultural authorities in the aimags establish contracts with the private service providers in the
soums. Upon successful completion of their services, the aimag authorities approve and authorize
payment for the services rendered centrally at MIA.

2.        The program is implemented through laboratory diagnosis and vaccination against
contagious diseases. Available data for the period between 2007 and 2011 show that the number of
animals that have undergone laboratory diagnosis increased from 5,816 in 2007 to 7,685 in 2008,
but fell slightly to 6,718 in 2009. Thereafter, the number of animals covered by laboratory diagnosis
increased steadily to 17,150 in 2011. Vaccinations against contagious diseases increased from 786 in
2007 to 1,018 in 2011.

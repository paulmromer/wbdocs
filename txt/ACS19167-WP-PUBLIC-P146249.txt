PREFACE
Afghanistan remains in the bottom 10 percent globally in electricity consumption per capita (~
100 kWh per year) and only 25-30 percent of its population is connected to the grid, one of the
lowest rates in the world. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) notes that
“Energy is [Afghanistan’s] top economic development priority, and [its] economy’s hope,?
singling out electricity as “the motor that powers [Afghanistan’s] growth.? The National
Energy Supply Program (NESP), a national priority program developed in the context of
setting out a strategy of support for Afghanistan post the 2014 transition, further demonstrates
the priority both country and donors place on support for the power sector.

Planning is a fundamental part of addressing the energy stress of Afghanistan. It is an essential
part of future investment. An analytical framework is needed with which to replace sporadic
decision making with informed policy choices that will support national efforts to reduce
poverty and share prosperity.

Afghanistan’s power sector faces a planning challenge of enormous complexity embedded in a
high degree of uncertainty. Its local generation capacity has remained stagnant (circa 340 MW),
however rapid growth in consumption has been primarily met by imports (circa 80% of the
total) especially from Uzbekistan, suggesting a high vulnerability to interruption in energy
supply. Planning is weak and driven by piecemeal studies. Donor assistance lacks consistency
in selecting and supporting priority investments.

This paper develops a number of approaches to power sector planning that respond to the
uncertainties that Afghanistan faces. It aims to provide an alternative to the “predict then act?
approach to planning, which will allow more robust decision making. The paper is divided
into two parts: the main text provides an overview of the challenges faced in Afghanistan,
analyses some of the key decision problems and future development options and makes
recommendations on how they may be tackled. The annexes contain more detailed case
studies of individual problems and introduces methodological approaches by which they can
be addressed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
E.1.    The environment in which power sector planning must take place in
Afghanistan is especially challenging as a consequence of unusually high levels of
uncertainty about potential resources, each with different environmental impacts,
compounded by the disadvantages of being a land-locked country, and difficult
geopolitical circumstances that further complicate energy security. This report
explores approaches to address the challenges of power sector planning in
Afghanistan.
E.2.     In the past years, power sector master plans have been prepared for
Afghanistan, including one in 1978 and another in 2004. The most recent one was
prepared in 2012 with financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and is
referred to as the Afghanistan Power Sector Master Plan (APSMP). These
planning efforts followed the classical route of least cost planning based on an
approach that requires expert judgement to define the likely future (in terms of
load forecasts, international fuel prices, generation costs and so on) and then use
relatively sophisticated planning models to define an optimal expansion plan.
The difficulty is that such a plan, prepared based on a planning paradigm
sometimes described as “predict-then-act,? remains optimal only for the scenario
into which it is embedded.
E.3.     Such plans are based on the assumption that the implementation of their
conclusions poses few difficulties. In the unusual circumstances of Afghanistan,
assumptions about the ability to finance and implement projects are increasingly
coming under question, rendering many of the large projects proposed by the
master plans unrealistic in terms of scale, likelihood and timing of completion,
and hence the plans are generally too optimistic. Furthermore, methodologies that
rely on the predict-then-act approach do not appear to be grounded in a strategic
view about optimum use of resources, embedded in economic reasoning. Hence
the traditional approach does not lend itself very well to providing decision-
makers in Afghanistan helpful information about the robustness of particular
strategies.
E.4.    The questions and issues surrounding decision making and planning in
Afghanistan led to the formulation of this Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program (ESMAP) funded study on Energy Security Trade-Offs under High
Uncertainty: Resolving Afghanistan's Power Sector Development Dilemma. The first
objective of the study was to develop an approach to power sector planning and
investment decision-making in Afghanistan that accounts for the high level of
uncertainty faced by planners and decision-makers, and that strikes a balance
between the three main policy imperatives of economic efficiency, energy security
and environmental sustainability. A second objective of the study was to
introduce these new approaches to key staff of the relevant entities in the energy
sector in Afghanistan, and contribute to their capacity building using a
participatory approach, through joint analysis of a set of specific pending
planning decisions, and to make recommendations in light of the joint analysis.

THE APPROACH
E.5.    This report, which is the final output of the study, provides an overview
of challenges facing Afghanistan’s ener gy sector, analyzes a select set of key
decision problems and future development options, and makes recommendations
on the way forward. In its underlying analyses, the report takes a different view
about how best to plan the power sector, compared with the more traditional
approaches. Rather than try to attempt to forecast the future, then identify the
“best? plan to meet that future, the analysis turns the question around, and asks

“given a set of options that can be practicably implemented, which one of these
alternatives is the most robust to the main uncertainties?? This does not
necessarily imply a short term outlook focused just on the immediate issues:
indeed, some of the illustrative problems that are discussed in this report explore
what one must do today so that the benefits can be realized far in the future (such
as the ability to build power generation projects).
E.6.     This report proposes a set of relatively simple tools, adapted from a field
of enquiry known as “decision analysis?, to complement the traditional power
sector planning methodology. These techniques have been used in the private
sector for some time to assist financial portfolio decisions and investment
decisions in many sectors, such as oil exploration, where high uncertainty requires
a full understanding of risk.
E.7.     The methodologies developed in this study deal with the often conflicting
criteria of economic least cost, energy security, and environmental sustainability.
It approaches the issue of discount rates, which have particular relevance for
Afghanistan, which must choose between continuing imports (which generally
are attractive under high discount rates) and construction of domestic
hydropower generation (which generally is more attractive under low discount
rates). The study also identifies methodologies that will address both local and
global environment impacts of Afghanistan’s energy development pathways. It
addresses energy security in terms of resilience, risk and their mitigation.

THE CASE STUDIES
E.8.     Chapter 3 of the report outlines the results from a series of case studies
focusing on planning decisions that require urgent attention by the Government
and are likely to have a significant bearing on the future of Afghanistan’s energy
sector. These are:
   Hydropower planning: Progress towards building new large hydropower
    projects recommended in the master plans has been slow, perhaps in part
    because the easiest way to expand supplies has been to increase imports from
    neighboring countries. Annex 2 of the report applies a real options analysis on
    how to assess the steps in hydropower planning given large uncertainties
    about Pakistan’s willingness to take surplus summer hydropower generation
    from Afghanistan, geotechnical feasibility of options under consideration, and
    the difficulties of financing large projects: the decision process is depicted and
    analyzed in decision-trees.
   Coal resources: Notwithstanding several large coal-fired plants appearing in
    recent master plans, there remains high uncertainty about Afghanistan’s coal
    reserves in terms of their quantity, quality, cost and the timescale within
    which they may be available for use. Therefore, master plans that include
    coal-fired power plant projects are likely to remain speculative. The report
    describes how a coal resource can be assessed and uncertainty can be reduced,
    and outlines the key features of a good resource exploration and development
    program. Annex 3 estimates the economic benefits of a proposed coal
    exploration program in a probabilistic scenario analysis.
   Natural Gas: The country’s first gas-fired power generation project has been
    delayed, mainly due to the slow progress of well rehabilitation and new
    exploration, and the completion of a new gas pipeline to Mazar-e-Sharif. The
    gas case study in Annex 4 describes how the high uncertainty surrounding the
    comparison of the development of gas-fired generation versus imported
    electricity can be clarified using the techniques of Robust Decision-making, in
    which one does not attempt to specify the probability of uncertain future

    events, but uses statistical techniques to examine patterns and factors of
    vulnerability of particular choices in a wide range of futures.
   Transmission Development: The main factor complicating decisions about
    system development is the high uncertainty about the location of new
    domestic power projects. The regional problem of lack of synchronization
    among neighboring power grids, and the lack of a grid or distribution code.
    The case study in Annex 5 discusses the main issues in transmission system
    development.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Hydropower Development
E.9.    The analysis in this report shows that the critical uncertainty in moving
ahead with the large candidate hydropower projects is not the uncertainty of
assurances from the Government of Pakistan about its willingness to take summer
surplus power, which in any event would be conditional on technical feasibility.
Rather it is the uncertainty of the cost of domestic thermal generation alternatives
(notably of the Sheberghan gas) and of imported electricity. The Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) that was signed in November 2015 between Afghanistan and
Turkmenistan indicates a cost of US¢ 5/kWh, escalated at three percent per year.
This is an excellent price for Afghanistan, and provides the benchmark cost for
domestic hydropower generation at least in the short run, though the quantity
available at this price may well not extend to additional imports.
E.10. The completed feasibility study for the proposed Bagdhara hydropower
project indicates a levelized electricity cost of US¢ 7/kWh. It is important to note
that the critical question with respect to Bagdhara is whether adequate geological
and geotechnical surveying (with drilling to confirm the depth to bedrock) has
been done at the proposed site, for technical feasibility to be demonstrated.
Moreover, as the feasibility study notes, costs are dependent on the security
situation and there is an unpredictable risk of potential increase of cost and
construction time. Uncertainty about capital cost estimates remains high. The
analysis shows that decision makers have been better served by waiting for the
results of the Bagdhara FS so that its results can be used to recalibrate the APSMP
estimates before making any decisions about further hydropower development.

Coal-fired Generation
E.11. The use of coal (or coal-bed methane) for power generation is a
potentially attractive option for Afghanistan, but until the resources to power
these options are verified with some degree of confidence, coal mine and power
plant planning is premature. It follows that unless an exploration program is
started today, the large future benefits of coal-fired generation (as opposed to
imports of baseload power) can never be realized. There are only two options to
answer the questions related to coal resource availability: either the private sector
explores for and develops the resources it needs, or the public sector funds the
exploration and then either develops the resource itself, or auctions the proven
resource to tender.
E.12. The analysis finds that the current Mining Law is considered too
unfavorable by junior mining exploration companies to give them confidence that
they would be able to secure financing from international investors to pursue
projects in Afghanistan. Similarly there are likely to be significant challenges
associated with options involving the bundling of mineral exploration and power
generation projects in a concession to be given to a foreign minerals mining
consortium, given the implementation challenges experienced in the copper
mining concession in Afghanistan. It follows from this assessment that the only
April 25, 2016                                                                          3
realistic option currently open to the Afghan Government is to finance the
exploration work itself.
E.13. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the expected value of future
benefits of a government-financed exploration program far outweighs its upfront
costs. Under the most pessimistic outcomes for the cost of coal generating projects
relative to imports, the analysis shows that the expected Net Present Value (NPV)
for an exploration program in the known areas of coal resources is $112 million;
while under the expected conditions of coal generating costs and imports, the
NPV is $369 million. Potential benefits of this magnitude warrant immediate
implementation of the proposed Afghan Geological Survey (AGS) program.
Indeed, if extended to the presently unexplored areas of the deep coal on the
North Afghan Plateau, the NPV rises by $762 million. It also follows that even if
the AGS program proved to be two or three times more expensive than estimated
here, the economic benefits to Afghanistan remain high.

Gas-fired Generation
E.14. Gas-fired generation is a well proven technology with some advantages of
modularity over coal and hydropower, especially when using diesel-cycle engines
rather than gas turbines. But as with coal, decisions to invest in gas-fired plant
depend on well-characterized and proven reserves of gas.
E.15. The results of the analysis show that the decision to proceed with
reciprocating engines for use of the Sheberghan gas is robust with respect to the
main uncertainties over a very wide range of futures. Even if the cost of
Sheberghan gas proves to be double the cost now seen as likely (around $8 rather
than $4/mmBTU), the probability that a Sheberghan gas project would deliver
negative economic returns is very small. The International Finance Corporation
(IFC) of the World Bank Group is considering supporting a 50 MW gas engine
project in Mazar-e Sharif. This analysis concludes that the proposed project
should be strongly supported, since it is of reasonable scale, and gas engines are
the most robust technology given the likely operating environment.

Transmission Planning Strategies
E.16. Major transmission investment decisions have recently been taken on the
basis of recommendations in the APSMP and are currently being implemented.
During the next few years, and as conditions are expected to change in the region,
Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat
(DABS) have the opportunity to revisit the priorities for investing in further
development of the transmission network. The review process will need to take
into account alternative ways of further supporting power transit operations
without limiting the ability to meet the competing financial needs for supporting
the country’s rural electrification program and developing i ndigenous generation
resources.
E.17. This could indeed be an appropriate topic for a real options (RO) analysis
of transit strategies based on assumptions and decision criteria that take into
account (i) the risk of building 500kV lines that are underutilized because
potential transit opportunities fail to materialize; (ii) the options for making a
return on investment from either 500kV high voltage alternating current (HVAC)
wheeling or high voltage direct current (HVDC) line availability fees or both; (iii)
the additional investment required to guarantee an equivalent level of reliability
and security for the importer or exporter of power; (iv) the future use of dedicated
transit facilities at the end of the life of the PPA. Clearly there is less cost and
operational risk to Afghanistan if a dedicated HVDC line is built by its proponents

and used for transit operations even though there may be a perceived loss of
sovereignty in enabling independent commercial operation.
E.18. A key recommendation of this study is that before 2020, when the new
transmission projects are expected to be commissioned, there is an urgent need to
develop a national grid code primarily to facilitate negotiations with
Afghanistan’s neighbors but also to determine the incremental investments
needed to upgrade substations and generation control systems to meet security
and reliability standards for the transmission network. The review process
necessary to formulate the essential features of a grid code must include a strategy
for synchronization between Afghanistan and its neighbors to facilitate the more
efficient use of domestic generation. This may include a requirement for new
investments in back-to-back HVDC (HVDC b/b) or HVAC interconnections, or
variable frequency transformer (VFT) facilities, which can transmit electricity
between two asynchronous (or synchronous) AC frequency domains.
E.19. Any future master plan will need to establish rules for transmission and
generation diversity planning to minimize the potential for widespread
disruptions and facilitate the development of new hydropower and coal-fired
generation that may be associated with large mining operations. There will also
need to be a clear policy setting out how Afghanistan proposes to integrate its
domestic transmission development (which may be built to achieve a lower
standard of reliability) with any new power import, export or transit proposals
that have their own special requirements for security and commercial viability.
E.20. Last, a strategy for optimizing the development and eventual
interconnection of the large number of small grids is required. They should be
made ready to connect and disconnect from the grid operating in both grid-
connected or island mode. There needs to be greater consumer engagement to
solve power issues locally by enabling the penetration of local renewables in
residential, commercial, and industrial customer segments.         In this way,
distribution can become a transmission system resource, with all its components
as part of a cohesive system. This will depend heavily on standardization
(physical and data) as could also be established in the grid code.

General Conclusions
E.21. The analysis undertaken as part of this study demonstrates the value of a
step-by-step planning process, in which the option of using particular resources
for power generation is evaluated in the framework of an implementation plan,
assessing the uncertainties at each step. This is likely to be more useful than
developing further large capacity expansion optimization models, which will
have limited application in the context of Afghanistan.
E.22. The analysis strongly supports the need to prioritize development of IPPs,
but at least for the next few years, their scale must be commensurate with realistic
assessments of the likely availability of private equity and the suitability of the
proposed technology. The proposed 50 MW gas engine-powered IPP at Mazar-e
Sharif meets both these requirements, but projects at the 300-600 MW scale and
based on Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) technology or modern coal
technology seem a more distant and unlikely prospect.
E.23. This report recommends that MEW initiates a broader national energy
plan to look at alternative energy futures to the same level of detail, and based on
economic reasoning, as in the APSMP: the main focus of such an exercise being to
assess what is the best approach for use of the national fossil fuel and hydro
endowment. Indeed, the use of gas to replace diesel in Kabul would also bring
significant environmental and public health benefits. A consultant is currently

preparing a Gas Master Plan financed by ADB for the Ministry of Mines and
Petroleum which may provide an entry point for this higher level plan.
E.24. When combined with the difficulties of mobilizing finance for
hydropower or thermal generation projects, Afghanistan’s need to secure
adequate supplies of electricity limit the freedom of choice for development of the
power sector. In the short term there really is no other option but to negotiate
large-scale electricity imports from Central Asian Republic (CAR) neighbors,
combined with upgrading and rehabilitating existing hydropower projects, and
increased efforts to develop renewable energy in the rural areas. It is recognized
that this has political and security implications for the authorities, and underlines
the importance of setting up a functional and high-quality planning system.

Essential components of a good planning framework
E.25.    A good planning framework would include the following elements:
   The regulatory and legislative basis for conducting planning and for taking
    investment decisions.
   How different tools (or one particular tool, to be selected from a range) could
    be used for long term planning and thereafter for assessing specific
    investment decisions.
   The responsibilities of each agency involved in the planning, decision making,
    construction and operations phases of investments. For the purposes of this
    review, the focus is necessarily on MEW as the agency responsible for
    planning and its translation into broader policy making.
   A clear understanding of the capacity, data and management information
    systems needed to ensure that planning can be carried out.
   A mechanism by which continuity in planning and decision making is
    assured, with the implied need for a politically neutral approach that will
    allow consistency in implementation of the power system plan.
E.26. As important as the planning framework is the need to ensure a
participatory approach for each step in the planning process. In Afghanistan’s
case, this may require consulting a broader group of stakeholders than in
countries which have not so recently emerged from conflict.

1        INTRODUCTION
________________________________________________________________________
1.       The power sector in Afghanistan faces a planning challenge of enormous
complexity embedded in a high degree of uncertainty. Over the past few years
Afghanistan's local generation capacity has remained stagnant at about 340 MW,
and the rapid growth of consumption has been met primarily by imports which
are now about 80% of total consumption especially from Uzbekistan, suggesting a
high vulnerability to interruption in energy supply. This vulnerability was
demonstrated by the loss of power to Kabul in February 2015 and again in
January 2016, when first an avalanche and then insurgent action brought down
several towers of the 220kV line that transfers electricity from Uzbekistan to
Kabul; for the time that the line was out of commission Kabul had to rely entirely
on domestic supplies, leading to significant load shedding. In the past decade,
planning capacity has been relatively weak and driven by piecemeal studies.
Donor support has lacked clarity in terms of priority investments, although the
revitalization of the Inter-ministerial Committee on Energy (ICE) offers the
opportunity for significant improvement in the planning process.

1.1 POWER SECTOR PLANNING IN AFGHANISTAN
2.       In the past decade two power sector master plans have been prepared for
Afghanistan: in 2004 and the more recent APSMP in 2012 which was financed by
the ADB 1. These planning efforts have followed the classical route of least cost
planning based on an approach that requires judgments about the likely future
(load forecasts, international fuel prices, generation costs and so on) and then use
relatively sophisticated planning models to define an optimal expansion plan.
The difficulty with this approach is that any least cost plan remains optimal only
if the predicted future materializes. Moreover, such plans are based on the
assumption that the implementation of their recommendations is straight
forward, which in most countries is not unreasonable. But in Afghanistan’s
unusual circumstances, normal assumptions about the ability to finance and
implement projects do not apply: many of the large projects proposed by the
Master Plans are of a scale that is unrealistic, with timelines and financing
expectations that are largely too optimistic.
3.       The APSMP, prepared based on a conventional power sector modelling
approach, contains much useful information and offers a good analysis of what
would be optimal in a less uncertain environment. Nonetheless, the APSMP does
not appear to have taken into account a systematic risk assessment of candidate
projects, including of technical, implementation and financing considerations. It
therefore relies on what might be characterized as the ideal “least cost? future.
4.       The challenge facing decision makers in Afghanistan’s energy sector is
how to determine the most robust options now, to secure the best possible or least
bad outcome in the near or distant future, amid a range of uncertainties.
Uncertainty over the extent of Afghanistan’s coal resources illustrates this
challenge: both Master plans propose 300-400 MW-scale coal-fired power plants
using Afghanistan’s domestic coal resources. Yet to realize the benefits of
potential coal use to meet base-load requirements before moving forward with
any investment plan, Afghan decision makers must first establish whether in fact
there is a resource and if so, its extent and cost. Questions surrounding the
feasibility of large coal-fired plants are further complicated by the peculiar
conditions of Afghanistan: in a land-locked county, it cannot simply be assumed

hereinafter cited as APSMP.
April 25, 2016                                                                                7
that internationally traded coal can be purchased and physically imported for use
when it is needed.
5.       Similar problems arise in hydropower planning.              The proposed
generation expansion plan outlined in APSMP includes several large hydro
projects (among others, the 300 MW Kunar B and 789 MW Kunar A, costing $600
million and $2,000 million, respectively). 2 Without the availability of reliable and
good quality information on hydrology, site geology, access to site during
development and construction, it is uncertain that such projects can be financed as
required by the plan.
6.       There are many questions about the extent to which conventional least
cost planning models can deal with the range of uncertainties faced by
Afghanistan, as in many small and post-conflict countries. A case in point is
natural gas: Afghanistan may indeed have a high likelihood of being host to
natural gas reserves in sufficient quantities for large-scale power generation, but it
does not follow that power generation is the best use of that resource. Economic
theory demands that domestic resources should be used in the application that
has the highest economic value – one of the issues to be evaluated in the
forthcoming Gas Master Plan. Kabul is one of the world’s most polluted cities, so
if gas can be brought to Kabul to displace diesel used for power generation, and
coal, fuel wood and waste materials used by some industries and households for
their process, heating and cooking needs, the local environmental benefits also are
large.3
7.        Should long gas pipelines be required, there would be further trade-offs
related to security. There are important questions of long term policy into which
power sector investment plans should be embedded. The limits of the predict-
then-act approach are further illustrated in the 2014 Addendum to the APSMP,
which presents 23 scenarios, each involving different assumptions about project
delays, and each costed out, but using the same building blocks of large projects to
present a generation expansion plan for each. Such multiplicity of scenarios makes
it difficult to derive well founded recommendations, not least because many of the
basic assumptions about load forecasts, international fuel prices, and discount
rates are common to all.
8.      In the particular circumstances facing Afghanistan, there is need for an
alternative approach to planning in the power sector. Afghanistan faces a sector
planning problem of high complexity and uncertainty, for which conventional
approaches and tools offer little practical help to decision-makers in
understanding trade-offs, and how to deal with uncertainty.

1.2      OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THIS STUDY
9.      This study was framed in the recognition of the Government’s need for
developing a modern decision framework for sector planning. It recognizes the
large uncertainties, and potentially conflicting objectives of economic efficiency,
energy security, and environmental sustainability. The limitations of traditional
planning approaches, and the need to address the various questions and issues
surrounding decision making and planning in Afghanistan led to the formulation
of this study. Its first objective is to develop an approach to power sector
planning and investment decision-making in Afghanistan that accounts for the


2        APSMP, Table 6.6.6-1
3        And far outweigh the GHG emission consequences – which even if Afghanistan
         were able to build several 1000 MW of coal projects by 2030, will still leave
         Afghanistan among the world’s smallest emitters of GHG per unit of GDP and per
         capita.
April 25, 2016                                                                            8
high level of uncertainty faced by planners and decision-makers, and that strikes a
balance between the three main policy imperatives of economic efficiency, energy
security and environmental sustainability. The second objective is to introduce
these new approaches to key staff at the relevant entities in Afghanistan by a joint
analysis of a set of specific pending planning decisions, and to make
recommendations in light of the joint analysis.
10.      The focus of this study was to develop an alternative analytical
framework for tackling key decision making and planning problems in
Afghanistan’s power sector. It then aimed to apply this framework to concrete
problems that require immediate decisions, working closely with key staff of the
MEW and DABS, the national power utility. To achieve the objectives, a study
team comprising World Bank staff and consultants with complementary expertise
in transmission planning, fuel supply options, generation planning, and energy
economics was formed. As part of the study, two workshops were held bringing
together the larger study group. The first workshop, held in December 2014,
discussed the proposed framework and methodology, and identified the real life
decisions facing the ministry and utility. The second workshop was held in May
2015, with representatives from MEW, DABS and ICE working jointly to apply the
approaches developed for decision making under uncertainty to the selected
decision problems. This report, which is the final output of the broader study,
provides an overview of challenges facing A fghanistan’s energy sector, analyzes a
select set of key decision problems and future development options, and makes
recommendations on the way forward. In its underlying analyses, the report takes
a different view about how best to plan the power sector, compared with the more
traditional approaches.
11.      Rather than try to attempt to forecast the future, then identify the “best?
plan to meet that future, the analysis turns the question around, and asks “given
a set of options that can be practicably implemented, which one of these
alternatives is the most robust to the main uncertainties?? Instead of adopting
the traditional “forecast then act? approach to planning (i.e. act on the basis of the
set of assumptions seen as most likely to identify the least cost strategy), this
study explores an approach in which risk and return are explicitly considered.
This report proposes a set of relatively simple tools, adapted from a field of
enquiry known as “decision analysis? or “decision-making under uncertainty?, to
complement the traditional power sector planning methodology.4                  These
techniques have been used in the private sector for some time to assist financial
portfolio and investment decisions in sectors where high uncertainty requires a
full understanding of risk and where some of the uncertainties can be resolved by
additional research, exploration or data gathering. The classic application of this
approach is in the oil and gas industry, where developers are faced with the
question of how much additional expenditure is justified on surveys and seismic
studies before drilling a well. In power sector planning, the analogous problem is
encountered in the geothermal sector: how much so-called 3G (geology,
geochemistry and geophysics) is warranted before exploration drilling
commences for a given geothermal work area. Such problems lead to the concept
of the so-called expected value of perfect information, and to concept of real
options (the value of waiting until uncertainties are resolved) – both concepts are
illustrated in the case studies in this report.

consideration of risk preferences of the decision-maker, and of an understanding

of the consequences of making decisions based on assumptions that subsequently
prove to have been in error. The use of an approach based on decision making
under uncertainty does not necessarily imply an emphasis on the short term,
focused just on the immediate issues: indeed, some of the illustrative problems
that are discussed in this report explore what one must do today so that the
expected benefits can be realized in the future.
13.     The primary audience of this report is decision makers in the key Afghan
agencies in the sector, especially the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MEW, ICE and
DABS. This report is structured to focus on the needs of the primary audience,
with a shorter main report targeting decision makers, accompanied by technical
annexes covering the detailed technical discussions, case studies and analyses that
can be useful for other audiences, including energy sector practitioners in
Afghanistan and other countries facing similar challenges.
14.     Organization of the report. The main part of the report is organized as
follows: Section 1 introduces the study and its objectives; Section 2 summarizes
the sector challenges and outlines the methodology; Section 3 applies the
proposed approach to analyze a series of real life decision problems facing
Afghanistan today and Section 4 discusses the main findings, recommendations,
and next steps, primarily for the benefit of decision makers in Afghanistan. The
technical annexes, targeted to energy sector practitioners, delve deeper into the
key components of the study, starting with the methodology, followed by detailed
case studies on real life decision problems facing Afghanistan’s energy sector, and
additional information that may be useful for technical specialists.

DILEMMA
15.      This Section describes the essential problems related to Afghanistan’s
power sector development, and the unusually high levels of uncertainty that make
decision-making so difficult. The Government of Afghanistan is faced with
having to make decisions about the future of the energy sector in a way that
balances the sometimes competing objectives of economic efficiency, energy
security and environmental sustainability. This is true for decision makers in
most countries. There are many answers to the question of what to do next, but
the difficulty has been that the sequence of the recommended projects in proposed
plans has few links to the likelihood that these projects can actually be
implemented given the many uncertainties. This chapter discusses how the
Government’s objectives are framed in the current state of the Afghan energy
sector, and elaborates on the approach it has adopted.

2.1      INSTITUTIONAL SETTING IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR
16.     Primary authority and responsibility for the electricity sector resides
with MEW. In May 2008, the government of Afghanistan corporatized MEW’s
National Electricity Service Department Da Afghanistan Breshna Mossasa (DABM)
and it became an independent state owned utility Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat
(DABS). This vertically integrated utility is responsible for electricity operations
in the entire country: its shares are owned by the MOF (45%), MEW (35%), the
Ministry of Economy (10%) and the Ministry of Urban Development (10%). MEW
is responsible for power sector planning, while DABS is responsible for
operations.
17.     In August 2014, the Government announced plans to create an Energy
Master Planning Secretariat (EMP-s) in MEW. Its principal purpose was to be
responsible for updating the APSMP, for preparation of consolidated budgets for
submission to MOF, and for reporting implementation progress to the Ministry of
Economy. This entity is expected to become operational in the near future.
18.      ICE has served as an important coordinating body. It meets every few
months, and issuing detailed minutes that summarize the status of planning and
project implementation.5

2.2      POWER SUPPLY AND DEMAND OVER THE PAST DECADE
19.      There is no single Afghan power system. It presently consists of four
distinct service areas along with numerous small isolated systems that may take
some time to interconnect (Figure 2.1). Each is connected in some way to a source
of generation, mostly imported, to which part or all of the corresponding Afghan
system is then synchronized, creating a series of “islands?. Of the four main
geographically separate power networks in Afghanistan, the North East Power
System (NEPS) is the largest. The NEPS currently supplies part of Kabul city over
long 220 kV links from Tajikistan and, separately, Uzbekistan. Other parts of
Kabul are supplied from various local hydro and diesel generators which are
currently not allowed to be synchronized with the NEPS (for reasons explained
below). Under a USAID sponsored project it is expected that by 2018, NEPS will
be interconnected with the Kandahar-based South East Power System (SEPS).



5        This body also has a website that provides much useful information
         (https://sites.google.com/site/iceafghanistan/).   Efforts to reinstate the
         Afghanistan Energy Information Center (AEIC), previously funded by USAID, are
         now underway.

20.      Over the past few years, the rapid growth of Afghanistan’s electricity
consumption has depended on imports. It has been possible primarily due to the
rapid growth of supply from the CARs, and from Uzbekistan in particular. In
2011, almost 80% of the country’s total supply was imported from Uzbekistan. In
the past decade, only one new generation project has been built - a 105 MW diesel
project in Kabul, which has been little used due to diesel fuel shortages and high
operating costs.
21.     The distinguishing feature of energy demand in Afghanistan is the sharp
winter peak. As shown in Figure 2.2, December-January consumption is between
150-180% of the summer consumption. The figure also shows the change in
generation mix: with the start of significant imports in early 2009, diesels have
rarely been used, and by 2011, 74% of the Kabul demand was derived from
imports brought from the North across the Salang Pass transmission line.

22.     With demand far in excess of supply, loads are severely curtailed. Figure
2.3 shows the average hourly demand for February 2015: of the estimated total
peak demand of 497 MW (at 20:00), just 350 MW can be met, of which 252 MW
derives from imports.

23.     No less severe is the power situation in SEPS that supplies Kandahar and
Helmand provinces. In November 2014, it was reported that 93 factories in
Kandahar were inoperative due to power shortages6 One of the cornerstones of
economic development in the region is the new industrial park development at
Shurandam – where over 100 small factories had started up in the last few years,
with access to reliable electricity produced by NATO military-run generators
powered by fuel procured and donated by USAID.7 The sustainability of this
development – a key element of the NATO counter-insurgency strategy – is
unclear once donor funds expire, and if more sustainable sources of power are
delayed. Without reliable grid supply, the only other source is diesel self-
generation at costs that are prohibitive (even at the lower oil prices of early 2016),
and which would directly challenge the fragile economic development of the
region.   It is precisely this urgency to provide greater electricity access
(throughout Afghanistan) that has driven NEPS/DABS electricity supply to its
extraordinary dependence on electricity imports from Afghanistan’s northern
neighbors, and the need to bring on additional supplies once the SEPS/NEPS
connection is complete.
24.       In Afghanistan, energy security and supply diversification have, for the
time being, been subordinated to the requirements of low cost supply expansion .
Nevertheless it is understood that over-reliance on a single source entails
significant risk, not merely due to potential impacts in the event of interruption
(be it from security or natural causes), but also the loss of negotiating leverage on
price for new IPP generation projects. The ease with which imports have been
rapidly expanded also appears to have reduced the incentives to examine
properly other generation alternatives. Notwithstanding the recommendations of
the 2004 NorConsult Master Plan to undertake feasibility studies for large
hydropower projects, only a single FS to international standards, for the Bagdhara
project, has been completed. In the 2012 APSMP this project appears for

have yet to be prepared.

2.3      TRADE WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
25.     Afghanistan is landlocked, surrounded by energy rich neighbors to the
west and north, and an energy-hungry Pakistan to the east. Given its
geographical position and fragility it has looked to its neighbors for electricity
supply. Its historic role as a conduit between central and south Asia lends itself to
the concept of Afghanistan as an energy transit country between CARs and
Pakistan.

Central Asian Republics
26.      Although attractive, importing power from the CARs incurs significant
costs. It is important to recognize that the neighboring Tajik, Turkmen and Uzbek
power systems operate asynchronously with one another and with Afghanistan
(although the Turkmen system is synchronized with that of Iran). Hence
importing power from these different countries obliges Afghanistan to operate
several separate power systems each synchronized with its neighboring supplier
or with its own domestic supply (which is itself not synchronized). While this has
helped Afghanistan grow its electricity consumption over the last five years,
asynchronous supplies limit the opportunities to interconnect to improve security
of supplies and expand the power network in a rational way. Afghanistan’s
contract with Uzbekistan expressly forbids DABS from synchronizing domestic
generation plants with the Uzbek system. On the other hand, the contract with
Turkmenistan stipulates that the High Voltage (HV) transmission facilities in
Afghanistan must have “identical technical characteristics with those of
Turkmenistan…? Other smaller load centers adjacent to the Uzbekistan-Kabul
transmission lines are similarly constrained to use their own diesel or smaller
generation without access to the cheaper Uzbek power.
27.     If Afghanistan is to avoid wasteful and costly duplication, further
investment in transmission cannot avoid the synchronization issue. In the first
instance it is essential that Afghanistan adopts the relevant elements of a Grid
Code acceptable to the CARs to enable DABS to synchronize its in-country
generation with the imported power systems.

Pakistan
28.     Pakistan presently suffers from persistent power shortages . These occur
especially during the summer, when electricity demand for is at its peak. This
acute shortage is the driving force for the various proposals for electricity trade in
the region, and the CASA-1000 project in particular.
29.      Pakistan’s power shortages affect Afghanistan’s hydropower planning
considerations. Looking forward, the extent to which Pakistan’s shortages will
persist in the medium to long term is a fundamental question for Afghanistan. It
is widely assumed that were Afghanistan to build its own new large hydropower
projects, Pakistan would be a potential buyer for their expected summer surplus.
Pakistan is now redoubling its efforts to build its own large hydropower projects:
the 1320 MW Tarbela 4 extension is now under construction and a further 1320
MW for Tarbela 5 is under consideration. The much larger 4,350 MW Dasu
hydropower project is also nearing construction start, with financing in place for
the 2,160 MW Phase I project nearing close, and preliminary works now
underway. Moreover, gas sector reforms are underway in Pakistan, which, if
successful, may result in more gas being available for power generation, which
would also alleviate power shortages if implemented. The extent of summer
power shortages in Pakistan ten years from now, and Pakistan’s willingness to

pay for importing summer power from new regional interconnection projects, is
therefore unclear8.
30.      Pakistan’s need to import for gas-based electricity is also uncertain.
Pakistan might be a willing buyer of gas-based electricity imported from
Turkmenistan, as envisaged under regional power trade projects involving
Afghanistan as a transit country. That must be balanced against Pakistan’s
intention to build its own CCGT projects based on imported LNG. Power imports
from Turkmenistan would be attractive to Pakistan only if the price of gas-fired
generation in Turkmenistan is sufficiently low to offset the cost of transmission
plus the cost of any transit fee charged by Afghanistan. So that will depend
mainly on the size of the difference between the LNG price in the Asia Pacific
market (LNG would most likely to imported from Qatar, although Pakistan is also
reportedly exploring other suppliers), and the market price of gas in
Turkmenistan (driven by competition between potential gas suppliers to China,
including Turkmenistan and Russia). In the past, that differential has been large
but it may narrow in the future if the global efforts to decouple LNG prices from
oil prices succeed and the current surplus persists.
31.     Gas transit may opportunities may compete with electricity transit.
Moreover, Pakistan is actively exploring imports of pipeline gas from Iran, while
also pursuing the Turkmenistan Afghanistan Pakistan India (TAPI) gas pipeline
project. In the latter case, Afghanistan stands to receive substantial transit
revenues as well as gas for its own use. More revenue from transit – implying
Pakistan and India are importing more gas – may mean less opportunity to sell
summer surplus hydro to Pakistan. This may be a tradeoff over which

2.4      POWER SECTOR DEVELOPMENT VISION
32.     Past national power plans (and the recent APSMP) have been ambitious.
In 2011, it was anticipated that by 2014/2015, the construction of a 400 MW coal
project would be underway including the additional transmission infrastructure
in place to evacuate the power; that the connection between SEPS and NEPS
would be complete, that major hydro projects would be underway on the Kunar
river following trans-boundary agreements for hydropower development; and
that the Sheberghan gas project would be under way (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.4).
Their projected costs far exceeded the level of likely financing available, with the
consequence that they raised expectations among some stakeholders, while also
making prioritization difficult.

33.      Preparation of master plans can increase risks. The risk is that the master
plan simply becomes the entry point for a proposed project which does not ensure
that there is either financing or the need to build it. It misses the purpose of there
being a living document to guide the development of the sector. This is a problem
that is not unique to Afghanistan, and most countries make efforts to avoid this,
by instituting a set master planning cycle, perhaps in line with a broader economic
planning model such as a five year economic development plan. Other countries
provide annual updates. The risk of not doing so is that a rolling master plan that
evolves simply gets bigger and it becomes impossible to remove projects from the
plan once they are in, because vested interests continue to support their inclusion.
The general guiding principle should be that power sector master plans, as any
other plan, must be realistic and achievable.

34.     Many investments have been delayed. The NEPS-SEPS connection –
supported by USAID – is now expected to be completed only in 2018 although it is
unclear how synchronization issues would be dealt with. The coal-fired power
plant project is stalled – the China Metallurgical Group Corporation (CMGC) coal
resource assessment was significantly delayed by security problems in the region,
and the status of the mining concession is also unclear. Little progress has been
made on the Sheberghan gas power generation project. However some progress

2.5      ENERGY SECURITY CONCERNS AND DECISION-MAKING IN THE SECTOR

Dimensions of Energy Security in the Afghan Context
35.     Expansion of electricity supply has come at the expense of increasing
import dependence. In Afghanistan, the expansion of electricity supply over the
past 7-8 years has relied almost exclusively on imports from its northern and
western neighbors, at average costs of less than US¢ 6/kWh. This has come at the
potential geopolitical risk concomitant with dependence on its neighbors and
particularly on Uzbekistan which provides the bulk of imports for NEPS and the
Kabul region. It also depends on the physical security of the single 220kV
transmission corridor that brings power to the Kabul region. Even though an
energy security policy may not have been explicitly formulated by the
Government, the way in which the trade-off has been made in practice makes
clear that the risks stemming from the sector’s vulnerability to changes in
geopolitical circumstances or damage to the Salang Pass transmission corridor are
not considered severe when assessed against the alternative of constraining
consumption to the available domestic supply. It is well recognized that access to
affordable grid-connected electricity is central to economic development, which is
acknowledged to be the only route to a long term sustainable future. Section A1.3
in Annex 1 provides further details on the most predominant energy security
concerns that were discussed during the course of this study. A broader
discussion of the different descriptions and interpretations of implications of
energy security is also available in Annex 1.
36.     Physical security is an increasing source of uncertainty. The prevailing
perceptions of the security issues facing Afghanistan reflect the view as seen by
Afghan officials involved in the day-to-day operation of the power system, and
faced with short term priorities. These can be summarized as: the imperative of
ensuring supply to consumers; the lack of domestic refinery capacity; dependence
on electricity imports; the harsh weather in Afghanistan; local opposition; and
insurgent activity.
37.      There is a disconnect between the perceptions of energy security of Afghan
officials and potential investors and equipment suppliers overseas .10
Unfortunately it is the perception of parties outside Afghanistan – particularly
potential investors – that pose the most significant obstacle to developing the
generation options for the long term. In addition to the problems faced by the
Chinese mining consortium in assessing the coal resource, other recent examples
include: difficulties of consulting companies working on hydropower FS that
require extensive on the ground investigations; and limited interest in bidding to


9        According to the ICE meeting of February 2015, construction contracts for the first
         phase were to be awarded in the 2Q 2015.
10 There is no doubt that physical ecurity concerns may easily become misused as a

convenient cover for the mismanagement of foreign contractors. The SIGAR report on the
Tarakhil project asserted that delays and cost overruns were largely a consequence of
ambiguities in the statement of work, delays in subcontract awards, subcontractor
performance problems, lack of on-site quality assurance, lack of timely approvals, and poor
communication between USAID and the contractors. The only Afghanistan-specific issue
was delays associated with land ownership (also noted by the World Bank Enterprise
Survey as one of the main constraints to private investment). See SIGAR, Special Report:
Contract Delays and Cost Overruns for the Kabul Power Plant and Sustainability Remains a Key
Challenge. January 2010.

country.

Decision-making Implications of Energy Security
38.      Private investment is limited by poor security and political instability .
As noted by the World Bank’s 2014 Business enterprise survey of Afghanistan, 11
after political instability (25%), corruption (16%), access to land (14%) and finance
(12%), lack of electricity is cited by 10% of businesses as the main obstacle to
private investment.12 These assessments severely constrain the freedom of choice
for power sector investment in Afghanistan, and has led to significant distortions,
particularly to over-investment in transmission and under-investment in
generation.
39.      Costs and feasibility are affected by uncertainty. Detailed feasibility
studies show that generation project construction costs, say, for a CCGT in
northern Afghanistan could be 60% greater than a comparable unit in Pakistan
(attributable to “substantial logistics and security costs?).13 Similarly, the cost
estimate for extra security for the construction of the CASA-1000 transmission line
was increased by $60 million in the latest FS update. 14 Therefore, in the absence of
a sustained improvement in the overall security environment, the feasibility of
any large project being built as an IPP will be highly uncertain and will involve
significant risks and costs.
40.      Energy security concerns need to be addressed pragmatically in decision
making. If a decision maker is to compare two alternative investments, or two
alternative generation plans, and ask which contributes more to energy security,
then the first question is how the security dimension of each would be quantified
in practice. The usual expedient is textual discussions (often on the presumption
that the argument is self-evident and needs no further explanation): but these
inevitably descend into vague assertions for which there may or may not be much
basis, and which contribute few meaningful insights. The case studies in the
annexes to this report show practical ways of quantifying the security dimension.
41.      A quantitative approach to energy security requires first a decision about
whether it should be treated as an economic externality, or as a separate
attribute. If the former, it needs to be quantified and monetized, and included in
the table of economic flows (or NPV) calculations. If to be treated as a separate
attribute it needs to reflect an objective separate to that of maximizing economic
returns. Analogy may be drawn to the treatment of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions reductions: one can either monetize the global social value of carbon,
and include the resulting flows in the calculation of economic returns; or,
recognizing the inherent difficulties of estimating such damage costs, calculate the
(undiscounted) lifetime carbon emissions and then focus on the trade-offs
between the two.
42.     In the case of Afghanistan, narrowly defined dimensions of energy
security are subordinate to the overall public security environment - which plays a

         2015 review of business regulations for domestic companies in 189 economies.
         While Afghanistan ranks high in starting a business, it is nearly last in dealing
         with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, trading across
         borders, and enforcing contracts.

major role in determining the costs of infrastructure investment (and power sector
capital costs in particular), and even the ability to finance and implement any
large capital investment.      Common sense dictates that the physical security
aspects are built into the economic costs of the project (and indeed may influence
the choice of one project over another – Bagdhara over Kunar for example). But
the energy security implications do not so easily lend themselves to this
quantification in an individual project and can only be done by comparing some
measure of system security (for example loss of load probability - LOLP) with two
different projects and seeing which one gives the “more secure? result.

2.6       ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS AND DECISION-MAKING
43.     To some extent, environmental and social concerns are already being
taken into account in energy sector decision making. The 2012 APSMP notes that:


      The general considerations and preliminary social screening of the selected projects ...
      reveal that the social impacts of energy infrastructure projects are mainly related to
      land use, land acquisition and resettlement issues … as well as to Environment,
      Health and Safety impacts that will arise during the construction and operation
      phases of the projects that are the subject of the Environmental Impact Assessment
      and Environmental Management Plans.
44.     For example, as noted in Annex 1, consideration of social impact issues
have already shaped the design of the Bagdhara hydro project, whose reservoir
design was adjusted to avoid large scale resettlement issues. Other preliminary
studies of potential hydro projects suggest that the application of international
safeguards policies should not pose insuperable difficulties.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
45.     The avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is unlikely to be a
primary concern for policy makers: Afghanistan’s GHG emissions are among the
lowest in the world, both in absolute and in per capita terms (Table 2.2).
Afghanistan ranks at the bottom of the list with emissions less than 0.1
tons/capita. It can be stated with confidence that Afghanistan’s GHG emissions
will remain negligible, even if by 2030 several thousand MW of coal base load
capacity were in operation.15

15        There is much uncertainty about population size. The World Development
          Indicator (WDI) database gives the 2010 population as 34.4 million – which value
          is used in this report unless stated to the contrary.

46.      Quantifying the GHG emissions of alternative power sector options is
straightforward (and described in the World Bank’s 2015 Guidelines for carbon
accounting).16 It is also likely that the strict guidelines that apply to the World
Bank’s financing of coal projects could almost certainly be met, given the need for
thermal power to improve energy security, reduce power shortages, and
increased access. The main consideration would turn on whether gas is available
in sufficient quantity as a viable alternative to coal.
47.      The World Bank has now also issued guidelines for the valuation of
carbon emissions, so calculation of economic returns with and without inclusion
of carbon emissions is also straightforward.17 If the baseline carbon values
($30/ton CO2 in 2015, increasing to $50/ton by 2030) were applied to the
valuation of coal and its alternatives – it would add 2.7 US¢/kWh to a coal project,
but only 1 US¢/kWh to a gas CCGT. The summary of the cost benefit analysis in
Table 2.3 shows the impact of adding the damage cost of GHGs at the baseline
level recommended by the World Bank.18 More detailed calculations are in Annex
1.

48.     These are illustrative calculations and this paper does not argue that
Afghanistan should make urgent power sector decisions based purely on the
avoidance of GHG emission damage costs. Indeed, these simple calculations are
made much more difficult when the various uncertainties in assumptions are
taken into account. However, the calculations do show the importance of the
discount rate assumption, and the main principle involved, namely that the
relevant externalities and damage costs be monetized and included in the table of
costs and benefits.

Local Air Quality
49.      Kabul has recorded levels of ambient air pollutants greater even than
Beijing and Lahore. Located at a high altitude, ringed by mountains, and subject
to frequent atmospheric inversions, concentrations of PM2.5, SOx and NOx are
multiples of generally accepted safe levels (Table2.4). According to the Ministry
of Health, some 3,000 deaths per year in Kabul are attributable to the toxic air
quality: in a sample of 200 hospital patients, 80% had elevated levels of lead
(indicative of leaded gasoline). Indeed, so serious are the perceptions of poor air
quality that the US Defense Department has been petitioned to include exposure
to Kabul’s toxic air quality conditions in military service personal histories. 19
50.      The direct contributions of DABS thermal generation to these air quality
levels is minimal. Major sources of pollution include motor vehicles (many of
which are old, and poorly maintained), brick kilns, and open burning of tires and

waste material. Coal (of unknown quality) is widely used as a residential fuel,
including in small district heating systems for new residential developments. The
Tarakhil diesel plant and other generators owned by DABS are used infrequently.

51.       Self-generation of electricity is likely a large contributor to local air
pollution. As grid power delivered to Kabul has increased in recent years, the use
of diesel self-generation will have declined (other things equal), but with renewed
economic and industrial growth, power shortages remain widespread, and
estimates of the current self-generation capacity in commercial and industrial
enterprises is between 25-100 MW. In addition, in the residential sector, many
households have 2-stroke gasoline generators. The strong winter peak demand
for electricity is largely attributable to the widespread use of electric bar-heaters.
Much residential heating and cooking is from burning wood, coal and wastes, –
though LPG has begun to replace it for cooking. Greater availability of grid-
electricity can only be beneficial from the point of view of reducing emissions
from heating and cooking, though it is likely to exacerbate difficulties of meeting
peak demand.20

Social Impacts
52.      Social impacts are not expected to be a major source of uncertainty in
planning. Major generation and transmission projects, as well as domestic
resource exploitation (coal, gas, oil, hydro), may affect the well-being, land use
and livelihoods of project-affected persons (PAPs). There is little reliable
information about the number of PAPs likely to be displaced by the large
hydropower projects: the pre-feasibility study of five smaller Kunar river projects
showed the number of displaced households in the few hundreds (Table 2.5), with
the cost of social mitigation plans between $6.5 and $18 million. It is estimated
that for Kunar A if 1,234 households are to be resettled, the total costs of the EMP
and SMP would be at about $36.4 million. The detailed feasibility study for
Bagdhara suggests that by restricting the reservoir level to 1375 meters above sea
level (masl) no resettlement is needed for the dam, and the transmission line
would require resettlement of ten households. It would therefore seem possible
that by careful design and good management, uncertainties in planning related to
social impacts can be minimized.

20       It is well understood that the damage costs of diesel self-generators, located in
         densely populated urban areas, with uncontrolled emissions emitted at or near
         ground level, have damage costs per kg of pollutant, are 1-2 orders of magnitude
         greater than from modern utility scale generators fitted with high stacks, located
         in remote areas, and fitted with state-of-the-art pollution controls. (see for example
         Lvovsky et al, 1990). This would likely hold true for Afghanistan as well: any
         large coal generation project would be far away from the major urban population
         centres near the coal mine from which the coal is to be obtained. For details, see
         World Bank, Economic Analysis of Power Sector Projects: Guidance Note. Technical
         Annex B5, June 2015).

     53.      The costs of social and environmental management and mitigation plans,
     and of other related safeguards policies are readily monetized and included in the
     table of economic flows – though given the limited information at hand, such
     estimates are again subject to high uncertainty. Based on the information in Table
     2.2 the incremental costs in the case of hydropower projects may be taken as 3%.

     2.7       DIMENSIONS OF UNCERTAINTY IN DECISION MAKING IN AFGHANISTAN
     54.     A wide range of uncertainties, impact the extent to which different energy
     sector objectives can be achieved. It is the additional high degree of uncertainty
     that makes Afghanistan’s task that much more complex than that facing most
     countries that must balance economic efficiency, energy security and
     environmental sustainability, since the uncertainties may compromise the extent
     to which these objectives can be achieved or even traded off one with another.
     Uncertainties include the following: 21
          Import dependency: For the past 10 years, Afghanistan’s main source of new
           supply has been imports, to the point that 80% of the 2014 NEPS consumption
           came from its neighbors, exposing Afghanistan to the risks of supply
           disruption, and to supply contraction if the previously available surpluses
           decline due to increasing domestic needs of Afghanistan’s neighbors. Figure
           25, drawn from 2012, shows continued expectation of dependence on imports
           in the short term, based on investment plans for import lines. To date, these
           supplies have been relatively secure, but the extent to which this stability will
           persist is unclear.




     21        These issues are all discussed in more detail in the relevant case studies (Annexes
               2, 3, 4 and 5) and their summaries in Section 3.

   Geopolitical considerations: Afghanistan is faced with a challenging geo-
    political situation. Being land-locked, it is entirely dependent upon the
    goodwill of its neighbors for much of its energy supply, not just for electricity
    imports, but also for oil imports. The challenges in cooperation among the
    CAR countries is expected to continue to frustrate plans to implement the
    APSMP concept of the development of a TUTAP power market. In January
    2012, Iran closed its border with Afghanistan for oil trade, causing significant
    disruption. The evolution of bilateral relations with Pakistan and India are
    even more uncertain, given that the relationship between India and Pakistan
    is itself uncertain. If the lifting of sanctions on Iran improves the general
    geopolitical climate in the region, there may well be benefits to Afghanistan –
    though this too is subject to much uncertainty.
   Gas resource uncertainty: how much gas there may be in the Sheberghan
    fields is subject to great uncertainty: recent studies show that, based on
    current information, the variation between the high and low estimates of the
    maximum rate of resource extraction span an order of magnitude. The
    difficulty is that some decisions about the gas distribution infrastructure
    (capacity and routing of pipelines) must be made in the absence of good
    information about the ultimately available reserves, leading to high risks of
    both over- and under- capacity in gas transmission (and hence rendering the
    investments economically inefficient), and the location and size of gas-fired
    power plants.
   Coal resource uncertainty: Coal mining in Afghanistan has a long history,
    and there is extensive small-scale mining to supply local needs. But whether
    there is adequate resource to support a large, utility-scale coal-fired power
    project is uncertain: most of the resource information dates to the Soviet era,
    and both quantity and quality of the coal reserves are uncertain. A Chinese
    mining consortium investigated the coal resource with a view to building
    such a project to provide power to meet its own mining requirements and
    supply the rest to DABS: however, this reportedly ran into security-related
    difficulties, so it remains unclear what conclusions were drawn from that
    investigation, if any. It is understood that even if the mining concession

     survives, the willingness to include a large power station now seems quite
     unlikely, making the development of such a power plant dependent upon
     IPPs.
    TAPI: The gas supply uncertainty is further complicated by the possibility of
     the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline (TAPI), which
     might allow any Afghanistan share of gas to be used for a gas-fired power
     generation project in the Kandahar (SEPS) region, but also by the increasing
     possibility of a competing Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline becoming operational, as
     shown in in Figure 2.6
                        Figure 2.6:      Gas pipeline proposals




    Hydrological uncertainty: Much of the hydro-meteorological network was
     damaged or destroyed during the conflicts, and record-keeping at some
     existing hydro-meteorological stations has only recently improved. With the
     only reliable data going back to the 1980s, the extent to which precipitation
     and flow regimes have changed over the past decades remains unclear.
    Climate change uncertainty: Some of the major hydro projects are on the
     Kunar River, which rises in the Himalayas. The impacts of climate change on
     hydro projects have already begun to be observed in some other countries in
     the region (such as Nepal). Reliable methods of estimating the impacts of
     climate change on the inflow hydrology of hydropower projects are still under
     development.
    Hydropower project development uncertainty: The first two new hydropower
     projects recommended by the APSMP are on the Kunar River, which rises,
     and subsequently returns to Pakistan. Although the Government of Pakistan
     and the Government of Afghanistan signed in 2013 an agreement to jointly
     study the cascade development of this river basin: 22 the realization of such
     projects is subject to high uncertainty given the high sensitivity to riparian
     issues in the region, and the history of international water agreements (and
     disputes) in South Asia.
    Geological and geotechnical uncertainty: In the case of the Kunar
     hydropower projects, the 2009 feasibility study of Kunar A (Shal) did not
     conduct the necessary on-site geological and geotechnical investigations for
     security reasons. However, the proposed approach, namely that the EPC
     contractor would conduct detailed geological and geotechnical studies after

22       The Governments have requested the assistance of the World Bank to study the
         cascade development of the Kunar: preliminary technical work is now under way.


April 25, 2016                                                                            24
     project tendering, is highly unrealistic. International experience suggests that
     either no serious contractor would be willing to assume the risks for an ill-
     defined project based on incomplete data, or the bids would be inflated to
     cover the contractor’s geological risks, in either case, inevitably resulting in
     disputes. No International Financing Institution (IFI) would be likely to have
     any interest in financing such a project. In short, for a large hydropower
     project to be bankable requires that the FS include, among others, detailed
     geological and geotechnical investigations.
    Export potential to/from Pakistan: Pakistan presently has severe power
     shortages, particularly in summer – and this makes Pakistan an important
     potential buyer, particularly of surplus summer hydro. Development of the
     many hydropower projects on the Kunar River will depend on Pakistan’s
     willingness to take the substantial summer surplus power that these projects
     will produce. But Pakistan has its own large hydro projects under
     development (such as the 2,800 MW Tarbela extensions and the 4,300 MW
     Dasu project), and current policy reforms are expected to eventually lead to
     making more gas available for power generation, which may well alleviate the
     worst of the summer shortages.
    Regional Hydro surplus uncertainty: CASA 1000 would be the first major
     investment to enable regional electricity trade, with the goal of exporting the
     existing summer hydro surplus in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan (and
     to Afghanistan). Additional hydro projects are being discussed in these
     countries, which may prolong the time period during which a summer hydro
     surplus persists: but the timetable for such projects is highly uncertain. If
     there are no further projects in these countries, then there is an opportunity
     for Afghanistan to build its own hydro project which will also have summer
     surplus that could be exported over the CASA-1000 project.
    Energy trade uncertainty: Several energy trade proposals in the region are
     pending. How many and when these may be realized is not just a question of
     geopolitical feasibility, but sheer scale of investment and financing difficulties.
     Each may have a low probability of ultimate realization in any given year, but
     bring potentially very large economic benefits to Afghanistan if they were to
     proceed. A domestic railway system is also under discussion, whose
     realization would have significant impacts on petroleum product and coal
     trade.23 A further uncertainty is introduced in considering whether to trade
     electricity or fuels, the balance of which is dependent on relative costs of each;
     recent volatile fuel prices have served to underline this.
    Stranded asset risk and synchronization uncertainty: whether the
     Afghanistan power system can be synchronized with that of one or more of its
     neighbors depends not just on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with these
     neighbors, but also relations among these neighbors among themselves:
     restoration of Soviet-era synchronization of the Central Asian Republics may
     be decades distant. This has great consequences for transmission planning in
     Afghanistan, with potential risks of stranded assets (of back-to-back
     interconnections of asynchronous systems, as proposed by the APSMP) if
     resynchronization were to occur. In the short term, the question is whether
     and when Afghanistan’s domestic generators can be synchronized with one of
     the sources of imports (particularly Uzbekistan) which would avoid the
     tedious and inflexible operation of the NEPS as two or three separate systems.
     This has been discussed for some years, but the timing of any agreement is
     uncertain.

   IPP uncertainty: Several proposals are under consideration for developing
    power generation projects as IPPs including coal-fired power generation at
    large copper and iron ore mining concessions, and for the development of the
    Sheberghan gas generation project. The bankability of IPPs in Afghanistan in
    the short- to medium will depend on how major risks are managed, including
    creditworthiness of the buyer (DABS), the security situation, and general
    perceptions of country risk.
   Oil price uncertainty: The world oil price is the main determinant not just of
    other internationally traded fuels such as LNG in the Asia Pacific market
    where the price has historically been linked to the crude oil price (through the
    Japan Crude Cocktail, JCC), but more directly to the price of diesel for self-
    generation whose differential to the grid-electricity price drives much of the
    consumer demand. The economic benefit of renewable energy as a substitute
    for diesel self-generation is directly linked to this differential: at $100/bbl
    solar PV for off-grid application is economic, but not at $50/bbl. At the time
    of writing (March 2016), the oil price (Brent) stands at around $35/bbl and has
    recently dipped below $30/bbl (see Figure 2.7). The short-to-medium term
    outlook is highly uncertain: some analysts expect prices to be as low as
    $30/bbl for some time – on the other hand, escalation and spillover effects of
    the conflicts in Iraq, Yemen and Syria could also see a sharp increase in price.

   Gas price uncertainty: The extent to which Pakistan would be a potential
    buyer of gas-based power generation depends on its price. Is it cost effective
    to import CCGT gas-power from Turkmenistan, compared to CCGT in
    Pakistan using imported LNG? Both could exploit scale economies and build
    CCGTs at 800 MW scale (not possible in Afghanistan at Sheberghan) so the
    question becomes whether the price difference between the cost of imported
    LNG in Pakistan and the gas price in the CARs is large enough to pay for the
    HVDC transmission line from Turkmenistan to Pakistan, plus the Afghanistan
    transit fee? Whatever may be the result of such a calculation, it is certainly
    subject to high uncertainty since it depends on (1) the extent to which LNG
    prices in the Asia Pacific market will become decoupled from the oil price; (2)
    the level of LNG prices (spot prices have gone from $16/mmBTU to
    $7/mmBTU in the past year); and (3) China's willingness-to-pay for
    Turkmenistan gas and Gazprom pricing policy that largely determine gas

      prices in the CAR region (which have generally been much lower than LNG
      gas prices in the Asia Pacific region) – all of which are uncertain.

2.8       CONSEQUENCES OF UNCERTAINTIES FOR POWER PLANNING
55.    These uncertainties pose great difficulties for conventional power
planning. The difficulties that are well illustrated by reference to the APSMP,
which sets out the schedule of new generation projects shown in Table 2.1.
56.     Each project in the existing expansion plan is subject to uncertainty . This
capacity expansion plan was derived in the conventional way, starting with a
demand forecast, and alternative sources of supply then selected to meet that
demand under the criterion of least cost. While this is certainly a reasonable
approach in various contexts, the achievability of this plan in practice, given the
current circumstances in Afghanistan can be questioned. Every one of the projects
included in the capacity expansion plan in Table 2.31is subject to one or more of
the uncertainties noted above.        Despite all its strengths, APSMP is not
accompanied by a formal risk analysis that assesses the uncertainty in its key
assumptions or the relative riskiness of one plant’s realization compared with
another’s. The APSMP does acknowledge that “further study is required? for
many of the options it proposes. To be able to make the urgent decisions that are
required to be made now, Afghan decision makers may see value in adopting a
practical perspective for assessing implications of uncertainties on the efficiency
and realisms of the options facing them.
57.      Interdependence of projects adds to uncertainties. The treatment of the
NEPS/SEPS interconnection as generation expansion illustrates how the
interdependency of separate projects can also create uncertainty. Presently, the
SEPS power supply is based on diesel sets in Kandahar and hydro at the Kajaki
hydro project. APSMP argues that the potential for extension of hydropower in
SEPS is limited to the potential along the Helmand River, and generation from
imported diesel is not economically justifiable.         USAID is funding an
interconnection, some 490 km along the Kabul-Kandahar road: the construction of
the $814 million project began in 2012 and is now scheduled for completion in
2018.24 There are sound political reasons to connect the two systems, given that
the economic development of Helmand is seen as a high priority to promote
political stability. APSMP expected that the “major hydropower resources in the
Northeast of Afghanistan? would enable additional supply to be delivered to
SEPS through the NEPS/SEPS interconnection, but these are not likely to be
available until the mid-2020s. More recently, the expectation is that the additional
supplies available from expanded imports from Turkmenistan would be available
as additional supply. The viability of the NEPS/SEPS interconnection is
dependent on otherwise independent projects that are themselves subject to
uncertainties.
58.    A review of the capacity expansion plan reveals a range of practical
problems for implementation:
     Capital mobilization: to what extent does capital mobilization constrain both
      new domestic generation projects, and the long term development of the
      transmission grid? Under what circumstances can public sector financing be
      supplemented by private investment?
     Development of the domestic resources: there has been little progress on further
      exploration of the Sheberghan gas field. Without a confirmation of the
      additional resources, which necessarily means drilling, there can be little

     progress for a gas supply agreement, one of the essential prerequisites for
     mobilizing an IPP for implementation. The coal resource is even less
     confirmed (as discussed in detail in Annex 3).
    The readiness of the new hydro projects: In the 2014 Addendum to the APSMP,
     the Kunar B project is advanced to start construction in 2018. As noted above,
     given that work on a detailed FS has yet to commence, construction start
     before 2020 seems very unlikely: even if a FS and all its environmental studies
     could be completed in three years, it will take at least another year before
     financial closure can be reached, so 2020 appears to be the very earliest
     construction start. If financial closure depends on agreements with Pakistan
     on benefit sharing and a signed PPA for the export of the expected summer
     surplus, even 2020 may be optimistic.
59.      Uncertainties of timing cannot easily be dealt with by the use of
scenarios. This is illustrated by reference to the Addendum that was prepared in
2014. 25 The 2014 Addendum deals with various uncertainties by adding a large
set of additional scenarios, four of which involve no load shedding, and 17 of
which involve various degrees of load shedding and delays in project
implementation (Figure 2.8). In its “no load shedding? baseline, Sheberghan is
delayed to 2020, but Kunar B is accelerated to 2022 (from 2024) and Kunar A to
2023 (from 2026). This timing is questionable: with a five-year construction
period, construction would need to begin for Kunar A in 2017, and Kunar B in
2018. Given that neither project as yet has a bankable FS (which will take at least
two years), and that arranging for finance will take at least a year, it would appear
that this schedule cannot be achieved. Using scenarios as the basis for testing
robustness itself introduces further uncertainty.

25    Although the APSMP was completed in February 2014, an APSMP Addendum was
      issued in October 2014. This appears to have modified the TUTAP concept as
      originally designed by opting for using duplicate asynchronous supplies for domestic
      use from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan for the medium term, recognizing the role of
      the CASA 1000 project and pushing back further export links to Pakistan to the outer
      years of the plan.

60.      Nor can scenarios deal with resource uncertainties, international energy
prices, and synchronization options.        These demonstrate the limits of the
“predict-then-act? approach. The results of these 23 separate scenarios are
difficult to interpret precisely because every one of them is subject to a range of
uncertainties that are not considered. Conversely, if all the uncertainties were
included as separate scenarios, there would need to be several hundred and that
in turn would further confuse their interpretation. Moreover, at the end of such
an analytical process, what gets built ends up being driven by the availability of
funds and the priorities of the donors whose priorities are often set by the
imperatives of their lending and disbursement plans as much as by any specific
master plan. In short, completely new approaches are required as illustrated in
the case studies discussed in the next chapter and in the annexes.

3        CASE STUDIES
61.     This section summarizes the case studies, each dealing with specific
problems that require immediate attention by Government. Section 3.1 deals with
planning for hydro projects (with details in Annex 2); Section 3.2 with the
potential use of coal for power generation (details in Annex 3); Section 3.3 deals
with decisions about developing domestic gas resources (details in Annex 4); and
Section 3.4 describes how transmission planning decisions are hampered by
unresolved issues peculiar to Afghanistan being bordered by large asynchronous
power systems (details in Annex 5.

3.1      PLANNING FOR HYDRO PROJECTS
62.      Progress in planning for new hydropower projects has been slow .
Notwithstanding successive recommendations that new large hydropower
projects be built, progress toward implementation of these projects has been slow,
perhaps in part because the easiest way to expand supplies has been to increase
imports from neighboring countries. By way of example, the many hydro projects
in the Kunar River Basin have appeared in all of the various power sector Master
Plans, but assumptions made about the size and technical feasibility are subject to
very high uncertainty. In the APSMP Kunar B is recommended for development
before all other hydropower projects with an entry into service of 2024 based on
studies that cannot be considered to be complete treatments. On the other hand
the Bagdhara hydropower plant, which has a more comprehensive FS completed
in 2015 but which is expected to enter service in 2032.
63.       A key question is whether to proceed with a cascade development study
for Kunar. The funding decision for the $5-10 million required for the Kunar river
cascade development study and subsequent detailed feasibility studies is
especially relevant, because the latest study of the Kunar hydro projects
recommends that the riparian issues with Pakistan "be clarified before work on the
FS for cascade development is started? - which could be in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years
or indeed never. At the same time, it is pointed out that a FS without
confirmation of the geological and geotechnical conditions – which means drilling
at site – is likely to be of limited value, and hence not the best use of resources.
64.      The problem of how to proceed on hydro projects is a classic example of a
real option.26 The specific question to be asked here is whether one should
commission a FS for one of the Kunar River projects now, or delay and reconsider
one year later, given the present uncertainties about (1) whether and when
agreement can be reached with Pakistan on joint development of the Kunar river;
(2) the ultimate capital cost of the hydro project; (3) whether summer surplus
hydro of the project can in fact be exported either through the CASA-1000 project
which may have spare capacity depending on the rate of decline of the summer
surplus in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, or through a new transmission corridor
along the Kunar River; and (4) what would be the cost of energy from the next
best alternative (either imports or generation at a Sheberghan CCGT).
65.     The real options analysis is depicted in a decision tree. The details of its
structure and calculations are described in Annex 2 which presents the case study.
Important here is simply the idea that the problem is captured as a series of


26       A real option is the right, but not the obligation, to invest in a future project of
         unknown benefit at a known cost today. A real option implies at least two time
         steps: a decision to be made today – whether to take the option – followed by a
         decision to be made tomorrow – whether to make the investment. There are many
         good texts. T. Copeland and V. Antikarov, Real Options: A practitioner’s guide,
         Texere, New York, 2001 is one of them.


April 25, 2016                                                                                  30
decision nodes (that require actions – such as a funding decision for a FS, and
whether to abandon, delay or proceed with construction) and chance nodes (that
characterize the uncertainties faced). The options available at each decision node
are assessed on the basis of maximizing NPV (or minimizing the present value of
costs to meet a given level of demand). There is also the assumption that learning
takes place over time that will help inform the decision making.
66.      The case study concludes that the critical uncertainty in moving ahead
with the large candidate hydropower projects is the cost of domestic thermal
generation alternatives and of imported electricity. It is not the uncertainty of
assurances from the Government of Pakistan about its willingness to take summer
surplus power which in any event would be conditional on subsequent technical
feasibility. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) that was signed in November
2015 between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan indicates a cost of US¢ 5/kWh,
escalated at three percent per year. This is an excellent price for Afghanistan, and
provides the benchmark cost for domestic hydropower generation at least in the
short run, although the quantity of year round thermal power available at this
price may well not extend to additional imports.
67.       The Bagdhara FS indicates that a recalibration of the APSMP estimates is
needed. Bagdhara is the hydropower project with the most recent FS completed
to international standards in 2015. The FS recommends a plant size of 226.5 MW
with an estimated capital cost of $562 million ($2,481/kW), and average annual
generation of 857 GWh. The FS cautions that “depending on the security situation
there is an unpredictable risk of potential increase of cost and construction time.?
Uncertainty about previous capital cost estimates is thus high, and serves to
underline the need to recalibrate the APSMP estimates before making any further
decisions about hydropower development. The analysis shows that decision
makers have been better served by waiting for the results of the Bagdhara FS so
that its results can be used to recalibrate the APSMP estimates before making any
decisions about further hydropower development.

3.2      PLANNING FOR COAL FOR POWER GENERATION
68.     Notwithstanding several large coal-fired plants appearing in every recent
Master Plan, there remains high uncertainty about Afghanistan’s coal reserves .
Their quantity, quality, cost, and the timescale within which they may be available
for use are not well known. Unless a comprehensive exploration program is
started today, the large future benefits of coal-fired generation (as opposed to
imports of base load power) can never be realized, nor can the cost be fully
understood. The main question is the potential economic benefits of such an
exploration program; a subsidiary question is who should undertake such a
program.
69.       The case study presented in Annex 3 aims to establish whether the costs
of a near-term exploration program be justified by a demonstration of the future
economic benefits. To deal with the wide ranges of uncertainty that characterize
the extent of benefits, the technique of probabilistic scenario analysis is used to
evaluate the many layers of uncertainty and the different probabilities that may
apply at each level: an exploration program may be unsuccessful in finding any
coal at all (or insufficient even for a small 100 MW project) – or it may find enough
for several 1,000 MW – but with such benefits appearing only some 5-6 years after
the resource is proven because of the time required to develop a large mine and
build the power plant. Even if enough coal is found, whether it is economic to
exploit the resource depends on the cost of coal-based power generation relative
to the next best alternative for base load power, likely to be imports of gas fired
electricity from Turkmenistan or possibly gas delivered to Afghanistan by one of
the regional pipeline projects such as TAPI.


April 25, 2016                                                                          31
70.     The quantitative analysis requires two steps. First one evaluates the cost
of generation from coal (assuming enough were found) which is subject to
uncertainties in capital costs and the cost of fuel, and compares it with the cost of
imported base-load power, which is subject to the uncertainty of the PPA price
and the cost of incremental transmission connection. The results are summarized
in Table 3.1: the NPV of coal generation ranges from $309 to $463 million; that of
imports from $565 to $788 million. The nine entries in the bold face type represent
the net benefits under the different combinations of conditions for domestic coal
generation and imports. For example, for unfavorable (highest cost) coal and
favorable (lowest cost) imports the net benefit of coal is $565million minus
$463million=$102million.

                                                                   Imports

          (3) Coal cost $70/ton, capital cost 2240 $/ton


71.     With the potential future benefits of coal in hand, one then assesses these
benefits against the costs of the exploration program. The calculation has to take
into account that the costs of the exploration program are required today, whereas
the benefits will only be realized in the future: even if the exploration program is
successful there will be a time lag between the demonstration of the resource and
the earliest date that coal can be produced. In this analysis the following
assumptions are made:
      Funds for the Afghanistan Geological Survey (AGS) program committed: 2016
      AGS exploration program begins: 2017
      A potential resource identified: 2019
      Financial closure of the project: 2021
      Construction time: 3 years, hence commercial operation date (COD): 2024.
72.      The NPVs must now be brought back to a single base year . The benefits
shown in Table 3.2 are to the beginning of 2024, and must be brought back to the
NPV in 2016, at which point they can be compared to the outlay required in 2016
for the proposed AGS exploration program. It is also the case that the exploration
program has potentially many outcomes: there may be no coal at all (of sufficient
size for a 100 MW project) – but there may also be enough coal for 1,000 MW or
more.
73.     The calculations necessary to assess the NPV of the AGS exploration
program in the existing coal areas are shown in Table 3.2. In row [1] appears the
estimated costs of the program: these costs are (relatively) certain. Rows [3] to [8]
assign a probability distribution for the prospects of various levels of coal resource
being discovered. Row [3] shows that the probability that the exploration
program is wholly unsuccessful is 5% - it contributes nothing to the expected
NPV. Row [4] shows the probability of finding just enough coal for a single 100
MW project as 25%: but its benefits realized only in 2024 – which under the most
pessimistic circumstances yields a net benefit of just $102 million (in 2024).27

            74.      The chance of finding enough coal for 400 MW is 50 percent. It is assumed
            that the first project would still be 100MW, but that two years thereafter a 300MW
            project is built (recognizing the difficulties of financing large projects). Therefore
            the net benefit will be 3 x 102=$305 million (another conservative assumption
            since scale economies would reduce the capital costs per kW assumed in the
            calculations for Table 3.2). This calculation is repeated for the other exploration
            outcomes, from which the total expected NPV, including the upfront costs of the
            AGS program, is $112 million. Under less pessimistic assumptions (say expected
            value for both coal imports and coal generation costs, the $292 million entry in
            Table 3.2), the NPV of the AGS exploration program is $365 million.
            75.      The robustness of the AGS program NPV can be tested by calculation of
            the switching value for the probability of no coal being found . This calculates to
            83% for the most unfavorable benefit of coal generation (i.e. under a favorable cost
            of future imports and unfavorable costs of the coal project). In other words, the
            probability of finding only enough coal for 100 MW project would have to be 17%
            or less for the exploration program to have negative returns. In light of what is
            already known about the current extent of coal mining in Afghanistan, this is
            considered highly unlikely. Annex 3 also presents similar calculations for a
            second stage of the exploration program, which should convert the deep coal
            resource of the North Afghan platform: for this second stage, the NPV under the
            most pessimistic circumstances is $249 million.
            76.     Having first decided on the primary question of whether to proceed with
            an exploration program, the choice of who should undertake it is simple . Either
            the private sector explores for and develops the resources it needs, or the public
            sector funds the exploration and then either develops the resource itself, or
            auctions the proven resource to tender. The case study shows that the current
            Mining Law is seen as so unfavorable by junior mining exploration companies
            that there is limited confidence that such companies would be able to secure
            financing from international investors to pursue projects in Afghanistan.
            Similarly there are likely to be significant challenges associated with options
            involving the bundling of mineral exploration and power generation projects in
            concessions to be given to a foreign minerals mining consortium, given the
            implementation challenges experienced in the copper mining concession in
            Afghanistan. It follows that the only realistic option currently open to the Afghan
            Government is to finance the exploration work itself.




            April 25, 2016                                                                                              33
77.     The case study shows that the potential benefits of this magnitude
warrant immediate implementation of the proposed AGS program. It also finds
that even if the AGS program proved to be 2-3 times more expensive than
estimated, the economic benefits to Afghanistan remain very high indeed.

PLANNING DOMESTIC THERMAL GENERATION USING GAS
78.     Thermal generation in the Afghan power system is needed to meet the
winter peak. System peak demand occurs during the winter months, when hydro
flows are at their lowest. Thermal power plant are also not prone to variations in
output due to variations in hydrology and are thus well-positioned to support
Afghanistan’s growing demand. Hence both coal and gas generation feature
prominently in the APSMP scenarios. A gas CCGT at Sheberghan appears at 400
MW scale in most of the APSMP Addendum scenarios with commercial
operations date (COD) of 2020, and coal generation appears in the original
APSMP at 400 MW at Aynak, and another 800 MW at Haji Gak 28, both at
$1,700/kW (albeit with the qualification that “It is unknown if the necessary coal
reserves exist in Afghanistan?). In the APSMP Adde ndum there appears just a
single 400 MW coal project at Bamyan.
79.     Exploitation of the gas reserves has attracted most attention. In addition
to studies on gas use for generation, uses other than for power generation have
been examined, including exports, and a gas pipeline to Kabul where gas would
displace diesel fuel. While a gas project at Sheberghan has been considered for
many years, decisions have been delayed as a result of continuing uncertainty
over the actual size of the resource, the appropriate technology to be applied if gas
were to be used on a large scale for electricity generation, and the ability to
finance a project as an IPP. Most recently there has been a proposal for a 50MW
gas engine IPP project in Mazar, to be supplied by the newly refurbished gas
pipeline from the Sheberghan gas field.
80.      The Mazar IPP has been much delayed, mainly due to the slow progress
of well rehabilitation and new exploration, and the completion of a new gas
pipeline to Mazar-e-Sharif. The case study in Annex 4 describes how the high
uncertainty surrounding the comparison of the development of gas-fired
generation versus imported electricity can be clarified using the techniques of
Robust Decision-making, in which one does not attempt to specify the probability of
uncertain future events, but uses statistical techniques to examine patterns and
factors of vulnerability of particular choices in a wide range of futures.

The Basic Question: Gas Generation v. Imports
81.    High costs of generation investment in Afghanistan. In the absence of
energy security constraints and geopolitical considerations, the question of
whether Afghanistan should use its gas resources for power generation are easily
answered. A gas-fired power project in Afghanistan will have higher costs
because of:
    Scale economies – even a relatively large 200-400 MW CCGT in Sheberghan
     will have higher investment costs per kW than an 850 MW scale project in
     Turkmenistan. The smaller project will also have a lower heat rate.
    Security related construction premia – as noted, costs for the Sheberghan
     project are estimated to be 60% higher than international levels.
    Gas quality – the gas in Sheberghan is sour, and of lower quality than in
     Turkmenistan, which will incur an additional cost for gas treatment.



28       APSMP, Table 6.1.2-5.


April 25, 2016                                                                          34
   Gas field development costs – Gas field development will be more costly than
    in the CARs: One study estimates a premium of 60% just to account for the
    more mountainous terrain (rather than flat, smooth steppe), the lack of supply
    equipment and materials, and the inability to provide much of the necessary
    specialized personnel. Moreover, this premium does not account for any de-
    mining or security expenses which might be necessary for an upstream project
    in Afghanistan.
82.      Offsetting avoided transmission costs. On the other hand, a project in
Afghanistan will have lower costs because the distance from the generation point
in Turkmenistan to Sheberghan is several 100 km. This involves transmission
losses, and the cost of the transmission line itself which are avoided if the power
plant is built at Sheberghan.
83.     An important question concerns how the resource rent would be shared
between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. Imports of gas-based electricity will be
based on the market price of gas in Turkmenistan (set largely by China’s
willingness to pay), not on the actual production cost of gas (say as defined by the
long run marginal cost (LRMC) of gas extraction). If the market price of gas is, say
$8/mmBTU, but the LRMC is only $1/mmBTU, then the resource rent that
accrues to the Government of Turkmenistan (or to the production entity involved)
is $7/mmBTU. So even if the LRMC in Afghanistan is triple that of Turkmenistan,
generation in Afghanistan brings a resource rent of $5/mmBTU. Of course, that
rent would also be available if the gas were used to supply Kabul to displace
diesel oil and petroleum-based LPG: while that would entail a significant
additional gas transmission cost, the value of gas is highest where it displaces oil.
The low LRMCs in the CARs are a result of the large size of their gas fields and
production volumes: these are not achievable in Afghanistan even under the most
optimistic scenario of gas resources. At the same time, this explains the interest of
Turkmenistan of selling gas-based electricity to Afghanistan: it thereby locks in for
the long term a significant resource rent.
84.      Any comparison of the costs of domestic gas generation against imports
there are numerous assumptions, upon which depends the choice of one option
over the other. Conventional techniques of sensitivity analysis have limited
power when many input assumptions may vary simultaneously. It is easy to
show the sensitivity of the result to, say, capital costs of gas engines, or to a
specific size of the gas resource – but when all the main variables are uncertain
this gets difficult. Monte Carlo simulation – a much used tool of risk assessment –
is a partial answer: here a probability distribution is assigned to each variable, and
the economic analysis calculated several hundred (or thousand) times, at each
iteration using input values drawn from these distributions – and then presenting
the result as a probability distribution of the present value of the comparison (see
Annex X for examples). But the main difficulty here is that defining probability
distributions for some of the variables may be very difficult – defining a
probability distribution for, say, the future CAR market price for gas is almost
impossible (as well illustrated by the 2014-2015 collapse of international energy
prices).

Testing Robustness of the Gas Investment Decision
85.      Avoiding decisions based on “predict-then-act?. The essential question
for “predict then act? decisions is how to make the best estimate of the future, and
then chose the option of least cost. A better approach is to ask – “given the
difficulties of predicting the future, which option is more robust to these
uncertainties?? This implies looking at the performance of each option in all
plausible futures (which may well run into the tens of thousands, each reflecting

different combinations of individual input assumptions), and then examining the
vulnerability of a particular option to identified risks. The trick is to do this
without necessarily needing to say anything about the probability of an input
assumption being at a particular value. Table 3.1 shows the plausible ranges of
uncertainty set for the analysis of the gas generation decision.

86.       Figure 3.1 shows a plot of a 1,000 plausible futures. The dark (blue) dots
are the combination of gas price ($/mmBTU) and import price (US¢/kWh) for
which imports are the preferred option; the light (green) circles represent those for
which the gas generation is the preferred option. The robustness of the decision
(i.e. the proportion of cases in which the right decision is made) in quadrant II is
very high: if the import price is greater than 6S¢/kWh, and the gas price less than
$6/mmBTU, then whatever the combination of all other uncertainties (security
outages for gas supply and transmission corridors, capital cost escalations, world
oil prices, capacity utilization, demand uncertainty, heat rate), there is a 97%
chance of Sheberghan power generation being the correct decision. The “Z(j)?
shown in this figure is the percentage of cases in each quadrant ( j) in which
Sheberghan gas is the preferred option. The points marked A, B and C reflects the
judgment of individuals as to what are the “most likely? set of future conditions

87.     The results of Figure 3.1 suggest that if indeed import prices were above
6USc/kWh, a decision to proceed with Sheberghan gas would be low risk . At the
time this analysis was developed in early 2015, there was still considerable
uncertainty about the price of imports from Turkmenistan, since the PPA was still
under negotiation – and the negotiations for renewal of the Uzbekistan PPA were
expected at 8-8.5 US¢/kWh. Moreover, there remains continuing uncertainty
about the production cost of Sheberghan gas –the only way of resolving that
uncertainty is to proceed with the necessary further gas field development: the
Gas Master plan for Afghanistan has yet to be completed – which should provide
guidance on what the gas production costs will likely be, and whether that gas
should be used to displace diesel use in Kabul or for power generation. If the
delivered gas price is below $6/mmBTU, then there is a very low probability of a
negative rate of return. LRMC estimates of the gas cost (see Annex 4 Table A4-5)
suggest costs of around $3/mmBTU, so there remains a margin of error of 100%
before the $6/mmBTU threshold is breached.
88.      In early November 2015 the long awaited PPA between DABS and the
Turkmenenergo of Turkmenistan was signed at a price of 5 US¢/kWh . The PPA
covers imports of electricity from Turkmenistan from January 1, 2018 to December
31, 2027. The price of 5 US¢/kWh is for 2015, rising by 3% per year (so
7.13USc/kWh in 2027), with agreed volumes of 899 GWh in 2018, increasing to
1,516 GWh in 2027. By comparison, the estimated energy from the Bagdhara
hydro project is 968 GWh, and total energy imports in 2014 were 3,814 GWh (of
which 1,426 GWh were from Uzbekistan and 1,103 GWh from Tajikistan). A
50MW gas engine project at Sheberghan would produce 300 GWh at a 0.7 load
factor, representing only a small fraction of imports.
89.     This is a low price that is clearly to Afghanistan’s advantage . At first
glance makes the development of the gas engine project at Sheberghan less
pressing. However, the probability that a Sheberghan gas project would deliver
negative economic returns is small. The International Finance Corporation (IFC)
of the World Bank Group is considering supporting a 50 MW gas engine project in
Mazar-e Sharif. This analysis concludes that the proposed project should be still
be supported, since it is of reasonable scale, and gas engines are the most robust
technology given the likely operating environment. Moreover, if this relatively
modest sized project cannot be done as an IPP, then the prospects for other IPP
development (including hydro projects) would be even less likely to attract
private sector interest. Efforts to confirm the size and cost of the gas resource also
remains a policy priority even with the next tranche of imports becoming
available at low cost.

3.4      TRANSMISSION PLANNING
90.     The case study in Annex 5 discusses the main issues in transmission
system development. The analysis finds that a grid/ distribution code is urgently
needed in Afghanistan to address issues in connecting the mostly renewables-
based mini-grids. It also underlines the difficulties in operation of the system
stemming from Uzbekistan’s resistance to Afghanistan synchronizing its own
generation projects to the Uzbek grid, resulting in the segregation of the Kabul
supply network, with one part connected to the Uzbek grid, one part to the Tajik
system when it is operating and a third to DABS’s own system.
91.     Major transmission investment decisions have recently been taken on the
basis of recommendations in the APSMP and are currently being implemented.
During the next few years, and as conditions are expected to change in the region,
MEW and DABS have the opportunity to revisit the priorities for investing in
further development of the transmission network on the same basis. The review

process will need to take into account alternative ways of further supporting
power transit operations without limiting the ability to meet the competing
financial needs for supporting the country’s rural electrification program and
developing domestic generation resources.
92.       This could be an appropriate subject for a real options analysis of transit
strategies. The analysis would be based on assumptions and decision criteria that
take into account (i) the risk of building 500kV lines that are underutilized because
potential transit opportunities fail to materialize; (ii) the options for making a
return on investment from 500kV HVAC wheeling or HVDC line availability fees,
or both; (iii) the additional investment required to guarantee an acceptable level of
reliability and security for the importer or exporter of power; (iv) the future use of
dedicated transit facilities at the end of the life of the PPA. Clearly there is less
cost and operational risk to Afghanistan if a dedicated HVDC line is built by its
proponents and used for transit operations even though there may be a perceived
lack of sovereignty in enabling a commercial operation to operate independently.
93.      A key recommendation of this study is to develop a national Grid Code
before 2020. It will be needed when the new transmission projects are expected to
be commissioned, primarily to facilitate negotiations with Afghanistan’s
neighbors but also to determine the incremental investments needed to upgrade
substations and generation control systems to meet security and reliability
standards for the transmission network. The review process necessary to
formulate the essential features of a Grid Code must include a strategy for
synchronization between Afghanistan and its neighbors to facilitate the more
efficient use of domestic generation. This may include a requirement for new
investments in back-to-back HVDC interconnections or Variable Frequency
Transformer (VFT) facilities, which can transmit electricity between two
asynchronous (or synchronous) AC frequency domains.
94.      Any future master plan will need to establish rules for transmission and
generation diversity planning. They are needed to minimize the potential for
widespread disruptions and facilitate the development of new hydropower and
coal-fired generation that may be associated with large mining operations. There
will also need to be a policy clarifying how Afghanistan proposes to integrate its
domestic transmission development (which may be built to achieve a lower
standard of reliability compared with those involved in imports, exports or transit
flows) with any new power transit proposals that have their own special
requirements for security and commercial viability.
95.     A strategy for optimizing the development and eventual interconnection
of the large number of small, isolated grids is required. They should be made
ready to connect and disconnect from the grid operating in both grid-connected or
island mode. There needs to be greater consumer engagement to solve power
issues locally by enabling the penetration of local renewables to supply
residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In this way, distribution can
become a transmission system resource, with all its components as part of a
cohesive system. This will require high dependency on standardization (physical
and data) as could also be established in the Grid Code.

4        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1      DECISION-MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY
96.      The Afghanistan power sector faces unusually high levels of uncertainty,
as discussed in the preceding sections. Nevertheless there are a range of relatively
simple analytical tools – whose applications are illustrated in this report – that are
available to inform decisions in such circumstances. These have long been used in
the private sector and can give confidence to the decision-maker by providing
useful information about the robustness of the decision to uncertain futures.

4.2      THE LIMITS OF “PREDICT-THEN-ACT? PLANNING
97.      The Addendum to the APSMP pushes to the limit the traditional
“predict-then-act? approach. In response to criticisms that the original APSMP
paid insufficient attention to many uncertainties, 23 alternative scenarios are
presented. But simply rearranging the same building blocks – large hydropower
plants, large new coal, large new blocks of imports and large CCGTs, modified by
assumptions about international fuel prices, capital costs and Afghanistan-specific
cost premia, and discount rates does not aid the decision-maker. It may even
increase uncertainty by presenting a greater number of options from which to
choose.
98.      Project size and technology cannot be chosen independent of country
circumstances. Undoubtedly it is true that large projects offer scale economies
over smaller projects, but if such projects stretch implementation or financing
capacity beyond their limits, their inclusion in any of the scenarios is not going to
be very useful for the decision maker. The same applies to the technology
variants considered: undoubtedly it is true that CCGT offers higher efficiencies
over open cycle combustion turbines or gas engines, and hence the lowest cost per
kWh. But CCGT plants are highly complex, require significant water supplies and
present substantial challenges compared with gas engines and open cycle
machines, which can be much more easily installed, operated and secured, and for
which the Afghanistan construction cost premium will be lower than CCGTs. Gas
engine generating capacity can be built in small increments that can be much
more easily financed: their cost per kWh may well be higher than that of a CCGT,
but if CCGTs cannot in reality be financed, again, their inclusion in scenarios for
the short- to medium term will be of limited value to the decision maker and in
fact could be a distraction.

4.3 ENERGY RATHER THAN POWER SECTOR PLANNING
99.      The analysis demonstrates the importance of energy sector planning .
Both coal and natural gas have uses other than power generation, and economic
theory holds that resources should be used where the highest value can be
extracted from them. Power sector planning exercises (including the APSMP)
seek to address investment planning by careful quantitative analysis and
economic reasoning. But “national energy plans? risk being statements of
aspirational goals, with little quantitative analysis to support them. One cannot
meaningfully plan the optimal utilization of national resources without credible
resource assessment: the presence of large coal projects in a power sector master
plan does not therefore make much sense in the absence of a verified resource.
100.    Should the gas resources prove to be at the upper end of the resource
estimates, then the highest value use of the gas is to replace diesel. To be sure,
there are security implications of a long pipeline from Sheberghan to Kabul. For
example in Pakistan, gas pipelines are regular targets of terrorist attacks, but as
equally well shown by Pakistan’s experie nce, gas pipelines can be repaired


April 25, 2016                                                                           39
relatively quickly. The value added from replacing diesel imports appears to be
worth the risk and difficulty of operating a gas pipeline.
101.    The report recommends that MEW initiates a broader national energy
plan that looks at alternative energy futures to the same level of detail . Based on
economic reasoning, as in the APSMP, the main focus of such an exercise should
be to assess the best utilization of the national fossil and water resources. Indeed,
the use of gas to replace diesel in Kabul would also bring significant
environmental and public health benefits. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
Resources is currently preparing a Gas Master Plan financed by ADB with
consultant support, but for it to bring real value added it must be closely
coordinated with MEW’s plans.
102.     When combined with the difficulties of mobilizing finance for thermal or
hydro generation projects, Afghanistan’s energy security concerns limit the
freedom of choice for development of the power sector. In the short term there
really is no other choice but to negotiate large-scale electricity imports from CAR
neighbors, combined with upgrading and rehabilitating existing hydro projects,
and increased efforts to develop renewable energy in the rural areas. It is
recognized that this has political and security implications for the authorities, and
underlines the importance of setting up a functional and high-quality planning
system that is an essential precursor to moving away from the current state of
affairs.

4.4      HYDROPOWER PLANNING
103.     The risks identified in the FS for Bagdhara would not appear to change
the conclusion that the magnitude of the investment required prevents its early
implementation. The probabilities noted in the decision-trees of Annex 2, suggest
that this or any other large hydro project is simply too risky. Given the high
uncertainties of the security situation, the emphasis for developing Afghanistan’s
domestic resources should continue to be in smaller projects commensurate with
the risk appetite of potential investors.
104.     For other hydropower projects, the range of uncertainty about earlier
capital cost estimates remains high. The Bagdhara FS results could be used to
recalibrate the APSMP estimates of Table 2.3 before making any further decisions
about new hydropower development. Without confirmed technical feasibility, the
likelihood of finding a reputable international EPC contractor or a PPA being
bankable are remote. The prospects for hydropower development most of whose
output is provided in summer using a PPP approach are further diminished for a
PPA of this magnitude with DABS, because revenues will be relatively low.

4.5      COAL FOR POWER GENERATION
107.     The results of the analysis demonstrate that the expected value of future
benefits far outweigh the upfront costs of any coal exploration program. The use
of coal or coal-bed methane for power generation are attractive options for
Afghanistan, but the resources must be found and developed. A coal exploration
program has high potential rewards. Under the pessimistic outcomes for the cost
of coal generating projects relative to imports, the expected NPV for an
exploration program in the known areas of coal resources, is $112 million; under
expected conditions of coal generating costs and imports, the NPV is $369 million.
If extended to the presently unexplored areas of the deep coal north Afghan
Plateau, the NPV rises by $762 million.
108.    Potential benefits of this magnitude warrant immediate implementation
of an exploration program. The analysis suggests that a publicly-financed coal
exploration program conducted by AGS is the most attractive in the short term,


April 25, 2016                                                                          40
given that the legal and regulatory conditions are not attractive to private sector
mining exploration companies. It also follows from the analysis that even if the
AGS program proved to be 2-3 times more expensive than estimated, the benefits
remain very high indeed. Nor would adding the potential GHG damage costs,
which cannot be estimated until the quantity and quality of the coal resource be
likely to render the exploration program substantially less attractive. The analysis
presented also demonstrates the value of a step by step planning process, in which
the option of using coal for power generation is assessed in the framework of an
implementation plan, assessing the uncertainties at each step. This is likely to be
far more helpful in the long run than running large capacity expansion
optimization models.

4.5      GAS POWER GENERATION PLANNING
105.      Domestic generation costs are likely to be higher than their equivalent
imports. Imports of electricity that is produced using gas-fired generation are
likely to benefit from scale economies, lower construction costs because of
avoided security costs, and lower cost gas. These lower costs of imported
electricity based on gas-fired generation are unlikely to be offset by the lower cost
of domestic gas fired generation within Afghanistan. In the short to medium
term, Afghanistan is likely to remain a significant importer of gas-fired electricity.
The tariff for imports from Turkmenistan, due to start in January 2018, is 5
US¢/kWh and the initial agreed volume of 899 GWh/year is significant and
similar to the level of imports from Uzbekistan (1,426 GWh in 2014) and Tajikistan
(1,103 GWh in 2014).
106.    Notwithstanding the low price of power imports, development of
domestic gas generation capacity is economic. Despite this, a power generation
project relying on domestic gas from Sheberghan remains attractive, and the
probability that it will deliver negative economic returns is small. This report
concludes that the proposed 50 MW gas engine plant at Mazar-e-Sharif should be
supported as an IPP, and recommends against attempts to scale up the project or
use more sophisticated CCGT technology in this first step. The plant would
produce around 300 GWh/year and would thus be only a small fraction of
imports.

TRANSMISSION PLANNING STRATEGIES
107.     The main factors complicating decisions about system development are
the high uncertainty about the location of new domestic power projects,
synchronization among neighboring power grids, and the lack of a grid or
distribution code. Hence the report recommends that before 2020 when new
transmission projects are expected to be commissioned, there is a need to develop
a national Grid Code. The planning process must include a strategy for
synchronization between Afghanistan and its neighbors to facilitate the more
efficient use of domestic generation. The requirement for new investments in
HVDC b/b or VFT facilities to provide interconnections was identified in the
APSMP; a strategy could refine this program to reduce the investment required
and the risk of creating stranded assets. In addition, before future master plans
are prepared, MEW and DABS will need to establish rules for transmission and
generation diversity. Last, a strategy for optimizing the development and
eventual interconnection of the large number of small grids is required.

ANNEX 1:         METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
________________________________________________________________________
A1-1. This annex discusses methodologies, and how one deals with the often conflicting
criteria of economic least cost, environmental sustainability and energy security. Energy
security is the most difficult of these three, because it encompasses so many different
concepts, and therefore commands most of the attention here.

A1. 1    ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY
A1-2. Economic efficiency has three main dimensions: producing goods at the lowest cost
is only one of them:
   Productive efficiency: Electricity or a fossil fuel should be produced at least economic cost.
    If prices are too high on account of monopolistic behavior or price collusion, even
    inefficient firms can continue to make money and stay in business. Productive efficiency
    can be promoted through competition, open access, and price regulation.
   Allocative efficiency: Prices should reflect underlying economic costs so that electricity (or
    a fossil fuel) is allocated to its highest value use. If prices are too low, consumers may
    consume more for non-essential purposes, or waste energy purchased for essential
    purposes. If shortages arise because prices are too low, then some of those willing to
    pay a high price may be unable to obtain any, while some of those who do not value the
    resource highly may waste it.
   Dynamic efficiency: Firms should introduce innovation and improvement in the market
    as new technologies become available.
A1-3. Allocative efficiency for electricity, gas and coal in Afghanistan is poor. The retail
gas price is around $14 per thousand cubic meter (MCM), far below market prices in central
Asia of around $200/MCM. Retail electricity prices have increased of late, but are still
generally below the economic (and financial) cost of supply. Productive efficiency is also
poor: while there are no reliable data on transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, the
general consensus is that there is considerable scope for improvement. Several hydro
generating plants are in urgent need of rehabilitation.
A1-4. In World Bank practice, power system planning is generally conducted at economic
prices – so capacity expansion planning models are run with domestically produced fossil
fuels priced at import parity prices, and to the exclusion of transfer payments (taxes, import
duties, VAT). But that is not universally true: often these models are run by utilities using
their financial prices which may include significant taxes and subsidies. The APSMP is
based on economic costs, though there is little discussion about fossil fuel prices, and how
gas prices in CARs or Pakistan might be affected by changes in international oil and LNG
markets. Pakistan’s willingness-to-pay for surplus summer hydro (whether from the CARs
via CASA-1000, or from possible exports of Afghanistan’s’ future large hydro) is very much
a question of the cost gas-fired CCGT in Afghanistan – which sets the upper bound for
peaking hydro prices.
A1-5. Nevertheless, the measurement and quantification of the economic efficiency
objective poses relatively few problems: the methodology of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is
long established, and its application to power sector planning and investment problems is
relatively straightforward.

The Discount Rate
A1-6. The main issue to be resolved is the choice of the discount rate: just how to define
the Government’s economic opportunity cost of capital given Afghanistan’s unique fiscal
and economic circumstances? All IFI energy sector infrastructure activities in Afghanistan
over the past years have been in the form of grants. But although the actual financial cost of
capital is zero, this does not mean capital is unconstrained: in practice, the supply of capital
from the donors and IFIs is a function of their (limited) willingness to mobilize grant funds.


April 25, 2016                                                                             45
Funding of T&D appears to be possible without much controversy, but funding for
generation projects will be much more difficult. Afghanistan is already eligible for IDA
financing, but only as grants – it will get around $400 million in IDA-17 (FY15-18).
A1-7. The choice of discount rate is one of the critical assumptions for CBA. In the past
few years there has been increasing discussion within the World Bank about the extent to
which the normal discount rate used in the past (10-12%) is still an appropriate measure
given that the cost of capital has greatly fallen. For example, for the Concentrated Solar
Power (CSP) project in Morocco, a 5% (real) discount rate was used, on grounds that the
actual economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK), as reflected in the latest Government
Euro and US$ bond issues was 7% (nominal). 29 It is widely argued that high discount rates
discriminate against projects whose benefits arise mainly in the long term (and so
discriminate against investments directed at long-term climate change). But that is true even
when projects of relatively short life are considered. Others argue that the EOCK is in any
event not the appropriate measure of the social discount rate, and argue for application of
the (so-called) Ramsey Formula which links the discount rate to long term consumption
growth based on the social rate of time preference (SRTP), which generally yields discount
rates in the 2-8% range.30
A1-8. As an illustration of the practical importance of the choice of discount rate, consider
the problem now faced by Afghanistan: should the country continue to rely mainly on
imported electricity from its CAR neighbors, or should it build its own CCGT based on
Sheberghan gas, or develop its own smaller scale renewable energy projects. The
comparison is made on the basis of a 300 MW of additional load imported at an annual load
factor of 0.7. Comparing like with like means that to produce the same amount of energy as
the gas and import options, with a 35% annual capacity factor one must build 600 MW of
wind.31
A1-9. The NPV calculations at the traditional 10% discount rate are shown in Table A1-1:
the results show that the NPV of the cost of imports is $998 million, as against $1,013 million
for gas and $1,235 million for renewable energy. Imports are least cost (though not by
much).

A1-10. But change the discount rate and the conclusions also change. Figure A1-1 shows
the NPV for each option as a function of the discount rate. Imports are only the least cost
option for discount rates above 9%; from 4 to 9% the indicated choice is gas, and below 4%
the indicated choice is renewable energy. In short, lower the discount rate, the more
attractive is the renewable energy option.

A1. 2          ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
A1-11. These comparisons do not take into account the negative externalities of fossil based
generation. In most countries, the objective of environmental sustainability in power sector
development is dominated by the need to address two main sets of externalities: at the
global level the avoidance of GHG emissions; and at the local level the impacts of local air
and water emissions on environmental quality and human health, particularly those arising
through the emission of particulates (this report mainly refers to particulates of ten microns
or less, or PM10), oxides of sulfur (SOx) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).
A1-12. The conventional (classical) view of natural resource economics is that the best way
to achieve environmentally sensitive decision-making is to ensure that environmental
externalities are valued in economic terms, and included in the table of economic flows,
rather than lowering discount rates. 32 The main concern, of this analysis is therefore to
ensure the full costs of environmental externalities are incorporated into the analysis to
allow proper comparison of options.

GHG Emissions
A1-13. Imports are based on gas generation in the CARs, and therefore also generate GHG
emissions. How do the results change if these externalities are taken into account? The
recent Bank guidance on valuation of carbon is an important step in this direction: these
guidelines suggest the values shown in Table A1-2.

A1-14. In Table A1-3, the analysis adds (in the case of imports in rows [9]-14]) a calculation
of the GHG emission damage costs using the baseline values in Table A1-2.33 Now at the
10% discount rate, the cost of the renewable energy option ($1,235m) is only marginally
above the import option ($1,126), and below the gas option ($1,246m). Indeed, at all
discount rates below 10% renewable energy is least cost when the GHG emission damage
costs are taken into account.

32             Section 14.5 of Pearce & Turner (1990) discusses alternatives to reducing discount rates to
               reflect environmental concerns. Markandya & Pearce (199 1) make the same point (“the
               effects of carbon emissions should therefore be captured in the social cost of carbon, not in
               the discount rate?).

A1-15. Figure A1-2 shows the same comparison as Figure A1-1, but now with NPVs
calculated to reflect the GHG emission damage costs. One observes that the renewable
energy option is least cost for all discount rates less than 11%; above 11% the least cost
option is imports.

that Afghanistan should make urgent power sector decisions based on the avoidance of
GHG emission damage costs. Indeed, these simple calculations are made much more
difficult when the various uncertainties in assumptions are taken into account. However,

A1-17. The avoidance of GHG emissions commands little primacy for Government
policymakers (or indeed of the global community) in making policy choices: Afghanistan’s
GHG emissions are among the lowest in the world, both in absolute and in per capita terms
(Table A1-4). Afghanistan ranks at the bottom of the list with emissions less than 0.1
tons/capita, together with four of the poorest African countries. 34 It can be stated with
confidence that Afghanistan’s GHG emissions will remain negligible, even if by 2030
several thousand MW of coal base load capacity were in operation.

A1-18. The overriding priority of the international community for Afghanistan is poverty
alleviation, social stability and justice, and continued economic development following the
departure of NATO Forces. In any event, quantifying the GHG emissions of alternative
power sector options is straightforward (and described in the 2015 Guidelines for carbon
accounting). It is also likely that the strict guidelines that apply to the World Bank’s
financing of coal projects could almost certainly be met, given the need for thermal power to
improve energy security, reduce power shortages, and increased access. The main
consideration would turn on whether gas is available in sufficient quantity as a viable
alternative to coal.
A1-19. The World Bank has now also issued guidelines for the valuation of carbon
emissions, so calculation of economic returns with and without inclusion of carbon
emissions is also straightforward.35 If the baseline carbon values ($30/ton CO 2 in 2015,
increasing to $50/ton by 2030) were applied to the valuation of coal and its alternatives – it
would add 2.7 US¢/kWh to a coal project, but only 1 US¢/kWh to a gas CCGT.
Local Air Quality
A1-20. Kabul is one of the world’s most polluted cities, with recorded levels of ambient air
pollutants greater than Beijing and Lahore. Located at a high altitude, ringed by mountains,
and subject to frequent inversions, concentrations of PM2.5, SOx and NOx are multiples of
generally accepted safe levels (Table A1-5). According to the Ministry of Health, some 3,000
deaths per year in Kabul are attributable to the toxic air quality conditions: in a sample of
200 hospital patients, 80% had elevated levels of lead (indicative of leaded gasoline).
Indeed, so serious are the perceptions of poor air quality that the US Defense Department

A1-21. The direct contributions of DABS thermal generation to these air quality levels is
minimal, since the Tarakhil diesel is used infrequently. Major sources of pollution include
motor vehicles (many of which are old, and poorly maintained), brick kilns, and open
burning of tires and waste material. Coal of unknown and probably variable quality is
widely used as a residential fuel, including in small district heating systems for new
residential developments.
A1-22. As grid power delivered to Kabul has increased in recent years, the use of diesel
self-generation will have declined (other things equal) but with renewed economic and
industrial growth, power shortages remain widespread, and estimates of the current self-
generation capacity in commercial and industrial enterprises is between 25-100 MW. In the
residential sector, many households have 2-stroke gasoline generators. The strong winter
peak demand for electricity is largely attributable to the widespread use of electric bar-
heaters. Given that much residential heating and cooking is from burning wood, coal and
wastes, greater availability of grid-electricity can only be beneficial – though LPG has begun
to replace fuel wood and coal for cooking. 37
A1-23. As shown in the calculations of the case studies, inclusion of the damage costs of
both local and GHG emissions have little impact on the calculation and comparison of
economic returns, especially when the avoided damage costs associated with the reduction
of self-generation and indoor air pollution are also included.

Social Impacts
A1-24. Major generation and transmission projects, as well as domestic resource
exploitation (coal, gas, oil, hydro), may affect the well-being, land use and livelihoods of
project-affected persons (PAPs).38 There is little reliable information about the number of

37       It is well understood that the damage costs of diesel self generators, located in densely
         populated urban areas, with uncontrolled emissions emitted at or near ground level, have
         damage costs per kg of pollutant, are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than from modern
         utility scale generators fitted with high stacks, located in remote areas, and fitted with state-
         of-the-art pollution controls. (see, e.g., Lvovsky et al, 1990). This would likely hold true for
         Afghanistan as well: any large coal generation project would be far way from the major
         urban population centres. For details, see World Bank, Economic Analysis of Power Sector
         Projects: Guidance Note. Technical Annex B5, June 2015).

PAPs likely to be displaced by the large hydro projects: the pre-feasibility study of five
smaller Kunar river projects showed the number of displaced households in the few
hundreds (Table A1-6), with the cost of social mitigation plans of $6.5 to $18 million. That
for Kunar A is 1234 households to be resettled, with total costs of the EMP and SMP at $36.4
million. The original feasibility study for Bagdhara indicated that some 20,000 people
would be displaced if the full supply level for the reservoir was set at 1460 masl. The
updated feasibility study prepared in 2015 adjusts the full supply level to 1375 masl, at
which it is stated that no people would be affected by the reservoir.

A1-25. The costs of social and environmental management & mitigation plans, and of other
related safeguards policies are readily monetized and included in the table of economic
flows – though given the limited information at hand, such estimates are again subject to
high uncertainty. Based on the information in Table A1-4, the incremental costs in the case
of hydro projects may be taken as 3%.

A1. 3     ENERGY SECURITY

Definitions of Energy Security
A1-26. Energy security is one of the main uncertainties in small and fragile countries, but is
also an aspect of energy and power system planning that has been much discussed, most
often in connection with high cost renewable energy projects: when economic returns in a
conventional CBA fail to reach hurdle rates, might not the energy security benefits provide
additional justification, even if not monetized? Yet as noted by many, “energy security? has
rarely been clearly defined, which makes it hard to measure and therefore difficult to
balance against other policy objectives. Indeed, discussion of energy security requires much
caution and skepticism.39
A1-27. Most governments assert that energy security is a concern: and energy security is a
frequent topic of political debate. Indeed, governments, international institutions and the
international financial institutions (IFIs) define energy security in many different ways: each
has its own definition according to the risks and threats it perceives. Some definitions are
so broad as to become very difficult to relate to practical decision-making, much less to


             that are the subject of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental
             Management Plans.
39 As noted by the eminent MIT economist Paul Joskow (2008) , “There is one thing that has not

changed since the early 1970s. If you cannot think of a reasoned rationale for some policy based on
standard economic reasoning, then argue that the policy is necessary to promote “energy security.?
No less scathing is the US Chamber of Commerce (that publishes an annual Index of US Energy
Security Risk) “Thrown around ad nauseam by politicians, the media, and scholars alike, any
advancement in securing our energy sector has been overshadowed by an inability to determine what
is meant by this vague, but important objective – begging the question, how can we protect something
we have failed to define?? (US Chamber of Commerce, Institute for 21 st Century Energy, Index of US
Energy Security Risk, 2011).



April 25, 2016                                                                                       52
construct meaningful indicators. For example, IEA’s definition of energy security is the
uninterrupted physical availability at a price which is affordable, while respecting environmental
concerns (IEA, 2001), encompasses not just “security?, but includes many of the other
objectives of energy policy: how to quantify so grand a concept is attempted only by the
very brave.40
A1-28. Taylor and Van Doren (2008) note the differences between the perception of energy
security among economists, and that among (American) “foreign policy elites.? The
principal focus of the former is macroeconomic impact of fossil fuel price volatility, the
focus of the latter is geopolitical extortion. They point out that upon closer inspection, most
of the fears about geopolitical extortion are groundless, pointing to the failure of oil
embargoes to physically interrupt oil supplies to particular target countries: for example in
the 1972/73 Arab oil embargo, instead of buying oil from Arab members of OPEC, the US
simply bought from non-Arab sources (and the customers displaced by the US bought from
the Arab OPEC members).             Of course prices increased sharply, but quantities were
unaffected: US Oil imports increased from 1.7 mbd in 1971 to 3.2 mbd in 1973. They
similarly dismiss other related foreign policy concerns about energy security.41

Definitions of Energy Security
A1-29. There are wide differences in how governments perceive their energy security:
sometimes these are stated explicitly, in other cases they are evident from actions. What
constitutes energy security (or insecurity) is determined by the perceptions of government,
examples of which include:
    The UK Government in 1912: Arguably the first example of an expressly announced
     energy security policy, Winston Churchill, famously noted that “ We must become the
     owners or at any rate the controllers at the source of at least a proportion of the oil which we
     require?.42
    The Government of Saudi Arabia in 2012 : the commitment to large scale development
     of CSP reflects not just its excellent solar regime, and opportunity to become a global
     leader in a new industry, but the need to hedge the vulnerability of the Saudi oil
     infrastructure and its oil exports to blockade of the Straits of Hormuz. 43
    The Government of Nepal in the 1990s: The goal of energy sufficiency was articulated
     on grounds of its rich hydro resource, and that Nepal’s energy policy should build
     hydro projects and export the hydro surplus to India, rather than rely on electricity
     imports from India whose Eastern provinces at the time had a surplus of coal-fired


40The UK Government has a similarly encompassing definition: “consumers should have access to the
energy services they need (physical security) at prices that avoid excessive volatility (price security),
and delivered alongside achievement of our legally binding targets on carbon emissions and
renewable energy? (UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Energy Security Strategy,
Report to Parliament, November 2012).
41 For example, that in order to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil, the US must maintain friendly
relations with oil producers (such as with Iran), or that money from oil imports finds its way to fund
terrorist organizations. The authors argue that neither concern has any evidence to support them.
42History records the emergence of energy security as a major policy problem for the UK Government
in the conversion of the British Royal Navy from coal to oil first proposed in 1882. This was finally
realized in 1912 with the construction of the first oil-powered battleship. In the language of cost
benefit analysis, the military benefits of oil as a naval fuel (no smoke, 30 minutes to reach full power,
not 3-4 hours, a third of the engine weight, and a quarter of the fuel weight for equal horsepower, 12
hours instead of 5 days to refuel) far exceeded the incremental cost of oil, and the cost of securing the
supply. The problem was that while Britain had coal, it had no oil, which needed to be secured from
the Middle East – a fact that shaped (and held hostage) British foreign policy for the next 50 years.
43 The Saudi Electricity Company 550 MW Duba 1 project, an integrated solar combined cycle project,
is the first CSP project in a program that has set a target of 41 GW of solar power by 2032 (CSP 25 GW,
PV 16 GW)

       capacity, suitable for export as base-load. While electricity self-sufficiency was largely
       attained, the result of the reluctance to see energy trade as a two-way opportunity
       resulted in no progress in exporting hydro power, and endemic power shortages,
       particularly because an almost all-hydro system was exposed to increasing hydrology
       risk.44
      The United States in 2011: The March 2011 speech of President Obama articulated
       America’s energy security problem as freedom from oil imports “…there are no quick
       fixes. We will keep on being a victim to shifts in the oil market until we get serious about a long-
       term policy for secure, affordable energy … The United States of America cannot afford to bet
       our long-term prosperity and security on a resource that will eventually run out… So today, I’m
       setting a new goal: one that is reasonable, achievable, and necessary. When I was elected to this
       office, America imported 11 million barrels of oil a day. By a little more than a decade from now,
       we will have cut that by one-third?.45 In fact by 2013 US oil imports had already fallen by
       half - albeit less as a consequence of new Federal Government policies as much as by the
       private sector-led fracking technology revolution.

Lessons from the Energy Security Literature
A1-30. Since the 1973 OPEC oil embargo a growing literature has grappled with the
question of how to define and quantify energy security concerns. In the economics
literature the emphasis of energy security discussions – particularly since the mid-1970s – is
on the macroeconomic impacts of oil price shocks. Bohi, Toman and Walls (1996)
summarize much of the early work and define energy insecurity as the loss of welfare that may
occur as a result of a change in the price or availability of energy ; Tang et al (2010) examine the
impact of oil price shocks on the Chinese Economy; and Ebrahim et al. (2014) 46 assess the
macroeconomic consequences of oil price volatility - all typical examples of a still-growing
literature. Much of this work is focused on the asymmetries of oil price shocks (the costs of
sharp oil price rises – including inflation and recession - are not matched by the benefits of
any subsequent price falls): it is the price and consequent macroeconomic impacts, rather
than curtailments in physical supply that is the main concern. This is complemented by a
substantial World Bank literature that deals with strategies to mitigate the impacts of oil
price shocks in developing countries (both importers and exporters). 47
A1-31. Translating price volatility impacts into a risk premium that could be built into CBA
is difficult, and rarely attempted. A recent study for Latin America by the Inter-American
Development Bank48 suggests the risk premium to be very small, (0.01 US¢/kWh), an order
of magnitude lower than, say, the damage costs from local air pollution of thermal
generation. Another recent study to develop an avoided cost renewable energy tariff for
Indonesian geothermal projects49 estimates the volatility premium at 0.07 US¢/kWh
(estimated as the cost to Ministry of Finance of short-term financing of unexpected
increased subsidy to PLN as a result of volatility induced forecasting errors of coal prices.
A1-32. Another strand of the relevant literature is to cast renewable energy as a hedge
against fossil fuel price volatility, as first proposed by Auerbuch (2000). He argued that the

oil price volatility (industrial production, employment, inflation and monetary policy, unemployment,
stagflation)

role of renewable energy projects in a portfolio of generating projects was akin to the role of
essentially risk-free treasuries in a financial portfolio. The application of mean-variance
portfolio theory is useful but one must be careful not to overstate the case: wind projects in
particular have high annual variability due to wind speed variations – though because this
risk is uncorrelated with the factors that drive fossil fuel price variability, it can still serve as
a hedge.
A1-33. The general theme of renewable energy as a hedge against fossil price uncertainty
has been taken up by Bolinger and Wiser (2005) at the US Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. This argues that – at least in the US where futures markets for natural gas are
well developed – renewable energy can be a cost-effective hedge when compared to futures
hedging. However, sophisticated oil-price hedging strategies for small developing
countries are to be recommended only with great caution (Sri Lanka’s recent attempts to do
so were an unmitigated disaster, with losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars). 50
A1-34. This survey points to a number of important lessons for Afghanistan:
    The general conclusions about the ineffectiveness of embargoes and physical
     interruptions, or the threat of interruption, do not apply to landlocked countries.
     Afghanistan’s experience with Iran, Nepal’s experience with India, or indeed
     Switzerland’s experience in World War II,51 all show that landlocked countries are
     indeed exposed to this category of energy security concern.
    Even during the height of the cold war, the Soviet Union did not disrupt gas supply to
     Europe (that has other gas import options); but Russian threats to cut off pipeline gas
     supply to the Ukraine and Georgia have been more successful.
     Definitions of energy security vary from country to country. These need to be clearly
     established in consultation with the Government at the outset of a planning study (or
     project appraisal).
    One should distinguish between the resilience of the power system and the risks
     associated with specific projects. System resilience is primarily about diversity (the
     more diverse the sources of supply, the less is the impact of a given shock); about
     energy efficiency and energy intensity (if energy is used efficiently, again the less is the
     impact of an external shock). Efficient pricing is an important dimension of this: the
     fewer and lower the subsidies the better.
    Security should be treated as a separate attribute – and a quantitative indicator selected
     to quantify it. In most cases there will likely be a trade-off between economic efficiency
     and the energy security attribute.
    The relevant security attribute will be a function of the level of planning involved. For
     example, the Herfindahl index as a measure of generation supply diversity may be
     appropriate for a generation planning study. But for a project selection appraisal, the
     various project-specific risks should be enumerated, and costed on the basis of outages
     (unserved energy) and repair costs.

Energy Security in Afghanistan
A1-35. The definition of energy security concerns was taken up at the May 2015 Workshop.
In order of importance, these were defined by the participants as follows:



50  Both the ENRON and Ceylon Petroleum Company fiascos are well described                         at
http://www.risk.net/energy-risk/feature/2323248/the-10-biggest-energy-risk-management-
disasters-of-the-past-20-years
51Switzerland experienced the most extreme case of energy security related geopolitical extortion:
During World War II, Switzerland was almost entirely dependent on imported coal for winter space
heating, which enabled Nazi Germany to force Switzerland to export machinery and hi-tech goods to
Germany in exchange for coal, in contravention of international laws on neutrality (Wylie, 2003). But
such successful examples of extortion are rare.



April 25, 2016                                                                                55
    People need power: As the first priority, unanimously accepted by all of the
     Government and utility officials present. Access to reliable low cost electricity is
     viewed as fundamental to economic and social development, which in turn are the best
     guarantors for a reduction in insurgency.
    Weather: In the seven years since the construction of the 220 kV transmission line across
     the Salang Pass, and large scale imports of electricity from northern neighbors, one of
     the two major disruptions has been due to inclement winter weather: in late February
     2015 avalanches destroyed several towers, resulting in a six-week disruption to Kabul’s
     power supply.
    Lack of refinery capacity: This makes Afghanistan vulnerable to border closures given
     that diesel fuel is imported by tanker truck. In January 2011, Iran closed the border to
     diesel trucks, for the officially given reason of discouraging smuggling. This
     demonstrated how vulnerable Afghanistan’s diesel supplies were, in the event of any
     disruption of trade at the border, regardless of the reason – commercial or political.52
    Dependence on electricity imports: The lack of import alternatives in the short term
     leads to the impression of a weak bargaining position for Afghanistan when negotiating
     the price of electricity imports from Uzbekistan to supply the NEPS system and Kabul.
     However, while the price has certainly increased over the past few years, the price now
     being requested by Uzbekistan for firm power over the next year (around 8US¢/kWh)
     is not unreasonable given current market conditions for gas in the CARs (see case study
     in Annex 3).
    Local opposition: The main disruption to transmission infrastructure construction and
     right-of-way clearance has been local opposition “Locals see the line, but they see no
     benefit and get no power?. The use of local contractors during construction is a partial
     solution to this problem, and Appendix 1 to Annex 5 presents some technical solutions
     to delivering small amounts of power along a major transmission line.53 As in many
     other developing countries, as soon as a project is announced (and particularly those
     funded by IFIs known to insist on generous compensation packages), it has been
     reported that “land grabbers? appear as potential beneficiaries, c laiming to be eligible
     for the compensation package expected to be on offer.
    Insurgent action: Attacks on small scale energy infrastructure are rare, and so far no
     small off-grid renewable energy facility in rural areas has been targeted. There have
     been many reported security problems where foreigners have been concerned (the
     Chinese mining consortium experienced problems during its investigations of coal
     resources)54 or where the presence of NATO forces have attracted insurgents (such as at
     the Kajaki hydro project). Separate insurgent attacks in Baghlan province in early 2016
     led to Kabul’s supply from northern imports being disrupted for the first time.
A1-36. These perceptions of the security issues facing Afghanistan reflect the view as seen
by officials of the Government of Afghanistan, involved in the day to day operation of the
power system, and faced with short term priorities. Unfortunately it is the perception of
parties outside Afghanistan, particularly among potential investors, that pose the most
significant obstacle to developing the generation options for the long term. In addition to
the problems faced by the Chinese Mining consortium (noted above), other recent examples
include.



52Given the withdrawal of NATO forces, the Workshop participants did not see a repetition of such
an embargo as an important threat for the future.
 Using the so-called Shield Wire System (used in several developing countries). See Appendix 1 to
53

Annex 5.
54 The Government’s response of sending 400 troops to the Hagi Gak concession area was deemed
insufficient by the CMGC, who discontinued survey work on grounds of poor security (though it has
also been argued that this withdrawal may have been related to renegotiation of the concession
arrangements).



April 25, 2016                                                                            56
      The reluctance of the Indian consulting company preparing the FS for the Kunar A
       hydro project to conduct the necessary geological and geotechnical studies on grounds
       of insurgent activity: resulting in a FS that is of little practical value since it cannot
       confirm technical feasibility.
      The refusal of potential suppliers of converter stations for the HVDC CASA-1000 project
       to bid for the proposed Kabul converter station (they have also refused to bid for the
       converter station in Peshawar, which may lead to the relocation of the Pakistan end of
       the HVDC line closer to the main load centers).
      According to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR),
       turbine parts for the Kajaki hydro projects have been on-site since 2008 but uninstalled
       due to “security threats?.55
A1-37. In other words, there is a disconnect between the perceptions of the energy security
as perceived by those Afghanistan officials intimately involved in the day-to-day planning
and operation of the power system – who are accustomed to the realities of daily life in
Afghanistan – and the perceptions of potential investors and equipment suppliers
overseas.56 These assessments severely constrain the freedom of choice for power sector
investment in Afghanistan, and has led to significant distortions, particularly to over-
investment in transmission and under-investment in generation.

Risk, Risk Mitigation and Resilience in Afghanistan
A1-38. Energy insecurity can be described as a basket of applicable risks: different
countries will have different perceptions of the relevant risks in their baskets, which are
typically one or more of the risks listed in Table A1-7. Risk mitigation refers to actions
focused on the mitigation of specific risks – hedging of oil prices (mitigating against price
volatility), increasing fuel supply stocks at fossil power plants (mitigating against the risk of
physical supply disruption). The important point is that all such mitigation actions come at
a cost, and that these costs can be compared to the expected value of the cost of the risk.
The cost of a one month disruption to coal supply for example caused by an accident that
disrupts coal trains can be calculated as the cost of lost generation plus the cost of restoring
the supply.

                      outages at generators)
                    Natural resource variability  Commodity price bubbles
                      (hydrology & wind speed
                      variations)
                    Natural         force       majeure
                      (typhoons, extreme drought)


55 The reports of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR) to the US
Congress reveal the extent to which US contractors have encountered problems in various power
sector projects. The extent to which claims of “security problems? is used as cover for other
implementation and management problems is unclear, but reports of this kind shape the perceptions
of potential overseas investors about security risks (see, e.g. SIGAR, Quarterly Report to the United
States Congress, April 2015).
56There is no doubt that “Security? seems to be a convenient cover for the mismanagement of f oreign
contractors. The SIGAR report on the Tarakhil project showed that the delays and cost overruns were
largely a consequence of ambiguities in the statement of work, delays in subcontract awards,
subcontractor performance problems, lack of on-site quality assurance, lack of timely approvals, and
poor communication between USAID and the contractors. The only Afghanistan-specific issue was
delays associated with land ownership issues (also noted by the World Bank Enterprise Survey as one
of the main constraints to private investment). See SIGAR, Special Report: Contract delays and Cost
Overruns for the Kabul Power Plant and Sustainability Remains a Key Challenge. January 2010.

A1-39. Resilience: and metrics for its quantification capture the degree to which the power
sector is robust with respect to exogenous uncertainties. This is an attribute of the system,
and not of the riskiness of a particular project. Accordingly, the extent of resilience will be
determined by sectoral policies, and particularly those that improve the efficiency of the
sector: industrial energy efficiency that improves the energy/GDP intensity, or T&D loss
reduction, both improve the resilience to exogenous risks no less than the introduction of
renewable energy to diversify the supply mix. Many definitions of energy resilience have
been proposed:
      Simple measures such as the fraction of oil demand met by imports in oil supply (much
       used in the US)
      More sophisticated numerical indicators of diversity of supply (under the presumption
       that greater diversity implies better energy security), such as the Herfindahl index (and
       its derivatives, discussed further below).
      Energy (electricity) consumption per unit of GDP – the more energy intensive the
       economy, the greater the impact of supply disruption or price volatility.
A1-40. The most common indicator of supply diversity (or generation mix diversity in the
case of the power sector) is the Herfindahl Index, a dimensionless measure used originally
to assess the degree of concentration and competition of firms in industrial sectors. The
index H is calculated simply as the sum of squares of the market or generation mix shares si
for each of the n shares as follows:

            H   si2
                  n
A1-41. The lower the value of H the greater the diversity of fuels. In estimating
diversification of supply by this approach, if there were only one fuel the index would be 1,
if there were ten fuels each taking the same share, the index would be 0.1. The shares are
best expressed as installed capacity shares rather than energy shares: obviously, introducing
new renewable energy forms into a power system will increase such diversity, but as noted
above, whether greater diversity necessarily improves energy security is not always true.57
A1-42. The case of energy efficiency improvements is instructive: all other things equal,
T&D loss reduction or energy efficiency projects will reduce the need for supply, but leave
its mix (and hence its H-index) largely unchanged – but the resilience of the economy (say
measured as kWh per unit of GDP) will surely improve.58


57When one looks at diversity of supply, the value of a 100 MW thermal project normally run at 70-
90% is much greater than the value of a 100 MW wind project that has a 15% annual capacity factor.
The thermal project can be run at 90% (if there is enough fuel in its tanks), but the total average
capacity factor of the wind project cannot be increased (and in any event may not be available at the
system peak). So it is not installed capacity that is the relevant metric, but the maximum dependable
capacity that should be used.


58The International Energy Agency (Blythe & Levebre, 2007) modified this simple diversity measure
by weighting the shares by the relative political risk ( ri) associated with each source, the “energy
security index? ESI defined as

A1-43. Figure A1-3 compares the Herfindahl index for the NEPS supply, with a notional
index value of 0.333 for three equal shares. With the growing dominance of electricity
imports, and the more or less complete phasing out of diesel generation in Kabul, the index
value has increased from 0.45 in 2007 to 0.6 by the end of 2011 – the supply has become less
diverse.

where zero geo-political risk would reflected by r=1, and maximum oil import risk (e.g., oil that must
pass through the Straits of Hormuz), by r=10. Studies of a similar genre include Wintzer (2011) who
assesses European vulnerability to Russian gas imports; and Grubb et al (2006) who assess energy
security and carbon reduction for the UK. In an IMF working paper, Cohen et al. (2011) use a similar
index based on the risk assessments of the Political Risk Services Group and reported in the
International Country Risk Guide (PSRG,2014).58 (Afghanistan is not among the 145 countries
monitored by PRSG).

ANNEX 2: CASE STUDY - HYDROPOWER PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
A2.1     BACKGROUND
A2-1. There is little question that Afghanistan is endowed with significant hydro
resources59. But as with all energy resources, whether they should be developed is not a
question of their existence, but of whether their development is economic. Successive
master plans have recommended that new hydro projects be developed, but progress
toward their realization has been slow.
A2-2. This Section examines the question of how and when to proceed with the
development of new large hydro projects in Afghanistan that have been recommended for
implementation by plans going back more than 30 years. The locations of existing and
candidate projects in the east of the country where much of the potential lies are shown in
Figure A2-1. Decisions about hydro have been repeatedly delayed perhaps because of the
ease with which imports have grown: the high capital cost of hydro has also discouraged
the preparation of modern feasibility studies.
       Figure A2-1:      Existing and planned hydro projects in the Kabul/Kunar river basins.




       Red circles: major new hydro projects
       Green circles: existing dams

A2-3. The distinguishing feature of hydro projects is their site-specific dependence, which
requires a favorable combination of topography, hydrology and geology, and the fact that
this requires expensive feasibility study to establish. For Afghanistan there is the additional
problem of matching hydro output to strong seasonal load dependence: peak demand is in
winter (December-January), but peak inflows are in summer (Figure A2-2). This same
problem is common to Afghanistan’s northern neighbors Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which
also have hydro surpluses in summer – and is one of the reasons why summer surplus
hydro from these countries has been available to Afghanistan at low cost. This is in contrast


59Afghanistan is also reputed to have significant wind resources especially in the South-West part of
the country (near Herat and Farah). It is possible these could be developed more quickly than hydro
but very little information is currently available about wind characteristics: see:
http://www.red-mew.gov.af/ren-sources-publication/wind/potential-map-wind/

to Pakistan, which faces summer power shortages, and which is therefore the driver for the
CASA-1000 project that will deliver summer surplus power from the hydro surplus
countries in Central Asia to North-eastern Pakistan by HVDC transmission across
Afghanistan.

23,000 MW. APSMP identifies several hydropower projects for development to enter
service in the period to 2032, as shown in Table A2-1. At the start of this study, there were
no feasibility studies to international standards for any of the projects identified in the
APSMP, and most studies were dated.

A2-5. Since then, the FS for Bagdhara hydropower project has been completed, which,
with the benefit of some additional geotechnical exploration concluded that the project was
“technically feasible under consideration of the prevailing hydrological, topographic, geological,
infrastructure, environmental and social conditions?. Of particular note is the conclusion that a
lower full reservoir level of 1375 masl would will avoid resettlement from the inundation of
fertile Bagram/Gulbahar Plain. The recommended installed capacity is 226.5MW rather


April 25, 2016                                                                                  61
than the previous estimate of 210 MW shown in Table B.1. Energy generation is 876 GWh,
slightly lower than the previous estimate of 968 GWh because the new design also
contemplates drinking water supply to Kabul. Total EPC cost (at constant 2014/2015 prices)
is $562 million, slightly lower than the $600million of the 2012 APSMP. A six-year
construction period is envisaged with civil works beginning in 2017, and completed in 2022.
The report cautions that “depending on the security situation there is an unpredictable risk of
potential increase of cost and construction time.? Given the magnitude of the financing needed,
and the work that remains to be done to put it in place and undertake contracting, means
that a perhaps the APSMP commissioning date is more realistic.
                                     Box A2-1: Real Options
A real option is the right, but not the obligation, to invest in a future project of unknown
benefit at a known cost today. Just like buying a plot of land gives one the right (but not
obligation) to erect a building in the future, a real option implies at least two time steps – a
decision to be made today, followed by a decision to be made tomorrow.
The value of a real option is
= Expected Net Present Value (calculated in the usual way)
 + Value of options created
- Value of options destroyed
Thus an investment today which has positive net benefits but fails to create new options
may be less desirable than an investment with fewer (or even no) benefits today but which
results in increased or better options in the future. So there may be a value in implementing
a project that does not provide any benefit today, but makes it possible to implement
another project at a later point in time.
There are several necessary conditions for the real option value approach to be relevant:
uncertainty, learning and flexibility – which one can illustrate in the case of a hydro project
for which the commissioning of a detailed feasibility study (FS) is an example:
Uncertainty. Without which there is no need to consider the possibility of deferring an
investment decision: the future is known and the best decision under certainty can be made
now. But one does not start dam construction until the various geotechnical uncertainties
have been resolved.
Learning; that is, the state of information regarding uncertainty must change over time.
The FS represents that learning. If it is unlikely that uncertainties will be resolved over
time, then one might as well make a decision today. 60
Flexibility; if the FS shows that the hydro project will be uneconomic (or technically
infeasible), one must be prepared not to proceed.
A2-6. The problem of how to proceed on hydro projects is a classic example of a real option
which is described in more detail in Box A2-1.61 The specific question to be asked is
whether one should commission a FS for one of the Kunar River projects now, or delay and
reconsider one year later, given the present uncertainties about (1) whether and when
agreement can be reached with Pakistan on joint development of the Kunar river; (2) the
ultimate capital cost of the hydro project; (3) whether summer surplus hydro of the project
can in fact be exported (either through the CASA-1000 project which may have spare

60Even with the benefits of a FS, however, not all geotechnical problems can be resolved – there are
several examples of dam axes being changed once construction started, and foundation and geological
fault conditions verified. Similarly, notwithstanding that commercial lenders often insist they take no
tunneling risk (which means that the costs of unexpected geological conditions must be covered by
equity), depending on terrain it may be judged uneconomic to confirm by drilling at the FS stage the
actual rock conditions deep underground. A FS can never eliminate all uncertainty.

Options: A practitioner’s guide, Texere, New York, 2001 is one of them

capacity depending on the rate of decline of the summer surplus in Tajikistan and KYR, or
through a new transmission corridor along the Kunar River); and (4) what would be the
cost of energy from the next best alternative (either imports or generation at a Sheberghan
CCGT).
A2-7. The funding decision for the $5-10 million required for the Kunar river cascade
development study and subsequent detailed feasibility studies is especially relevant,
because the latest study of the Kunar hydro projects recommends that the riparian issues
with Pakistan "be clarified before work on the FS for cascade development is started? - which
could be in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years or indeed never. At the same time, it is pointed out that
a FS without confirmation of the geological and geotechnical conditions – which means
drilling at site – is likely to be of limited value, and hence not the best use of resources.

A2.2     THE ECONOMICS OF HYDROPOWER
A2-8. The hydro project candidates listed at Table A2-1 are assumed to provide the best
information available on them, although the reliability of some of the assumptions and
calculations are at least open to question: for example it seems unlikely that all but two
projects have a load factor of 56-57 percent (except Kunar A at 69 percent and Bagdhara at
53 percent - close to the recent FS estimate of 49 percent). It is likely that further refinements
would result from size optimization analysis based on inflow hydrology and alternative
machine configurations and reservoir sizes.
A2-9. Table A2-2 displays the results of a simple comparison of a hydro project (using
Bagdhara as the example, with capital costs and energy according to Table A2-1) and a gas-
fired plant at Sheberghan. Other assumptions include
   Hydro construction time 5 years; gas engine 2 years
   Hydro O&M costs at 3% of capital cost per year
   Gas engine cost $1000/kW, with Afghanistan construction premium at 1.6
   Sheberghan gas price $4/mmBTU (see next section for details)
   Gas engine life is 20 years, so a second gas engine is built in years 18&19.
A2-10. At 10 percent discount rate, the hydro project is considerably more expensive, with
an LCOE of 10.3 US¢/kWh (row [10] of Table A2-2), and gas at 7.71 US¢/kWh (row [26] of
Table A2-2). Even at 6 percent discount rate, the hydro project at 7.40 US¢/kWh is more
expensive than the gas project at 6.83 US¢/kWh.

      A2-11. However the further problem is that the benefits are not the same. Table A2-3 shows
      the expected annual generation for all prospective hydropower plant in APSMP. Seventy
      percent of the Bagdhara energy will be generated during the 5 wet months (April-August).
      If it is assumed that the avoided cost during winter peak hours is the cost of diesel self-
      generation (say 25 USc /kWh, for a $75/bbl world oil price, 62 and the cost of off-peak winter
      power is 8.5USc/kWh(the presumed cost of firm imports from Turkmenistan or
      Uzbekistan); and that in summer, the avoided cost of peak and off-peak energy is 6
      USc/kWh, then under these dispatch conditions the net benefit (as NPV) for the hydro
      project is $24 million, but that of the gas engine is $84 million (Table A2-4).
      A2-12. Even if all summer energy could be exported to Pakistan at 10 US¢/kWh, the gas
      engine option is still preferred (with an NPV of $247 million, compared to the hydro at $170
      million). More importantly presentation of comparisons of levelised costs of energy is of
      very limited value: it is always net benefits that matter. Note also that these results can only
      be illustrative: this analysis needs to be updated when an FS for Sheberghan is available.

               A2.3        THE STATUS OF DETAILED FEASIBILITY STUDIES
               A1-44. In its major recommendations, in 2004 the Norconsult Master plan called for the
               preparation of a feasibility study of the 280 MW Bagdhara hydro project, and, depending on
               its results, to then prepare a further FS on the 180 MW Surobi 2 hydro project that is
               downstream of Bagdhara.
               A1-45. The Norconsult report also recommended a FS be conducted for Kokcha, and for
               the development of the 20,000 MW of hydro projects on the Amu/Panj rivers that constitute
               the Afghanistan/Tajikistan border. Work on neither of these FS appears to have been
               initiated. The Master plan noted that the prospects for Kunar A, with its large dam, would
               stand little chance of being implemented if the smaller Bagdhara project were turned down
               for environmental reasons – and implied that the development of Kunar A should await the
               results of the Bagdhara FS.

               Bagdhara
               A2-13. A consultant was commissioned by MEW to undertake a “Project Definition Study?
               for Bagdhara in 2005, and several reports entitled "Bagdhara Feasibility Study" were issued
               in January 2007 (Volume I on Hydrology, Volume 2 on a Preliminary Social Impact
               Assessment, and Volume 3 on a Preliminary Environmental Assessment). The main
               conclusion of these preliminary studies was to limit the full reservoir level to 1,420masl in
               order to avoid the resettlement of 20,000 people in the originally intended level of 1,460
               masl. The consultant was then asked by MEW to draw up the terms of reference for a
               detailed FS, which included a requirement for detailed on-site geological and geotechnical
               investigations.

               The Kunar River projects
               A2-14. In 2009, a feasibility study for the 798 MW Shal Hydro project on the Kunar River
               (which is called Kunar A in the APSMP), was submitted to MEW by consultants. This
               estimated capital costs of $1.6 billion (at 2009 prices) or $2,000/kW, for a project with
               average energy of 3,600 GWh. Updated to 2015 prices (at 1.5% per year), this results in a
               levelised economic cost of 7.26USc/kWh (at 10% discount rate and 30 year life).
               A2-15. In 2013, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed an agreement to jointly develop the hydro
               potential of the Kunar River, and requested the World Bank to provide technical assistance
               to develop the cascade. The World Bank has now completed the first step in this process,
               with an initial assessment of the options for cascade development of the river, with projects
               to be built in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, and including the prospects for multi-purpose
               projects to meet water supply and irrigation needs. This assessment recommended that
               Afghanistan proceed with a detailed Cascade Development Study and a Detailed Feasibility
               Study, whose total costs are estimated at $5 million (though this estimate is a bit vague in
               that it states it is preliminary and would depend on the number of projects proposed for the
               cascade).
               A2-16. The assessment observes that Pakistan’s involvement in a ca scade development of
               the Kunar River is vital, preferably in a development scenario that would include a project


               April 25, 2016                                                                              66
on the Pakistani part of the river, or in a scenario in which the Kunar project extended into
Pakistani territory to achieve a larger storage reservoir. However, “ Pakistan’s interest in the
cascade development?, either by one of these options or by its willingness to import electricity
from Afghanistan “has a fundamental bearing on the configuration of the development of the
hydropower resources on the Kunar River, and needs to be clarified before the commencement of the
FS for the Cascade Development.?
A2-17. Even under the best of circumstances, international cooperation on a jointly
developed project on an international waterway is a very slow process indeed, subject to a
range of exogenous geopolitical considerations that tend to get in the way of rational
economic reasoning. The necessary clarifications sought in the above recommendation may
take years to achieve, and general expressions of willingness to consider future imports
have little significance because they will always be contingent upon “reasonable price.?
And even if it were true that the Shal project were only feasible if its summer surplus can be
exported to Pakistan, without better information than what is in the existing FS, general
assurances of a willingness to buy, even if given, are also of marginal value. Indeed, in our
view the best way of eliciting Pakistan’s interest is precisely by a credible demonstration of
the benefits.

A2.4     THE REAL OPTION METHODOLOGY
A2-18. The question to be answered is, given the information presently available, and
given the uncertainties, whether or not to proceed with a FS today, or whether one should
wait one year and then reconsider. For sake of illustration assume the question is whether
to proceed with a FS for Kunar B, which is the first hydro project in the sequence
recommended by the APSMP notwithstanding that an FS for Bagdhara is now available, the
consequences of which are discussed in more detail below. From Table A2-1 this is shown
as 300 MW generating 1,485 MWh/year, with a capital cost of $2,000/kW.
A2-19. Figure A2-3 shows the decision tree for this problem. At time step T=1 one can take
the decision to conduct an FS, assumed to cost $6 million, or to wait one year, and
reconsider the same question at time step T=2.

A2-20. At time step 1, if the FS proceeds, there is no guarantee that the project is in fact
found to be technically feasible. It is assumed that the probability of feasibility is 80%: if not
found feasible, then the energy is presumed to be supplied by imports – about which the
assumed uncertainty is as shown in Table B.5: the probabilities here are based on the
expectation that the Turkmenistan PPA under negotiation will likely be in the range of 6.5 –
9.5 US¢/kWh. If the project were found to be feasible, the main uncertainty is the
investment cost, whose uncertainty is again shown in Table A2-5: here the assumption
would be that the capital costs estimated for hydro projects as given in the APSMP are
reliable, so the most weight (60%) is given to the $2,000/kW estimate.

                     value

A2-21. For each of the branches that represent the outcome of the FS, the expected value
can be calculated: for example, in the case of the feasible hydro project, the expected value
is:
         E{ }= $605m = 0.05*$744m+0.25*$685m+0.6*$573m+0.1*$524m
         This can be folded back to calculate the expected value before the outcome is
         known (at time step t-1), namely



April 25, 2016                                                                              68
         E{FS}= 0.2* $575 million + 0.8* $605 million + $6million = $574million
         Where the $6 million represents the cost of the FS.
A2-22. The NPVs are calculated on the assumption that the FS takes 2 years, and
construction (if found feasible) takes 5 years, and that the hydro project has a life of 30 years
– in other word it estimates the cost of power from the two sources from year 8 to year 38.
If the hydro project is delayed one year, then for the first year the energy would also have to
be imported – which explains why the NPV of the hydro option at time step 1 is different to
the NPV one year later.
A2-23. However, in the case of the hydro project, these NPVs must be adjusted to account
for the uncertainty regarding exports of the surplus summer hydropower to Pakistan.
Since a comparison is being made based on the least cost option to meet a specified demand
- 1,485 GWh – the presumption is that the benefits are the same for both. But that is not the
case here, because 70% of the total hydro energy is generated in summer, when it has less
value than the firm and dispatchable energy provided by imports. If the surplus can be
exported to Pakistan at a price comparable to Afghanistan’s impor ts from Turkmenistan,
then one can assume equivalence of benefits. But if that is not the case, then one must
adjust the NPVs by a penalty charge that reflects the lower value of summer surplus power
(shown as ? in the decision-tree Figures that follow).63
A2-24. The branches at the decision node at time step 1 is repeated at time step=2 in the
upper half of Figure B.3 – and indeed could easily be extended to cover further time steps
were the decision at time step 2 again be for delay.
A2-25. The result is that at time step=1, the FS has an expected value of cost of preparing
the FS at time step 1 of $605 million (which is written as E{FS,t=1} , but delaying the
decision to the next time period has a lower expected value of E{delay, t=1}=$575 million.
The rational decision is to delay until the following year.
A2-26. Certainty that Pakistan will take the summer surplus does not change the decision.
Now cost of the E{FS},1=$524million – lower because of the additional export revenue from
Sales to Pakistan; but E{delay,1} is also lower, at $517million (The decision tree for this case
is shown in Annex VI, case A).       The robustness of the decision is easily demonstrated by
varying some of the key assumptions: for example, decreasing the probability that the FS
will demonstrate technical feasibility could be lowered to 50% (from 80% in Figure 4.3): in
this case E{FS,1}} increases to $596million; and even if this were set at 100%, the
E{FS,1}=$611million – so in both cases more costly than the delay E{FSdelay,1}=
$575million.
A2-27. The delay FS decision is also robust to the discount rate: if the discount rate is
lowered to 6%, then the E{FS,1} is $929million, but the expected value of delay,
E{FSdelay,1) = $892million.

The Impact of Learning
A2-28. For the real option approach to useful, there has to be learning. In other words, the
only reason for delay is if by waiting one has the option of implementing a better project in
the future - and that will only be the case if some of the uncertainties can be resolved over
time. One of the important uncertainties that has been resolved in part is the price of
imports: PPA negotiations with Turkmenistan are now complete. Had this been signed at
8.5 US¢/kWh, then the decision tree would appear as shown in Figure A2-4: Now on the
top right hand corner the probability of the import price is seen as 8.5 US¢ (with the others


63       This penalty is calculated as the present value of the summer generation (assumed at 70% of
         the annual total) penalized at 2 USc/kWh (which is roughly the difference between the
         average cost of current summer imports and of firm power provided from Uzbekistan. At
         time step=1 this NPV is $101; at time step =2 the NPV is lower ($92million) become the
         stream of penalty payments is delayed by a year.


April 25, 2016                                                                               69
at zero): the resulting E{noFS,2} is now $611 million, as against the hydro FS of $597 million,
so the decision would then be to proceed with the FS.

A2-29. If in addition Pakistan were to make, say, an in principle commitment to take the
summer surplus, the probability of export sales can be adjusted to 50% - only once a PPA is
signed would there be certainty. In this case the expected value of the FS falls further to
$524 million. Under these assumptions one can conclude that the decision to proceed with
the FS is not sensitive to assurances provided by the Government of Pakistan (if the price of
imports is 8.5USc/kWh). At the end of this annex some revised decision trees are shown:
Case A gives the changes that result from increased certainty of summer sales for Pakistan.
Case B shows the effects with and without knowing the outcome of import prices and Case
C on a change of the discount rate to 6 percent.
A2-30. In June 2015 the Bagdhara hydro project feasibility study was presented to the
Government of Afghanistan. With the benefit of some additional geotechnical exploration
the FS concluded that the project was “technically feasible under consideration of the prevailing
hydrological, topographic, geological, infrastructure, environmental and social conditions?. Of
particular note is the conclusion that a lower full reservoir level of 1375 masl would will
avoid resettlement completely and the inundation of fertile Bagram/Gulbahar Plain. A
maximum resettlement of 10 households is required for the overhead transmission line.
A2-31. The recommended installed capacity is 226.5MW rather than the previous estimate
of 210 MW of the Masterplan energy generation is 876 GWh, slightly lower than the
previous estimate of 968 GWh because the new design also contemplates drinking water
supply to Kabul. Total EPC cost (at constant 2014/2015 prices) is $562 million, slightly

lower than the $600million of the 2012 APSMP. A six-year construction period is envisaged
with civil works beginning in 2017, and completed in 2022. The report cautions that
“depending on the security situation there is an unpredictable risk of potential increase of cost and
construction time.?
A2-32. These more recent findings which became available after the original analysis
would not appear to change the probabilities noted in the decision-trees of this annex, nor
the conclusion that the magnitude of the investment required prevents any early
implementation of this (or any other) large hydro project. Given the high uncertainties of
the deteriorating security situation, the emphasis for developing Afghanistan’s domestic
resources should continue to be in smaller projects commensurate with the risk appetite of
potential investors – which means small hydro projects, PV, and gas-engine scale
development of the Sherberghan gas reserve.

A2.5     CONCLUSIONS
A2-33. This analysis shows how decisions can be made under uncertainty.                   One may
conclude that
   A FS has value only if technical feasibility can be demonstrated. There is no point in
    commissioning any further detailed FS in Afghanistan unless the consultant is willing
    to conduct detailed geotechnical investigations on site (as has been done at Bagdhara).
    The idea that the geological risk can be assumed by the EPC contractor, and factored
    into the EPC tender price is not credible: no competent contractor would accept such
    risks, and no IFI would be willing to provide finance in the absence of demonstrated
    technical feasibility at site.
   Declarations of interest from the Government of Pakistan about its willingness to
    purchase surplus power form the Kunar River hydro projects need not be made a
    condition precedent for the proposed cascade development study. Such declarations of
    intent can only be made with any credibility once the benefits of the projects can be
    demonstrated – which requires the FS to be done and will be driven by the price offered
    for the power. Economic feasibility will be demonstrated in the light of alternatives,
    now known to be the Turkmen imports. The analysis shows that under current
    assumptions, the decision to proceed with an FS depends on other factors; moreover as
    more information is now available, the analysis could usefully be repeated.
   In any event, the Bagdhara FS shows an economically attractive – if complex and costly
    – project; hence establishing the Kunar River projects becomes less urgent. Its more
    advanced status worsens the case for proceeding with Kunar. Bagdhara, like Kunar,
    must find a suitable market for the summer surplus and must therefore compete with
    other projects, including CASA-1000. To state the previous conclusion another way,
    whether Bagdhara is able to sell its summer surplus will depend on the price at which it
    can offer the power to Pakistan.
   The uncertainties for Baghdara and the project cost are significant and will probably not
    be attractive to potential private investors – at least until there has been further
    experience in Afghanistan. Hence it may be most appropriate to proceed with efforts to
    sound out the level of interest among IFIs to finance it.

ANNEX 3 – CASE STUDY:                        DEVELOPING AFGHANISTAN’S COAL
RESOURCES
A3.1       BACKGROUND
A3-1. With the increasing concern over the role of coal as the most GHG emission-
intensive form of power generation, any discussion of the use of Afghanistan’s coal
resources for power generation requires caution. The World Bank, which is generally now
unwilling to finance coal projects, concedes that under exceptional circumstances, a case for
coal may be warranted. The World Bank’s screening criteria set out several tests. Two are
especially relevant when undertaking planning studies: for a base-load thermal project in
Afghanistan for which there is no practicable renewable energy alternative, and assuming
gas is not viable at the scale required (discussed in Annex 4):64
      There is a demonstrated developmental impact of the project, including improving
       overall energy security, reducing power shortage or increasing access for the poor.
      After full consideration of viable alternatives to the least cost (including environmental
       externalities) options, and when the additional financing from donors for their
       incremental cost is not available.
A3-2. Given the priority that the Global community gives to Afghanistan’s economic and
social development, and the importance of electricity at a reasonable price and accessible to
all to support these objectives, the question of whether coal-based power generation is a
viable option commands attention. Moreover, the question is not simply one of whether or
not to build a coal-burning power station, but how coal fits into a strategic vision of the
environmentally sustainable evolution of the energy sector. Much coal is already used in
households and industry, where it is burnt inefficiently and without pollution controls,
hence contributing significantly to indoor and urban air pollution. Of course it is true that
gas would be a much cleaner fuel for power generation than coal, but it does not follow that
this would necessarily be the best solution from a local and national environmental point of
view.
A3-3. For example, Afghanistan’s gas could be used not for power generation, but instead
brought to Kabul where it could be used to displace diesel for self-generation, petroleum for
transportation, and coal and fuel wood for heating and cooking. Meanwhile coal could be
used for baseload power generation in modern facilities in relatively remote areas. This
would bring very significant improvements in urban air quality.
A3-4. Afghanistan’s GHG emissions are among the lowest in the world, both in absolute
and in per capita terms (shown in Table A-1.4 above). Afghanistan ranks at the bottom of
the list with emissions less than 0.1 tons CO2/capita, together with four of the poorest
African countries.65 It can be stated with confidence that Afghanistan’s GHG emissions will
remain negligible, even if by 2030 several thousand MW of coal base load capacity were in
operation.66 In short, if there is one place in the world where power generation from coal is
still a reasonable choice, it would be Afghanistan: and this is true regardless of the source of
financing.

64 World Bank, 2010. Criteria for Screening Coal Projects under the Strategic Framework for
Development and Climate Change, Operational Guidance for World Bank Group Staff. According to
the World Bank’s Energy Sector Directions Paper of 2013, the criteria have “effectively seen WBG
financing for coal limited to rare circumstances (pressing needs, no other source of energy available
and no other source of funding for that energy). Since 2013…there has been no lending for
“greenfield? coal-fired power plants?
65   Mali, Chad, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
66 There is much uncertainty about population size. The World Development Indicator (WDI)
database gives the 2010 population as 34.4 million – which value is used in this report unless stated to
the contrary.


April 25, 2016                                                                                   75
A3-5. For these reasons, it is not surprising that successive master plans have proposed
coal as a source of low-cost power generation in Afghanistan. However, none of the past
power sector master plans have examined basic questions about the practical feasibility of
this option: they have simply assumed a large coal burning power plant can be
commissioned by a certain date. The 2004 Norconsult report included an “unlimited coal
scenario? with a 7x 50MW project at Shabashak; the APSMP has a 400 MW coal project in
2027 and 800 MW in 2029 (see Table 2.1, above). In 2011, the China Metallurgical Group
Corporation (GMGC) examined the possibility of a 400MW coal project in Bamyan province
(Ishpushta and Qaleech coalfields) under the terms of the Aynak copper mine concession.
A3-6. To some extent these questions about whether or not coal should or should not be
used for power generation are academic, because there is no assurance that there are
coalfields of the necessary size to support large-scale use. Figure A3-1 maps the known coal
deposits in the country. They have allowed significant coal production, much of which is
used in Kabul. However, much of this mining is artisanal (and outside the control of the
authorities) in nature, for which reliable statistics are simply not available.

A3-7. Some sources suggest recent production of some 800,000 tons/year (Figure A3-2),67
others that similar quantities are exported to Pakistan, which suggests the official figures
are significantly understated. As a yardstick, a 100MW coal-burning power plant would
need some 300,000 tons of coal per year depending on coal quality: see Box A3.1 for more
detail.




67 Commodity production and trade statistics are tabulated based on self-reported numbers. In
countries where economic reporting is reliable, it is possible to accurately estimate production and
trade and to verify these numbers by collecting proxy statistics (e.g. the coal trade can be estimated
based on an assessment of the coal import statistics provided by trading partners in combination with
coal deliveries to export terminals, tax records, and freighter loading records). However, when there
is incentive to obscure these figures by either or both trading partners, it becomes significantly more
difficult to obtain accurate production/trade records.

                             Box A3.1: Coal requirements for power stations
The amount of coal required for a power station depends mainly upon the (1) coal calorific
value, (2) efficiency (and hence heat rate, BTU per kWh), which is a function of the
technology employed, and (3) station own use (a project fitted with flue gas desulfurization
will require more coal than one that is no so fitted). In the table below the lifetime coal
requirement for three typical projects is calculated:
     1.   a 300 MW scale project as recently built by the Chinese at Puttalam, Sri Lanka,
          using Indonesian coal at 5,900 Kcal/Kg
     2.   a 400 MW scale project as likely planned by CGMC , assuming a lower calorific
          value of 5000 Kcal/kg
     3.   a typical small 2 x 50 MW scale project (with lower efficiency than the larger
          projects)

A3-8. CMGC’s 70km2 concession area is about 18km by 4km, wherein it is reported some
200 small coal pits are operating. The stated aim of CMCG’s drilling program was to
identify a resource that could supply 1.5 million tons of coal/year over a 30 year period.
Drilling work began in 2009 and by 2011 it was reported that CMGC had completed 18
boreholes with total drilling length of 5,000 meters. In the western part of the concession,
CMGC predicted 78 million tonnes of coal reserves with another 12 million tonnes in the
east. It now seems that geological work has subsequently been suspended for security
reasons, with only 10% of the planned work completed. How much reliable information
will be provided on the work performed to date is unclear. Some anecdotal reports say that
the results did not meet GMGC’s expectations: there is no information on the status of the
status of the copper concession agreements, and on CMGC‘s current view of the feasibility
of a power generation project.

A3-9. Remote sensing evidence68 indicates and brief field surveys suggest that there may
be coal in the Cretaceous section. These coals are unproven, and their quality and
abundance are unknown. Determining if these coals actually exist will significantly impact
the thermal power generation sector. The Cretaceous section is relatively undeformed, so
Cretaceous coals, if they exist and are thick enough to constitute a resource, will be easier to
mine underground and could potentially be strippable at some localities. For an
explanation of different geological ages, see Figure A3-3.

A3-10. There are places across the North Afghan Platform where the Cretaceous section is
deeply eroded suggesting the possibility that Jurassic sediments are not far below. Inboard
of the outcrop belt, the Jurassic section may not be as severely deformed than further south.
If this is correct, it is possible that there may be virgin Jurassic coals close enough to the
surface to be accessed via shaft mine in some places. If this can be proven, it opens the
possibility of building large scale mechanized mines that can supply sufficient coal for
thermal power plants in the range of 1000 MW or more.
A3-11. In short, the question of whether a coal power generation option is feasible for
implementation in Afghanistan remains subject to high uncertainty. The objective of this
Section is to lay out the basic steps necessary to resolve these uncertainties, which will
require a significant expenditure by the various Government agencies for an exploration
program that will provide the answers.
A3-12. This is another classical example of a decision problem under uncertainty. The
expenditure of $25 million to mount an exploration program may or may not be successful
in establishing a high likelihood of a satisfactory resource. If an adequate resource is found,
the potential benefits of a low cost source of power generation may be very high. Moreover
it reduce the dependence on electricity imports, and free up the domestic gas resource for

petroleum products in Kabul, as discussed in Annex 4.

A3.2     COAL RESERVE ASSESSMENTS
A3-13. Afghanistan has never had a proper coal resource assessment. The earliest coal
availability studies in Afghanistan were made by the Survey of India during the 1880s. The
most extensive subsequent work was done between 1965 and 1974, when the Government
of Afghanistan commissioned V/O Technoexport of the USSR to carry out geologic
mapping studies across large parts of Afghanistan. Virtually all of the detailed information
known about Afghan coal derives from a dozen Technoexport studies that survived the
civil war period. These and other coal reports have been digitized and are available in the
USGS Data Series 317.
A3-14. All of the existing coal investigations were commissioned to answer a single
question: “where can we find mineable coal in Afghanistan?? Because all of these studies
were of limited scope and of short duration, every prospector followed the same
methodology. They looked for new mineable coal beds adjacent to areas where coal had
been found previously. No effort was made to collect the kind of data needed to improve
exploration success such as the stratigraphic information needed to interpret depositional
environments in order to build more effective exploration models. This shortcoming is true
of the Technoexport work as well.
A3-15. The difficulty with this strategy is that prospectors have found more coal that has
the same technical mineability problems that plagues all of the current mining operations:
structurally complex coals that are irregular and of unpredictable thickness. The structural
complexity limits the size of mineable blocks. Faulting moves the mined bed up or down.
In many cases, the movement is great enough that it becomes uneconomic to chase the bed
across the fault. Where this is not the case, the disturbance makes the rocks around the fault
highly unstable making mining conditions more dangerous. Because of the intensity of the
structural disturbance, it is difficult to find areas that have approximately continuous coal
beds that contain enough reserves to justify the expense of building a mechanized mine; 30
years of high volume mining cannot be guaranteed, and without a guaranteed supply of
approximately uniform quality coal it is difficult to finance and engineer thermal power
plants.

Type and Quality of Afghanistan’s Coal
A3-16. According to one report69, Afghan coal consumers are aware that there are
significant differences in coal quality from one mine to the next. Consumers are known to
request purchasing of production from specific mines which they identify by name. Such
specifications are presumably based on their empirical experience with the performance of
different coals when they are burned. Afghanistan has no operating laboratory facilities
(certified or otherwise) capable of conducting a coal quality analysis. Technoexport
established a coal lab at the Afghan Geological Survey (AGS), but much of the equipment
was lost during the civil war period. The instruments that remain are mostly obsolete.
Donors have provided some newer instruments, but the laboratory staff is not trained in
their proper use or procedure, and the available instrumentation cannot provide the full
suite of quality tests needed to properly characterize coal.
A3-17. The majority of the available coal quality data derives from the work of
Technoexport. The analyses were conducted at AGS with a smaller subset of samples sent
to the USSR for quality assurance testing. Samples were properly collected as channel
samples strictly in accordance with standard collection methodologies. Quality testing was
limited to detailed petrographic analyses, proximate/ultimate testing (though complete

results are not typically offered for every sample tested), and (sometimes) determinations of
total sulfur, phosphorus, calorific value, and coking potential. The reasons for such spotty
quality reporting are unknown.
A3-18. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) worked with the AGS to
provide coal quality analyses for coal samples collected from working mines, both artisanal
and those operated by Northern Coal Enterprise (NCE). According to AGS, samples were
collected using standard channel sampling methodology. These samples were shipped to
the United States. Basic coal quality testing was done in commercial labs. USGS labs
provided the trace element analyses.70
A3-19. Before discussing the quality of Afghanistan’s coal, several caveats are required.
Technoexport admitted that many of the samples that it collected were weathered. Analysis
of weathered samples provides some indication of coal characteristics, but, overall, the
results do not provide accurate quality assessments. One needs only to look at the range of
reported heat contents of coal samples collected in the same area from the same bed or from
closely spaced beds. Samples in close proximity sometimes return analyses that range from
lignite equivalent to high volatile bituminous. This is a geologic impossibility if these
samples do indeed come from the same bed. Such results indicate that the “lignite? is really
a highly weathered and degraded bituminous coal. All of the chemical analyses are
impacted by weathering.
A3-20. Analyses of coal from deep mines and core sampling should provide the most
reliable results. Typically, Technoexport reports do not identify where samples were
collected. Sometimes their reports lump trench, pit and adit sample results together,
making it hard to understand the true quality of each coal bed away from the zone of
weathering. Analysis of core samples collected below 80 to 100 meters should yield
definitive analyses. Unfortunately, core recoveries in the coals are often so low (13% in one
case) that the analyses are not representative of the bed, and could, in fact, be significantly
misleading if an anomalous section of the core was the only part recovered.
A3-21. Based on conversations with the AGS geologists that collected the samples sent to
USGS, most of them were reported collected from adits and deeper mines, so the analytical
results should be more reliable. But even in this data set, some of the samples were likely to
have been weathered since some geologists indicated that there was an understandable
reluctance to enter too deeply into unstable adits.
A3-22. A bigger problem with Afghan coal is its ash content. Contents above 30 percent
are not uncommon. Coals above 45 percent ash are considered uneconomic. Much of this
ash occurs as thin clay partings that were deposited in the precursor peat swamp during
flood events. Thicker coals often contain numerous partings, but in places, two to three
meter thick coals are almost parting-free. Such coals have ash contents of under 10 percent.
Since there is no understanding of the environments in which these coals formed, there is
no model to help in the search for low ash coal occurrences. Based on the available
evidence, low ash coals are of limited distribution.
A3-23. Selective underground mining to limit the amount of parting material entering the
production stream is not possible especially given the primitive mining techniques being
employed. A coal washing system will be needed to produce a uniform quality, low ash
product suitable for use in a thermal plant. This will require a significant amount of water,
which could be problematic in places where water is not overly abundant. Wash water will
have to be purified prior to disposal otherwise downstream farms will be very negatively
impacted, particularly during periods of low stream flow when there is little water in the
discharge basin to dilute toxic materials in the wash plant discharge. Alternatively, power

plants can be designed to accommodate high ash coals, but then an environmentally secure
ash disposal facility must be built.
A3-24. Except for the USGS work, nothing is known about the minor and trace element
profiles of Afghan coals. Depending on the specific combustion technology used, coal
boilers can be sensitive to fouling caused by high concentrations of certain elements or
combinations of elements. To some degree, this can be mitigated by the combustion
technology selected, but once a thermal plant is designed, the feedstock that is burned must
conform within the range of the chemical profile that the plant was designed to handle. For
this reason, it is important to have a dedicated coal supplier that delivers a uniform
product. Buying whatever coal happens to be available in the market place at any given
time can have catastrophic consequences for the power plant operations and reliability.

Coal Transportation
A3-25. In the absence of a rail network, the only option in Afghanistan is supply by road. A
100 MW coal power station operating at 75 percent plant factor needs roughly 300,000
tonnes of coal per year (see Box A3.1). A typical coal truck is presumed to carry 40 tonnes,
so to supply this project would require an average of 7,500 loads per year, or 21 trucks a
day. For this reason large coal plants are invariably sited either at the mine-mouth, on the
coast or on a major river where it can be supplied by sea. Over long distances, it is far
cheaper to move coal by wire (i.e. by HVAC or HVDC).

Coal Production Costs
A3-26. Consultants have studied cost structures at NCE, the state owned coal mining
entity. They determined that, for a variety of reasons, NCE has no clear understanding of
its operating costs. NCE is not an autonomous entity. It is an operating division within the
Minstry of Mines and Petroleum (MOMP) and is subject to MOMP procurement
regulations. Purchases of mine supplies are handled at the Ministerial level. Purchases
may or may not be handled in a timely manner and may or may not be for the full
requisition amount depending on the state of Ministry finances.
A3-27. The cost of NCE coal is set by the national government based on presumed fixed
costs (salary, operating budgets and mine technical budgets). These operational costs are
routinely underestimated by a factor of two or more. NCE coal is sold (regardless of
quality) for Af2100 per ton ($35 per ton). This cost is significantly below current world coal
prices (current Australian coal exported in the Asia-Pacific market is around $60/ton). To
partially compensate for cost overruns, certain operational costs are being passed on to
customers. These include transportation costs and customs duties. Payment to miners is
also off loaded to the coal buyers both to minimize operational cost overruns and to reduce
threat of attacks on the mines because the majority of the mines are in insecure areas. The
mine operators find it too dangerous to keep cash on hand to pay laborers.
A3-28. NCE does not employ miners directly; therefore miners do not benefit from the
worker protections that accrue to permanent employees of NCE. Miners are contract labor
hired from the surrounding villages. They are not professional miners and have no
underground experience. All learning is on-the-job. Workers must supply their own tools.
Minimal safety equipment may be provided (hard hats and dust masks), but ventilation and
lighting are poor. Safety statistics are not kept, but anecdotal reports indicate a high rate of
injury and death. Mine crews are hired in groups of 6 to 10 individuals per crew.
Customary payment is Af400 per ton of coal mined in mechanized mines (though it is not
clear what constitutes a mechanized mine since mechanization in the western sense is not
currently known in Afghanistan. Miners in semi-mechanized mines are paid Af500 per ton
and, in un-mechanized mines, miners are paid Af600 per ton.
A3-29. Artisanal/extra-legal mine operators are almost certainly knowledgeable of their
operating costs, but there has never been an assessment of mining costs or coal sales price
from any of these operations. In all likelihood, these are the most efficiently run mines, so


April 25, 2016                                                                           81
their cost structures most nearly reflect true market conditions. However, one might
anticipate that worker protections are minimal in these private enterprises, thus potentially
contributing to below market costs for coal mining.

A3.3     THE TIMELINE AND COST OF MINE CONSTRUCTION
A3-30. Estimating the time and cost of building a coal mine of a size sufficient to support a
large scale coal-burning power plant is subject to high uncertainty. Unlike other coal fields
with producing coal mines, as of today the nature of the coal resource in Afghanistan is
completely unknown. In a developed coal field, sufficient exploration and development has
occurred, such that prospective new mine developers have some basic understanding
whether or not a prospective mine lease block has a reasonable probability of containing
sufficient coal to support a mining operation. As a result, the time and dollar cost of
exploration and the exploration risk itself is greatly reduced. Only a few holes will be
needed to determine if a block is likely to contain a mineable resource.
A3-31. This does not hold in Afghanistan. The location of a mineable tract is a major
undertaking that could take years and cost tens of millions of dollars, because, to a large
degree, holes are being drilled at random until a mineable occurrence is encountered. The
CGMC exploration effort at Ishpushta and Qaleech coalfields exemplifies this approach.
The background information needed to zero-in on a mineable block quickly does not exist,
so exploration success depends on luck. Perhaps the first hole will identify a potential
deposit (assuming it can be found at all), but it is equally possible that 10 or 20 holes will be
required to find that deposit. Mine planning and costing cannot begin until that deposit is
found and defined by drilling. Over time, as information from such wildcat exploration
holes accumulates, geologists will be better able to define the geometry of the coal bed
distribution, exploration success will improve, and exploration time requirements will
decline.
A3-32. A typical timeline for mine development is shown in Figure A3-4. One can say
with certainty that this would be the lower bound for mine development in Afghanistan:
Given that a comprehensive program of exploration drilling would unlikely be put in place
before 2017, the earliest possible date for a coal project of this size would be 2025.
                       Figure A3-4:     The timeline for mine development




A3-33. In other words, for the large coal projects to be built to the timetable proposed by
the APSMP – namely a 400MW unit to be in place by 2027 followed by another 800 MW in
2029 – a comprehensive coal exploration programme must be started as soon as possible.
A3-34. It is conceivable that one could begin much sooner by importing coal for the first
few years (see Box A3.2) until a large scale domestic mine has been developed. This option
can safely be rejected, not merely on grounds of the precarious supply chain and unknown
future costs of imported coal, or on the energy security aspects, but on practical grounds of
finance. It will be difficult enough to finance a mine-mouth coal IPP in Afghanistan even
with bankable coal supply and power off-take agreements, but with an imported coal

supply chain even for the first few years such a project becomes impossible. A public project
would be equally difficult to finance. In any event, a mine-mouth location for the coal
project would depend upon the ultimate coal mine area to be known at time of financial
closure.
                                          Box A3.2: Imported Coal
Could imported coal be used in Afghanistan? As of April 2015, Australian steam coal cost
$62/tonne FOB. In July 2008 steam coal peaked at $192/tonne. Bulk shipping costs are
currently at an all-time low, about $10 per tonne for a Capesize vessel, even more for smaller
boats. During periods of peak cost, shipping rates as great as $50 to $70/tonne were charged.

The logical port of import would be Gwadar (a port newly developed expressly to better serve
Western and Northern Pakistan as well as Afghanistan as alternatives to Karachi and Port
Qasim). Trucking costs from Gwadar to Kabul are highly uncertain: based on older trucking
rates adjusted for inflation, these probably now range in the $25 to $50/tonne range. The costs
of customs and duties along the transit route are unknown, but it would be wise to add
another $10 to $20 per tonne.
Thus at current prices, Australian thermal coal 6,000 kcal/kg low ash, low sulfur coal can be
delivered to Kabul for perhaps $110 per tonne. At costs prevailing in 2008 (at the height of the
speculative commodity boom), the same coal delivery would have cost potentially as much as
$250 per tonne or more.

A3-35. While it is conceivable that a mineral mining concessionaire would build a power
plant for his own-use (or do a deal with a power IPP to build and operate one for him), the
reverse is not true: an IPP will not undertake a coal mining development to supply a coal
project unless the coal resource is proven.
A3-36. There is an alternative strategy that could be used to locate suitable coal resources.
The entire exploration process could be turned over to the private sector, at least for a time
until AGS coal exploration capabilities are strengthened. Unfortunately, the current Mining
Law is such that no private sector mining company will take on the exploration risk,
because it does not guarantee development rights to the exploration company at the time of
discovery. Unless the exploration contract specifically allows seamless development rights
on the exploration lease by eliminating the legal requirement to offer the explored property
to open tender for development, it will be impossible for exploration companies to get
exploration financing.
A3-37. In short, the realistic options for the Government are:
    Modify the Mining Law to encourage junior coal companies to assume the mining risk.
    Hope that if the CMGC development does not proceed as previously expected, that
     some other mining concessionaire would develop a coal power project.
    Assume the exploration risk itself.
A3-38. This last option is examined in the following section.




April 25, 2016                                                                                     83
A3.4     STRUCTURING A GOVERNMENT EXPLORATION PROGRAM
A3-39. In the expectation that the Afghan Government chooses not to change how the
current Mining Law is implemented as it relates to coal, strengthening the capabilities of the
AGS to conduct coal exploration is the only option available to the government to promote
mine development on the scale needed to power a thermal power plant. Furthermore, even
if the Government were to allow contractual exceptions to the mining law, strengthening
AGS exploration capabilities is to its advantage. The more information that the
Government provides to bidders during lease auctions, the more bidders are willing to pay
for the leases because exploration risk is reduced.
A3-40. The Technoexport coal resource assessment is almost 50 years old. During their
investigations, Technoexport and AGS geologists identified significant areas that were
potentially coal-bearing. Since the Technoexport assessment, there have been no follow-up
studies. Local artisanal miners have used the same techniques used by Technoexport to
locate coal beds and mine them. Thus, some unknown portion of the reserves identified by
Technoexport have now been extracted or spoiled for further mining. New reserves must
be found to replace these, if a coal industry capable of supplying thermal power generation
is to be established.
A3-41. National geological surveys like AGS ordinarily have responsibility for finding
areas that have a demonstrated coal potential. Prospective areas identified by AGS would
then be tendered to the private sector for further exploration and possible development.
Because of the extended conflict, AGS has lost the capability to carry out coal exploration
work. These capabilities must be rebuilt before the AGS can again become effective in
finding coal.
A3-42. Technoexport executed its coal outcrop exploration plan well. Over the following
five decades, AGS and knowledgeable locals used the same exploration strategies to locate
additional coal occurrences. There is a strong likelihood that additional coal outcroppings
remain to be discovered. However, these will all have the same characteristics as known
coal deposits – they will be highly deformed and difficult to mine. The search for less
deformed deposits will require a new exploration strategy, one that relies on drilling to
evaluate subsurface coal beds inboard of the outcrop belt.
A3-43. Afghanistan does not have indigenous private sector drilling capability able to
attain the depths required for coal exploration. Furthermore, since the Mining Law is
unattractive to the junior mining industry, there is little likelihood that small exploration
companies will come to Afghanistan, so there will be little work to sustain an Afghan
contract drilling company. Under the prevailing conditions, AGS capability for exploration
drilling must be rebuilt. This will entail:
   Supplying AGS with effective drilling equipment.
   Training the AGS drillers to use it.
   Supplying borehole geophysical logging equipment.
   Training AGS professionals to operate the equipment and interpret the resulting data.
   Ensuring that the AGS drilling group has an adequate budget to regularly purchase
    repair parts and consumable supplies.

A3.5     THE COST OF EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Drilling Costs
A3-44. Coring costs for shallow holes at current market rates generally average between
$100 and $200 per meter. Rotary rates are lower. Thus, a 400 m deep hole cored for its entire
length will cost somewhere between $40,000 and $80,000, plus the cost of mobilization,
demobilization and any rig downtime that may accrue. Since it may not be possible to
contract for geophysical logging services in Afghanistan, the cost of purchasing, training,
operating and maintaining logging capabilities (which are essential) will be additional.



April 25, 2016                                                                         84
With mobilization and demobilization and rig downtime costs, it should be possible to drill
a dozen coal exploration holes for $1-2 million.
A3-45. CBM test holes, because they are drilled to greater depths, are considerably more
expensive. Exploration holes are likely to cost $600,000 to $1,400,000 each though recently
developed technologies may reduce these costs. These new small hole-diameter drilling
technologies will require the purchase of specialized drilling equipment and geophysical
logging tools specifically adapted for use with small diameter holes.
A3-46. Once regional stratigraphy is better understood, coring will be limited to the coal-
bearing interval. Less expensive rotary drilling will be used for the barren parts of the
section thus reducing costs per hole. In this scenario, geophysical logging will become an
even more critical requirement.

The Cost of Providing AGS with Drilling Capability
A3-47. There are many variables involved in budgeting the cost of acquiring relatively
standard drilling equipment and delivering it to Afghanistan. The budget defined below
should be regarded as a general indication of the range of expenses that might be incurred
in developing drilling capability in AGS. Major equipment purchases are negotiated with
the manufacturer at the time of purchase because equipment configurations and capabilities
are not designed until then. Because of the small number of industry participants and the
intensity of the competition between them, price structures and purchase incentives are
regarded as highly proprietary so what follows is a best estimate which will be modified by
the level of global demand and suppliers’ perceptions of market conditio ns in Afghanistan
at the time of procurement.
A3-48. The range of costs of providing a drilling capability to AGS will be:
          A used track mounted self-contained drill rig capable of NX to HQ71 coring to
           depths of 1,200 m: $250,000 - $300,000.
          A truck mounted drill rig capable of reaching maximum CBM development depths
           (2200 m) with a production diameter drill hole. Three rigs with this capability were
           in the possession of the U.S. Army in Afghanistan as of 2012 but they have since
           been returned to the United States: $850,000 - $1,000,000.
          Drill rig down-time is expensive and can lead to the loss of the hole and all
           downhole equipment (rods, bits, core barrels etc.).          Ordinarily such large
           inventories of spare parts are unnecessary because (a) parts are easily acquired from
           suppliers and (b) because companies have the cash flow to purchase these parts as
           needed. Neither situation applies to AGS. Parts will be unavailable in Afghanistan
           and AGS does not have the budget resources to purchase them: $2,000,000 – $
           5,000,000.
          Consumables. This includes things like drill bits, muds, polymer muds, batteries,
           hydraulic fluid, lubrication oil and grease, fuel: .$1,500,000 – $3,000,000.
          Geophysical logging truck equipped with gamma-gamma density tool (radioactive
           source), neutron log (radioactive source), gamma log, 3-arm caliper, resistivity log,
           sonic log, lateral log, and inclinometer. Other probes may also be desired: $500,000
           - $2,000,000.
          Two years on-the job training in geophysical logging, truck operations and
           equipment maintenance: $750,000 - $1,250,000.
          Three years on-the job training for drillers: $750,000 - $1,250,000.
          Self-contained drilling base camp facility: $500,000 - $1,000,000.



71   Coring drill sizes are designated by two letters. NX is 2.9 inch outside diameter and HQ is 3.7 inch
           outside diameter.



April 25, 2016                                                                                    85
        All of the equipment and supplies need to be shipped to Afghanistan which will
         include a complex chain of road, rail and ocean shipping as well as duties and taxes
         that may be assessed at various points along the way: $1,000,000 - $2,000,000.
        Security costs. Drill camps are fixed installations that may be stationary for months
         at a time. These need to be protected in hostile environments: $1,000,000 –
         4,000,000.
        Rig mobilization and demobilization costs: $1,500,000 – $3,000,000.
A3-49. Thus the total cost to create a 3-5 year sustainable drilling capability at AGS will be
between $10.6 and $23.8 million.

Mining Coal
A3-50. The next big uncertainty is the kind of mine that is to be built. Mines fall into three
general categories: underground adit; underground shaft; or open cast. Currently, all coal
mines in Afghanistan are adit mines that enter the coal bed at the point where the bed is
exposed at the surface. Adit mines are less expensive to build, because coal production
starts almost from the first shovel dug to start mine construction. If bed characteristics are
favorable, with uniform thickness, good roof conditions and little structural complication,
these mines can be built out at low cost and employ more productive mining techniques
such as long-wall rather than the room and pillar method used in underground mines with
more difficult conditions. Long-walls are initially expensive to build because a single long-
wall machine can cost $10 million to $20 million or more. A small long-wall mine can
probably be built for $25 million to $30 million. Because of the large capital cost involved in
designing a long-wall, small volume mining operations like those supplying a 100 MW
power plant requiring about 300,000 tonnes of coal per year are not likely to be cost effective
on a cost per tonne mined basis.
A3-51. A 1,000 tonne per day (TPD) mine, about what is needed for a 100MW power plant,
using room and pillar design in the outcrop belt accessed by adit portal would cost between
$26 million and $46 million broken down as follows:
   Two continuous mining machines: $1 million to $2 million.
   One 1km long conveyer system: $3 million.
   Rock bolting rigs: $1 million to $2 million.
   Muckers, water pumps, ventilation system, haulers and other ancillaries: $2 million to
    $3 million.
   Spare parts and supplies: $3 million to $5 million.
   Construction of a shaft or incline if coal is not exposed at outcrop: $2 million to $4
    million.
   Coal washing plant for minimal preparation level: $3 million to $5 million.
   Engineer and construct earthquake resistant tailings pond: $5 million to $10 million
    (though depending on capacity requirements, this may be significantly more).
   Water treatment facility if needed: $5 million to $10 million (this may also vary
    depending on volume of water needed).
   Environmental reclamation bond: $1 million to $2 million.
A3-52. Shaft mines are expensive to build. These are necessary when the coal to be mined
does not outcrop at the surface and a shaft has to be dug to reach it. There will be no coal
production during the entire construction process. For safety reasons, a second escape shaft
must also be built. Shafts can be vertical or inclined and, if coals are deep, can easily exceed
a kilometer in length. Since the shaft is the only point of access, the structure must be
highly reinforced, so that there is minimal risk of collapse. Engineering and building a shaft
or incline will cost several million dollars.
A3-53. Open cast mines can be inexpensive. If coal is near the surface and overburden is
thin, $1 million to $3 million may be sufficient to buy the equipment necessary to remove
overburden and mine the coal. Costs mount in proportion to the size and complexity of the


April 25, 2016                                                                           86
open cast. More complex open cast mines capable of producing 5,000 TPD are estimated to
cost $20 million to build in developed mining areas. Costs for the same facility in
Afghanistan would be higher. Given the observed conditions in Afghanistan, coals near
enough to the surface to mine with such simple mining systems may very well be of
degraded quality, and not really economic to mine.
A3-54. Given Afghanistan’s geology as it is presently understood, unless there are
significant Cretaceous coal reserves waiting to be discovered, it is unlikely that there are
many areas where open cast mining will be possible. Even in the Cretaceous, most mining
will be underground.
A3-55. Environmental compliance of the surface footprint of the mining operation will
incur additional cost, especially for spoil disposal, waste water control, and tailings pond
engineering. Since the environmental compliance regulations have not been defined for the
mining industry, estimating these costs is much more speculative. Because the Jurassic coal
outcrop belt is on the fringes of one of the most seismically intense zones in the world, the
mines themselves and engineered structures like spoils piles and especially tailings disposal
facilities will have to meet high earthquake resistance standards. Otherwise the risk will be
serious of downstream contamination by acid rock drainage from the mines or of the release
of toxic materials from the tailings ponds due to earthquake damage.                  Seismic
considerations will add to engineering costs.
A3-56. It must be emphasized that the cost estimates presented here are generalized and
speculative based on experience of the different possible mining scenarios in Afghanistan.
Much more information will be needed to estimate costs more realistically. The assumption
is made that new equipment will be preferred over used equipment, because used
equipment maintenance costs will necessarily be higher. Because there is no functioning
repair or replacement infrastructure in Afghanistan, it will be critical to maintain a major
parts inventory until a supply chain is developed. Otherwise economic losses due to non-
production while waiting for parts to be imported will be prohibitive and could potentially
impact power plant operations.
A3-57. The cost estimates made here assume that protecting the miner from injury is a
primary consideration. Costs can be reduced significantly by reducing the degree of
mechanization in the mine, and using more miners to do the physical excavation of the coal
using 19th century techniques. This is a values choice that will have to be made by the
Afghan Government.

Other Data Needs
A3-58. Since it is considered illegal, it has been difficult to study private sector coal mining
activities in Afghanistan.      The following information would be useful in better
understanding the coal market in Afghanistan and the potential dislocations that
introduction of a major new consumer of coal (a power plant) may have on other parts of
the national coal market:
   Cost structures in private sector mines.
   Organization of the coal transportation networks.
   The quality of the coal being sold in the Afghan markets.
   The uses for coal in Afghanistan.

A3.6     ALTERNATIVES TO COAL AS A SOLID FUEL

Coal Bed Methane
A3-59. In planning its energy mix, Afghanistan’s focus on coal has been exclusively from
the perspective of coal as a solid fuel. Coal has always been known to contain significant
amounts of methane. Historically, the methane was regarded as a dangerous by-product
that poisoned miners and caused mines to explode. By the early 1980s, the energy
exploration community realized that improvements in oil-well stimulation technology


April 25, 2016                                                                           87
(fracking) could also be applied to coal beds to accelerate the release of the contained
methane known as coal bed methane (CBM).
A3-60. CBM production depends on the rank and the porosity of the coal. Mid to low
volatile bituminous coals contain the most methane, but even lignite deposits contain
economic concentrations of gas. Currently, the deepest economic CBM wells are 2200 m.
Methane is still abundant in more deeply buried coals, but the rate of methane extraction is
not economic. However, over geologic time, even such deeply buried coals will release
methane. If the coal beds are covered by suitable trap and reservoir rocks, these coal beds
will act as source rocks for vast “conventional? gas deposits.
A3-61. Afghanistan’s Jurassic coals are regionally extensive. Jurassic coals are known as
far north as southern Russia, Georgia to the west and Kyrgyzstan to the east. Seventy five
percent of Turkmenistan’s gas deposits, more than half of Uzbekistan’s and a significant
proportion of Afghanistan’ are known to be sourced from the same coals that are being
mined in the Jurassic outcrop belt. Given the documented distribution of Jurassic coals
across the region, there is every possibility that much of Afghanistan north of the Herat
River is underlain by Jurassic coal. There is a lesser possibility that this same area may also
be underlain by important Triassic coal deposits and an even more remote possibility that
there may be Mississippian coal occurrences below these. If these speculations are correct,
there may be deep conventional gas reservoirs in many places across northern Afghanistan
in addition to CBM plays.
A3-62. No deep test holes have ever been drilled anywhere on the North Afghan Platform.
Until exploration test holes are drilled, the potential cannot be known. Ideally 6 to 10 holes
should be drilled at carefully selected locations across the Platform to test for deposits.
Because at present no detailed understanding of the regional stratigraphy is available, these
early holes should be drilled as core holes. These early exploration holes will test two other
geologic possibilities besides the CBM potential:
   The possibility that conventionally mineable Cretaceous coals exist, and
   The possibility that virgin, conventionally mineable shaft accessible Jurassic coals can be
    found inboard of the outcrop belt.
A3-63. In general, the best CBM wells occur in coals that are too deep to mine, so they
develop an energy resource that would otherwise be unproductive. Economic CBM wells
can contain reserves that range between 0.5 Bcf and 10 Bcf gas per well. The gas is sweet
(contains no hydrogen sulfide) and tends to be low in impurities, though the percentage of
carbon dioxide is variable and can be quite high. Ordinarily, the gas can be processed at the
well site into a product suitable for use in a gas fueled distributed power generation system
to supply electricity at the village level. Waste water, if it is unsuitable for agricultural use,
can be disposed in an on-site reinjection well.

The cost of a CBM Project
A3-64. The amount of exploration conducted and infrastructure put in place to create a
generation capacity able to supply local users depends entirely on the productivity of each
well and the number of wells that have to be drilled to define the required reserves. Sample
costs are likely to be as follows:
   $5 million to develop a five well field with an on-site gas separation facility and
    wastewater disposal. The exploration success ratio is assumed to be 20%: the result is
    assumed to be one producing well with an average production of 800 Mcf/day. This is
    adjusted for the assumed 1.6 Afghanistan premium.
   $0.30/Mcf for gas treatment (primarily CO2 removal) and compression costs.
   $37,000 to $50,000 per km gas transmission infrastructure construction: the calculation
    below assumes 10km @ $50,000/km x (1.6 Afghanistan multiplier) =$800,000.
Table A3-1 shows the estimated levelized cost of gas based on these figures and a typical
production pattern of a gradual increase over first few years, followed by gradual decline as


April 25, 2016                                                                             88
shown in row [1] of the table. An average production of 800 Mcf/day over 20 years is
assumed, in line with the average production in US CBM wells. The resulting $7.5/mmBTU
is significantly higher than the likely cost of gas from the large fields in the Sheberghan
area. However, for rural application in remote areas, the competing fuel is diesel, which
even at $40/bbl world crude oil price is around $15/mmBTU (delivered in rural areas).

Geothermal Potential
A3-65. There are several active volcanic systems near Afghanistan’s borders. Tor Zawar,
475 km SSW of Kabul in Pakistan experienced a fissure eruption in 2010 and Koh-e-Taftan
near to the juncture of the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Iran borders is reported to have had a lava
flow in 1993. Other volcanoes in these border areas have been dated as active within the
past 10,000 years. Afghanistan has three volcanoes that are classified geologically active, but
dormant. Kaneshin last erupted 620,000 years ago and Vakak (120 km west of Kabul) and
Dasht-e-Nawar (160 km SE of Kabul) erupted within the past 10,000 years. Of these, Dasht-
e-Nawar is considered the most prospective geothermal site in Afghanistan. It is a 20 km
long, 10 km wide volcanic caldera. Remote sensing studies and site visits to this location
confirm that there are flowing hot springs along its entire western margin. If this site has no
geothermal potential, then Afghanistan’s other hot springs are less promising candidates.
A3-66. A substantial number of warm water and hot water springs are known across
Afghanistan, first documented by Technoexport. More recently, their potential as
geothermal resources have been considered.72. None of these springs have ever been tested
as potential energy resources. The presence of hot springs is not definitively indicative of
geothermal potential. It is entirely possible that the magmatic systems that warm these
waters have cooled below the temperature needed to efficiently power a geothermal plant.
The geothermal potential should not be discounted out of hand. Drilling a geothermal test
well will cost about the same as a deep CBM test well.

Shale Gas Potential
A3-67. It will likely be a long time before Afghanistan is in a position to develop any shale
gas potential it may have. When Afghanistan was being mapped in the 60s and 70s, the
technology to develop shale gas did not exist, so the stratigraphic studies needed to identify
potential shale gas reservoirs were not conducted. However, for the same reasons that
Afghanistan’s coal potential is much greater than surface evidence would indicate, there is a
significant possibility that Afghanistan hosts shale gas deposits.           Future geologic
investigations should include a search for evidence that such a resource exists.

A3.7     DECISION ANALYSIS
A3-68. The reality is that without confirmation of the coal resource, one cannot realize the
future benefits of coal generation. Compared to the cost of imported electricity, even the
most pessimistic assumptions about the cost of setting up a coal mine, and about the
construction cost of the coal generating plant, shows a very large benefit. Table A3-2 shows
a calculation of the cost of electricity imports under different sets of assumption ranging
from 7.5 to 9.5 US¢/kWh as the PPA price, plus the incremental cost of transmission,
compared with a 100 MW coal project again under different assumptions from a favorable
capital cost of $1,000/kW to an unfavorable cost of $1,400/kW. All the capital costs (coal
mine, transmission and coal generating plant capital costs are adjusted for a (pessimistic)
Afghanistan cost premium of 60%.
A3-69. The levelized cost of electricity imports is between 9.1 and 12.7 US¢/kWh, whereas
that for coal generation from 5.0 to 7.5 US¢/kWh. In other words, even under the most
optimistic assumptions for electricity imports, and the most pessimistic assumptions for the
cost of coal generation, coal generation would be preferred over imports.

A3-70. The decision problem is straightforward: given the uncertainties of the outcome of
an exploration program, what is the maximum amount that the Government should invest
today in an exploration program? This should obviously be less than the expected value of
future benefits of having coal available as an option to meet base-load requirements.

             A3-71. Table A3-3 shows the net economic benefit, as NPV at 10 percent discount rate. For
             example, under expected conditions for imports, the NPV is $676 million (from Table A3-2);
             under expected conditions for coal projects, the NPV is $384 million. Therefore, the net
             benefit of coal is $292 million73

             A3-72. The calculation has to take into account that the costs of the exploration program
             are required today, whereas the benefits will only be realized in the future: even if the
             exploration program is successful, as shown in Figure 5.4, there will be a time lag between
             the demonstration of the resource and the earliest date that coal can be produced. In this
             analysis the following assumptions are made:
                   Funds for the AGS program committed: 2016.
                   AGS exploration program begins: 2017.
                   A potential resource identified: 2019.
                   Financial closure of the project: 2021.
                   Construction time: 3 years, COD 2024.
             A3-73. In other words, the NPVs shown in Table A3-3 are to the beginning of 2024, and
             must be brought back to the NPV in 2016, at which point they can be compared to the
             outlay required in 2016 for the proposed AGS exploration program. It is also the case that
             the outcome of the exploration program has potentially many outcomes: there may be no
             coal at all (of sufficient size for a 100 MW project) – but there may also be enough coal for
             1,000 MW or more.
             A3-74. Table A3-4 shows the calculations necessary to assess the NPV of the AGS
             exploration program in the existing coal areas. In row [1] appears the estimated costs of the
             program: these costs are certain. Row [3] shows that the probability that the exploration
             program is wholly unsuccessful is 5% - it contributes nothing to the expected NPV. Row [4]
             shows the outcome as finding just enough coal for a single 100 MW project as 25%. The
             benefits is realized only in 2024 – which under the most pessimistic circumstances yields a
             net benefit of just $101million (in 2024). When this is discounted back to 2016, and
             multiplied by the 25% probability, the contribution to NPV is $10.8 million.

                A3-75. The chances of finding enough coal for 400 MW is 50%. It is assumed that the first
                project would still be 100MW, but that two years thereafter a 300MW project is built,
                recognizing the difficulties of financing large projects. Therefore the net benefit will be 3 x
                102=$305 million; another conservative assumption since scale economies would reduce the
                capital costs per kW assumed in Table A3-2. This calculation is repeated for the other
                exploration outcomes, from which the total expected NPV, including the upfront costs of
                the AGS program is $112 million. Under the expected net benefits of coal power generation
                v. imports, $292 million (see the entry in Table A3-3), the NPV of the AGS program is $365
                million.
                A3-76. The robustness of this AGS program NPV can be tested by calculation of the
                switching value for the probability of no coal being found. 74 This calculates to 83 percent
                (see Table A3-5) for the most unfavorable benefit of coal generation (i.e. under a favorable
                cost of future imports and unfavorable costs of the coal project.75 In other words, the
                probability of finding enough coal for a 100 MW project would have to be 17 percent or less
                for the exploration program to have negative returns. This can be regarded as extremely
                unlikely.

                A3-77. Thus it is seen that under the most pessimistic outcomes for the cost of coal
                generating projects relative to imports, the expected NPV for an exploration program in the
                known areas of coal resources, is $112 million; under expected conditions of coal generating
                costs and imports, the NPV is $369 million. Potential benefits of this magnitude warrant
                immediate implementation of the proposed AGS program.
                A3-78. These results apply just to an AGS program limited to the known coal areas in
                Afghanistan. In a second phase, the program could be extended to the deep coal North
                Afghan Platform, in which case Table A3-4 extends as shown in Table A3-6. The expected
                NPV of the combined program under worst case conditions (unfavorable coal generation
                costs, low import costs) is $248.7 million; for expected conditions, this rises to $760 million.

                75One may also note that the probabilities of import costs and of costs of a coal generation project are
                independent of the probability of exploration success: in other words, even if electricity imports were
                cheap, and coal generation projects expensive, one could still have a good outcome in the exploration
                program.

                     A3.8       CONCLUSIONS
                     A3-79. The use of coal for power generation is in principle an attractive option for
                     Afghanistan, but until the resources to fuel these options are identified, mine and power
                     plant planning are premature. Nobody knows exactly where the coal resources needed to
                     fuel either of these options might be located. A concerted exploration effort will be needed
                     to answer this question, the importance of which should not be underestimated. When
                     Aynak was initially offered for tender around 2006, one of the main impediments to
                     negotiating the final agreement was identifying an adequate source of coal to fuel power
                     plant needed to provide electricity to operate the mine. A decade later, Afghanistan still has
                     no answer to this question. There are only two options to answer the question of resource
                     availability: either the private sector explores for and develops the resources it needs, or the
                     public sector funds the exploration and then either develops the resource itself, or auctions
                     the proven resource.
                     A3-80. The current Mining Law is so unfavorable to private sector participation that no
                     exploration Junior could ever be financed by international investors to pursue projects in
                     Afghanistan. Thus, the only option open to the Afghan Government is to self-finance to do
                     the exploration work itself. Several of these actions are low cost options and can be taken
                     immediately to start the exploration process. Others are more expensive, but must occur if
                     Afghanistan expects to seriously develop its coal resource potential.
                     A3-81. Given that the private sector will avoid participating in exploration under the
                     current Mining Law, if the Afghan Government has a serious intent to locate developable
                     coal resources, the following recommendations are made:
                           The Afghanistan Geological Survey is the de facto exploration arm of the Afghan
                            Government. A permanent AGS coal team needs to be constituted. It will require up to
                            three years of intensive training and practical on-the-job –training to become fully
                            operational and effective.      It will require A highly experienced coal exploration
                            geologist with a proven track record of coal discovery should be retained to provide
                            this training. Training in coal geology field methods is critical. Given current security



                     April 25, 2016                                                                            93
     considerations in the coal fields, to be effective this training may need to be provided in
     3rd country venues.
    AGS needs to compile all of the existing coal data into modern digital data files.
     Gathering and including coal geology data from NCE mines will provide important
     information about coal bed geometry needed for resource assessments. Within the
     Afghan Government, NCE has the best understanding of the geologic conditions
     underground and hence it can make an important contribution to the NCE in the coal
     resource assessment process. Representative samples of coal for sale in marketplaces
     across Afghanistan should be collected to get a basic understanding of the quality of
     coal currently offered for sale and to learn more about its origin.
    Until AGS has the ability to conduct required analyses in house, a budget to pay for
     critical laboratory work outside Afghanistan is essential. The AGS coal team will also
     need a reliable field budget. The AGS coal geology team, working with its international
     trainer must lay out a wildcat coal exploration program based on the best available
     geologic information. With training, the AGS Coal Team can begin collecting essential
     stratigraphic and sedimentological data needed to understand depositional
     environments. These data are an essential input for developing more successful
     exploration strategies.
    Afghanistan needs to develop an effective drilling capability, requiring suitable drilling
     equipment to be purchased, together with an adequate inventory of spare parts and
     consumables.76 Drillers need to be trained by an experienced master driller retained for
     a minimum of three years. A dedicated budget to pay for labor, field expenses, rig
     mobilization, and consumables must be consistently allocated. The AGS drill team,
     working with their international trainer needs to drill the targets identified by the coal
     geology team. Once initial discoveries are made, prospects can be better defined with
     additional drilling or blocks can be offered for development tender. A geothermal test
     hole can be drilled at Dasht-e-Nawar.
A3-82. The analysis demonstrates that the expected value of future benefits far outweighs
the upfront costs of the exploration program. Under the most pessimistic outcomes for the
cost of coal generating projects relative to imports, the expected NPV for an exploration
program in the known areas of coal resources, is $112million; under expected conditions of
coal generating costs and imports, the NPV is $369million.        Potential benefits of this
magnitude warrant immediate implementation of the proposed AGS program. Indeed, if
extended to the presently unexplored areas of the deep coal north Afghan Plateau, the NPV
rises by $762 million. It also follows that even if the AGS program proved to be 2-3 times
more expensive than estimated here, the benefits remain very high indeed.




76 Note that fully training an AGS coal exploration team but not providing it with the required
exploration tools (the capability to drill) will not shift the status quo. At best, the AGS might be able
to demonstrate the presence of Cretaceous coals using surface field methodologies, but no meaningful
description of coal bed geometry needed for resource evaluation will be possible without drilling.

ANNEX 4 – CASE STUDY: THERMAL GENERATION OPTIONS

A4.1 BACKGROUND
A4-1. Both coal and gas generation feature prominently in the APSMP scenarios. A gas
CCGT at Sheberghan appears at 400 MW scale in most of the APSMP Addendum scenarios
with a commercial operation date (COD) of 2020, and coal generation appears in the
original APSMP at 400 MW at Aynak, and another 800 MW at Haji Gak 77, both at
$1,700/kW, albeit with the qualification that “It is unknown if the necessary coal reserves
exist in Afghanistan?. In the APSMP Addendum there appears just a single 400 MW project
at Bamyan (equivalent to Aynak, since the CMGC concession includes coal mining at
Bamyan). Exploitation of the gas reserves has attracted most attention, including several
studies that examine uses other than for power generation, including exports, and a gas
pipeline to Kabul where gas would displace diesel fuel.
A4-2. While the gas project has been considered for many years, decisions have been
delayed as a result of continuing uncertainty over the actual size of the resource, the
appropriate technology to be applied if gas were to be used on a large scale for electricity
generation, and the ability to finance a project as an IPP. Most recently there is a proposal
for a 50MW gas engine IPP project in Mazar, to be supplied by a refurbished gas pipeline
from the Sheberghan gas field.

A4.2 THE GAS RESOURCE
The prospects for gas production in Northern Afghanistan have been reviewed by
consultants.78 Table A4-1 shows the consultant’s estimate of remaining reserves (as of 2003)
to be 77.4 billion cubic meters (BCM). By contrast the reserves in Uzbekistan are estimated
to be some 1,900 BCM, and those of Turkmenistan to be 8,000 BCM.79

79Turkmenistan is the major producer and exporter of natural gas in the region, producing some 76
BCM of natural gas in 2014, of which 45BCM was exported. In 2015, production is expected to
increase to 80 BCM, according to figures from the Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ministry. Most of
Turkmen gas exports go to China through the Central Asia-China gas pipeline, which is currently able
to handle as much as 55 BCM of gas per year. The CASA-1000 study quotes the gas reserves of
Uzbekistan at 66 Tcf, and of Turkmenistan 280 Tcf. Turkmenistan is becoming a major supplier of
natural gas into China.

The table shows the conversion between $/mmBTU and $/MCM for a

A4-3. The review concludes that the amount of gas-fired power generation that will be
installed in Northern Afghanistan depends crucially on whether or not further exploration
of these two basins occurs, and if so, on the degree of exploration success. If there is very
limited exploration success, then there could be enough gas supplies from previously
discovered fields to meet limited gas needs and power demand in Northern Afghanistan
alone. If there is exploration success only in the Afghan-Tajik basin then about 200 MW of
power could be available for export from the region to other parts of Afghanistan or
internationally in about ten years. With substantial exploration success in the Amu Darya
basin, then power generation in the region could be as high as 1,000 MW. There are likely
to be challenges in coordinating hydrocarbon exploration and development activity with
increases in demand for power and natural gas. Oil and gas firms may be reluctant to
explore and develop when there is substantial uncertainty about demand for gas; while
industrial developers (and power plant developers) may be reluctant to invest without
assurance of energy availability. 86
A4-4. A number of potential options has been proposed on how best to use this gas.
While the use for this gas for power generation is the most frequently proposed, other
options include:
      Exporting the gas to Tajikistan (which would require the construction of a pipeline from
       the Sheberghan (and other) fields to the Tajik border. 87


80The APSMP quotes gas prices as $/MWh (see e.g. Table 6.1.2-2). This risks confusion between gas
price and electricity price and makes difficult a comparison with costs of other fuels. 1 kWh=3,412
BTU, so the gas price of $3.9/MWh cited by APSMP as applying to existing wells converts to
$1.14/mmBTU; “gas price, refurbished well? of 10.4$/MWh converts to $3.05/mmBTU .
81Again care is required: some reports use “MCM? to denote millions of cubic meters. However, the
universal practice is to use “mm? to denote millions of BTU.
82How much energy there is per m3 depends on whether the heat content is specified as lower heating
value (LHV) or as higher heating value (HHV). In Central Asia it seems the energy content is
denominated as LHV (as in Russia and Europe) - whereas in the US, HHV is used (e.g. as in Henry
Hub prices). For natural gas, the difference between HHV and LHV is about 10%. There is a
corresponding difference in the way heat rates of power plants are stated: efficiency based on LHV is
thus 10% higher than based on HHV (so for example, 55% rather than 50%).

   Expanding the fertilizer plant at Mazar-e-Sharif and other industrial and commercial
    uses of the gas there, which would require additional pipeline capacity to accommodate
    the increased volumes of gas to be supplied. Pipeline options are shown in Figure A4-1.

   Building a gas pipeline from the Northern gas fields to the Kabul area, where the gas
    would displace diesel oil (and fuel wood) for domestic and household use (which
    would require, in addition to the main gas pipeline, the development of gas distribution
    infrastructure in the Kabul region). Pending the gradual development of the gas
    distribution infrastructure, gas could also be used for power generation at one of the
    existing thermal generating stations in Kabul (again displacing expensive diesel oil).
    This pipeline option is shown in Figure A4-2.

A4-5. These options are not mutually exclusive, and combinations of these projects could
be implemented in sequence as the gas supply increases. For example, one could begin
with a pipeline to Mazar-e-Sharif to allow increased use for fertilizer production; then build

LNG imports at prices in excess of $10/mmBTU. However, exporting to Pakistan would involve
additional investment costs for the extension of the gas pipeline from Kabul to Peshawar.

The choice is bounded by the amount of gas actually available in each year, and the
investment capital as may be available to the Government of Afghanistan from the
international community. Table A4-2 and Figure A4-3 show the consultant gas production

A4-6. Uncertainty surrounds both the choice of technology and the capital cost, as well as
the location. Both CCGT and reciprocating gas engines have been proposed (assumed in
the APSMP at $1,700/kW for the former, and $1,200/kW for the latter).
A4-7. The 2005 Sheberghan FS for USAID recommended reciprocating gas engines with
waste heat recovery be used for the power plant, with gas treatment consisting of hydrogen
sulfide removal using amine scrubbing, water removal using glycol dehydration, solids
filtration and pre-heating. The main advantage of such gas engines is the fact they can be
installed in small 5 MW modules. With the necessary gas conditioning facilities now
proposed as part of the gas production, the APSMP assumes use of CCGT. 88

A4-9. In the more recent evaluation of the Sheberghan project, the consultant reports that
recent experience of construction projects in Afghanistan suggests that the substantial
incremental security and logistics costs add 60 percent to general international price levels
for power generation equipment: it estimates international cost for a 200 MW size CCGT at
$1,000/kW, when adjusted by a 1.6 multiplier equal to $1,600/kW (slightly lower than the
APSMP estimate of $1,700/MW).

A4.3     THE BASIC QUESTION: GAS GENERATION V. IMPORTS
A4-10. In the absence of energy security constraints and geopolitical considerations, the
question of whether Afghanistan should use its gas resources for power generation are
easily answered. A project in Afghanistan will have higher costs because:
   Scale economies – because even a 200-400 MW CCGT in Sheberghan will have higher
    investment costs per kW than an 850 MW scale project in Turkmenistan. The smaller
    project will also have a poorer heat rate.
   Security related construction premia – as noted, costs for the Sheberghan project are
    estimated to be 60% higher than international levels.
   Gas quality – the gas in Sheberghan is sour, and of lower quality than in Turkmenistan,
    which will incur an additional cost for gas treatment
   Gas field development costs – Gas field development will be more costly than in the
    CARs: One study estimates a premium of 60% just to account for the more
    mountainous terrain (rather than flat, smooth steppe), the lack of supply equipment and
    materials, and the inability to provide many of the necessary specialized personnel.
    Moreover, this premium does not account for any de-mining or security expenses
    which might also be necessary for an upstream project in Afghanistan.
A4-11. A project in Afghanistan will have lower costs because:
   Avoided power transmission costs: the distance from the generation point in
    Turkmenistan to Sheberghan is several 100 km. This involves transmission losses, and
    the cost of the transmission line itself.
A4-12. There is also the question of the benefit of the resource rent. Imports of gas-based
electricity will be based on the market price of gas in Turkmenistan (set largely by China’s
willingness to pay), not on the actual production cost of gas. If the market price of gas is,
say $8/mmBTU, but the LRMC is only $1/mmBTU, then the resource rent that accrues to
the Government of Turkmenistan (or to the production entity involved) is $7/mmBTU. So
even if the LRMC in Afghanistan is triple that of Turkmenistan, generation in Afghanistan
still brings a resource rent of $5/mmBTU. Of course, that rent would also be available if the
gas were used to supply Kabul to displace diesel oil and petroleum-based LPG: while that
would entail a significant additional gas transmission cost, the value of gas is highest where
it displaces oil (diesel cost in Kabul is about $17.50/mmBTU at an oil price of $40/bbl).
However, it is worth noting that the very low LRMCs in the CARs (Table 6.4) are a result of
the very large size of their gas fields and production volumes: these are not achievable in


April 25, 2016                                                                                99
Afghanistan even under the consultant’s high scenario. At the same time, this explains the
interest of Turkmenistan of selling gas-based electricity to Afghanistan: it thereby captures
a significant resource rent.

A4-14. At the higher discount rates that may be necessary to attract the necessary capital,
the LRMCs increase as shown in Table A4-6. Even under conservative assumptions, the gas
price at Sheberghan, before any onward transport to the point of utilization should be no
more than $2/mmBTU. These are based on a 2006 study, so at current prices $3/mmBTU is
assumed.

The Cost of Imported Power to Afghanistan
Table A4-7 shows the import prices assumed by the APSMP. These appear to be quite low,
particularly for the major additional imports envisaged from Turkmenistan: 1,000 MW of
firm capacity from generation in Turkmenistan must inevitably come from dedicated export
projects, which means the export price must also recover capital costs.

A4-15. Moreover, it is hard to see why Turkmenistan would build such projects based on a
gas price that is far below the border price. 5.5 US¢/kWh would cover just the variable fuel
cost at $268 /MCM ($7.50/mmBTU), which is the 2011 gas price assumed in the UAP-EST
project proposal for a dedicated gas project in Uzbekistan. Recovery of fixed costs (CAPEX
and fixed O&M) would add at least another 2-3 US¢/kWh. Table A4-8 gives the results of a
sensitivity analysis in the UAP-EST report, which shows the power price as a function of
different natural gas prices.90

A4-16. Table A4-9 presents the baseline comparison between imports and power
generation using gas engines, assuming an import cost of 8 US¢/kWh, and a gas price of
$4.00/mmBTU (assuming another $1/mmBTU for gas transmission). This shows the gas
projects have lower costs than imports.

Afghanistan will be generated at low cost using open cycle gas turbines.

A4-17. But with slight changes in assumptions, imports are more cost effective – for
example, if the gas price is $4.5/mmBTU, then the gas option levelized cost is 8.5 US¢/kWh,
more expensive. The problem is that in this calculation there are some 15 different
assumptions, all of which are uncertain. A conventional sensitivity analysis can show
switching values for each assumption one at a time, but reality does not work that way. In
reality, most variables will show some deviation from the best estimate made today. A
Monte Carlo risk assessment can provide a probabilistic assessment of the NPV (or IRR),
but requires that one make assumptions about the probability distribution of each variable –
but who can credibly make statements that the probability of the world oil price being $x
five years hence will be y percent?

Modelling Energy Security
A4-18. The comparison is made more difficult by the different security attributes of each
option. The calculations shown in Table A4-9 deals with this by specifying for each option
the number of days per year that power is not delivered (other than the usual scheduled
and forced outage rates that are allowed for in the plant capacity factor). For the gas option
this would apply to disruption of the gas supply, and power transmission (say to Kabul
across the Salang Pass). For the import option it would apply to disruptions to the
transmission line from the generating station in Turkmenistan.
A4-19. Since these security costs vary across the choices, to compare like with like one
needs to include the different amounts of unserved energy associated with each choice, and

its cost, which is taken here as the cost of diesel self-generation, which will be a function of

A4.4      TESTING ROBUSTNESS
A4-20. Instead of making a decision based on “predict -then-act?, where the essential
question is how to make the best estimate of the future, and then chose the option of least
cost, the better approach is to ask – “given the difficulties of predicting the future, which
option is more robust to these uncertainties?? This implies looking at the performance of
each option in all plausible futures (which may well run into the tens of thousands, each
reflecting different combinations of individual input assumptions), and then examine the
vulnerability of a particular option to identified risks. The trick is to do this without
necessarily needing to say anything about the probability of an input assumption being at a
particular value. Table A4-11 shows the plausible ranges of uncertainty set for the analysis
of the gas generation decision.

A4-21. By sampling these ranges of uncertainty one can easily generate the probability
distribution of NPVs, as shown in Figure A4-4. The expected value of cost for imports is
$2.78 billion, compared with $2.29 billion for gas engines. For the 1,000 sample futures
calculated here, gas generation the better option in 775 cases. Nevertheless, a comparison of

A4-22. But now the following question is asked: under what combinations of input
variable assumptions (or “scenarios?) would a decision taken for the gas engine option
prove to be the wrong decision? Put another way, under what conditions would imports
have been better? Although the two probability distributions suggest considerable overlap,
when one looks at the individual calculations a different picture emerges.
A4-23. Figure A4-5 shows a plot of a 1,000 such futures. The dark (blue) dots are the
combination of gas price ($/mmBTU) and import price (US¢/kWh) for which imports are
the preferred option; the light (green) circles represent those for which the gas generation is
the preferred option. The robustness of the decision, that is the proportion of cases in which
the right decision is made in quadrant II, is high: if the import price is greater than

US6¢/kWh, and the gas price less than $6/mmBTU, then whatever the combination of all
other uncertainties (security outages for gas supply and transmission corridors, capital cost
escalations, world oil prices, capacity utilization, demand uncertainty, heat rate), there is a
97% chance of Sheberghan power generation being the correct decision. The “Z( j)? shown
in this figure is the percentage of cases in each quadrant ( j) in which Sheberghan gas is the
preferred option. The points marked A, B and C reflects the judgment of individuals as to
what are the “most likely? set of future conditions.

example, level of import price at which could one be certain that gas would be cheaper, if
the stakeholder argued that the Sheberghan gas price would unlikely be higher than
$7.5/mmBTU. As shown in the redrawn Figure A4-6, even if the import price were less
than 6 US¢/kWh then gas will still be least cost in 74 percent of the futures.

The scenario discovery method illustrated in these figures was generated with a simple
heuristic implemented in a spreadsheet, and the sampling across the ranges specified in
Table A4-7 is based on Monte Carlo sampling. In other applications of this technique 91
more sophisticated methods have been used including the Patient Rule Induction Method
(PRIM) for scenario discovery92, and Latin Hypercube sampling of the variable space. For
this application it was preferable to include the entire set of calculations and all graphics in
a single spreadsheet for demonstration and discussion at the May 2015 Workshop. This
enabled easy discussion with stakeholders.

A4.5     CONCLUSIONS
A4-25. At the time this analysis was developed in early 2015, there was still considerable
uncertainty about the price of imports from Turkmenistan, since the PPA was still under
negotiation – and the negotiations for renewal of the Uzbekistan PPA were expected at 8-8.5
US¢/kWh. Moreover, there is continuing uncertainty about the production cost of
Sheberghan gas – the only way of resolving that uncertainty is to proceed with the
necessary further gas field development. The Gas Master Plan for Afghanistan has yet to be
completed which should provide guidance on what the gas production costs will likely be,
and whether that gas should be used to displace diesel use in Kabul or for power
generation.

A4-26. The results suggest that if indeed import prices were above 6USc/kWh, a decision
to proceed with Sheberghan gas would be low risk – if the delivered gas price is below
$6/mmBTU then there is a very low probability of a negative rate of return. LRMC
estimates of the gas cost (in Table A4.5) suggest costs of around $3/mmBTU, so these could
be 100% greater to reach the $6/mmBTU threshold.
A4-27. In early November 2015 the PPA between DABS and the Turkmenenergo State
Power Corporation of Turkmenistan was signed. This covers imports of electricity from
Turkmenistan from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2027. The price is 5 US¢/kWh in 2015,
rising by three percent per year (so 7.13 US¢/kWh in 2027), with agreed volumes of 899
GWh in 2018, increasing to 1,516 GWh in 2027. By comparison, the estimated energy from
the Bagdhara hydro project is 968 GWh, and total energy imports in 2014 were 3,814 GWh,
of which 1,426 GWh were from Uzbekistan and 1,103 GWh from Tajikistan. A 50MW gas
engine project at Sheberghan would produce 300 GWh at a 0.7 load factor, representing
only a small fraction of imports.
A4-28. This is a low price that is clearly to Afghanistan’s advantage, and at first glance
makes the development of the gas engine project at Sheberghan less pressing. However, the
probability that a Sheberghan gas project would deliver negative economic returns is small.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group is considering
supporting a 50 MW gas engine project in Mazar-e Sharif. This analysis concludes that the
proposed project should be still be supported, since it is of reasonable scale, and gas engines
are the most robust technology given the likely operating environment. Moreover, if this
relatively modest sized project cannot be done as an IPP, then the prospects for other IPP
development (including hydro projects) would be even less likely to attract private sector
interest. Efforts to confirm the size and cost of the gas resource also remains a policy
priority even with the next tranche of imports becoming available at low cost.
A4-29. This case study illustrates the power of new approaches to assess planning
decisions under high uncertainty. The focus is no longer on trying to predict the future, but
of looking at possible options and then assessing the vulnerability to the most important
sources of variation.

ANNEX 5 – CASE STUDY: TRANSMISSION PLANNING
A5.1     BACKGROUND
A5-1. The status of power system development in Afghanistan is outlined in the earlier
World Bank study93 that describes the development of the electricity sector up until 2013
and reviews options for accommodating power transit operations. That report covered
power planning up to the time when NATO, backed by a substantial donor aid program,
began to wind down its operations in anticipation of the change of government in 2014. In
summary the report noted that the last decade of power sector development had been
characterized by significant investments by IFIs for the rehabilitation of the urban electricity
networks in the larger cities and towns, along with new investments in transmission and
isolated rural electrification/ renewable energy projects. Subsequently, during the last 18
months there has be a major commitment of about US$2.2 billion, particularly by ADB,
USAID and the World Bank, to support transmission projects that currently being
developed generally in line with the recommendations of the APSMP94.
A5-2. In the context of this particular study there were important technical decisions
taken in the transmission planning process that perhaps may have been evaluated
differently if the broader perspective of a real options analysis had been employed. Gven
the status of these ongoing projects, particularly in terms of the constraints of their financing
and the restrictions of the respective IFI procurement processes, any suggestion of revisiting
those decisions would be counterproductive, especially in light of the uncertainties that still
prevail in the Afghan power sector. This Annex therefore identifies areas of continuing
uncertainty in aspects of the key planning assumptions that need to be addressed in order
to reduce the risk of choosing less desirable outcomes in future.
A5-3. It is important for Afghan planners to recognize that there will be limitations in
their ability to secure large grants to support their ambitious concept for the establishment
of a 500kV regional power market. Accordingly it would be premature to invest US$3-4
billion in 500kV transmission if in the next decade the grid was mainly used to serve a
relatively small domestic power market. It is accepted that in $/kW terms transmission is
generally the smallest component of a power sector lending portfolio.95 However there are
large demands on IFI grants worldwide and available funds would probably be better spent
on urban distribution and RE expansion along with the development of domestic
generation. In terms of the complementary transmission development over the next decade
it is important to separate the needs of supporting the domestic program from the
investment requirements peculiar to power transit operations in Afghanistan. A summary
of the issues to be resolved before further transmission investment decisions are taken,
preferably using a real options analysis, is given in Chapter 4 of the main text.

94 The APSMP finalised in May 2103 by Fichtner was revised with some important changes and
published in an Addendum to the report that was finalised in August 2104. Currently the APSMP is
being revised by DABS to incorporate the scope of new plans driven by the promise of substantially
increased imports from Turkmenistan.
95Typically average generation costs about $2,000/kW; transmission $300/kW and distribution about
$800/kW. On the other hand component costs of transmission are highly susceptible to price
variations. Typically components comprise: 30 percent conductors & fittings; 30 percent foundations
and towers; 30 percent construction & stringing; 10 percent ROW issues – all variable and location
specific depending on world market prices, access and environment.



April 25, 2016                                                                             109
A5.2     CURRENT PLANS
A5-4. The ongoing process of updating the APSMP 96 will necessarily take into account the
impact of the new transmission projects that are expected to be commissioned by about
2020. This planning process will also help refine the strategy for further network expansion
that optimizes the use of existing transmission assets over the longer term. Currently the
major ongoing grid investments include (a) the 500kV line from Pul-e-Khumri to South
Kabul; (b) the CASA 1000 HVDC project, and (c) the SEPS/NEPS 220kV interconnection.
A5-5. A revised APSMP will also need to consider how to incorporate a growing number
of isolated power networks generally supplied by diesel generation or imports, along with
MEW’s rural electrification (RE) microgrid systems, most of which are expected eventually
to be interconnected with the main grid. The latter RE development program is expected to
promote the greater use of renewable energy to expand the number and efficacy of isolated
micro grids – expected mainly to be supplied by micro hydros and PV solar power systems.
A5-6. The US$ 220 million Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul 500kV project comprises the
construction of a single circuit 500 kV overhead line (on towers equipped for a second
circuit) including a Kabul SW substation with 400 MVA 500/220 kV transformers, at
Arghandi. The project is complemented by a separate project to construct 500 kV substation
at Dashte Alwan at the northern end of the transmission line. Both projects have been
conceived as part of the APSMP strategy to provide a direct 500kV link from Turkmenistan
to Kabul and eventually onward to Pakistan. The implementation of the Pul-e-Khumri to
Kabul link earlier than might have been expected has been justified as a means of relieving
the loading on the existing 220kV circuits from Pul-e-Khumri to north Kabul.97 These lines
are currently constrained in their ability to transfer 300MW from Uzbekistan by a lack of
reactive capacity support.
A5-7. Because of financing limitations and concerns about security issues on a more
desirable alternative western route via Bamyan, the new 500kV transmission line to south
Kabul will share the same right-of-way as the existing Pul-e-Khumri to north Kabul 220kV
double circuit line. This line provides the only source of imported power supply to the
Kabul load centre and follows a route that passes through the notoriously avalanche prone
Salang Pass. While there are strong arguments for the alternative Bamyan route for the new
500 kV line (a) to provide increased diversity in supplying Kabul; and (b) to facilitate the
possible development of a coal fired power station at Ishpushta, the uncertainty of the latter
development and the additional US$45m cost involved were considered compelling reasons
to proceed with the current design.
A5-8. The major avalanche on February 23rd 2015, which knocked out three towers of the
220kV line in the Salang Pass resulted in severe power curtailment in Kabul for about two
months. This served to remind planners of the value of diversity in transmission systems;
this disruption was the first such catastrophic event in the seven years of operation of the
220kV line. During the power disruption98, supplies in Kabul were partly provided by the
existing 105 MW Tarakhil diesel power station along with about 100 MW from local hydro
(Naghlu, Mahipar and Sarobi). In addition many Kabul consumers were reportedly able to


96The dedicated Energy Masterplanning Secretariat (EMPES) will be established and accountable for
making changes to the APSMP to make it a ‘living document that reflects changes in the priorities and
implementation of the energy sector projects agreed between the Government and its International
Development partners.
97 Two other transmission projects are expected to complete the remaining 250km interconnection
between Pul-e-Khumri to Sheberghan and Andkhoy West by 2019. This line will thereby facilitate the
initial 300MW supply from a new CCGT being built in Turkmenistan.
98       One temporary 220kV circuit was restored by DABS after about two weeks but it took two
         months to restore the 220kV line to full capacity. See: https://www.afghanistan-

meet their electricity requirements either from a number of self-operated petrol (under 3
kW) or from larger diesel backup generators. This mix of consumer owned backup power
(estimated to be about 30 MW in aggregate) indicates that the economic value of unsupplied
energy can be computed from the cost of power generated by diesel.

CASA-1000
A5-9. The objective of the ongoing CASA 1000 project is to create the conditions for
sustainable electricity trade between the Central Asian countries of Tajikistan and the
Kyrgyz Republic and the South Asian countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It also serves
to demonstrate the best way of promoting a power transit operation at minimal cost to
Afghanistan. In particular it reduces the risks to the export and import parties by providing
a lower cost more secure link that can function independently of the Afghan system. The
deployment of HVDC termination facilities within the import and export countries, along
with the proposed installation of an intermediate terminal at Kabul, minimize the cost to
Afghanistan and avoids the complications of synchronization between grids. The
alternative, of constructing a high capacity 500 kV domestic network designed to cater for a
future regional power market could well be considered in terms of a Real Options Study of
the risks of stranded investment in a regional power facility.
A5-10. The CASA 1000 project comprises four sub-components: (a) construction of about
750 km of 500 kV HVDC overhead transmission line to interconnect the electricity network
of Tajikistan from the Sangtuda converter station, to the Pakistan network at the Peshawar
converter station, and the Afghanistan network at the Kabul converter station. About 120
km of the line will be in Tajikistan, 560 km in Afghanistan, and 70 km in Pakistan; (b)
HVDC/HVAC converter stations: at (i) Sangtuda (1,300 MW) in Tajikistan; (ii) Kabul (300
MW) in Afghanistan; and (iii) Peshawar (1,300 MW) in Pakistan; (c) Construction of about
475 km of 500 kV HVAC overhead transmission line to interconnect the electricity network
of the Kyrgyz Republic at Datka substation to the Tajikistan network, at the Khudjand
substation. About 450 km of the line will be in the Kyrgyz Republic and 25 km in Tajikistan;
and (d) the construction of about 115 km of 500 kV line from Regar substation to Sangtuda
substation and other parts of the network necessary, along with associated substation
equipment to ensure transfer of Tajik and Kyrgyz export power. This project, conceived in
2007 and revitalised in 2011, has involved significant negotiations between the parties in
developing bankable legal agreements to ensure the project’s financial viability for at least
the first 10 years of operation.
A5-11. The experience with the CASA-1000 highlights the difficulties and uncertainties
faced by MEW/DABS planners in trying to facilitate regional market by (a) seeking
cooperation by transnational parties concerned by the risks of transit operations through
Afghanistan; (b) building complex equipment in locations where security considerations are
considered problematic for international contractors; and (c) ensuring there are ways to
mitigate the concerns by people living within or near the line right-of-way (ROW).

NEPS-SEPS Interconnection
A5-12. Connecting Afghanistan’s North East Power System (NEPS) from Kabul to the
South Eastern Power System (SEPS) in Helmand and Kandahar is a priority for
government99. The project will construct: (a) the 490 km transmission line connecting NEPS
to SEPS from Arghandi to Kandahar: (b) a substation at the Salang Tunnel to provide power
and displace high-cost diesel generated power serving the tunnel and local loads (c) the
rehabilitation of medium-voltage transmission lines, substations, distribution systems and
power facilities in Kabul to increase reliability and reduce power outage; and (d) facilitate


99In the revised version of the APSMP, DABS is also planning to extend the 220kV NEPS/SEPS line by
building a 500kV line from Khandahar to Herat (approx. 600km) thereby completing the loop and
facilitating interconnection of the Afghan grid with Iran.



April 25, 2016                                                                            111
the construction of a 10 MW solar power plant in Kandahar. The project began in 2012 and
is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.
A5-13. The NEPS/SEPS component will provide an opportunity for DABS to
synchronously interconnect six existing isolated systems en-route to the SEPS system that
currently supplied by diesels and the Kajaki hydro power plant. The project will therefore
provide DABS with an opportunity to develop a secure transmission network that retains
the ability of the existing mini-grids to disconnect and continue to operate in the case of
major disruption from imports. However the implementation of the project will require the
relevant sections of the Grid Code to be developed in advance of interconnections to
address the issues relating to DABS inability to parallel local generation plant with
imported generation emanating from the CAR states.

Connecting Isolated Grids
A5-14. To improve the efficiency of the mini-grids there appears to considerable scope for
retrofitting existing diesel plant with PV Solar power which has steadily become
competitive with other technologies. Biomass for power, hydropower, geothermal and
onshore wind can all now provide electricity competitively compared with fossil fuel-fired
power generation. Most impressively, the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of solar PV has
halved between 2010 and 2014. Installed costs for onshore wind power, solar PV and CSP
have continued to fall, while their performance has improved. Nevertheless, the problem
remains that renewable energy resources are often located far from load centers, and have
special transmission needs. Intermittent renewables such as wind are not dispatchable, so
comparisons of LCOE as shown in Figure A5-1 need to be viewed some with caution:
comparisons should be on the basis of net benefits rather than costs. The possibilities of
renewable and decentralized generation add an additional dimension of uncertainty to the
transmission planning process.

connected to the grid in the near term100. With an aggregated capacity of 55 MW the average
size of each microgrid is about 11 kW, many of which are very small PV facilities with a few
others ranging as high as 1MW101 The bulk of the microgrid capacity is sourced from
microhydros supplies (2,677) averaging 22kW each. While too small to make much of a
contribution to the power system their interconnection with the grid will provide a means
of increasing security and reliability to the rural areas.
A5-16. The strategy for future development of the larger mini-grids could also take into
account technological advances that are now driving structural changes in the power sector
worldwide102 Despite some lingering skepticism of industry advisors, there is no doubt the
technological advances are real and can be expected to have a profound impact on power
sector development in future. For Afghanistan’s existing isolated grids, there will
opportunities to retrofit existing diesels with low cost PV solar or wind facilities. The
emergence of the off-the-shelf “plug-in? battery technology is likely to minimize the need
for standby diesel generation in urban systems and reduce the high cost of meeting peak
demand.
A1-46. Another technology that could be used in Afghanistan to extend electricity supplies
to remote villages could be the introduction of shield wire electrification and single wire
earth return (SWER) lines fed from nearby there phase medium voltage lines 103. These are
mature technologies widely used in similar circumstances as exist in Afghanistan to supply
small loads in the vicinity of transmission lines. This as an effective way of mitigating
against local opposition to a transmission line that would otherwise be perceived as having
no benefits to locals. Technical details of how such a connection can be arranged are given
in Appendix 1 to this Annex.

A5.3     UNRESOLVED TRANSMISSION ISSUES
A5-17. There are three key issues that need to be addressed and resolved in the context of
future decision making for transmission system development.

Synchronization Strategy
A5-18. Afghanistan’s synchronization strategy is probably the most important technical
issue that needs resolution in the next five years - certainly before the three major
transmission projects are commissioned. It is generally accepted that HVAC power systems
must be synchronized for safe and optimal management of generation and power flows
under various operational conditions.104 In Afghanistan, currently an 800 MW system, the
situation is complicated by DABS continuing to take the bulk of its power supplies from

104The ability to synchronize all types of electricity generation plant within an integrated AC power
system is key to ensuring the most economic operation of a country’s generation plant. For a small
AC system it is relatively easy to lock generators together by carefully controlling their respective
speeds until they are identical and then quickly connecting them together. For a larger power system,
interconnection must be made according to an established Grid Code for the network to ensure failure
of any unit or line does not adversely impact other units in the system. Once interconnected the
respective generators can be readily coordinated by observing common market rules to serve an
aggregated regional demand according to their economic or technical advantages.



April 25, 2016                                                                                113
CAR countries. These countries were once integrated in the 350GW Soviet grid system, but
they no longer operate synchronously, although they claim to observe some of technical
aspects of the Russian IPS/UPS Grid Code.105 The other two dominant neighboring power
blocks are Iran – currently synchronized with Turkmenistan (65GW) and Pakistan (24 GW)
each of which have their own Grid Codes.
A5-19. In the APSMP Addendum the earlier proposal for Afghanistan to invest around
$600m to interconnect the CAR countries through an HVDC b/b facility in Pul-e-Khumri is
much modified. This approach had been intended to enable Afghanistan to isolate its
power system from its neighbors. Instead, the revised report proposes a complex interim
arrangement to separate Uzbek and Turkmen supplies using the double busbar facilities in
Pul-e-Khmri and Kabul. This however appears to be a dangerous mode of operation
requiring operators to take great care in effecting normal switching operations. The report
also recommends that synchronizing between Uzbekistan and local generation can be
effected using simplified power-frequency control and Emergency Control Systems (ECS) as
an effective inexpensive option for faster implementation. While the report indicates this
mode of operation may be acceptable to Uzbek authorities, it has not suggested how and
when the operating procedures proposed for Afghanistan should be incorporated in a
National Grid Code acceptable to the other CAR countries, Iran and Pakistan. Developing a
Grid Code for Afghanistan is discussed in Appendix 2 to this Annex.
A5-20. The immediate problem for Afghanistan is how to continue to import about 300MW
power from Uzbekistan while at the same time being able to expand its networks to supply
the greater NEPS Kabul/Jalalabad area using both its domestic generation and import
sources operating synchronously. By 2020, when the new 500/220kV lines are in place there
should be an additional 300MW available from Turkmenistan - with promises to increase
Turkmen exports to Afghan by 1000MW before 2030.
A5-21. Also by 2020 transmission facilities are expected to be available to connect NEPS to
the southern Kandahar (SEPS) region and on to the Western part of the country now
supplied from Iran. It therefore appears practical for Afghanistan to plan before 2020 to
interconnect most of the NEPS/SEPS system synchronously with Turkmenistan – especially
assuming if that country continues operate synchronously with Iran. There should be no
insurmountable technical difficulties in synchronizing NEPS/SEPS with either of these two
larger suppliers (e.g., Turkmenistan/ Iran)106 and by using a HVDC b/b or preferably
VFT107 connection to enable Uzbekistan to continue to export 300 MW to Afghanistan as
shown in Figure A5-2.

Facilitating Domestic Generation
A5-22. The various domestic generation facilities would give more flexibility to DABS in its
operations if they were synchronized with the power supplies from the exporters108. The
APSMP Addendum (Section 5.5 page 93-94) includes a discussion of the way in which an
ECS approach might work to enable local generators to share load. However although the
report has suggested this could be in place in 17 months, it has not explored wheter such an
interconnection is acceptable to the IPS/UPS regulators (or for that matter if an

         of interconnectable systems. It appears to have significant advantages for interconnection of
         smaller network using a the more familiar motor technology that should be easier for DABS
         to maintain.
108      It is understood that DABS operators have already successfully tested for a short period the
         capacity to connect Naghlu with the Uzbek supply on an unofficial basis.

interconnection through an HVDC b/b or VFT HVDC facilities could be accepted). Clearly
the development of the necessary operational elements of the Grid Code satisfactory to
Afghanistan’s neighbors is necessary condition for developing a synchronization strategy
for the longer term.

A5-23. In recent years Grid Codes have been established by several countries mainly to
document the basis for interconnection of new generation to existing power systems. Grid
Codes are often designed to accommodate new technologies. In many cases they are
necessary to satisfy the requirements for interconnecting intermittent forms of generation
such as wind and solar power where special procedures are needed for invoking system
support in case of sudden changes of output. A Grid Code with the necessary standards is
specifically needed to enable Afghanistan to negotiate its operating arrangements with its
neighbors; and to determine the relatively small investment necessary to ensure domestic
plant, protection and control equipment function effectively according the agreed rules.
A5-24. For Afghanistan a Grid Code should therefore focus on the following major issues
(a) formalizing electrical standards for all transmission and distribution operations (in
particular taking into account the variety of mountainous environmental conditions
transmission lines are expected to traverse); (b) establishing operational security and
reliability criteria satisfactory to neighboring states to enable interconnection of domestic
generation and imports; and (c) defining basic generation and transmission planning
criteria and data sharing for evaluating of least cost generation expansion planning.

Security and Diversity of Transmission Routing
A5-25. The security and reliability of a transmission network is considerably enhanced if
diverse transmission line alignments are used, each preferably taking shortest route
between the generation sources and the main load centers. It is also important to limit the
numbers of transmission lines terminating in one substation so as to minimize the impact of
a local substation equipment failure. With Afghanistan’s transmission system still at an
early stage of its development, the present plans provide for very little redundancy to deal
with a sudden loss of supply. In this respect, proposals to co-locate five separate lines at
Pul-e-Khumri risk creating a critical node in the transmission network and rendering the
whole power system vulnerable. A disruption in case of terrorist activity, equipment
breakdown or inclement weather could well result in prolonged system blackouts.




April 25, 2016                                                                         116
A5-26. Ideally, in any transmission network for every generator, circuit, substation node,
transformer, busbar and switching facility there should be an alternative means of
maintaining peak loads in the event of a disruption – the so-called “n-1? criterion109. While
this involves some degree of duplication of transmission paths, with proper planning using
modern least-cost reliability planning techniques, there are many ways of designing the
network to minimize costs. Finding alternative routes for transmission lines near roads in
Afghanistan is of course difficult and expensive because of the terrain and limited access
through high mountain passes. Nevertheless in making transmission planning decisions it
is important to move to an n-1 configuration as early as possible, since it facilitates
continued operations if repairs and routine maintenance are delayed.
A5-27. At this early stage in the development of the Afghan transmission system there is
room to apply different levels of reliability for different subsystems to minimize costs. For
example there would be an argument for an “n-2? reliability standard to be applied to a
major city like Kabul and an “n? standard for a small rural town where the cost of
duplication is prohibitive. This does not mean that two other locations, both receiving an n-
1 standard, will have the same probability of service in terms of annual “unsupplied?
energy statistics. This because the failure and repair rates of the transmission components
such as lines and transformers are markedly different. For example: transmission line
failures are usually weather dependent but quicker to reinstate, whereas transformer
failures are usually load dependent and can take a year to replace; HVDC lines comprising
two conductors are generally more reliable that the equivalent HVAC lines comprising six
conductors. Since the value of “unsupplied? energy can be easily ascertained this is an
obvious area of decision making under a RO analysis process.
A5-28. Planning for diversity can also be arranged to facilitate decisions to invest in new
generating plant by providing a means of power evacuation and thereby reduce one of the
main avenues of uncertainty. This may well be an important factor in decisions regarding
the development of the coal resources in the central parts of Afghanistan as explained
below. Likewise the plan to extend the NEPS/SEPS line through to Herat would also
facilitate decision making by IPP investors in developing the significant wind resources
reputed to be located near Herat and Farah as shown in Figure A5-3.




109 The n-1 criteria is a generally accepted concept used for transmission planning. Hence the
expression “n-1? refers to the failure of a single element like a transformer or generator, or “n -2? refers
to, say, a double-circuit transmission line, or two generators at a power plant This distinction is not
always correct because sometimes separate elements are either physically or electrically linked so that
when element A fails or trips off or is disconnected, element B goes with it.

A5-29. Nowhere better is the case for transmission diversity better made than in
considering the next round of imports from Turkmenistan due to start in 2018. If this is not
done with HVDC – which seems unlikely, even though it in itself a means of technical
diversification of transmission – several options are possible. The he new 500 kV lines from
Sheberghan could be extended direct to South Kabul over the new Hindu Kush route. This
proposal is shown below indicating how a 500 kV ring design following the UAP_EST route
could complement the 500 kV proposals in the APSMP. It has the advantage for the project
developers in both diversifying the routing of power supplies from Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul,
and having 500 kV transmission capacity in place to enable the connection of two major coal
fired power stations that are proposed by investors interested in developing Afghanistan’s
coal and copper mines. 110
A5-30. Nevertheless, the cost of the additional transmission routing will not be negligible,
and the tradeoff between a shorter and lower cost route in the short run compared with a
longer route that provides additional options in the future should be examined. This
problem would lend itself well to a RO analysis.




110 See World Bank Report: Afghanistan Resource Corridor Development: Power Sector Analysis July 2012.
If indeed the two proposed Ishputa and Haji Gak 600-1,200 MW coal generation projects ever go
ahead the alternative Hindu Kush 500 kV line via Banyam will certainly be required - with some of the
cost expected to be partly met by the mining developers.

A5.4     FACILITATING POWER TRANSIT OPERATIONS
For point-to-point transmission of bulk power over 500 km or more, HVDC transmission
links can normally be built at a lower overall cost than conventional HVAC lines. Although
HVDC lines can be constructed at about 50% of the cost of an equivalent HVAC line, the
cost of the necessary HVDC/HVAC converter stations are about $120/kW, compared with
$20/kW for a conventional HVAC/HVAC substation. A typical HVDC interconnection
arrangement is shown in Figure A5-4.
                     Figure A5-4:      Typical HVDC interconnection arrangements




A5-31. Various HVDC projects have been proposed to bring electricity generated in the
Central Asian States to Pakistan. The CASA-1000 project would deliver up to 300 MW of
surplus hydro power from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, also by HVDC to Kabul, and a
further 1,000 MW to Peshawar. Likewise The Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Electricity
Supply and Trade Project (UAP_EST) would deliver 100 MW (915 GWh) to DABS at a
substation north of Kabul and 900 MW to Pakistan in the Peshawar area. Both projects offer
technical advantages to Afghanistan, particularly in terms of how they may be used to deal
with the synchronization problems and how they can supply a diversified source of bulk
power over long distances to the major load center in Kabul. As the CASA-1000 experience
has shown, import/transit schemes need considerably more analysis than presented thus
far, particularly to ensure equity among the participants.
A5-32. An HVDC interconnection for interconnecting asynchronous systems is sometimes
effected with an HVDC back-to-back facility, thereby enabling both power systems to
maintain their own system frequencies independently of the other. HVDC effectively
enables two power systems to be interconnected without having to re-synchronize at every

forced or planned disconnection. In considering an HVDC back-to-back facility, it is
prudent to consider building an HVDC interconnection instead to achieve the same
objective at much lower cost. HVDC is also used in many countries, in parallel with HVAC
systems, to improve system stability at both ends of the HVDC line as well as moving
power more economically over long distances. In effect, HVDC can be designed to act as a
very fast FACTS operating device designed to inject power into the HVAC system and
counteract inherent instability problems.
A5-33. Although HVDC technology has had many years of operational experience, 111 new
control systems have been developed recently which reduce cost and improve flexibility
and performance. This is based on modern, newly developed voltage source converters
(VSC112) with series-connected insulated gate bi-polar transistor (IGBT) valves controlled
with pulse width modulation (PWM) that have already reached levels of 1,200 MW and
±500 kV. Notably, HVDC can also be built in stages to match increased loading, as
required. This can be done by first building the line for monopole operation, then later
uprating to bipole operation – and, if necessary, uprating again using a higher operating
voltage. A diagram of this kind of scheme is at Figure A5-5. Provided that the line is
designed for its ultimate operating configuration (at little extra cost), the cost lies primarily
in uprating the HVDC/HVAC terminals at each end of the lines.




111HVDC was originally developed to supply large volumes of power over long distances. The first
large-scale commercial project was installed in 1965 in New Zealand where a 600 MW HVDC line was
built to carry power from the South Island 600 km to the North Island. This has operated very reliably
for over 45 years and was recently upgraded to 1,400 MW. Over 200 HVDC systems have been built
over the years. The longest HVDC link in the world is currently the 2,071 km ±800 kV, 6,400 MW link
connecting Xiangjiaba Dam to Shanghai in the People's Republic of China.

A5.5     PRIORITIES FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS
A5-34. For the next decade or so Afghanistan will depend on imported power that must be
integrated with local generation which is expected to increase over time. A key activity to
improve power quality and reliability is to seek approval from the CAS countries to
synchronize local generation to the import grids. Transmission planning in Afghanistan
must also take into account the need for diversity and security of supplies, recognizing that
in the short term the cheaper imported power from unsynchronized sources needs to be
managed so as to maintain competitive prices through flexible off-take designs.
A5-35. Given the country’s synchronism issues, the long distances involved and the power
transit opportunities, HVDC systems in some form or another must be an integral part of
any future Afghanistan transmission system. In principle HVDC transmission should be
used to provide lower cost, greater security for transit projects along with supply & stability
advantages to Afghanistan. HVDC systems can be readily integrated into the design of the
Afghanistan power system either in parallel with the HVAC systems or via HVDC terminal
and b/b facilities but must also be a consideration in developing the Grid Code.
A5-36. In the near term Afghanistan needs to develop its existing microgrids to increase
diversity and security of supplies. Essentially these should be seen as groups of
interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical
boundaries acting as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. They should be
able to connect and disconnect from the grid operating in both grid-connected or island
mode. There needs to be greater consumer engagement by DABS with resources to solve
power issues locally by enabling the penetration of local renewables in residential,
commercial, and industrial areas. In this way distribution can become a transmission
resource with all its components are part of a cohesive system. This will of course require
high dependency on standardization (physical and data) as established in the T&D Grid
Code.
A5-37. Changes to accommodate new technologies need to be recognized in the planning
process to improve grid and micro-grid operations and lower overall costs. These include
the deployment of utility-scale and domestic PV solar plant along with distribution-level
storage to replace backup diesel power. Likewise it in planning new HVDC schemes it is
important to recognize the current developments of new HVDC technologies that can

facilitate an increased number of intermediate converters and provide stabilizing power to
weak interconnect systems. These include technologies such as LCC (Line Commuted
Converters) versus VSC (Voltage Source Converters), and their competing technology VFT
(Variable Frequency Transformers. Other technologies can be used to increase the capacity
of existing AC lines using; using FACTS (Flexible AC transmission) equipment to
compensate for the limitations of long lines and light loads and thereby avoid unnecessary
investment in new lines as shown in Figure A5-6.

APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX 5: ELECTRIFICATION USING SHIELD WIRE AND SWER SYSTEMS
A5-39. Shield Wire System (SWS) is an innovative approach to grid connected rural electrification using
a standard Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) system. Many of DABS HVAC and the proposed HVDC
transmission lines pass nearby villages that subsist without electricity. As a way to facilitate ROW
compensation and to add value to the communities and people living around the proposed transmission
line, SWS provides a means to provide electricity to the villages along the line.

The Technology
A5-40. High voltage transmission lines have Over Head Earth Wires (OHEW) that are connected to a
tower and grounded to provide protection to the transmission line from lightning strikes. They are
mounted above transmission lines and thus attract the lightning away from the phase conductors,
essentially shielding the transmission lines from lightning.
A5-41. In shield wire systems, these shield wires are insulated from the tower and ground and provide a
conductor for transmission of electricity. They are energized at MV (20-34.5kV) from a HV/MV
transformer stationed at one end of the HV line. MV/LV transformers are then added along the HV line
to supply the loads. There are four main systems within SWS. They are:
     Single Wire Earth-Return (SWER).
     Single Phase Metallic-Return.
     “V? Scheme.
     “3-phase scheme?
A5-42. The last three schemes are only applicable for transmission systems where there are two shield
wires available. The recommended tower design uses one of the shield wires as a carrier for an optical
fiber communications link. The second shield wire could be used to provide power along the line by
implementing a SWER shield wire system.
A5-43. Single-phase earth-return can be designed and implemented in transmission towers in with only
one OHEW. In this system, a single phase of power is transmitted through the single insulated OHEW
and returned through the earth. This system works essentially like a SWER system, however utilizes the
existing infrastructure of the towers and lines. The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Figure
A5-7.

more expensive but also very commonly used system of electricity distribution is the use of single phase
system which is commonly used in North America 114. A non-exhaustive list of countries using SWER
systems is at Table A5-2. Main stream distributive technologies such as MV distribution, can also be
implemented, however these usually prove to be too cumbersome and expensive in rural areas.

Lightning Performance of High Voltage
A5-45. Normally the OHEW is grounded, and attracts the lighting, intercepting the strike to protect the
phase conductors. In SWS the OHEWs are insulated in a way so as not to compromise the effectiveness
of the lighting protection. The proposed insulation for shield wire systems is a rigid string toughened
glass insulator, with protective arcing horns (or rod gaps) as shown in Figure A5-8. These rod gaps are
installed across the shield-wire insulators to facilitate flash-over when-ever necessary.117

A5-46. The arcing horns are not a new concept. Along with insulating the earth wires in EHV, they also
implement spark gaps. In order to maintain continuity along the shield wire, the insulation level should
be sufficient for flash-over protection in continuous duty and for insulation dielectric strength recovery
after clearing the fault. The arcing gaps should be between 100 and 300mm, depending on the operation
voltage. When the shield wire does experience a lighting strike, the closest insulating spark gaps will
flash over.
A5-47. For the protection of the system the shield wires will appear to experience a phase to ground
fault. The protection relays will trip, turning off the supply to the shield lines once the fault is identified.
This protection is the typical operational method used in MV systems. Tripping off the SWL will
extinguish the fault. After the line is tripped off, a secondary arc may flash over. This secondary arc is
supplied by the residual capacitive and electromagnetic induction from the HV circuit. Laboratory
testing and analysis of operating systems show that these secondary arcs self-extinguish in all cases. No
decrease in reliability of the HV line has been experienced in the SWS schemes in Africa, Ethiopia and
Brazil. Reliability of the medium voltage SWS line has been shown to be similar to other medium voltage
lines in the area.

APPENDIX 2 TO ANNEX 5: DEVELOPING A GRID CODE FOR AFGHANISTAN

Background
A2-34. For a landlocked energy transit country like Afghanistan, surrounded by large asynchronous
power systems, a Grid Code is required to allow the country to plan its power system development in a
rational way. A Grid Code appropriate for Afghanistan should comprise: (a) a Planning Code that
describes higher-level and common regional requirements, processes and criteria for joint planning; (b)
an Operation Code, including scheduling and dispatch to make use of the advantages arising from the
interconnected operation and define standards for reliability and quality of supply; (c) Connection Rules
to define rules for connection to the transmission system on non-discriminating terms; (d) a Data
Exchange Code to facilitate system analyses of the interconnected regional power system for dealing with
balance and capacity problems and to control the distribution of the models that are used to analyze the
regional power system; and (e) a Metering Code.
A2-35. An Afghan Grid Code should also define the technical and operational specifications and
parameters for domestic electricity generating plants and substation control systems. This will facilitate
both synchronous and asynchronous interconnections to enable proper functioning of the electrical grid.
The code will define appropriate power system design parameters and interconnection standards so as to
minimize the use of different types of power equipment that are often introduced by donor countries. In
this respect Afghanistan’s existing legacy of power systems designs comprise a mixture of voltage levels;
the MV/HV AC voltage levels include 35 kV, 44 kV, 110 kV, 132 kV, 220 kV, 500kV and HVDC systems.
Distribution systems are supplied at 6 kV and 15 kV with the latter built for eventual upgrading to 20 kV.
A2-36. A key section of the Grid Code for Afghanistan is required to facilitate a synchronous
interconnection between the Afghanistan and CAR/Iran power systems most probably based on
simplified power-frequency control and Emergency Control Systems (ECS) used by the UPS/IPS
regulator. These control strategies are already applied for synchronous interconnections of large systems
with peripheral systems of smaller capacity. In this respect it is unlikely that Afghanistan will participate
in primary or secondary frequency control of the interconnected system, but only be responsible for
maintaining the scheduled flows using its own generation resources and discontinuous control.
A2-37. It is expected that Afghanistan system interconnection shall at a minimum be monitored from a
regional dispatching centre, featuring real-time energy management functions, including state estimation
and contingency screening. There will also be a requirement for power system stabilizers of major
generation units to be tuned (or retrofitted) based on small signal stability studies supported by unit
measurements and model identification. Fast controllable reactive power compensators (SVCs) at critical
load or generation buses will be most probably be required.
A2-38. Provision should be made further to develop the Grid Code later to enable Afghanistan’s to play
a major role in the development of power transit operations. It will need take into consideration the
security and economic obligations between exporters and importers that are likely to be incorporated in
their respective PPAs.

Outline Scope of Work to Prepare a Grid Code
A5-48. DABS and MEW would need to investigate the technical issues raised above and draw up a plan
for commercial operation of asynchronous interconnections between CAR/Iran and Pakistan including
the specification of a functional upgrade of a regional control centre. Consultant support would likely be
needed to develop and assist in agreeing and adopting technical and reliability standards, including
ancillary services, and the roadmap for the transition from initial/current conditions to target standards.
A reliability study of the power grid system will be required to assess system capacity and fragility,
identify faults, to recommend solutions and upgrading; and to provide estimates for investment required
to upgrade existing plant for secure, safe and reliable operation.



April 25, 2016                                                                         127
A5-49. The objective of the code is thus to set a common basis for satisfactory operational reliability and
quality of supply for all participants in Afghanistan’s electricity industry. The code should be designed
to permit the development, maintenance and operation of an efficient, coordinated and economical
system for the transmission of electricity, to facilitate competition in the generation and supply of
electricity and to promote the Operation, Data Exchange and Metering Codes.
A5-50. While it will not be possible to provide a comprehensive Grid Code for Afghanistan in the near
term, the investigation should recommend standards that are required to achieve the above objectives
and include a program of further development of the Grid Code as generally outline under the following
subject headings:
   Rights and responsibilities of the transmission enterprise; the Power System Operator, electricity
    generators; customers connected to the transmission system; the public provider; public suppliers
    and electricity traders.
   Technical requirements for connection to the transmission system for both materials and staff.
   Procedures of transmission system development planning and use.
   Procedures of Power system operation planning.
   Scheduling and control of Power System (PS) operating mode; development and performance of a
    defense plan and of a plan for PS restoration;
   Procedures for mandatory data interchange, sequence of on-line data interchange, and on-line power
    system control.
   Activities of the PS operator and of transmission system Users related to the quality control of PS
    operation.
   Conditions and procedures of system tests, certification of systems.
   Provision of complementary services.
   A cost-effective framework for dispute resolution for all code participants
   Adequate sanctions in cases of breaches of the Grid Code.
   Efficient processes for changing the Grid Code.
   Technical, Safety, security and performance standards with regard to the PS and protection systems.
   Codes of practice covering the construction, operation and maintenance of electro-mechanical
    components of transmission and distribution systems.
   Codes of practice for customer services related to the electricity supply industry.
   Responsibilities in case of accidents.
   Responsibilities in case of losses and compensation.
   Other relevant activities related to the overall PS operation process.

                            vessel has a capacity of 140,000 dwt.
         Coal Rank          The calorific value of coal increases with coal rank along a continuum, though
                            at very high ranks, calorific value begins to decline. For historical reasons,
                            coal rank names and the places along the calorific continuum where coal is
                            recognized to change rank varies from country to country. North American
                            naming conventions are shown below. Soviet naming conventions are used
                            by Technoexport. Soviet conventions are significantly more complex than
                            other naming conventions because they take into account the kinds of original
                            plant material (stems, leaves, seeds, etc.) that constitute the coal. It is not
                            possible to directly correlate Soviet naming conventions with other systems.
                            The Soviet classification system tries to account for the fact that coals that
                            seemingly have the same rank have, in reality, very different combustion
                            properties.

         Ramsey Formula     According to the noted British economist Frank Ramsey, social rate of time
                            preference (SRTP) is the sum of two terms: first is a utility discount rate
                            reflecting the pure time preference (?), and the second is the product of the
                            elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption ? and the annual growth

         Social rate of time   The rate at which society is willing to postpone a unit of current consumption
         preference SRTP       in exchange for more future consumption. The use of the SRTP as the social
                               discount rate is based on the argument that public projects displace current
                               consumption, and streams of costs and benefits to be discounted are
                               essentially streams of consumption goods either postponed or gained. There
                               are two general methods in use for its empirical estimation (1) the after tax

         Pure rate of time     Considered to consist of two components: individuals’ impatience or myopia
         preference            (though this component is ignored in many studies because of the difficulty
                               of measuring it) and the risk of death (or as argued by Nicholas Stern, the risk

                                    WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS



Executive Summary
Over 100 participants took part in the opening of the Turkey Municipal Finance & Creditworthiness
Academy held on April 11, 2016. The grand opening with high level representatives from Treasury,
Ministry of Finance, the Turkish Union of Municipalities (TBB), IlBank (Bank of Municipalitiies), and
the World Bank, as well as Secretary Generals from 13 metropolitan municipalities, kicked off the week-
long Academy that was co-organized and jointly delivered by the World Bank and TBB. Over 24
Metropolitan Municipalities and three municipal water utilities participated in the Academy with the
objective of strengthening their financial management capabilities and thereby improving their credit
worthiness.




The City Creditworthiness Initiative is a global effort, led by the World Bank, committed to supporting
cities with the objective of improving municipal credit markets, promoting climate-smart infrastructure
projects, and using local currency markets if at all possible. The Initiative is conceived to coordinate and
integrate existing efforts, instruments, knowledge, and resources from global development partners and
stakeholders by identifying the most effective solutions and implementation arrangements for sub-
national entities. Success of the Initiative hinges on the ability by multiple sources to deliver capacity and
instruments to clients, drawing from best practice methodologies at a global level.

Within the framework of the Initiative, the Turkey Municipal Finance and Creditworthiness Academy
aimed to support local government officials in Turkey through an intensive one-week capacity building
workshop that was presented from a practitioners’ perspective. The 5-day Academy dealt with the full
range of factors affecting cities’ financial management performance, including issues determined by the
enabling environment and options for financing; revenue management and enhancement; expenditure
control and asset maintenance; capital investment planning; debt management; the use of special purpose
vehicles to “ring fence? specific revenues; and scoping out options for financing. Using a preliminary
self-assessment tool during the Academy, the participants developed a customized draft action plan of
specific institutional reforms, capacity building, and other actions that will improve their financial

sustainability and creditworthiness and facilitate their ability to plan, finance and deliver infrastructure
services.

Municipalities were presented
global best practice experiences
(both concept principles and
practical experience), i.e.
Washington, DC, Mexico, South
Africa, among others. The
Academy also had sessions
oriented toward national level
policy makers on matters of policy
reforms or enhancements that
could improve the municipal credit
market. The Action Plans
prepared will lead the
Municipalities to methods for
broader access to municipal credit,
bond structuring, and tapping into
the local capital market, which is
very limited to a few cities at this
time.

Background on the World Bank City Creditworthiness Initiative

For sustainable development to become a reality, cities, which are responsible for essential public
infrastructure, need access to finance. Supporting these entities on the path to creditworthiness is the
only way to unlock the potential for achieving larger, longer-term, sustainable investments. However,
they will not be able to achieve creditworthiness overnight. It is typically a long process, which requires
strengthening of fundamentals (in particular improving municipal revenues and financial management),
but also stronger project development capacity (in particular planning and structuring), long-term asset
management, as well as a supportive enabling environment (both on the central government and private
sector sides). The City Creditworthiness Initiative is committed to supporting cities throughout this
process by delivering technical assistance to sub-national authorities in developing countries with the
objective of successfully structuring and closing market-based financing transactions for climate-smart
infrastructure projects, using local currency markets if at all possible. The Initiative is conceived to
coordinate and integrate existing efforts, instruments, knowledge, and resources from partners and
stakeholders by identifying the most effective solutions and implementation arrangements for sub-
national entities. Success of the Initiative hinges on the ability by multiple sources to deliver capacity and
instruments to clients, drawing from best practice methodologies at a global level.


With the ultimate goal of enabling sub-national entities to structure viable investments that will deliver
low-carbon and resilient infrastructure services, the Initiative works with local authorities, including
utilities, providing comprehensive, hands-on, and long-term support to help them:
    1. Achieve higher creditworthiness by strengthening their financial performance;
    2. Develop an enabling legal and regulatory, institutional, and policy framework for responsible
       sub-sovereign borrowing through reforms at the national level;
    3. Improve the “demand? side of financing by planning/developing sound projects;
    4. Improve the “supply? side of financing by engaging with the private sector investors.
The Initiative’s comparative advantage is not necessarily the ability to bring about broad, sweeping
changes, but rather to recognize effective, proven innovations and adapt them and take them to scale to
meet the biggest challenges of cities. By partnering with global and regional stakeholders, the City
Creditworthiness Initiative will scale up impact through a systematic and long-term programmatic
engagement with cities. The City Creditworthiness Initiative is designed as a platform to systematically
reach clients with instruments that would otherwise be considered on a stand-alone basis. To this effect,
the Initiative is establishing operational collaborations with key stakeholders to coordinate the most
efficient and effective delivery of technical assistance to clients. Systematic partnerships will be pursued,
and to some extent have been already achieved, at the national level (e.g. joint WB/IMF Debt
Management Facility) and at the sub-national level (e.g. Deep Dive Umbrella Facility on Capital Market
Development). Existing collaborations with practitioners, such as the very successful one with the
Municipal Institute of Learning (Durban, South Africa) will continue to play a critical role and are the
basis for engaging with other stakeholders.
Reform-minded authorities seeking more, better, and longer-term financing for capital investments
engage with the Initiative to access capacity building support, international expertise, local hands-on
assistance, peer-to-peer networking, credit rating and transaction guidance. The direct result for all
participating entities is their enhanced financial performance and overall capacity to deliver better
infrastructure services.

The path to creditworthiness and to market-based transactions will vary in length and scope of
required interventions, depending on the baseline (at-entry) conditions of each sub-national entity and
their enabling environment. Whatever the specific conditions, however, noteworthy financing results can
also be expected also before a national scale investment grade credit rating is obtained. These outcomes
will include overall financial performance improvements which will enable delivery of more and better
public services. But they will also include sound financial transactions that can be pursued on a pilot-basis
while progressing to improved creditworthiness. Examples of such transactions, possibly with credit
enhancements, are hybrid-financing schemes, pilot public-private partnerships including increased
collections and reduced operating costs, smaller loans from commercial banks, enhancement mechanisms
applied to sub-national transactions, pooled financing, etc.




As cties and sub-national infrastructure service utilities follow their path to creditworthiness, credit
enhancement techniques enable realizing smaller financing opportunities and pursuing larger ones. The
private sector will take notice in each country and engage with increasing levels of partnership and
financing arrangements. Eventually, creditworthy cities command attention from institutional investors
and unlock the potential for cities to tap domestic capital markets for long-term financing of adaptation
and/or mitigation projects.
The Turkey Municipal Creditworthiness Academy, which took place from April 11-15, 2016 in
Ankara, Turkey, is a vital element of the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (2012-16) with Turkey.
Pillar three of the CPS is focused on deepening sustainability in Turkey and focuses on the energy,
water/sanitation, environment and urban/municipal sectors. Objective ten specifically focuses on building
sustainable cities and the Academy provided vital information, guidance and discrete municipality action
plans to enhance their financial sustainability. The program began well before the actual training. Each
participating municipality was expected to complete an online Municipal Financial self-assessment
(MFSA). The MFSA was a referenced learning tool used throughout the five days of training and is used
to diagnose municipal financial strengths and weaknesses. This was followed by cities preparing a
multiyear Action Plan that the participating municipality would follow in sequenced short-, medium-, and

4|Page
long-term measures to enhance its credit-worthiness. Over time, target municipalities are expected to
improve revenue collection, expenditure management, debt management and investment planning so as to
enhance their credit ratings and be able to obtain market-based finance. The activity should help develop
Turkey's market for municipal finance (in the form of longer tenor loans from domestic commercial banks
and increased bond issuance).


Key Messages and Recommendations


The opening statements expressed broad-based support for improving municipal financial performance
and creditworthiness in Turkey. Mr. Taşkin Temiz, Deputy Undersecretary of Treasury, highlighted
Treasury’s efforts at improving municipal creditworthiness, its importance in reducing dependency on
central government financing and support, and the recent efforts to develop bond instruments that can be
used by municipalities to attract needed finance. He pointed out Treasury’s long-standing commitment to
this agenda and attached particular importance to the Academy in exposing Turkish municipalities to best
global practices.
Mr. Hayrettin GÜNGÖR, Secretary General of TBB, also highlighted the importance of this agenda and
welcomed the high-level and broad-based participation in the Academy by Turkey’s metropolitan
municipalities. He pointed to the efforts being made by TBB with various Government agencies to
promote the implementation of Turkey’s Tenth National Development Plan, which devotes significant
attention to the desire of building sustainable cities, and the importance of financial sustainability as one
element of sustainable cities. He also mentioned that there are ongoing efforts to update and revise
municipal legislation relating to services and some elements of municipal finance.
Ms. Tamara Sulukhia, Sustainble Development Program Leader and Acting Head of Office for the World
Bank, underscored the importance that the World Bank attaches to promoting sustainable cities both in
Turkey and globally, and pointed to the contribution of the Academy to the ongoing Country Partnership
Strategy (2012-16) and prospects for ramping up the Bank’s engagement in supporting Turkey’s cities
and sustainable development in the years ahead.
The Opening Statements were followed by a Policy Discussion Panel session. Speakers included
government officials from Treasury, MOF, representatives from IlBank (the public sector municipal
bank), the World Bank and the private sector. The panel sought to highlight key challenges for
municipalities relating to the overall legal framework, weak municipal fiscal discipline that could be
improved, and opportunities for strengthening municipal credit worthiness. Speakers highlighted the
importance of increasing municipal own-source revenues (OSR), which is hampered by placing
responsibility for collection in district municipalities, while metropolitan municipalities (with major
expenditure obligations) have very limited OSR. Rates are also set very low (1/10 of 1% of property
value) or essentially 10% of the OECD country average. This results in very low yields from property
tax, at a time of increasing land values and infrastructure finance needs.
The paucity of efforts by municipalities to obtain credit ratings and the general practice of not carrying
out in-depth credit analysis, all underscored the need to strengthen the municipal credit market by
adhering to current lending rules, carrying out credit analysis in accordance with international standards,
and thereby, over time, help strengthen municipal credit worthiness.
The opening panel was followed by intensive training and discussion sessions over the next three days
and summarized in the fourth day of the Academy as follows:
        Creditworthiness is essential to opening access to new sources of capital for Metropolitan
         Municipalities’ infrastructure.



5|Page
      The case of Washington DC shows that a city can move from NO creditworthiness to HIGH
       creditworthiness by applying financial discipline and following good practices for financial
       management.

      National scale credit ratings are one of the best ways for Metropolitan Municipalities to
       demonstrate to the Turkish financial community that they are creditworthy.


      Increasing Own Source Revenue is the key to achieving improved creditworthiness and requires
       (in the following sequence) attention to:     1) improved collection of current revenue potential
       before… 2) seeking increased tax/tariff/fee rates, or… 3) new taxes, user charges or fees.


      Achieving a sustained positive Operating Margin (fiscal surplus) is the essential element for
       achieving creditworthiness—but that alone is not sufficient.


      Metropolitan Municipalities need to follow best practices and the GOLDEN RULES (as
       presented at the Academy) for management of debt, liquidity, and financial information. Keep in
       mind that in addition to following laws and regulations, MMs are free to establish their own
       internal administrative processes and guidelines, and should prepare manuals to ensure that all
       staff is aware of these.


      Metropolitan Municipalities can benefit financially from prioritizing climate smart infrastructure
       in their Capital Investment Plans through systematic analysis of their project options. Each MM
       should establish its OWN criteria for evaluating and prioritizing projects—you now have the tool
       (excel model).


      Metropolitan Municipalities will find that long term, market based financing mechanisms from
       the Turkish capital market (bonds, sukuks, pooled financing and PPPs) are a great source of
       capital for many of their infrastructure projects…

                      BUT offering investment opportunities that are credit rated as INVESTMENT
                       GRADE is essential.

      By engaging the capital market as creditworthy entities, Metropolitan Municipalities (and
       utilities) will help expand the healthy growth of the Turkish financial system, and of the Turkish
       economy.

      By engaging with TBB, Municipalities can address broader issues, can learn from each other, and
       can even explore pooled mechanisms for financing.

      Completing the Academy’s self-assessment and action-plan is a powerful step to advance the
       Municipality’s position toward creditworthiness.

levels of schooling (not shown in table 1), enrollment is

      fact that girls are subject to early marriage as a

     Marriage: For girls, marriage accounts for one in
      ten drop-outs at the preparatory level, and 28.1
      percent at the secondary level (see also Box 3).
     Repetitive failure: At the preparatory level,
      repetitive failures are also cited as one of the
      reason for dropping out, whereas this is less the
      case at the secondary level. Repetitive failure
      affects especially students from the bottom
      quintile of wealth who may not have the same
      ability to pay for private tutoring as children from
      better off families and may also have stronger
      economic pressure to drop out.

       Box 2: Child Marriage as a Reason to Drop Out

The impact of child marriage on education attainment can be
assessed in two different ways. The first approach consists in
looking at reasons cited by parents as to why their daughter          Table 3: Reasons for Dropping out by Gender, 2012
dropped out or did not transition to the next cycle. This may                                    Boy    Girl      Q12     Q45   All
lead to underestimating the role of child marriage because other

factors cited by parents for dropping out, such as a lack of desire

Women’s agency in the household: A higher level of education
leads women to have stronger decision-making ability within the
household, which in turn has been shown in the literature to
have benefits for the women themselves as well as their
children.

Female genital circumcision: Women with a better education are
less likely to have their daughters undergo female genital
circumcision (FGC) of mutilation (FGM). The practice, in turn,
has been found to increase risks for children during childbirth. It
may also lead to serious health complications for women, while
providing no known health benefits.

The types of reforms that these authors have in mind for
the various categories are illustrated in table 10. Crouch
and DeStefano did not conduct a systematic review, but
they considered a number of evaluations published in the
World Bank Policy Research Working Paper series. In
general, the impact of the broad-based reforms was
modest. The impact of the focused interventions was
larger. This does not mean that broad-based reforms are
not needed – they may be a prerequisite to implement
focused pedagogical reforms at scale in national
education systems since teachers and schools must be
accountable for those reforms to succeed. But it is
important to note that the two types of reforms may have
impacts of a different order of magnitude.

School-based management and accountability reforms
may also take more time to bear fruit than reforms
focusing on pedagogy. This does not mean again that
they are no less important, as mentioned earlier, in part
because they may be needed for pedagogical
interventions to succeed.

One of the conclusions of the rapid review of the literature
provided above is that while broad-based reforms are
needed in the medium to long term to promote school
accountability, pedagogical reforms tend to have a larger
and also more immediate impact on student learning. But
at the same time, implementing reforms related to school
autonomy and accountability may well be needed for the
success of some of the pedagogical reforms.

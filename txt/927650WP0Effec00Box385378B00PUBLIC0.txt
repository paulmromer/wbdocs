Abstract: The main objectives of this paper are to estimate the burden of tobacco-caused
mortality as a whole and by main tobacco-related diseases in Kazakhstan, the Russian
Federation, and Ukraine, and to assess the distributional health impact of an increase in tobacco
taxation in these three countries. According to the results obtained, in 2012 smoking caused
around 310,000 deaths in Russia, about 70,000 in Ukraine and 14,300 in Kazakhstan,
representing a key factor of mortality among the working-age population. Using data from
various sources, the paper estimates the distributional consequences of a hypothetical tax rise in
the three countries that leads to an approximately 30 percent increase of the average retail price
of cigarettes. The analysis includes an estimation of changes in smoking prevalence, mortality,
life expectancy, and public health expenditures by income quintile and gender. Considered
excise growth could lead to about 3.5 to 4.0 percent fall in smoking prevalence, which in turn
could avert about 600,000 tobacco-related deaths in Russia, 140,000 in Ukraine, and 30,000 in
Kazakhstan over a 50 years period. Reduced tobacco-related morbidity would also result in
substantial decrease in health expenditures for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Positive
health effects are expected to be pro-poor, as almost 60 percent of the reduction in mortality is
concentrated in the two lower-income quintiles of the population of the three countries.

Smoking causes significant economic and health losses in the post-Soviet countries where
smoking prevalence, traditionally high, increased significantly during the last twenty years. In
the Russian Federation, where the prevalence of tobacco smoking among males rose from less
than 50 percent in the mid-1980s to 60 to 65 percent in the 2000s (GATS 2009), the annual
tobacco-related mortality was estimated in 2009 as 280,000 (Maslennikova and Oganov 2011),
or 14 percent of total mortality.
Smoking is rapidly becoming popular among females, especially in Russia ‚Äî according to WHO
statistics, in 2010 the prevalence of current smoking of any tobacco product among females in
Russia was 22 percent (WHO GHO 2014) compared to less than 10 percent in the 1980s (Cooper
1982). In Kazakhstan and in Ukraine 10 and 11 percent, respectively, of females smoked in 2010
according to data reported by WHO (WHO GHO 2014).
Another widely discussed characteristic is the low price elasticity of tobacco consumption in
Russia and Ukraine that has been estimated to not exceed -0.3 (Ross et al. 2012; Arzhenovsky
2006; and Lukinykh and Zasimova 2009). Among possible explanations the researchers mention
a wide range of prices, supported by the tobacco industry, and high social acceptability of
smoking (Peng and Ross 2009). On the other hand, there are no estimates in the literature for the
price elasticity of tobacco consumption in Kazakhstan.
Cigarette excises and retail prices are traditionally low in post-Soviet countries. Even in Ukraine
where tobacco taxes were raised substantially in 2008‚Äì10, excise on filtered cigarettes in 2012
was almost five times less than the average excise for the European region of WHO in 2010.
Kazakhstan is characterized by the lowest level of tobacco excise, as taxes reached only about 15
percent of the average retail price of cigarettes in 2012.

Source: Authors‚Äô estimates based on national official statistics (Kazstat 2014, Rosstat 2014, and Ukrstat 2014) and
WHO data (WHO GHO 2014).

Tobacco taxation is widely acknowledged as an effective policy measure to curb tobacco
consumption (Chaloupka et al. 2010), but it has been traditionally considered regressive because
of the relatively higher incidence that the tax would have on the income of the poorer segments
of the population (Warner 2000). However, recent studies based on Chinese and Indian data (see
Verguet et al. 2013; and Murphy et al. 2012) using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA)
(Verguet et al. 2014) have shown that due to stronger health effects on poorer income groups,
excise taxes should be considered as a pro-poor (i.e., progressive) policy measure.
The main objectives of this paper are to estimate the burden of tobacco-caused mortality as a
whole and by main tobacco-related diseases in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, and to assess
the distributional health impact of an increase in tobacco taxation in these three countries.
We estimate the distributional consequences of a hypothetical tax rise in the considered countries
that leads to an approximately 30 percent increase of the average retail price. In this study we use
micro-data of specialized surveys (Global Adult Tobacco Survey-GATS for Russia and Ukraine,
and Household Health Survey for Kazakhstan), which helps create a model with mortality rate
per age group and cause of death with and without smoking.
The analysis includes an estimation of changes in smoking prevalence, mortality, life
expectancy, and public health expenditures by income quintile and gender. Tobacco-related
losses are also estimated (for example, tobacco-related mortality by age and causes, losses in life
expectancy caused by smoking).
According to the results obtained, in 2012 smoking caused more than 300,000 deaths in Russia
and about 70,000 in Ukraine and 14,300 in Kazakhstan, representing a key factor of mortality
among the working-age population. However, the Kazakhstan health survey used in the analysis
shows a smoking prevalence that is significantly lower than other estimate (e.g., WHO GHO
2014). Therefore, the data used for Kazakhstan may lead to both lower model estimates of health
losses due to smoking and expected health effects of hypothetical tobacco excise growth.
According to our estimations, considered excise growth could lead to about 3.5 to 4.0 percent fall
in smoking prevalence, which in turn could reduce tobacco-related mortality by about 30,000 in
Kazakhstan, 600,000 in Russia, and 140,000 in Ukraine.
Reduced tobacco-related mortality and morbidity would result in substantial decrease in health
expenditures for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases: the expected reduction can be
estimated as more than US$50 million in Kazakhstan, more than US$2 billion in Russia, and
US$180 million in Ukraine.
Positive health effects are expected to be pro-poor ‚Äî almost 60 percent of reduced mortality is
observed within two lower-income quintiles, which means that the poor would benefit more from
health improvements due to the tobacco tax increase.

                                              2. METHODOLOGY
                                                        DATA
Our estimates are based mainly on official information published by national agencies of
statistics, 1 WHO, and on micro-data:

    ‚Ä¢    Kazakhstan: Household Health Survey held by the Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan and
         the World Bank, 2012
    ‚Ä¢    Russia: GATS, 2009
    ‚Ä¢    Ukraine: GATS, 2010 2


It is worth mentioning that survey data used in the analysis for Kazakhstan give a considerably
lower estimate of smoking prevalence (34 percent for men and 2 percent for women) than
reported by WHO 3 (52 percent for men and 9 percent for women). GATS survey is not held in
Kazakhstan, so the Kazakhstan health survey is the only available source of micro-data on
smoking in the country. However, it is possible that these data underestimate smoking
prevalence in the country, which in turn leads to lower model estimates of health losses as well
as lower expected health effects of hypothetical tobacco excise increase.
                                                     METHODS
In our analysis we use a modeling approach similar to the ones used in Verguet et al. (2013) and
Jha et al. (2012). We estimate health effects across income quintiles, gender, 4 and five-year age
cohort, over a fifty years period with five-year intervals.
Health effects of increased taxation derive from the reduction of premature mortality from
tobacco-related diseases. The greatest effect of one-time tobacco-control intervention such as
excise increase would be observed after 25 to 30 years when a substantial fraction of tobacco-
caused deaths occur. 5
To estimate health losses due to smoking and expected health benefits of tobacco tax increase,
the following steps are taken.




1. Federal State Statistics Service of Russian Federation (official site
http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/en/main/); Agency of Statistics of the Republic of
Kazakhstan (official site http://www.stat.gov.kz/faces/home); and State Statistics Service of Ukraine (official site
http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/).
2. GATS data for Russia and Ukraine are available online at http://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSData/default/default.aspx.
3. See WHO GHO 2014.
4. The effect for female population in Kazakhstan was not calculated because of the low smoking prevalence
estimated in the country.
5. See time distribution of preliminary mortality avoided by tobacco-control intervention in (Jha et al. 2006).
                                                           9
Step 1. Estimating changes in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related mortality
First, we estimate the change in smoking prevalence after the considered tax increase. An excise
tax hike leads to an increase of the average retail price, which in turn, through a price elasticity
mechanism (see the assumptions on price elasticities of demand and participation in Table 1.4)
causes a fall in smoking prevalence.
Given changes in smoking prevalence, we obtain the reduction in tobacco-related disease‚Äì
specific mortality. In our calculations we use the assumptions from earlier research on age
probabilities of avoiding tobacco-related death after smoking cessation (Ranson et al. 2002) 6 and
the risks of premature mortality for long-term smokers (Jha et al. 2006). 7
Step 2. Estimating the number of years gained by reduced tobacco-related mortality
To estimate the number of life years gained by reduction in premature mortality, we need to
compare life expectancy for smokers and nonsmokers. This can be done on the basis of mortality
and smoking prevalence data as well as through estimates for relative risks of dying prematurely
from tobacco-related diseases.
To calculate life expectancy at different ages for smokers and nonsmokers, we use the relative
risk data from earlier research (see WHO 2012 and Danaei et al. 2009). The relative risk for a
specified disease is the risk of dying from it among smokers relative to nonsmokers. Seven main
causes of tobacco-related mortality are considered: ischemic disease, stroke, other cardiovascular
diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other respiratory diseases, lung cancer,
and other neoplasms. The values of relative risks for main tobacco-related diseases used in the
research are presented in the Table 1.1.

Note: The relative risk presents the ratio between the probability of death for a smoker and the probability of death
for a nonsmoker. Therefore, the relative risk of diseases that are not caused by tobacco is equal to 1.0.




6. 95 percent of quitters age 15 to 29 will avoid tobacco-related deaths, while it is only 75 percent of quitters age 30
to 39, 70 percent of quitters age 40 to 49, 50 percent of quitters age 50 to 59, and 10 percent of quitters age 60 or
older who will avoid tobacco-related deaths.
7. Between one-half and two-thirds of long-term smokers would eventually die from tobacco-related illnesses. In the
model we use a more conservative variant (the risk of premature mortality for a long-term smoker is 50 percent).
8. Due to incomplete data of mortality by causes, we had to aggregate relative risks for different types of cancers.
                                                           10
Knowing the values of relative risks (RR) and the number of deaths from specified diseases for
five-year age cohorts, one can split the total number of deaths for those representing smokers and
nonsmokers:

Then we use the standard life table technique 9 to estimate life expectancy of smokers and
nonsmokers at age x given the observed five-year age-specific death rates for them (5Mx=5Dx/5Nx,
where 5Dx is the number of deaths between ages x and x+5, and 5Nx is the mid-year population in
age interval x and x+5). Within these calculations, the following characteristics are computed:

      ‚Ä¢      5qx ‚Äî probability of dying between ages x and x+5
      ‚Ä¢      lx ‚Äî number of people left alive at age x (in the cohort of 100,000 births)
      ‚Ä¢      5dx ‚Äî number of people dying between ages x and x+5 (in the cohort of 100,000 births)
      ‚Ä¢      5Lx ‚Äî number of person-years lived between ages x and x+5 (in the cohort of 100,000
             births)
      ‚Ä¢      Tx ‚Äî person-years lived above age x, and finally expectation of life at age x (in the cohort
             of 100,000 births)
      ‚Ä¢      ex ‚Äî life expectancy at age x


Step 3. Estimating the reduction in public health expenditures for treatment of tobacco-related
diseases
To estimate the reduction in expenditures for treatment of tobacco-related diseases, we first
estimate input of each of seven main causes (ischemic disease, stroke, other cardiovascular
diseases, COPD, other respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and other neoplasms) in total tobacco-
caused mortality.
Subsequently, taking into account probability of health care utilization for different diseases
taken from the earlier research (Verguet at al. 2013) 10 and estimated tobacco-related diseases
treatment costs, we obtain the expected changes of public health expenditures. Tobacco-related
diseases treatment costs were estimated on the basis of the medical-economic standards of one
Russian region and subsequently indexed to Kazakhstan and Ukraine using WHO data on per
capita public health expenditures (see Table 1.5 for details).
We also try to take into account the fact that a younger smoker who is expected to die from
tobacco-caused disease needs more public health expenditures during his life time than an older
person whose treatment was probably paid off by the health care system earlier. So we suppose


9. See, for example, the description of period life table construction in Preston 2001, p. 49.
10. 80 percent for ischemic disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases; 50 percent for cancer; and 33 percent
for respiratory diseases.
                                                                                  11
that the expected number of utilizations of health care during a lifespan depends on the age of the
person suffering from the tobacco-caused disease (assumed to be 2.0 for smokers age 15 to 30,
1.8 for smokers age 30 to 45, 1.5 for smokers age 45 to 60, and 1.0 for others).
To estimate total health expenditures avoided due to fall in smoking prevalence, we applied
country data on general government expenditures on health as a percentage of total expenditure
on health reported by WHO 11 to estimate previously avoided public health expenditures.
To check the sensitivity of obtained results, we consider several values of price elasticity of
demand ‚Äî two values for Ukraine: -0.3 (basic) and -0.4 (higher); and three values for Russia and
Kazakhstan: -0.3 (basic), -.0.2 (lower), and -0.3 (higher).
                                              BASIC ASSUMPTIONS
INITIAL EXCISE CHANGE
Due to significant differences in VAT and share of excise in average retail prices between the
countries, 12 the same increase of excise will lead to different changes in average retail price (see
the table below).

To obtain the close changes in the average retail price, we are going to consider the following:

    ‚Ä¢    200 percent excise change in Kazakhstan (36 percent change of average retail price)
    ‚Ä¢    100 percent excise change in Russia (32 percent change of average retail price)
    ‚Ä¢    50 percent excise change in Ukraine (28 percent change of average retail price)

12. In 2012 the share of excise in the average retail price was about 16 percent in Kazakhstan, 27 percent in Russia,
and 46 percent in Ukraine (see Table 1.2).

PRICE ELASTICITIES OF DEMAND AND PREVALENCE
As stated in numerous research (see Arzhenovsky 2006; Lukinykh and Zasimova 2009 for
Russia; Ross et al. 2012 for Ukraine), the price elasticity of demand on tobacco is low in Ukraine




                                                                                                      13
and Russia. There exist no empirical estimates of price elasticity for Kazakhstan, except for
expert assumptions about its size. 13
Ross et al. (2012) estimate price elasticity of demand in Ukraine during the period of sharp rise
of excises as 0.3. Relatively low price responsiveness of demand in the country can be explained
by a set of factors, such as a wide range of prices (when a smoker can switch to less expensive
brands instead of decreasing consumption), high social acceptability of smoking, as well as
limited efforts to introduce additional measures to control tobacco use (see also Peng and Ross
2009). Empirical data from Ukraine (Krasovsky 2013) show that the price growth in 2009‚Äì10
had a long-term effect mainly on younger and poorer people.
To analyze changes in smoking prevalence and consumption, we have to use estimates for
elasticities 14 of smoking prevalence (Œµprevalence) and intensity (Œµintensity). Taking into account that
price elasticity of demand Œµtotal follows the rule Œµtotal=Œµprevalence+Œµintensity, we assume the following:

    ‚Ä¢    Absolute value of demand of cigarettes depends negatively on incomes: the demand of
         the higher income group is more inelastic.
    ‚Ä¢    Total price elasticity of demand is low (about -0.3 for Ukraine and -0.2 for Kazakhstan
         and Russia).
    ‚Ä¢    The demand for cigarettes among the richest income group is twice less elastic than
         among the middle-income groups (that is, third quintiles) 15 and three times less elastic
         than among lowest-income groups (quintiles one and two).
    ‚Ä¢    Smokers from the highest-income quintile are almost insensitive to price changes, as
         shown in Ukraine data (Krasovsky 2013).
    ‚Ä¢    Elasticity of participation is assumed to be half of the price elasticity of demand.
These assumptions allow us to estimate elasticities of demand and participation presented in the
table below. We undertake sensitivity analysis by comparing the results for three price elasticity
estimates: lower (-0.2), basic (-0.3), and higher (-0.4) (see annex 2 with main results
comparison).

14. Only long-run elasticities were considered.
15. According to Krasovsky et al. (2002), price elasticity within the high-income group was 0.15, while it was 0.28
and 0.33 within low-income and middle-income groups, respectively (for smokers age 29 and older).

V (see Verguet et al. [2013] and Murphy et al. [2013]).

To estimate tobacco-related diseases treatment costs for Russia, we used data of regional medical
economic standards for one Russian region (Sverdlovsk region). 17 Such standards are developed
at the regional level to estimate the cost of the benefit package provided under the Federal
Mandatory Health Insurance system also known as Program of State Guarantees for Medical
Care Provision Free of Charge. The estimated costs of tobacco-related diseases treatment for
Russia both in national currency and in US dollars are presented in Table 1.5.
Since there was insufficient data to estimate similar treatment costs for Kazakhstan and Ukraine,
we indexed the treatment costs for Russia to the ratio of per capita public health expenditures of
Kazakhstan and Ukraine. In support of this method, it can be argued that 25 years ago these
countries were part of the same health systems and that the relative costs of treating the same
disease across the three countries are still comparable.

                                HEALTH LOSSES DUE TO TOBACCO USE
Smoking substantially decreases life expectancy due to higher relative risks of tobacco-caused
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (ischemic disease and stroke), COPD, various types of
cancer, and other diseases. Life expectancy in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine is low; these
countries experienced a significant mortality crisis in the post-Soviet period. However, smoking
is not the sole contributory factor for higher mortality and lower life expectancy ‚Äî influence of
factors such as alcohol consumption, unhealthy lifestyle, and low health system performance are
also important (Shkolnikov et al. 2013). That is why Kazakh, Russian, or Ukrainian smokers
would gain less from avoiding tobacco-caused death than smokers in countries with higher life
expectancy. Therefore, estimates derived from countries where contributory factors are less

important, for example Britain (see Doll et al. 2004) would overestimate the health effect if
applied to the countries examined in the paper.
According to our estimates, in Kazakhstan the highest difference in life expectancy of
nonsmokers and smokers is observed at the age of 35 and exceeds 7 years for men and 8 years
for women. In Russia the number of years of life gained for avoiding tobacco-caused mortality
was about 7.0 years at age 30, about 6.5 years at age 40, about 6 years at age 50, and about 5
years at age 60. In Ukraine the highest difference in life expectancy of nonsmokers and smokers
is observed at the age of 35 and amounts to about 7 years for both men and women (see table
1.6).

The numbers of deaths caused by tobacco-related diseases estimated by the model are presented
in table 1.7. In 2012 in Kazakhstan smoking caused about 14,300 deaths among men and
600 deaths among women, or about 15,000 deaths within the whole population. However, as
mentioned before, smoking prevalence in Kazakhstan estimated using the 2012 Household
Health Survey is significantly lower that other estimates, which may lead to lower estimates for
both health losses due to smoking and expected health effects of hypothetical tobacco excise




18. In this table only life expectancies for age 30 and older are presented (from this age mortality rates for smokers
and nonsmokers begin to differ significantly). For population age 15 to 30, following the results by Doll et al.
(2004), we assume that difference in life expectancy is only one year more than for age 30 to 35.

growth. For example, according to national Ministry of Health data, annually, about 25,000
adults die prematurely from tobacco-caused diseases. 19
Diseases caused by smoking are responsible for 18 percent of all male mortality in Kazakhstan
and 1 percent of all female mortality. In middle age (from 30 to 59 years), the input of smoking
in overall mortality is 25 percent for men and 2 percent for women. Obtained results seem to
underestimate losses caused by smoking due to lower reported smoking prevalence.
According to our estimates, in 2012 in Russia smoking caused about 265,000 deaths among men
and 45,000 deaths among women, or 310,000 in total. In earlier research (Maslennikova and
Oganov 2011), similar losses in 2009 were estimated as about 280,000 in total. Diseases caused
by smoking are responsible for 24 percent of all male mortality and 5 percent of all female
mortality. In middle age (from 30 to 59 years), the input of smoking in overall mortality is quite
impressive: 31 percent for men and 16 percent for women.
In Ukraine, in 2012 smoking was the cause of about 65,000 deaths among men and 6,000 deaths
among women, or 71,000 within the whole population. Diseases caused by smoking are
responsible for 19 percent of all male mortality and 2 percent of all female mortality. In middle
age (from 30 to 59 years), the input of smoking in overall mortality is 29 percent for men and 9
percent for women.

Finally, table 1.8 presents the relative importance of the different types of tobacco-caused
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (ischemic disease and stroke), COPD, various types of
cancer, and other diseases. In Kazakhstan more than 55 percent of male and more than 60
percent of female tobacco-related mortality is caused by cardiovascular diseases.

In Russia cardiovascular diseases were the cause of more than 58 percent of all tobacco-related
mortality. In the earlier research on Russian data (Maslennikova and Oganov 2011), this
indicator was estimated in 2009 as 63 percent.
In Ukraine cardiovascular diseases accounted for 58 percent of male and more than 70 percent of
female tobacco-related mortality. It is worth mentioning the crucial role of cardiovascular
diseases in total mortality in Russia and Ukraine. The phenomenon of high input of
cardiovascular diseases in total mortality in Russia and Ukraine is well known and extensively
discussed in the literature (see, for example, Mesl√© and Vallin 2012). 20

                    EXPECTED HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOBACCO EXCISE INCREASE
The expected results of 200 percent excise growth in Kazakhstan, 100 percent excise growth in
Russia, and 50 percent in Ukraine (leading to 36 percent, 32 percent, and 28 percent average
retail price growth, respectively) are presented in Table 1.9 (males) and table 1.10 (females). The
results for Kazakhstan are reported for males only, since smoking prevalence among females is
almost negligible according to the Kazakhstan Household Health Survey.
Smoking prevalence among males in Kazakhstan is expected to fall by 4 percent on average, and
6 percent in the poorest quintile. Tobacco-related mortality among males would fall by 28,000,
and due to higher price sensitivity about 55 percent of this decrease in mortality would be
observed within the two poorest income quintiles. Reduced premature mortality of males in


20. Among the main causes, the researchers mention high mortality from cardiovascular diseases in younger ages
(due to alcohol abuse, smoking, and inappropriate health care); high mortality from external causes; and
overestimation of this type of mortality in mortality statistics. Authors are grateful to Evgeny Andreev for useful
comments.

Kazakhstan would decrease long-term public health expenditures on treatment of tobacco-related
diseases by US$31 million 21 and total health expenditures by US$53 million.
As a result of a 100 percent excise increase, the smoking prevalence in Russia is expected to
decrease by 3.6 to 3.8 percent among the adult population and by 5.4 percent in the poorest
quintile. A large number of those who would quit smoking would be able to avoid tobacco-
related diseases: about 430,000 males and 180,000 females, or more than 600,000 in total. The
effects of increased tobacco taxation would be concentrated in the lower-income groups ‚Äî about
60 percent of males (54 percent for females) who are expected to avoid premature mortality
belong to the two poorest income quintiles. The decrease of tobacco-related mortality in Russia
would accrue about 4 million years of life (2.9 million for males and 1.2 billion for females).
Public health expenditures averted can be estimated as more than US$1.3 billion, 22 while the
reduction of total health expenditures, including private health expenditure would be more than
US$2.2 billion.
The lower effect of excise tax increase on the health of the poorest females can be explained by
the lower impact of income on female smoking. In Russia, the dependence of smoking
prevalence on incomes is not as distinct as in some other counties, such as China (Verguet et al.
2013) or India (Murphy et al. 2012). For example, in India the prevalence of smoking in the
poorest income quintile is twice as large as in the wealthiest quintile. 23 In Russia, on the
contrary, no significant differences were observed in smoking rates among income quintiles, nor
does smoking prevalence tend to rise or fall with income growth. Several possible explanations
can be suggested for these trends. First, smoking is too widespread in Russia; it affects the whole
population, not just selected groups. Also different tendencies are superimposed on one another:
richer citizens tend to live healthier lifestyles and smoke less, while for women, especially young
women, smoking still remains a symbol of independence and emancipation.
According to our estimations, the expected results of 50 percent excise growth and subsequent
28 percent average retail price growth in Ukraine could lead to a reduction in smoking
prevalence of 3.4 percent on average and 4.7 percent within the two poorest quintiles. Tobacco-
related mortality among males would fall by almost 140,000, due to higher price sensitivity; 62
percent of this decrease in mortality would be observed within the two poorest income quintiles.
Reduced premature mortality would allow lower public health expenditures on treatment of
tobacco-related diseases by more than US$90 million 24 and on total health expenditures by
US$180 million.

The results of sensitivity analysis for different price elasticity estimates are presented in annex 2.


                     4. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The paper presented the estimated distributional consequences of a hypothetical one-time
increase in tobacco excise tax that leads to approximately 30 percent increase of average retail
cigarettes price.
Tobacco smoking is widespread in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, especially among males,
although the numbers of female smokers is increasing significantly in all three countries. As a
result smoking leads to vast health losses ‚Äî it is one of the main causes of adult and working-
age mortality ‚Äî and economic costs.
In spite of high smoking prevalence and significant health losses, tobacco excise policy remains
rather low in the countries included in the research. Absolute and relative tobacco excises are
low, especially when compared to excises in European countries. Low level of tobacco excise
policy combined with high social acceptability of smoking and a wide range of prices for
different brands of cigarettes explain the low price elasticity of demand for tobacco that is typical
for the countries included in the research.

                                                        21
According to our estimations, the excise increase considered in the study would lead to about 3.5
to 4.0 percent fall in smoking prevalence, which in the long term would allow reductions in
tobacco-related mortality by about 30,000 in Kazakhstan, 600,000 in Russia, and 140,000 in
Ukraine.
Positive health effects are expected to be pro-poor as showed in figure 1.3. Due to higher
absolute values of price elasticity for tobacco products among low-income groups, the poor are
more price-sensitive to tobacco control measures. According to modeling results, the expected
health effects would be concentrated in the lower-income groups ‚Äî almost 60 percent of
reduced mortality is observed within the two poorest income quintiles.

Reduced tobacco-related morbidity would substantially decrease health expenditures for
treatment of tobacco-related diseases: the expected reduction can be estimated as more than
US$50 million in Kazakhstan, more than US$2 billion in Russia, and US$180 million in
Ukraine. Thus, according to the obtained results (see table 1.11), considered tobacco excise
increase would have a significant health effect in terms of mortality reduction and years of life
gained. Since the poor are more price-responsive than the rich, they benefit more from the health
improvements effected by the growth of excises. Another important outcome of toughening of
state excise policy is a noticeable reduction of health expenditures on tobacco-caused diseases
treatment.

   ANNEX 2. EXPECTED HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOBACCO EXCISE INCREASE FOR
   LOWER ESTIMATE OF PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND FOR KAZAKHSTAN AND
                               RUSSIA
Due to scarcity of data on price elasticity of demand on cigarettes in Kazakhstan and Russia, we
used two variants of elasticity‚Äôs value ‚Äî basic (-0.3) and lower (-0.2). For sensitivity reasons we
also estimated expected health effects for higher value of elasticity (-0.4), although -0.4 is quite a
high value of elasticity, especially for Russia and Kazakhstan. The results for the basic value of
elasticity are included in the main part of the report, while the results for lower and higher values
are presented here.

The main objectives of this paper are to estimate the burden of tobacco-caused mortality as a
whole and by the main tobacco-related diseases in Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and
Ukraine, and to assess the distributional health impact of an increase in tobacco taxation in these
three countries. In 2012, smoking caused around 310,000 deaths in Russia, about 70,000 in
Ukraine and 14,300 in Kazakhstan, representing a key factor of mortality among the working-
age population. Using data from various sources, the paper estimates the distributional
consequences of a hypothetical tax rise in the three countries that leads to an approximately 30
percent increase of the average retail price of cigarettes. The analysis includes an estimation of
changes in smoking prevalence, mortality, life expectancy, and public health expenditures by
income quintile and gender. Considered excise growth could lead to about 3.5 to 4.0 percent fall
in smoking prevalence, which in turn could avert about 600,000 tobacco-related deaths in Russia,
140,000 in Ukraine, and 30,000 in Kazakhstan over a period of 50 years. Reduced tobacco-
related morbidity would also result in a substantial decrease in health expenditures for the
treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Positive health effects are expected to be pro-poor, as
almost 60 percent of the reduction in mortality is concentrated in the two lower-income quintiles
of the population of the three countries.

  Abstract
 Many African countries rely on sporadic land transfers                             fear of land loss, although not exclusively due to estates, is
 from customary to statutory domains to attract investment                          associated with a 12 percent productivity loss for females,
 and improve agricultural performance. Data from 15,000                             which is large enough to finance a low-cost tenure regular-
 smallholders and 800 estates in Malawi allow exploring the                         ization program; and (iii) failure to collect realistic land rents
 long-term effects of such a strategy. The results suggest that                     implies public revenue losses of up to US$50 million per year.

          Gender-differentiated impacts of tenure insecurity on agricultural performance in
                                 Malawiâ€™s customary tenure systems



1. Introduction

In most African countries, land access continues to be governed by customary tenure systems. These have
long been argued to provide high levels of tenure security and flexibility at a cost well below that of â€˜modernâ€™
arrangements (Bruce and Migot-Adholla 1994). Yet, studies also highlight that, with population pressure,
these systems face increasing pressure: Unclear rules on how to deal with outsiders â€“whether migrants or
foreign investorsâ€“ can trigger disputes, undermining investment (Berry 2009; Fenske 2010) and
productivity (Linkow 2016). Bias against women may further compromise tenure security and productive
resource use (Fenske 2011; Goldstein and Udry 2006), with women more likely to be affected by disputes
and to suffer productivity losses than men (Deininger and Castagnini 2006). Unclear institutional
responsibilities may lead to proliferation and persistence of conflict (Eck 2014). To respond to this
challenge, countries aim to either comprehensively formalize tenure or to carve out land deemed to be
unutilized from customary arrangements sporadically. Yet, the limited sustainability of past efforts at
systematic formalization is well documented (Atwood 1990; Pinckney and Kimuyu 1994) and although
more recent efforts imply that lower-cost approaches may provide a viable option (Ali et al. 2014a), the
verdict on their sustainability is still out (Ali et al. 2016a). Yet, the alternative of carving out land from the
customary domain for â€˜commercialâ€™ development on a case by case basis raises equity and productivity
issues (Sitko et al. 2014).

To contribute to this discussion, this paper assesses estatesâ€™ impact on productivity and neighborsâ€™ tenure
security decades after their establishment in Malawi, a country that underwent a burst of estate creation in
the 1980s and is thus ideal for such an exploration. We use the 2006/07 National Census of Agriculture and
Livestock (NACAL) that contains data on smallholders and estates for descriptive and analytical evidence.
Descriptively, we find that, although estates occupy more than 20% of Malawiâ€™s agricultural area, a large
part of their land is left unutilized and, for most crops, their productivity remains well below that of
smallholders. Data from digitizing estate leases suggest that legal uncertainty created by the expiration of
most leases and failure to collect realistic lease fees lead to large loss of public revenue, beyond weakening
incentives for more effective land use and land market operation: Even assuming that 40% of the area
registered under agricultural estates is non-existent or unsuitable for agriculture, leasing the remainder at

the median rent of US$53/ha & year that, as per the last household survey, smallholders are willing to pay,1
could generate annual income of some US$50 million, equivalent to almost 5% of Malawiâ€™s public revenue.

Beyond failing to live up to expectations in terms of productive development, estate development also does
not seem to have reduced tenure insecurity: with 22% of farmers concerned about losing their land and 21%
fearing encroachment, tenure insecurity is high. It is particularly pronounced among the poor, households
not born in the village or engaged in land transactions or who had a land dispute in the past, and in villages
close to an estate with no more land to be distributed. By comparison, impacts of matrilineal inheritance, a
factor emphasized in the recent literature, seem modest at best. Including fear of land loss in a production
function suggests that insecure tenure is associated with a 12% point output reduction for women but not
for men. In principle, comparing the present value of productivity gains due to program-induced reductions
in tenure insecurity to program costs would allow to decide if systematic regularization can economically
justify an alternative to demand-driven estate development. This implies that if a tenure regularization
program as implemented in Rwanda at a cost of US$5 to US$6 per parcel (Nkurunziza 2015) could
eliminate insecurity in Malawi, its benefits would be more than sufficient to recoup the costs. Carefully
designed and evaluated pilots that pay particular attention to womenâ€™s rights and overlap with estate leases
could help not only to deal with the issue of estate lease renewal, but also inform implementation of recently
adopted Land Bills. If success can be demonstrated and regulations to implement at larger scale passed,
they could provide significant economic benefits.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two puts Malawiâ€™s land tenure system in context
by describing its evolution, highlighting questions to be analyzed, and drawing out their relevance for recent
debates on land legislation. Section three presents the sample and descriptive evidence on s mallholdersâ€™
and estatesâ€™ intensity of land use and productivity and the size and potential lease fees from estates. Section
four discusses econometric results on determinants and productivity impacts of perceived tenure insecurity
by male and female users. Section five concludes by drawing out implications for policy and future research.

2. Context, issues, and link to the literature

While dating back to colonial times, Malawiâ€™s dualistic agrarian structure was reinforced by the creation of
estates on more than 20% of the countryâ€™s area in the late 1980s and limitations on smallholdersâ€™ market
participation. While the latter were eased in the 1990s, debates on land tenure remained inconclusive and
opinions on next steps remained divided. Quantitative evidence can help put issues in perspective and point

  Data are from the 2010/11 Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3). We chose willingness to pay because it is slightly lower than the median
rent paid (US $55/ha and year) and because it is based on responses from close to 90% of the sample rather than only those participating in markets.
                                                                        3
out challenges to be confronted. This is particularly relevant to be aware of the challenges to be confronted
in implementing the recently passed land Bills.

2.1 The evolution of Malawiâ€™s agrarian structure and land tenure system

Malawi has a dualistic farm structure that juxtaposes freehold or leasehold estates focused on â€˜commercialâ€™
activity with a customary sector emphasizing food crops. With 177 persons per km2 in 2014, population
density is high. During colonial times, cultivation of tobacco, the countryâ€™s main cash and export crop, was
restricted to white settlers who had preferential access to land, labor, and credit (Binswanger et al. 1995),
and guaranteed market access via a quota system (Mataya and Tsonga 2001). After independence in 1964,
estate land was transferred to Malawians (Jaffee 2003) with direct and indirect public support:2 Until 1994,
only estates were allowed to produce tobacco and smallholders had to sell output to the marketing board at
low prices. The surplus thus generated was funneled to estate owners in the form of soft loans, thus
providing an implicit subsidy that reinforced the dualistic structure of the countryâ€™s agriculture (Kydd and
Christiansen 1982). Thereafter, tobacco quotas were gradually extended to smallholders by licensing clubs
of 10-30 members. Rapid take-up led to marked improvements in socio-economic indicators (Jaffee 2003)
and soon brought small farmersâ€™ share in tobacco production to some 70% (Lea and Hanmer 2009).

Although debated since the mid-1990s, no corresponding changes were made in the countryâ€™s land system.
To accommodate pent-up demand for land to cultivate commercial crops, 30,000 to 50,000 estates of 10-
30 hectares each were carved out of what was deemed unutilized customary land and transferred to aspiring
farmers in the late 1980s, largely via 21-year leaseholds (Devereux 1997),3 before a 1994 moratorium to
stop new estate establishment.4 With records on paper only, data on the size and performance of the estate
sector, including the amount of land leased to estates, total land rent owed to government, and levels of
land utilization, remained scant,5 making it difficult to design policy to fully utilize the sectorâ€™s potential.6

2.2 Efforts to improve tenure security

Malawiâ€™s customary sector, long characterized by egalitarian of land access and great diversity between
different inheritance systems, has come under strain due to population growth, land scarcity (Ricker-Gilbert
et al. 2014) and urban expansion that increased prices (Takane 2008). Land transactions with outsiders not

2
  Transactions were directly supported through loans from the Farmers Marketing Board (FMB), a successor to the Native Tobacco Board, later
transformed into the Agricultural Development and Marketing Cooperative (ADMARC). Indirect support came from restricting tobacco cultivation
by smallholders and from establishing ADMARC as the sole marketing option with a power to fix prices (Mandondo and German 2015).
3
  As access to a minimum of 12 ha of land was required to access tobacco marketing quotas, an unknown number of so-called â€˜ghost estatesâ€™ was
established, often in office-based processes without corresponding to actual land on the ground.
4
  Failure to recognize customary rights â€“reinforced by subsidies that benefit the rich (Chinsinga and Poulton 2014)â€“ was a key reason why even
prima facie successful expansion of tobacco cultivation may have had mixed socio-economic impacts (Mandondo and German 2015).
5
  A 1997 study that aimed to obtain more precise figures faced difficulties due to the parlous state of records. It estimates that leasehold estates
cover less than 1 mn. ha while smallholders on customary land account for the remainder of the countryâ€™s agricultural area (Gossage 1997).
6
  A resettlement program to partly address this increased beneficiariesâ€™ food security but may have jeopardized womenâ€™s rights (Mueller et al.
2014). Little is known about the extent to which this program addressed the issue of â€˜idle estatesâ€™ or was the most cost-effective way for doing so.
                                                                         4
only became more frequent but were also frequently challenged ex post (van Donge 1999), with a possibility
of disputes surfacing even after long periods of dormancy (Jul-Larsen and Mvula 2007). Land tenure reform
has long been advocated to improve tenure security, encourage investment and effectiveness of land use
(Fenske 2011; Lawry et al. 2016) as well as operation of land markets (Ali et al. 2014b), and female
empowerment (Ali et al. 2016b; Newman et al. 2015).

To pursue such reform, a Presidential Commission was established in 1996 and submitted a report (Saidi
1999) that prompted adoption of a National Land Policy and implementation strategy in 2002. Draft
legislation was submitted to Parliament in 2006 but no action was taken for a decade.7 Substantive concerns
have been raised regarding the Billsâ€™ failure to acknowledge complex local realities (Peters and Kambewa
2007), in particular (i) recognition of land rental and sales instead of either outlawing them or making them
contingent on Ministerial approval; (ii) potentially adverse gender impacts of registering land in the name
of (male) heads and requiring equal inheritance by all children that may conflict with deep-rooted norms
(Peters 2010) or, in matrilineal systems, undermine femalesâ€™ bargaining power (Telalagic 2014);8 and (iii)
a danger of local land committees becoming politicized (Chinsinga 2011).

Whether tenure regularization efforts are warranted and the form they should take depends on incidence,
levels, and productivity impacts of perceived tenure insecurity. Despite its relevance for policy, studies of
this topic are limited.9 In Burkina Faso conflict risk -emanating largely from migrants- was estimated to
have reduced agricultural productivity by at least 8.9% (Linkow 2016). In Uganda, females have been
shown to be more likely to be involved in land disputes, many inheritance-related, and this is estimated to
reduce investment by close to 7% (Deininger and Castagnini 2006). In the case of Malawi, Place and Otsuka
(2001), Lunduka (2009), and Lovo (2016) postulate that discrepancy between males as prime decision-
maker and femalesâ€™ land ownership in matrilineal/matrilocal systems is a key source of tenure insecurity
with negative impacts on investment and provide some evidence to support this notion with data.

Assessing the size of productivity impacts of perceived tenure insecurity and the extent to which they vary
by gender allows us put this into context and to assess whether, beyond being statistically significant,
investment disincentives due to the inheritance regime are economically meaningful, and to draw out policy

  In Sept. 2016, four out of ten bills aiming to ensure action on this front were passed by Parliament. While action will be impossible without
passage of additional pieces, in particular the land registration Bill, drafting implementing regulations in line with current technological possibilities
and ground realities will require careful piloting.
8
  Facilitating female ownership of assets through informal and formal institutions does not, on its own, increase welfare when appropriate
complementary resources and institutions are absent (Bhaumik et al. 2016).
9
  While a number of studies have explored impacts of efforts to improve tenure security (Deininger and Jin 2006), perceived tenure insecurity has
received surprisingly little attention in the literature. (Holden et al. 2011).
                                                                              5
implications, noting that from an economic perspective, intervention programs are warranted only if the
impacts of tenure insecurity are larger than the cost of implementing a program to reduce tenure insecurity.10

3. Data and descriptive evidence

Descriptive data highlight three results. First, tenure insecurity is high with 22% of cultivators concerned
about land loss and 15% having experienced land disputes in the last decade. Second, village data highlight
increased land scarcity and transactions. Finally, comparing the productivity of estates with that of
smallholders points towards marked differences in terms of intensity and efficiency of land use, including
a pronounced negative relationship between farm size and productivity over the entire farm-size spectrum.

3.1 Sampling and characterization of smallholder farmers

Our data are from the 2006/07 NACAL implemented by Malawiâ€™s National Statistical Office (NSO) with
the Ministry of Agriculture. Beyond household-, individual-, and village-level data collection instruments
administered to a sample of smallholders, the survey also includes estates. While estates were drawn from
a nation-wide list, 11 smallholder farms to be sampled were selected in two stages: In a first stage,
enumeration areas (EAs) were randomly selected by district with stratification by agro- ecological zone and
a listing conducted in those that had been selected. In the second stage, farm households in each of the
selected EAs were randomly drawn with a target of 10 small (< 2 acres) and 5 medium sized (â‰¥ 2 acres)
farms each.12 For a sample of 931 estates and 23,896 smallholder farmers, the survey collected information
on household composition, welfare, food security, assets (incl. livestock), marketing, and parcel-level data
on land tenure and investment, in the 12-month period starting October 2006. Data gaps reduced the sample
for our analysis to 17,672 smallholders and 868 estates with complete information. Also, to reduce error
from misreporting due to intra-household informational asymmetries that are widespread in developing
countries (Goldstein and Udry 2008; Udry 1996) including Malawi (Lovo 2016; Telalagic 2012), we restrict
the regression sample for estimating impacts of insecure tenure to parcels operated by the respondent, which
reduced the sample to 15,472 smallholders.13

The data point towards widespread tenure insecurity: 22% and 21% of respondents voice concern that their
land may be taken away or encroached upon. In the past decade, 15% of respondent households experienced
a land dispute (table 1). While there is no information disputes nature or start date to link to the case study



10
   Implementation costs can be reduced through participatory approaches based on general boundaries as in Rwanda with costs of US$5 per parcel
(Ali et al. 2016a; Ali et al. 2014a) or even more via group approaches as in Mozambique (Kaarhus and Dondeyne 2015).
11
   Availability of a complete list of estates is a key advantage of this study over earlier ones where inability to compile the needed information
made sampling very difficult (Abeyasekera 1997).
12
   In EAs with less than 5 small farms, small farms were added to bring the total sample to 15.
13
   Coefficients of interest for the entire sample have the same sign but are less precisely estimated, consistent with the notion that information on
parcels that are not operated by the respondent contains considerable measurement error.
                                                                            6
literature (Peters 2007; van Donge 1999), elders and traditional leaders play an important role and resolve
some 60% of disputes. For most households, insecure tenure adds to an already precarious situation: 30%
and 17% of respondents experienced theft of crops and livestock, respectively, in the last 5 years. Housing
is basic with 75% having a grass roof and 79% a mud floor. With only about 40% having more than 5 years
of schooling, education may limit participation in more demanding off-farm activities even if demand exists
(Dimova et al. 2015; Nagler and Naude 2014). High food price variability (Harttgen et al. 2016), marked
seasonality (Sassi 2015) and exposure to rainfall risks (Lewin et al. 2012), and health shocks (Hyder et al.
2015) in a situation of limited asset ownership and insurance access are reasons why 28% of respondent
households had not eaten normally the last seven days and 19% had at least one member seriously sick.
Land lease markets are incipient (Lunduka et al. 2009), with 6% of households participating.

The mean smallholder parcel had been in use for some 12 years and measures 0.61 ha (table 2). While most
smallholder land is customary (77%), 20% is under other tenures including freehold. Inheritance remains
the main avenue of accessing land in Malawi (Peters 2010; Takane 2008); two-thirds of parcels were
acquired in this way, followed by allocation via the village headman (19%), rental (4%), and purchase (2%).
While most parcels (80%) are owner-operated, only 58% of operators were born in the village, highlighting
the increased importance of migration. Most sample parcels (77%) are in the village in flat terrain (73%)
with 15% mountainous and 8% in valley bottoms. Few producers adopted fertility-improving practices such
as fallowing (15%), crop rotation (13%), or terracing (7%) and planting of fruit (18%) or other trees (8%).

Most of smallholdersâ€™ land area is used for maize (46%) followed by wheat (24%), sorghum/millet (10%)
and various crops including legumes, tubers, and cash crops including coffee or tobacco that together
account for some 20% of area. With an output value of 305 US$/ha at the 2006 exchange rate, organic
manure is used on 36% of plots, improved seed on 11%, and chemical fertilizer on 7%. Data on labor use
allows inferences only on which household members participated in specific tasks, suggesting that land
preparation and management tasks such as ridging and weeding are, with very few exceptions, performed
manually with females being more involved than men.

Village level variables highlight Malawiâ€™s diversity in terms of inheritance practices (Berge et al. 2014)
and the extent to which land scarcity has increased market activity or given rise to intensification (table 3).
67% of villages follow matrilineal inheritance patterns (61%, 33%, and 6% of which matri-, patri-, or neo-
local), 28% a patrilineal one (93% and 7% of which patri- and neo-local), and 5% others. With 84% and
79%, respectively, matrilineal inheritance prevails in the South -where matrilocality dominates- and the
Center -where villages are almost equally split between matri- and patri-locality. It is virtually absent in the
North where only 2% of villages report to follow a matrilineal and patrilocal inheritance pattern.

                                                       7
Limits on land availability are evident from the fact that only 11% or 31% of villages still have uncultivated
or unallocated land available and that in 11% of villages, households have moved out to escape land
shortage. Village land is no longer exclusively used by villagers either, as 37% have village land owned by
outsiders and 34% rent village land to them (21% where outsiders own and rent village land). Higher outside
demand for land is also visible from the fact that 11% and 15% of villages had, in the last 5 years, sold or
given land to outsiders, sometimes (14%) failing to respect the village headâ€™s authority. Land conflict is
becoming more frequent: 29% and 20% of villages reported conflict among village families or with
neighboring villages, respectively. Some 24% of villages are located within walking distance from estates
and in more than a fifth of these cases, land conflicts with neighboring estates are reported. Infrastructure
access remains limited with only 35% of villages connected to an all-season road.

3.2 Comparison of land use and productivity between smallholders and estates

Our survey comprises small and large farms. We can thus compare the intensity and productivity of land
use between smallholders and estates to assess the long-term impact of land transfers to estates as well as
the extent to which rental or sales markets can attenuate dualistic structures and equalize returns between
different types of producers. Doing so allows us to see if, as some have claimed, studies of the relationship
between farm-size and productivity that rely on household samples may miss a significant part of the
distribution and thus come to erroneous conclusions (Jayne et al. 2015).

Comparing smallholder with estate data provides interesting insights in a number of respects. Mean age for
the 868 estates with data is 19 years with largest estates the oldest (table 4). Most (68%) are owned by
natural persons of Malawian nationality, 16% by â€˜othersâ€™ -most likely legal persons- and 10% by expatriates.
Expatriatesâ€™ ownership share peaks at the 100-500 ha size while that of government and â€˜othersâ€™ peaks in
the greater than 500 category. In contrast to smallholders, almost all estates (87%) use fertilizer and close
to two-thirds (61%) purchase pesticide or seeds, a practice more prevalent for larger sizes in both cases.
With about a third of estates having tenants; the share of estates with tenants peaks at close to 50% in the
10-100 size category. Compared to large farms in other countries that produce bulk commodities and often
generate little employment (Ali et al. 2015), many of Malawiâ€™s estates are quite labor intensive. Permanent
or temporary male (female) labor is hired by 60% (25%) and 66% (52%) of estates respectively. For these,
demand for permanent labor per ha cultivated is almost equal to the amount of labor spent by smallholders
based on the 2010/11 LSMS-ISA survey (Deininger et al. 2015). It increases with size to about 0.9 males
and 0.6 females in the largest category though the pattern for temporary labor is more volatile.

Claims about un- or underused estate land recurred in Malawiâ€™s policy debate (Holden et al. 2006). While
our sample was not designed to provide conclusive evidence on this, data suggest that for surveyed estates,

                                                      8
15% of allocated land is operated, a share that decreases from 88% in the group below 5 ha to 11% in the
above 500 ha group (table 5). While smallholders below 1 ha cultivate more than 95% of their land, mean
land use intensity for the few (154) smallholder farmers with more than 10 ha is only 22%.

Recent digitization of all the countryâ€™s estate leases by a World Bank supported project supports these
general conclusions. It puts the number of leases at 58,733 (of which 35,140 are in agriculture) and suggests
that the majority is expired. Even if 40% of the land leased to estates were non-existent or unsuitable for
agriculture, collecting lease fees equivalent to the median value of rent paid (or self-declared willingness
to pay) in the 2010/11 IHS for the remainder would generate a total of close to US$50 million per year, in
lease fees. Further analysis to eliminate overlaps and so-called â€˜ghost estatesâ€™,14 align registered estate
boundaries with actual land use, trace changes in ownership or occupation, and renew expired leases can
help further refine this. Analysis also suggests that not all estate land may be effectively used.15

Comparing production structure between smallholders and estates reveals differences in cropping patterns:
for sampled estates, 42% of area is devoted to tobacco, followed by maize (39%), groundnuts (7%), and
other crops (table 5). While differences in terms of crop composition somewhat limit the scope for
comparing yields, mean values suggest that for all crops with the exception of sunflower and tea, yields by
smallholders are significantly above those by estates. As estates use consistently more inputs than
smallholders, this suggests a strong negative relationship between farm size and productivity on the land
area actually cultivated. Non-parametric regressions of maize, rice, tobacco and coffee yields for the pooled
sample plotted against the log of farm size in figures 1a-1d graphically illustrate that, although slope varies
by crop, the overall relationship is stable and rather tightly estimated.

4. Econometric results

Regression results support the notion that perceived risk of land loss was higher for the poor, strangers,
people who transacted land, and those who had experienced land loss/encroachment or were involved in
land disputes earlier. Fear of land loss is estimated to reduce productivity by 5% overall, an effect limited
to females who, as a result of fearing land loss, are estimated to incur losses of 12%. While this would be
large enough to fund a systematic low-cost program of land regularization to eliminate insecurity, the net
effect of matrilineal inheritance on productivity remains limited.




14
   Coordinates in relevant survey plans imply that about one-third (19,222 of the 58,733 estates) are located outside Malawi and further study is
needed to determine whether this is due to transcription errors or whether estates in question do not exist.
15
   Of the 26,277 agricultural estates for which cloud free SPOT 2013/15 satellite imagery was available, 11,287 (43%) left more than 50% of their
total (cloud-free) land area uncultivated. While data would need to be updated to improve coverage and fine-tune land use classifications, freely
available imagery offers immense opportunities for doing so.
                                                                         9
4.1 Determinants of perceived tenure insecurity

We identify household-level determinants of perceived tenure insecurity16 by estimating

                                                                    í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»½3 í µí±‹í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»½4 í µí±‰

where TIijk is an indicator variable for household i in village j and district k expressing fear that his/her land
may either be taken away or be encroached upon. DXijk is a vector household level variables that may affect
perceived tenure insecurity with variables from three main groups, namely (i) respondent characteristics
such as gender, age, education level, main job, and whether born within or outside the village; (ii) tenure
of the householdâ€™s parcels, in particular the share that is customary, leasehold, freehold, or on public land;
the share of parcels acquired in different ways;17 mean length of possession; the share of parcels for which
owner and operator are identical; the share of parcels within rather than outside the village; and the share
of land leased, all aggregated with area shares from parcel to household level; and (iii) indicator variables
for having experienced land disputes, encroachment, or land loss during the last decade or crop theft in the
last growing season and food insecurity during the 7 days preceding the survey. DVjk is a vector of village-
level variables that may affect insecurity, including whether the village still has unallocated (reserve) land
available, if there are estates within walking distance, and if during the last decade households moved out
either due to land conflict or to look for land to cultivate.18 Xijk is a vector of household-level controls that
includes size of total land owned and cultivated, the share of area with different topography, demographic
composition, ownership of durable goods, agricultural assets, and livestock as well as housing conditions.
Vjk is a vector of village-level controls including road access and marriage type (matrilineal and
matrilocal/neolocal, matrilineal and patrilocal, patrilineal and patrilocal/neolocal, or unknown), Î»k is a
vector of district fixed effects, Î²1 and Î²2 are parameter vectors to be estimated, and Îµijk is an iid error term.

Coefficients in table 6 regarding fear of land being taken (cols.1 & 2) or encroached upon (cols.3 & 4)19
are reported overall (cols. 1&3) and for specifications where impacts of past land loss or encroachment are
allowed to differ by gender. Past loss is estimated to increase the fear of land being taken by 10%
irrespective of gender while past encroachment affected fear of future encroachment more than past loss
with point estimates of 34% and less than 7%, respectively, and the latter insignificant for male respondents.

In addition, having had disputes in the past is the most important factor (15% to 23%), supporting case
study evidence of traditional institutions often failing to conclusively resolve disputes. The poor are more

16
   As noted earlier, information on subjective tenure insecurity is not available at parcel level.
17
   Categories include whether land was acquired from the village headman, inherited/kept when spouse passed away, borrowed or inherited from
parents, obtained from government, or bought, rented or borrowed from others.
18
   As we are interested to see whether the magnitude of threats from estates varies by availability of land, an interaction term between the
indicator variable for having unallocated land and the indicator variable for having estates within walking distance is also included in DVjk.
19
   All variables in equation (1) are included in the regressions but only variables that significantly affected the fears are displayed in table 6.
                                                                          10
tenure insecure; not having eaten normally in the last 7 days and having experienced crop theft estimated
to increase the perceived danger of land loss by 5% and 3%, respectively. In line with the findings from
studies suggesting that traditional systems make it difficult for â€˜strangersâ€™ to acquire land, having borrowed
land is estimated to have increased the risk of expropriation by 7% without effect on encroachment risk,
while renting out land increases perceived risk in both areas by 3%, about the same as having all land
located outside the village (which affected the fear of encroachment more than fear of expropriation).
Having been born in the village and identity of owner and operator reduced perceived likelihood of land
being taken (encroached) by 5% (2%) and 5% (4%), respectively with each year of land occupation
reducing the fear of expropriation by 1% but not affecting perceived encroachment risk.

Village-level factors are estimated to have affected fear of land loss but less of encroachment. Villagers are
estimated to be 5% likely to fear land loss if other households had moved out due to land conflict. Presence
of estates in walking distance or unallocated land in the village are estimated to each have increased the
fear of land loss by 3%, presumably by increasing competition over land or by prompting certain groups to
try and acquire land ahead of others. The interaction between these two variables is positive with a point
estimate of 6%, suggesting that in presence of unallocated land, positive effects (e.g. employment) from
estates outweighed negative ones.

To compare our results to impacts attributed to inheritance regimes in the literature, we include dummies
on prevailing inheritance regimes and their interactions with operatorâ€™s gender. We find that in matrilineal
regimes, male operatorsâ€™ perceived risk of land loss is increased by 7.1%. By comparison, the fear of land
being encroached is lower by 4-5 points in patrilineal systems for women and weakly significant for males,
suggesting that the inheritance regime is one of several factors, and apparently not the most important, that
affect tenure insecurity.

Using the fear of (future) land loss as a right hand side variable in the equations for investment undertaken
in in the past (any time after land acquisition) would suffer from reverse causality. Assuming that the
inheritance regime did not change in the period of interest, we can still test for its impacts on investment
by estimating specifications similar to (1) with the dependent variable being whether a household had
planted fruit trees, built terraces, or practiced crop rotation. Results from doing so in table 7, which
suppresses estimated coefficients for all remaining variables, fail to provide strong to support the notion of
matrilineal inheritance regimes as a major cause of low investment: To the contrary, overall likelihood of
planting fruit trees is significantly higher in matrilineal systems, though estimated coefficients are
insignificantly different from zero for males. Terracing is significantly less likely in patrilineal systems for
males and females. Finally, for crop rotation, arguably a very short-term measure, investment is indeed

                                                       11
lower in matrilineal and â€˜otherâ€™ compared to patrilineal systems (table 7, col. 5) but gender disaggregation
suggests that in both matri- and patrilineal regimes, it is males who invest less.

4.2 Impacts of tenure insecurity on productivity

To quantify the impacts of tenure insecurity on production, we let Qlpijk be the value of output by household
i in village j and district k on plot l of parcel p. Alpijk, Llpijk, and Klpijk denote crop area; a vector of labor
variables including no. of household members by gender and age participating in land preparation, planting,
weeding and harvesting, the no. of hired workers, and an indicator of whether the household participated in
exchange labor; and a vector of values of organic manure, chemical fertilizer, seeds used in production as
well as agricultural assets.20 Taking logarithms on both sides yields

                                                                                                  í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»¿6 í µí°·í µí±ƒí µí°´í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»¿7 í µí°·í µí±‹í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»¿8 í µí°·í µí±‰

where qlpijk, alpijk, llpijk, and klpijk are logarithms of Qlpijk, Alpijk, Llpijk, and Klpijk, and Î¸s are technical coefficients
to be estimated. We include indicator variables for zero values of inputs following (Battese 1997). While
TIijk, DVjk, Vjk and Î»k are defined as in (1), parcel- and household-level determinates of tenure insecurity and
controls are separated in equation (2) with parcel-aggregated characteristics excluded from DXijk and Xijk
and included in parcel-level vectors of DPApijk and PApijk. We also control for household-level extension
activities and plot-level indicators for whether the plot was ridged and weeded, and the share of crop area
devoted to each of the main crops, which may affect production but not fear. Î´1 is the parameter of interest
that quantifies the impacts of tenure insecurity. To explore if insecurity (fear of land loss or encroachment)
affects production either directly or indirectly, we estimate three specifications based on (2), namely (i) one
where tenure insecurity determinates (DPApijk and DXijk and DVjk) and investment (Ipijk) are excluded; (ii)
one where the effect of tenure insecurity is allowed to vary by gender; and (iii) one where investments are
also included with tenure insecurity determinants controlled for.21

Results are illustrated in table 8.22 The fear of land being taken away is estimated to have reduced output
by 5% overall but we note that this result is driven by female operators whose output declined by 12% as a
result of tenure insecurity while results from the relevant test in the tableâ€™ s bottom row suggest that tenure
insecurity in terms of the fear of land loss (as well as land being encroached) has no perceptible impact on
productivity for males. Signs and significance on inputs are as expected with land contributing most (40%),
followed by chemical fertilizer (11%), seed (10%), agricultural assets and organic manure (6%). Although

20
   Hired labor, exchange labor, and agricultural assets are household-level variables.
21
   For space reasons, we only report the coefficient on the crop rotation indicator noting that coefficients on other investments are insignificant.
22
   All variables in equation (2) are included in the regressions but only fear-related variables, variables for investments, and variables for inputs
of the production function are displayed in table 8.
                                                                          12
the surveyâ€™s measure of family labor, i.e. if males, females, or children household members participated in
certain types of activities is extremely imprecise, it made a positive contribution to output.23 Each added
sick member over the last three months is estimated to have reduced output by 4 points. Participation in
exchange work, presumably to break seasonal bottlenecks, is estimated to have increased production by 8
points and the coefficient on extension is positive but insignificant.

One advantage of (2) is that it allows us to combine direct and indirect impacts to assess if and to what
extent inheritance regimes affects productivity.24 To obtain such estimates, we add (in col. 3 and 6), an
indicator variable for whether or not a household practiced crop rotation, the one investment that, based on
our earlier results is significantly affected by inheritance regimes (see table 7). Results provide no basis for
the conjecture of matrilineal systems being associated with lower levels of productivity, irrespective of the
inclusion of a crop rotation dummy. For patrilineal regimes, a significant negative effect emerges for
specifications that do not control for crop rotation but disappears if gender or the respective indicator are
included, suggesting that even in patrilineal systems, failure to practice crop rotation rather than the
inheritance regime per se, is associated with lower levels of productivity.

5. Conclusion and policy implications

Data from Malawi allow us to assess the extent to which large farms (estates) established sporadically and
in isolation from the customary sector in the late 1980s helped to establish a dynamic commercial farm
sector. We find that in most cases, estatesâ€™ productive performance is inferior to that of smallholders while
in the smallholder sector, fear of land loss is high and associated with significant productivity losses for
female cultivators, and, contrary to earlier literature, the inheritance regime is not a major impediment to
smallholder investment or productivity. The estimated present value of fear-induced productivity losses is
estimated to exceed the amount of resources required to implement a low-cost systematic tenure
regularization program along the lines of Rwanda.

Two implications for policy stand out. First, even in the customary regime, piloting of approaches to secure
tenure especially for women, accompanied by careful real-time evaluation, could thus help inform next
steps to feed into regulation for Land Bill implementation. Second, where land had been transferred to
estates historically, this would need to be preceded by use of digitized administrative data -including on
boundaries or (expired) lease documents- to adjudicate rights in a way that, where needed, would reconcile
legal rights with current occupancy status. Major steps for doing so would include (i) revision of lease fees
to bring them more in line with productive potential; and (ii) establishment of a systematic process to


23
     Estimated coefficients on male membersâ€™ input are slightly above that for women and children or hired workers
24
     Such analysis will be valid if inheritance regimes are exogenously given and do not change over time.
                                                                          13
ascertain and formally register location and occupancy of land leased to estates, extinguish rights to â€˜ghostâ€™
estates, adjudicate overlapping claims, and as much as possible allow market-based reassignment of unused
land to more productive uses. Impacts on own-source revenue generation could be very large: Our estimates
suggest that, beyond supporting greater efficiency of land use and opening up avenues to access land via
lease markets, incremental public revenue to be generated through realistic lease fees could potentially be
very large, amounting to up to US$50 mn. per year, equivalent to 5% of public revenue.

Follow-up research will be of interest in two areas. The first relates to determinants of estatesâ€™ productive
performance and their impact on neighboring smallholders in ways going beyond averages and exploring
heterogeneity across estates. This could combine survey data on location and actual occupancy of estate
land with more specific methods of imagery recognition to assess not only current land use but to rely on
historical imagery to also provide evidence on changes over time. Beyond providing a basis for any effort
at systematic lease updating, this could help assess estatesâ€™ effect on neighboring smallholders in a way that
would complement existing methodologies such as Ali et al. (2016c) with evidence on channels via which
such effects may be transmitted. A second area for follow-up research relates to exploring ways in which
smallholdersâ€™ tenure insecurity could be reduced in different settings and to assessing productivity impacts
of such interventions. This could improve not only understanding of production relations in Malawi, but
also help ensure that efforts at systematic tenure regularization address these so as to have the desired impact
on smallholder productivity and welfare.

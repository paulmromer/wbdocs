Executive Summary
History: In 1994 South Africa’s first non-racial democratic government was determined to
erase apartheid’s legacy of unequal access to basic services. Concerted efforts since then have
increased total electricity access from 65 percent to 85 percent, while the rural electrification
rate has increased from 28 percent to around 67 percent. Almost all of this increase has been
achieved by grid extensions, mostly done by Eskom, the state-owned utility.
Objectives of Solar Home System Concessions: To reach non-grid areas, the
government introduced a system of Solar Home Concessions in 1999. Following a
competitive process, concessions were awarded to six companies. The concessions conferred
a five-year exclusive right to access government subsidies for installation of solar home
systems in the concession area. The subsidy was set at 80 percent of the capital cost of each
solar home installation. The concessionaire was to finance the remaining 20 percent of the
cost, install the system, and then maintain each system for 20 years. The concessionaire’s
revenue would come from monthly fees from the users. Many users would be poor, and
therefore eligible for grants toward the monthly cost of the service. These grants would be
paid by municipalities under South Africa’s Free Basic Electricity policy. The plan was to
install 50,000 subsidized systems in each concession area.
Results: The number of systems installed per concessionaire is only a portion of what was
planned. The concession system has so far resulted in the installation of around 100,000
solar home systems. While by some measures an impressive achievement, only around
60,000 of these are still operational. Only three of the six concessions that were set up
around 1999 are still operational in the same format as they were at the outset. While some
are barely profitable at an operational level, the returns on investment to the private
investors have been lower than expected.
New Directions: The three surviving concessions still operate on the basis that they
undertake both installations and maintenance. However, moving forward, the Government
has moved away from the original concessionaire approach to a model where the
Government pays independent service providers directly for installations and hands over
maintenance to user cooperatives. This will be the basis upon which the off-grid solar home
system program will be run in the future.
Reasons for Results: A number of reasons can be ascribed to the disappointing
performance of the concession model:
         One of these was a lack of thorough planning on the part of Government at the
          outset. The contracts had not been designed at the time the tender was advertised,
          the start of operations were delayed, and an ambivalence about the approach led
          to a scaling back of original deployment plans. Extension of the grid has been the
          primary tool for increasing access to electricity and solar home systems are seen as
          merely temporary measures until grid electricity is available.
         The concession model was not fully compliant with legislation passed at around
          the same time concerning procurement by the state. Only small areas were
          approved for subsidized installations each year, crippling the concessionaires’
          business model as an investible proposition and thereby limiting their impact.




                                                i
        Other problems included difficulties in getting customers to pay; difficulties in
         getting municipalities to pay the Free Basic Energy grants; and extension of the
         grid into areas which, previously, had been thought of as areas that the grid would
         not reach. Grid extensions led to customers abandoning their solar home systems.
        In general terms, customers are pleased to get solar home systems but these are
         seen also seen as a poor alternative to grid electricity.
Key Lesson: While solar home systems are an increasingly viable option for rural
electrification across Africa, the concession model cannot be recommended to all countries.
It requires large government subsidies for large numbers of solar home systems. To conserve
scarce fiscal resources, a better approach would be to boost the already rapid development
of competitive private markets for solar home system sale, installation and maintenance. This
can be done through measures to increase access to finance for consumers and suppliers.
Quality certification will also help. Where subsidies are desired, vouchers could be used, so
that the subsidies work with the competitive supply chains, not against them.

1       Introduction
Starting in 1999, the Government of South Africa used concessions to have private
operators deploy solar home systems in three of the most rural parts of the country. The
purpose of this report is to review South Africa’s experience with these concessions. A rural
electrification concession is a public-private partnership in which a private entity is granted a
long-term right to provide electricity service in rural areas, through a distribution grid or
through home-based systems. This case study is one of six detailed case studies that form a
body of evidence on the experience and successes of rural electrification concessions across
sub-Saharan Africa.
Background on South Africa’s power system and its approach to rural electrification is
presented in Section 2. Profiles of four concessionaires—Solar Vision, NuRa, KES and
Ilitha—are presented next, in Section 3. The concession design is reviewed in detail in
Section 4. The report concludes with an assessment of the concession model in South
Africa, in Section 5.

Economy and demographics
South Africa is a county of 54 million people. It is classed as a middle income country. Over
the last 20 years, the population has been growing at 1.5-1.6 percent per year, while real
GDP per capita as grown at 1.68% per annum on average over the last ten years. In 2010,
over 60 percent of South Africa’s population was urban.1
Politics and governance
South Africa gained full independence from Britain in 1910 but only became a non-racial
democracy in 1994. The country has been ruled by the African National Congress (ANC)
since 1994, following South Africa’s first inclusive democratic election.
Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index for 2014 gives South Africa a
perceived level of public sector corruption a score of 44 (0 being highly corrupt 100 being
very clean) which ranks the country at 67 out of 175 globally. The legal system is based on a
mixture of common and civil law. The administrative tradition is English.
In the time that the Solar Home Systems concession has been in place (2000 to present), the
security and humanitarian situation has been relatively stable. South Africa is not a fragile or
conflict-affected state.2
2.1        Power Market Structure
The Department of Energy is the South African Government’s policy-making body with
responsibility for achieving the government’s energy objectives. NERSA regulates the sector.
The power market in South Africa is presented in Figure 2.1.

Eskom is at the center of the system, generating almost all power, operating the transmission
systems, and also operating distribution grids that sell directly to households and other
customers, especially in rural areas. In many urban areas, distribution is via municipally-
owned distribution companies.
Eskom has a total generating capacity of 41 GW. In the year ended 31 March 2015 it
supplied 216,274GWh to the national grid.3 By generating capacity, it is the fifth or sixth
biggest electricity utility in the world.4 While historically a strong, engineering-dominated
entity that achieved high reliability, failure maintain plant and bring new plant on line quickly
enough has brought regular bouts of load-shedding to South Africa for the first time in more
than 30 years. Independent Power Producers are now being procured to supply renewable
energy to the grid.
Eskom’s electricity price is still amongst the cheapest in the world,5 especially for industrial
users6 but this position is changing quite rapidly. In 2015, Eskom’s average selling price per
kWh is ZAR 0.83 (around US$0.10/kWh).

South Africa’s economy is one of the most electricity intensive by kWh required to produce
a unit of GDP. South Africa’s energy (and with it electricity) intensity doubled over the
period 1990 to 2007.7
2.2        Rural Electrification Approach
Since the end of apartheid, South Africa has boosted total electricity access from around 65
percent to 85 percent in 2012. The rural electrification rate has increased even more
markedly, from 28 percent at the end of apartheid to around 67 percent in 2012 (see Figure
2.2). More than 40 million people more now have access to electricity (Figure 2.3).
Almost all of this increase has been achieved by grid extensions, mostly done by Eskom.
However, from 1999, the government supplemented grid extensions with non-grid
concessions, in which private firms were awarded service territories and received subsidies to
install and maintain solar home systems.
Grid extensions
Work on mass electrification had commenced prior to 1994.8 However, Apartheid policy had
resulted in a racially determined differentiation in infrastructure provision and high levels of
inequality. The 1996 census, the first which surveyed all South Africans, indicated that less
than 60 percent of the population had access to electricity away from the urban areas. The
percent of black people with access to electricity was below 25 percent in 1996.9

In 1994, the new ANC-led government announced its Reconstruction and Development
Program (RDP). One of the RDP’s ambitious goals was to connect 450,000 households
annually. Eskom was expected to connect 300,000 households per year, with local
municipalities doing the remaining 150,000. Eskom, which at the time was relatively
ungeared and had significant excess capacity, was able to play a significant part in the roll-out
of electrification.10
The RDP goal was comfortably exceeded. Between 1994 and 1999 more than 2.5 million
households were electrified— an average of over 500,000 per year. The rapid rate of
electrification in the 1990s was due to Eskom’s direct involvement. Until 2001, Eskom
largely financed the electrification program from cross-subsidies of industrial users and bulk
sales to local authorities.
Despite the increase in total electrification, an urban-rural divide remained: electrification in
1999 was 46 percent in rural areas and 80 percent in urban areas.11
Non-grid concessions
Recognizing a need for a change in approach, the Department of Minerals and Energy
(DME) initiated a rural non-grid electrification program in 1999. This program sought to
provide Solar Home Systems (SHS) to those lacking access to the electricity grid. To ensure
proper installation and maintenance of the system, the solar homes systems would be
installed and maintained by companies. The companies would continue to own the system
once installed, and sell electricity from it to the household. Government would subsidize the
capital costs, and the operations. This was known as the ‘concessionaire’ or ‘fee for service’
program.
Solar home systems were not new to South Africa. Around 40 000 to 60 000 solar home
systems had already been installed on a commercial basis. However, sales had dropped off
after Eskom announced an ‘Electricity for All’ campaign and rural communities came to
expect grid electricity to be provided to them.
In 1995 the DME had entered the solar home business directly by setting up Renewable
Energy for South Africa (REFSA) Pty (Ltd). REFSA sold solar home systems on credit in
deep rural areas. However, the overheads of delivering and maintaining the systems in these
areas rendered the operation uneconomic, and DME shut it down.
In 1998 Eskom and Shell announced a joint venture to install 50,000 solar home systems in
rural areas. This venture was launched by (then) President Mandela in early 1999. The joint
venture’s technology involved the use of solar home systems with pre-paid cards. Customers
would pay for the use of the system each day by buying credit on the cards and then
inserting these into the solar unit.
The Eskom-Shell model, the DME’s own experience in trying to supply solar home systems,
and a 1998 White Paper12 signaling a shift to greater private sector involvement in electricity,

were all factors DME’s decision to adopt the concession model for delivering solar home
services.13
The plan was to award seven area based concessions. In each area, 50,000 solar home
systems were to be installed by the concessionaire14. The concessionaire would receive a
capital subsidy of 80 percent of cost, and finance the rest itself. The concessionaire would
cover its operating and maintenance costs, and earn a return on investment, from a revenue
stream of monthly fees charged to the users. Municipalities would contribute to the revenue
stream by paying the concessionaires to provide basic levels of service for poor people, in
accordance with South Africa’s Free Basic Energy program. The financing and risk transfer
arrangements were designed to fit within the Government’s rules relating to Public Private
Partnerships.15
As described below, in reality the government did not provide the funding for the 50,000
connections promised in each area. The concession program fell short of its original design.
Around 2.2 million households (roughly 8 million people) still do not have access to
electricity and a good proportion of these are in rural areas not yet serviced by the grid.16
De facto, the approach has since moved away from an area-based concession model to a
cooperative model. Private installers put in the solar home systems, and a cooperative
maintains them and collects the fees. This policy is expected to be officially announced in a
new Household Electrification Strategy to be published in the first half of 2016.

3          The Solar Home System (SHS) Concessions:
           Process and Experiences
In January 1999 DME issued a call for proposals for firms to offer to supply non-grid
electrification services in the provinces of Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo.
Twenty eight proposals were received. Six of these proposals were accepted, as shown in
Table 3.1.

        Concession?, Centre for Policy Studies (Johannesburg), Research report 104, September 2003.


At the time of the tender, contracting, licencing and subsidy arrangements had not been fully
defined. Negotiations took some time, and some of the bidders’ international partners
threatened to pull out. To keep the plan moving forward, interim contracts were issued to
five of the six in 2001 and 2002.
The location of the concessions is presented in Figure 3.1. The concession areas were
selected because they are the most rural areas of South Africa and among the most under-
developed. The areas overlap with the former independent "homelands" for blacks set up by
the apartheid government, for example: Ciskei, Transkei, Kwazulu and Venda.
The service areas identified include many areas with grid access. The plan was that pockets in
need of non-grid service would be identified in these areas, and solar home systems installed
there. A process for identifying these small pockets was established whereby concessionaires
consulted with the appropriate grid utility, usually Eskom, on an annual basis.17

Conventional concessions often confer an obligation to serve an area, and with it the
exclusive right to serve the area. Some thought was given to using this approach for the solar
home concessions, but in the end neither exclusivity nor a service obligation were granted.
Rather, what the concessionaire got was an exclusive right to access government subsidies
for rural electrification in its area for the first five years. Then, for each solar home system
installed, the concessionaire would then have an obligation to maintain the system for 20
years, coupled with a 20 year right to collect payment from the customer (and from
municipalities under the Free Basic Electricity program). The tender documents had stated
that 50,000 units would be installed in each concession area. The magnitude of the number
of units that government indicated it would subsidize is what made the concessions
attractive.
What actually happened was quite different from what was stated in the tender documents.
Rather than quickly rolling out service to 50,000 homes, only small pockets were identified
to be served at time.
Moreover, when areas to be served were identified, they were, in time, put out to be bid
rather than automatically going for the concessionaire for the area. Typical package sizes
were 1,000 to 3,000 units18.
In practice the concessionaires won the bids, as they were the only entities with the requisite
scale and capacity in the area. However, the diminished numbers and slow, disjointed rollout
reduced the impact of the program (compared to what had been planned). It similarly
crippled the financial performance of the concessionaires.
Solar Vision installed around 20,000 units, and Nura installed around 26,000 units. This is
less than half what was expected. Moreover, only between 30 percent and 70 percent of
those units are now still operational.
In about 2006, the Shell-Eskom concession was disbanded. Three “maintenance-only?
companies took over parts of the Shell-Eskom concession area in Eastern Cape: Ilitha
Cooperative, Shine the Way and Summer Sun Trading.19 Two of these new concession
companies were not operating at the time of the research. Summer Sun Trading went out of
business in February 2010, citing the loss of their clients to grid electrification. 20 Shine the
Way went out of business before 2010, unable to make money.
The EDF-Total concession became Kwazulu Energy Services (KES), later renamed
Kukhanya Energy Services. As of 2010, the concessionaires operating in the non-grid
electrification program included:

We interviewed the directors of each of these companies. Their stories are presented below,
after which common features of the concession are summarized.
3.1         Small Concessionaire Case Study – Solar Vision
Solar Vision was founded in 2000 and began installing solar home systems in 2001. The
company has between 6,500 and 6,600, all located in Limpopo province.

The company is run by Jakes Jacobs. Solar Vision bid on the SHS Program under the
understanding that each of the concession areas would quickly have 50,000 units connected.
It was on this basis that the first companies to participate in the program bid. It is also the
basis upon which the companies were able to attract foreign investors. In the case of Solar
Vision, REC, a Norwegian-based commercial solar PV developer/manufacturer was the
foreign investor.21
In order to participate in the tender, Solar Vision needed to demonstrate available funding
facilities of ZAR10 million (equivalent to around US$1.5 million in the year 2000). The
company also needed to have the systems and operational expertise to undertake such a
program. For example, being able to track customers is important and this requires a
customized database. This required Mr. Jacobs to invest in a customer database that alone
cost around ZAR550,000 (around US$80,000 in the year 2000).
The actual program roll-out occurred via a series of discrete tenders for 1,000 to 3,000 SHS
units each. There have been several of these over the years but together they have amounted
to far less than the initially advertised 50,000. For this reason, Solar Vision’s investor REC
departed from the business in 2007 and is no longer involved. For a period after 2005, the
tenders which have been published in regular intervals ceased and only recommenced after
about 2010.
Mr. Jacobs estimates that if the concessionaires are able to pare down all unnecessary costs,
10,000 customers can be serviced on a break-even basis.
Solar Vision collects most of the monthly fees directly from the municipalities in the form of
FBE grants. The municipalities that pay Solar Vision include:
            Thulamela Municipality
            Polokwane Municipality
            Makhado Municipality
            Mutale Local Municipality
            Greater Thubatse Municipality
The monthly maintenance fee collected from the local municipalities for the FBE is now at
ZAR89. The monthly fee is collected from these municipalities in terms of their FBE
budgets which are, in turn, funded by the national government to provide free basic
electricity services. Solar Vision attempts to recover a further amount of ZAR30/month
from end customers. These fees are often uncollected. A discussion with the company’s
accountant shows that of total monthly maintenance revenues, over 82 percent is made up
of the FBE fee and the balance of 18 percent is made up from fees obtained from customers
directly.
The agreements with the local municipalities, drafted by Solar Vision, include a service level
agreement that reflects Solar Vision as the concessionaire and a funding agreement, renewed
on a 3-year rolling basis, which requires that the municipality concerned pays the money
owed for customers actually serviced by the concessionaire.

21
     REC Group, “Company History,? accessed September 24, 2015, http://www.recgroup.com/en/aboutREC/history/
Over the various tenders that have been issued, Mr. Jacobs estimates that Solar Vision has
installed roughly 20,000 units. However, only 6,500-6,600 remain on the system. Most
defecting customers do so as they are able to be serviced by grid electricity. To understand
this better, many rural villages, covered by the Solar Vision concession, are have relatively
high population densities and happen to be in closer proximity to the national grid. This
settlement pattern and grid proximity means that Solar Vision loses customers to grid
encroachment at a higher rate than other areas.

Against the issue of each tender and its subsequent award based on indicative pricing
tendered, there is first a period of negotiation on the final price to be paid to the
concessionaire. The principle established by the Department of Energy is that it subsidizes
80 percent of the costs of an installation and the concessionaire is able to recover the balance
over the period of the contract (20 years). In reality the price or subsidy level is a result of
negotiation and the agreed subsidy level becomes the floor price of what an installation
ought to cost the concessionaire.
For Solar Vision, grid encroachment entails the de-installation of systems and is a significant
part of what Solar Vision does. All equipment remains the property of Solar Vision.
However, only part of the system can be removed.
In general terms, only the solar panel can be recovered and to some extent, some of the
electronics inside the DB Box. Some of these items can be re-sold in the second hand/used
products market. There is a significant amount of shrinkage and damage to the recoverable
items. On a value basis then, on average about 20 percent of the value of any one installation
can be recovered and be re-sold.
3.2     Small Concessionaire Case Study – NuRa
NuRa is an energy services company set up to implement the concession won in 1999 to
provide energy services to rural households in parts of Kwazulu-Natal. The company is 80
percent owned by Nuon Duurzame Energie, a Dutch utility company. An employee share
trust owns the balance of 20 percent. The company has around 18,000 solar home system
customers. Mr. Sifiso Dlamini is the Managing Director of NuRa.
The NuRa concession area covers large parts of the Umkhanyekude District Municipality in
the extreme northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal province and includes the municipal areas of:
         Umhlabuyalingana
         Jozini
         Mtubatuba
         Hlabisa
         Big Five False Bay
NuRa’s service area is deeply rural.
As with the other concessionaires, NuRa was established in 1999 following its winning bid
with the Department of Energy and Mineral Affairs (now known as the Department of
Energy). The terms of reference for the bid proposed that these concessions would increase
to around 50,000 customers.
The issuing of new tenders has been somewhat erratic. The first few tenders were regular
and then there was a lull between 2006 and 2010 and re-commenced only thereafter. This
made long-term planning a very difficult process.
Mr. Dlamini mentions that although each tender is theoretically open to anyone who would
like to provide the service, in reality, the requirements to tender mean that those
participating need to show expertise, the willingness to commit to a 20-year maintenance
agreement and the ability to provide a guarantee for each installation phase. Obtaining
commercial or trade finance is impossible. This is why the presence of Nuon who is able to
provide financial guarantees is critical.
Each new tender requires that those responding provide a costing of the installations against
the specifications set out by the tender document. Following submission of tenders, the
Department of Energy convenes a meeting where the final price for the installations is
negotiated. The final price is fixed somewhere between the highest and lowest tender of all
concessionaries.
NuRa has lost some customers to grid encroachment. However, it maintains a customer base
of around 18,000 households from an estimated 26,000 installations (or a 70 percent
retention rate). Almost all monthly maintenance fees of ZAR90 are recovered directly from
customers. Very little comes from the local municipalities’ Free Basic Energy program.
NuRa maintain a long and laborious fee recovery system.
3.3        Small Concessionaire Case Study – KES
Kukhanya Energy Services or KES (formerly KwaZulu Energy Services) started out as an
off-grid electrification joint venture between Total Renewable Energies and the French
power utility EDF. A local black-owned investment company, Calulo Investments, acquired
a 15 percent stake in the company.
The KES concession area is in Kwazulu-Natal in the following areas:
            Msinga
            Maphumulo
            Ndwedwe
In 2005 a separate tender was issued by the Kreditbank fuer Wiederaufbau22 (KfW) and the
Department of Energy for an area in the Eastern Cape that included Mount Fletcher and
Tsomo. KES won this tender and now serves this area.
KES is managed by Vicky Basson who was interviewed. Ms. Basson says that the Kwazulu-
Natal concession area has seen six successive rounds of contracts. Concessionaires work
with municipalities to identify non-grid areas to be electrified. A municipal resolution is
passed which entitles the municipality to a sign a service level agreement. Once this is done,
the concessionaire liaises with local community leaders to identify customers. The customers
must then apply for service. Most customers are entitled FBE. However, getting this paid by
the municipality is a challenge, in particular because the contracts that allow this have to be
re-signed every year.
Across the two concession areas, KES services about 30,700 customers. Like other
concessionaries, KES suffers customer churn whether through theft, non-payment or grid
encroachment.
Ms. Basson estimates that for viability, a concessionaire needs at least 15,000 paying
customers. Customers are serviced through ‘energy stores’. Any energy store needs to serve
at least 3500 customers to be viable. This is roughly the position of KES in respect of its two
concession areas. Ms Basson emphasized that for viability, the customers needs to be close
enough to the energy store, and to be good payers.
KES charges ZAR102 per month. Customers can pay at energy stores or from a KES
employee at the customer’s house. Payment rates are worse for customers who have been on
the system longer, dropping to 60 percent for those who have been connected longest.
The contribution to the monthly bill from the municipal FBE payments varies from zero up
to ZAR48 per month, depending on the customer. Collecting from municipalities is another
challenge. The FBE allowances are paid in terms of the service level agreements. Depending
on the municipality concerned, outstanding fees can remain unpaid for up to 1 year. In light
of these challenges, the continued survival of KES is ascribed in large part to the support
that it has received from its shareholders.

3.4        Small Concessionaire Case Study – Ilitha
Ilitha Co-Operative was one of three entities that took over parts of the Eskom-Shell
concession in 2006. This concession is based in the Eastern Cape. At the time, the total
number of Eskom-Shell installations amounted to around 6,000 units. Ilitha took over 1,850
units located in:
            Mataliele
            Umzimbuvu
Unlike other concessionaries, Ilitha does not participate in the bidding process for new
installations. Instead, new installations are commissioned directly from the Department of
Energy to companies such as Specialized Solar Systems23 which when completed are handed
over to Ilitha to administer. Ilitha now operates roughly 6 300 installations but derives
monthly fees of ZAR60 from just 1,440 installations in Mataliele and roughly 200
installations in Umzimbuvu.
Mr. Mzenzi, the Director of Ilitha Co-Operative, ascribes the fact that Ilitha has continued to
operate to the fact that it is a co-operative (a mutual) organization24. These co-operatives are
somewhat like business trusts or non-profit trading entities. This enabled Ilitha to survive
despite difficulties in securing the maintenance fees.
There are two types of fees: a fee for the ‘two light’ installations done in the e arlier years
(ZAR14) and a fee for the ‘four light’ systems installed more recently. In the Ilitha
concession area there is considerable resistance to paying the monthly fee. The culture of
non-payment might have emerged in the years where these concessions were run by the
Eskom-Shell joint venture, which reportedly made little effort to collect monthly fees from
the end-customers. Mr. Mzenzi is attempting to turn this situation around by mounting an
information campaign explaining that payment of the monthly fee is necessary to keep the
program running.
However, Mr. Mzenzi believes the most important issue for Ilitha is getting municipalities to
pay the Free Basic Electricity payment. To make these payments, municipality needs to
maintain a database on ‘indigents’—that is, those who are eligible for the subsidy. Such
records are not maintained. As a result, the municipalities do not pay the monthly fees due
for all installations operated and managed by Ilitha.

4           Concession Design
Having considered a large scale delivery of non-grid systems but rejecting that route, the
government took the view that challenges relating to planning, funding, maintenance and
affordability of large-scale non-grid electrification was best addressed through a privately-
owned utility delivery model25. In order to push some of the risks to the private sector, to
ensure the continued presence of the concessionaire for the 20-year maintenance period and
to contain costs, the government would subsidize 80 percent of the capital costs of an
installation which the concessionaire was to recover by subsequent maintenance fees.
4.1         Key Objectives, Challenges and Risks
The objectives of the SHS concession system were to:26
             Accelerate delivery of electricity to remote areas that would not receive grid
              electricity in the medium-term
             Improve access to a range of fuels, including gas, paraffin, SHS and mini-grid
              systems
             Attract large, well-organized private companies
             Tap private sources of financing
             Obtain economies of scale
             Create private sector vehicles to channel donor funding
             Stimulate the renewable energy market.
The main risk identified was that the solar home systems could be prone to misuse or
vandalism because they were under the control of the user, but under the ownership of the
utility.27 This risk was expected to be mitigated through professional customer care.
4.2         Allocation of Functions and Risks
The concessionaire owns the solar home system, charges the user for the service, and
maintains and services the equipment. Thus the concessionaire takes the risk on installation
costs, operations and maintenance costs, we all as on demand and collections.
These risks were mitigated and the whole system model made more affordable for customers
by a government subsidy originally set at 80 percent of the capital costs. The concessionaire

was to finance the remaining 20 percent. Officially, the concessionaire co-owns the
equipment with the Department of Energy.28
The concessionaire also takes the risk on getting municipalities to make the Free Basic
Energy payments to cover the cost of serving poor people. It is a legal requirement that
municipalities do this, but many avoid it in various ways.
4.3         Decisions on Areas to Serve
The process to decide on new off-grid areas to serve is as follows:
             The operator in a concession area submits an application to the Department of
              Energy, requesting approval and support for providing SHSs in an identified area.
              The application must include Eskom’s grid electrification plan (to show the area
              will not be served by the grid) and proof of engagement with the affected
              communities.
             The Department of Energy engaged with the community and checks that the
              proposed area meets the criteria for support.
             If the area meets the criteria it will be included in the non-grid plan for the
              following financial year.29
4.4         Operations and Management
The concessionaires generally operate energy stores from which they cater to customers in a
radius of up to 50 km from the store. The store is the point of sale for the solar home
systems. The stores manage sales on credit, applications for installations, customer
complaints and plan maintenance. Some of the stores also offer other energy services, such
as Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) or solar lighting products.30
The stores also are the base for mobile technicians who use trucks or motorcycles to travel
to sites for maintenance calls. NuRa reported in 2006 that it needed approximately 1
technician per 600 customers.31

     In policy documents the concessionaire is variously referred to as the “service provider?, the “utility?, the
     “concessionaire? and “energy services company (ESCO)?. See for example: Republic of South Africa Department of
     Energy, “Non-Grid Electrification Policy?, March 19, 2012, accessed September 13, 2015,

4.5        Stages of Development
A timeline showing the major stages of development leading up to the concession is
presented in Table 4.1.

4.6        Financing Capital Costs
The subsidy for each 50Wp SHS installation was originally fixed at ZAR3500 until individual
arrangements were made with each concessionaire.32 Now the capital subsidy is meant to be
equal to 80 percent of the capital cost of a solar home system. Reportedly, concessionaires

     Eastern    Cape:    Phase    1.   Baseline    Survey,?  March     2004,     accessed  September    24,    2015,
     http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/Research/publications/04ERC-Solar%20electrification%20Eastern%20Cape-baseline.pdf
are encouraged to inflate their capital costs so as to receive a subsidy equal to the full (non-
inflated) cost of the SHS.
The lead acid battery and other consumables represent roughly a third of the initial capital
investment and the batteries need to be replaced every two years. To finance the operations
in the medium and long term, the private operators need to earn enough income to replace
the batteries.
4.7         Operations and Maintenance Cost Recovery
Operations and maintenance costs are covered from the fee charged to customers and Free
Basic Electricity (FBE) grants from municipalities covering the cost of service for poor
families. FBE is an important portion of the revenue of the concessionaires, but is often not
paid as is should be:
             Solar Vision collects 82 percent of its revenue from the municipalities. The
              remaining 18 percent of Solar Vision’s revenue is directly from consumers. Solar
              Vision receives ZAR89 (US$6.5) per connection from the municipalities.33 It
              attempts to collect ZAR30 (US$2.2) from end customers.
             KES charges ZAR102 per month and of this the FBE varies from 0 to ZAR48
              per month. Collecting the FBE is a constant challenge. Depending on the
              municipality concerned, fees can remain unpaid for up to 1 year.
             NuRa is less dependent on the FBE. Almost all monthly maintenance fees of
              ZAR90 are recovered directly from customers and very little from the local
              municipalities. NuRa maintain a long and laborious fee recovery system. Of the
              current 18,000 households, the recovery rate is around 70 percent. This is a
              relatively high number and might be a consequence of NuRa being the only
              provider of electricity of any type for the areas that it services.
4.8         Contractual Arrangements
The main concession contract is between the Department of Energy and the concessionaire.
This provides for the subsidies for the capital costs of the SHS, and imposes the 20 year
maintenance obligations. In addition, firms may have service provider contracts with the
Department of Energy for maintenance arrangements outside their concession areas.
Some concessionaries have contracts with municipalities which include service levels, and
provide for the payment of Free Basic Electricity Grants. Solar Vision has such agreements,
drafted by the head of the company. Municipalities can’t legally enter into 20-year
agreements due to the Municipal Finance Management Act of 2003, so these agreements are
shorter-term.
4.9         Technological Approach
The electrification technology deployed by the concessions is exclusively off-grid solar home
systems. The concessionaires do not manage grid extension projects or mini-grid projects,
and the concessions do not interact with the existing transmission and generation sectors.


33
     89 South African Rand is equivalent to around US$6.5 in October 2015.
Some concessionaires do sell other energy products. NuRa markets LPG, KES markets solar
lighting equipment, and Solar Vision markets solar water heaters.
The 2001 specifications for the solar home systems were:
             A 50Wp photovoltaic (PV) panel
             A charge controller/DB board
             Wiring & outlets for small appliances
             A lead-acid battery of 105 amp-hour
             Two compact fluorescent lights.
Since 2001, the specifications have increased. Now a 95Wp PV panel with four energy
efficient compact fluorescent lights is required. Figure 4.2 shows a PV panel used in the SHS
installed by Solar Vision.
Given an annual average of six hours of effective sunlight, a 95Wp panel generates roughly
400-500Wh/day34, which over a 30-day month is 12–15kWh (the FBE is 50kWh/month).
According to a 2012 Department of Energy policy document, the more recent specifications
allow for the use of a black and white television for four hours, four hours of quality lighting
using high efficiency lights, the use of a portable radio for ten hours and the charging of
cellphones.35 The most recent technical specification is in Annex 4.

4.10 Regulatory Arrangements
The off-grid SHS falls outside the traditional regulation of the electricity supply system.
Regulation is via agreement with the Department of Energy and agreements with the local
municipalities who pay the FBE grants to the concessionaries.
The permitted tariffs are regulated. They are set such that the concessionaire is entitled to
“generate enough revenue to cover reasonable operational and maintenance costs, national
taxes, and earn a fair rate of return on capital employed?.36

     See clause 8.2 of Agreement for the Installation and Maintenance of Solar Home Systems - Annex 3
5           Assessment of Concessions
The concessions have each succeeded to varying degrees, especially when weighing different
means of evaluation. This section analyzes these results.
5.1.1 Access
The concession program has fallen short of the original targets. In the four original
concession areas, there was an expectation that as many as 200,000 solar home systems (or
50,000 for each concession area) would be deployed. However, only 100,000 have in fact
been installed, and only around 60,000 are still in operation.37
There are distinct differences between the number of households that each concession
services. It is estimated that each concession has bid on and installed roughly 20,000-26,000
units since inception and through about seven bidding rounds.38 Of these, NuRa in the deep
rural areas of Kwazulu-Natal, has been most successful in retaining customers. NuRa is also
the least dependent on FBE remittances from the local municipalities and receive almost all
its monthly fees from end-users directly.
The concession areas closest to the grid or subject to grid encroachment have been less
successful. Table 5.1 sets out the number of connections of each concessionaire.

survey was conducted by the University of Cape Town’s Energy Research Center into the

     Interviews with all four concessionaires
Shell-Eskom Concession in the Eastern Cape.40 This provides a useful insight into the way in
which the SHS is seen by its customers. In short, the SHS makes a significant difference in
the lives of those that benefit but it delivers well short of expectations in terms of what
customers expect from electrification. People want the level of service provided by the grid.
(That said, cost considerations mean that even those with grid supply can’t afford the
electricity for everything they would wish to use it for).
Table 3.1 compares homes with solar home systems, grid-connected homes, and non-
electrified households on their monthly household expenditure on candles and paraffin. It
shows that homes with solar home systems rely on traditional sources of lighting more than
homes with grid connections.

5.1.3 Sustainability
Today, the concessionaires operate in a fashion that is more similar to survivalist enterprises
rather than a commercial enterprise.
The original target size of the concessions, 50,000 units, was selected to make each
concession attractive to outside investors as potential sources of annuity income. The
income from each unit at the outset around 2,000 was to be ZAR48 per unit secured for 20
years. On the face of it and at the time, securing the monthly fee for a 50,000 customer base
would generate just less than ZAR29 million per annum and as such become an attractive
commercial prospect. For example, Solar Vision was able to attract a foreign private investor
at the outset on the basis of the expectation that recovering monthly fees of ZAR48 for each
installation across a 50,000 unit concession represented an attractive annuity income stream.

     Survey,? University of Cape Town, March 2004, accessed September 24, 2015,
     http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/Research/publications/04ERC-Solar%20electrification%20Eastern%20Cape-baseline.pdf
The envisaged scale would also permit a commitment to continue to service an installation
for a period of 20 years.41
The Government’s failure to deliver the expected 50,000 in subsidized installations per
concession is the biggest reason that concessionaires are now struggling. Other major
problems are the difficulties in getting municipalities to pay the Free Basic Electricity Grants;
customers abandoning the service because grid supply has become available, and general
difficulties in getting customers to pay the monthly fees.
Though the concessionaires would not share their financial information and their
profitability, we can deduce that the biggest concessions are generally the most sustainable:
             KES estimates that it needs around 30,000 customers in its two concession areas
              to cover minimum operational costs, and that is the number of customers it
              currently has. However, KES ascribes its continued survival as an enterprise in
              large part to the support that it has received from its shareholders.
             Solar Vision estimates that if the concessionaires are able to pare down all
              unnecessary costs, 10,000 customers can be serviced on a break-even basis. Today
              it services 6,600 customers, which may suggest that it is operating at a loss. We
              estimate that Solar Vision’s revenue is around ZAR705,000 (US$51,500) per
              month.42
             Ilitha is not financially sustainable as a commercial going concern but Ilitha is a
              cooperative. It says that it would not have been able to operate as a private
              company on commercial terms.
             We don’t know NuRa’s financial situation because we don’t know the costs facing
              the company. NuRa should have revenue of ZAR90 monthly from roughly
              18,000 customers. Accounting for a collection ratio of 70 percent, we can deduce
              that NuRa has revenue of around ZAR 1.13 million per month (US$83,000).
5.1.4 Efficiency
The solar home concession system is a lower cost approach to electrification than grid
connection. Table 5.3 provides a rough comparison of the cost of an electricity connection
to the grid compared to a solar home system.




41
     See clause 3.3 of Agreement for the Installation and Maintenance of Solar Home Systems - Annex 3
42
     This is calculated by multiplying the FBE contribution (ZAR) by the number of units (6,500) and dividing by the share of
     the revenue that comes from the municipalities (0.82).

Source: Department of Energy; Eskom; Solar Vision; Castalia calculations


The table shows the cost of a grid connection is around ZAR 171 per month, compared to a
monthly cost for a SHS of around ZAR98. This is the all-in cost, including amortizing the
capital cost, and adding maintenance and energy costs. This calculation suggest a cost
advantage in favor of solar home systems of around 43 percent.
Offsetting this cost advantage is the fact that the SHS delivers only about one third as much
energy as a typical rural customers would take from a grid system, and therefore is less
valuable to the customer. Clearly the cost advantage of the SHS would be reduced if it were
replaced with a grid connection before its 20 year life expired.
Despite the benefits of SHS to the fiscus, the subsidy directed towards off-grid solutions has
not kept pace with the subsidies provided to off-grid solutions as seen in the graphic below.

5.1.5 Other impacts
The SHS systems have had social and economic impacts on the lives of its rural users. These
conclusions suggest that solar home systems have had an overall positive impact on users.
This impact can primarily be seen through observed higher levels of education achieved
(however, correlation is not causation). Households with solar home systems also appeared

Table 5.4: Socio-Economic Impact of Solar Home Systems in NuRa Concession (July
2013)
Impact                Impact        Explanation
Category              of SHS
Safety                Neutral       Counterintuitively, households with SHS had lower perceived safety
                                    than households without SHS. PWC posits that beneficiaries may be
                                    targeted by criminals or that SHS increased awareness of safety risks
                                    (for example through increased mobile phone access).
                                    Some SHS households reported increased safety from presence of
                                    outdoor light and reduced risk of fires.
Education             Positive      Children in households with SHS generally have higher educational
                                    attainment than in households without SHS.
                                    Households with SHS are far more likely to report that their children
                                    “study sufficiently?.
Access to     Positive              Households with SHS showed higher levels of access to both radio and
communication                       television.
                                    96% of SHS households use mobile phones compared to 86% for non-
                                    SHS households
Household             Neutral       Households with SHS were no more or less likely to have seen a change
Income                              in their income from a year before.
Household             Neutral       Households with SHS tend to spend less of their “extra income? on
Expenditure                         food, and more on electricity.

5.2         Arrangements that Could Have Delivered Better Results
In our assessment, the SHS concession approach could have done better with the following
changes.
             Setting up an independent agency with the resources to focus on the off-
              grid concessions program. The concessions were largely managed by the
              Department of Energy, which is primarily a policy-making entity. The
              Department lacks technical and commercial expertise. Setting up an independent
              body like the one set up to procure large renewable generation projects (South
              Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program
              (REIPPPP) (see Appendix B) could have strengthened the institutional
              weaknesses described above.
             Scaling as intended: It was intended that each of the successful bidders would
              install 50,000 solar home systems during the first 5 years of the program.47 This
              would enable the economies of scale required for the businesses and the program

           to succeed. Delivering only a quarter of the expected number of installations, and
           doing so in small, intermittent packages, destroyed the concessionaire’s business
           model, and limited the impact of the program.
        Integrating long term planning for on-grid and off-grid expansion: The
         planning process in place (municipalities working with Eskom and with Integrated
         National Electrification Programme INEP) has resulted in short-term and ad hoc
         agreements rather than a long-term settled plan. In addition there is no agreement
         between Eskom, the Department of Energy the municipalities and the concession
         companies regarding grid and off-grid areas. An important consequence is that a
         material part of the investment in solar home systems was wasted as the grid was
         extended into areas where solar home systems had been installed, and customers
         switched to grid supply. In such cases the recoverable value of the solar home
         system is only around 20 percent of its original cost. Moreover, areas which will
         not in fact receive grid supply for 20 years nevertheless expect grid supply, and
         therefore do not consider alternative technologies.
5.3    Replicability of Experience and Success
While solar home systems are an increasingly viable option for rural electrification across
Africa, it would not be advisable for other countries to imitate South Africa’s attempt to
blanket large areas with subsidized SHS’s through the use of concessions.
The South African system derived from a determination to undo fundamental inequalities
created by apartheid. South Africa’s relative wealth and administrative capacity made it
plausible that solar home concession could rapidly deliver electricity to all off-grid areas. In
the end, the promise of the system was not met because of a lack of fiscal commitment and
administrative drive and coordination.
In most African countries the ability for government to pay for electricity investments from
the budget is much more limited than it was in South Africa. Across Africa, business and
households are paying for their own solar systems. A subsidized concession approach risks
killing this market. A better policy solution would be assist in improving and expanding
competitive private markets for sale, installation and maintenance of such systems. Markets
can be expanded by creating standards and certifications to enable customers to recognize
quality equipment; improving access to finance for customers and at all levels of the supply
chain, and meeting equity objectives by providing the poorest consumers with vouchers that
can be put toward the cost of certified systems. The Lighting Africa Program has shown
how this can be done with solar lanterns, and is working on similar approach for modular
solar home systems.

Appendix B: South Africa’s Renewable Energy
Independent Power Producer Procurement Program
(REIPPPP)
If mass electrification is one success of the post-Apartheid era, then the success of South
Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP)
is another. As of writing, from its launch in 2011, 64 separate projects have been completed
or are in the process of being built amounting to 4,944MW. This represents an investment
totaling ZAR120 billion.48
The key feature of the REIPPPP has been the establishment of a separate and well-funded
IPP office (although of an ad hoc nature) housed in the Department of Energy. The unit
followed an approach that emphasized problem solving, rather than enforcement of
administrative arrangements that often hinders public private partnerships (PPPs) in South
Africa. The IPP office also has benefited from extensive PPP expertise and has won
credibility with both public and private sector stakeholders.49 REIPPPP operates on a
competitive bidding basis which sees successful bidders entering into standard form Power
Purchase Agreements with Eskom, in turn guaranteed by the state. A key feature of
REIPPPP is that projects bid have had to be fully funded to prevent gaming the system with
impossibly low tariff offers (known as low-balling) which can’t be built. One problem with
this is the very high costs of getting the project ready to bid. To be funded, projects have to
submit to a technical due diligence prior to bidding because the commitment of a funder, if
the project is to make financial close, is made at that point.
While the relatively high compliance costs for participating in the REIPPPP has not
prevented enthusiastic participation by developers, sponsors and funders alike, these present
a problem for a separate small projects program50 which has failed to bring a single project
onto the grid. Their limited size has meant that transaction costs could not be absorbed and
therefore it is difficult to get private sector project finance for these types of projects51.
Several multi-year delays in the process of getting small projects through meant that project
developers, in general smaller companies, were unable to continue with the carrying costs of
such projects. For the reasons set out above, a lack of commercial viability has resulted in
many promising small-scale projects being abandoned by their promoters. As we shall see,
there are parallels with the Solar Home Systems described below.

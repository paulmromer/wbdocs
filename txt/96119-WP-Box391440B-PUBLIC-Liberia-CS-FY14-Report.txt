I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Liberia perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Liberia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Liberia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Liberia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Liberia;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Liberia.
    Use data to help inform Liberia country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
Between April and May 20141, 700 stakeholders of the WBG in Liberia were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 639 stakeholders participated in the survey (91% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to face.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Liberia; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Liberia; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’11. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in two
years, which allows for comparisons between two years. Stakeholder groups which were not
present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to
the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14 data
and the total number of respondents in two years are slightly different from those of the original
data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, F, G. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year
comparison results, please see appendix E (page 149).
A. General Issues Facing Liberia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Liberia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues Facing Liberia: priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): their familiarity with the WBG, its
   effectiveness in Liberia, WBG staff preparedness to help Liberia solve its development
   challenges, the WBG’s local presence, its collaboration with the UN, the WBG’s capacity
   building in Liberia, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and
   the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were asked to
   indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in
   helping reduce poverty in Liberia, and in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of
   its resources.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Liberia, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Liberia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the extent the
   WBG helps build existing country systems, the importance for the WBG to be involved in
   thirty five development areas, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across these areas, such
   as education, energy, job creation/employment and transport.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is adequately staffed locally and the contribution of the WBG’s
   technical assistance to solving Liberia’s development challenges.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Liberia: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Liberia and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country. They were asked what areas the country would
   benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would benefit most from
   other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Liberia, which WBG agencies they work with, their geographic locations, and
   whether they think that the IFC and the World Bank work well together.

II. Methodology (continued)

*Please note:

Only a quarter of this year’s respondents indicate that they professionally collaborate/work with
the World Bank Group in Liberia. This is worth noting because respondents who do not
collaborate with the WBG had significantly lower levels of familiarity with the institution than
those who do, and respondents’ levels of familiarity with the organization are significantly
correlated with their ratings for all indicator questions. Therefore, when interpreting the findings
throughout the report, please take into consideration the low percentage of respondents who
collaborate/work with the WBG this year and their comparatively lower familiarity with the
WBG.

Comparisons between responses from those who do and do not collaborate with the WBG are
described throughout the body of the report and in Appendix D (see page 133).

 Given the large number of respondents specializing in education and transport, cross-sectoral analyses were
conducted to examine if respondents from these two sectors dominated the overall responses to the multiple choice
questions about development priorities and sectoral areas which can contribute to economic growth and poverty
reduction in the country.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
          Respondents of this year’s Country Survey were significantly less familiar with the WBG
           (mean levels of familiarity = 5.2) than respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey (mean
           levels of familiarity = 6.8)3.
          Among all stakeholder groups, respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies were
           most familiar with the WBG, whereas respondents from the media and independent
           government institutions were significantly less familiar with the institution.
          Respondents from North Liberia were significantly less familiar with the WBG than
           respondents from other regions of the country.
          Respondents who professionally collaborate with the WBG were significantly more
           familiar (mean levels of familiarity = 6.1) with the institution than those who do not
           collaborate with it (mean levels of familiarity = 5.1).
          Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
           with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Liberia, and significantly,
           moderately correlated with the respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to
           Liberia’s development or its ability to help achieve development results in Liberia.

      In the FY’11 Country Survey, respondents indicated that the greatest contributors to
       poverty reduction in Liberia were “agriculture development? (47%) and “education?
       (35%), whereas this year’s respondents believe that “education? and “energy? will
       contribute most to reducing poverty in Liberia.
      While overall “education? is perceived as the greatest contributor to poverty reduction in
       Liberia, respondents from the office of parliamentarian and media were significantly
       more likely consider it the greatest contributor to reducing poverty in Liberia than
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.
      Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies were significantly more likely to
       indicate that “energy? is the greatest contributor to reducing poverty in Liberia compared
       to respondents from other stakeholder groups.
      Respondents from South East of Liberia were significantly more likely to indicate that
       “energy? is the greatest contributor to reducing poverty in Liberia than respondents from
       other regions of the country.
      Respondents across sectoral focuses, whether they collaborate with the WBG or not, all
       agreed that “education? and “energy? are the top two contributors to reducing poverty in
       Liberia.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Where the World Bank Group Should Focus its Resources (continued)
      Respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey indicated that the WBG should focus its
       resources in “peace and security? (40%), whereas respondents in this year’s Country
       Survey believe that that WBG should focus mostly on “education,? “health? and
       “energy.?
      Among the top areas in which stakeholders believe the WBG should focus its resources,
       respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies were significantly more likely to think
       that the WBG should focus its resources on “energy? and “health? than respondents from
       other stakeholder groups.
      Respondents from independent government institutions, CSOs and private
       sector/financial sector/private banks were significantly more likely to indicate that the
       WBG should focus its resources on “energy? and “health? than respondents from other
       regions of the country.
      Respondent who do not collaborate with the WBG were significantly more likely to
       indicate that the WBG should focus its resources on “health? than respondents who do.
      Respondent who specialize in “education? (24% of the sample) were significantly more
       likely to indicate that the WBG should focus its resources on “education? than
       respondents who specialize in other areas.
      Respondent who specialize in “transport? (11% of the sample) were significantly more
       likely to indicate that the WBG should focus its resources on “health? than respondents
       who specialize in other areas.

As noted in the “Methodology? section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)
          This year’s respondents gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in
           Liberia (weighted mean = 6.5) than respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey (weighted
           mean = 7.5)8.
          Respondents across stakeholder groups had statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
           overall effectiveness in Liberia.
          Respondents located in Central, Western Liberia had significantly higher ratings for the
           WBG’s effectiveness in Liberia than respondents located in other regions of the country.
          Respondents who do and do not professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had
           statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Liberia as well.

  NOTE: It is worth pointing out that in FY11 and FY14, the ratings for effectiveness are significantly, strongly
correlated with the ratings for familiarity (r=.63, p<.01). Therefore, although respondents in FY14 gave
significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in Liberia than those in FY11, the drop in ratings could be
related to the significantly lower levels of familiarity with the institution in FY14.

Effectiveness of the WBG Activities
      There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in four of the following activities (listed below). For the most part,
       respondents from the office of parliamentarians and local governments had the highest
       ratings, whereas respondents from the Office of President/Prime Minister/Ministers had
       significantly lower ratings.

       effectiveness of the following WBG activities in supporting Liberia’s efforts to achieve
       development results.
      Respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher ratings for
       the WBG’s effectiveness in building “linkage to South-South knowledge sharing? than
       those who do collaborate with the institution.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey indicated that they most often attributed
       failures of World Bank-assisted reform efforts to inadequate citizen/civil society

      Among all respondents this year, consultants working on WBG projects, respondents
       from ministries/PMUs, and academia/research institutes/think tanks were significantly
       more likely to indicate that slow WBG-assisted reforms should be attributed to “not
       enough adequate level of citizen/civil society participation? compared to respondents
       from other stakeholder groups.
      And respondents from Central, Western Liberia were significantly more likely to say so

Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
      There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in all of the thirty five sectoral areas (except “transport?). For detailed
       ratings, please go to Appendix B (page 94).
      There were significant geographic differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in eighteen of the thirty five sectoral areas. For detailed ratings, please go to
       Appendix C (page 116).
      It is worth pointing out that respondents who specialize in “transport? (11% of the
       sample) gave significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in almost all of the
       thirty five sectoral areas (including “transport?) than respondents specialized in
       “education? and other areas.
      Respondents across sectoral specialization gave statistically similar ratings for the
       WBG’s effectiveness in “health.?
      Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 76) that primarily
       informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
       “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
       areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Liberia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty five specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Liberia. The
       areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and,
               The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Liberia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
               The WBG’s effectiveness economic growth;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
               The WBG’s effectiveness at security/stabilization/reconstruction.

Appendix E: Responses to All Questions by Year13
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.
FY ’11 Number of comparable respondents = 527  FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 570
By weighting, FY11 and FY14 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 World Bank Group’s effectiveness in Liberia.*
(1-Not effective at all, 10-Very effective) *Significantly different between FY14 and FY11 country surveys
NOTE: It is worth pointing out that in FY11 and FY14, the ratings for effectiveness are significantly, strongly correlated with the ratings for
familiarity (r=.63, p<.01). Therefore, although respondents in FY14 gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in Liberia than
those in FY11, the drop in ratings could be related to the significantly lower levels of familiarity with the institution in FY14.

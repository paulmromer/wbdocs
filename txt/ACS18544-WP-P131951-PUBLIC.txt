This synthesis report details the process, outputs and intermediate outcomes of technical assistance (TA)
to support the Government of Bangladesh in developing information systems that incentivize
improvements in the quality of urban water and sanitation services through enhancing the
responsiveness of water and sanitation providers in particular to poor consumers. The strategic focus was
on information systems (i.e. quantitative data tools and qualitative assessments) to strengthen the
incentives for the central government and local providers to focus on the quality-of-service bottlenecks
(i.e. operation and maintenance, consumer satisfaction, inclusion, regulation) in key aspects of the service
delivery chain (i.e. water safety, water extraction, fecal sludge management and waste water disposal) to
complement the existing high levels of access to low quality water and sanitation services.

Executive Summary
This synthesis report details the intermediate outcomes, outputs and process of the World Bank Water
Supply and Sanitation Program Technical Assistance to Strengthening Poor-Inclusive Urban Water and
Sanitation (UWSS) Service Quality Information Systems in Bangladesh (P131951).

This technical assistance (TA) supported the Government of Bangladesh to develop information systems
that incentivize improvements in the quality of urban water and sanitation services through enhancing
the responsiveness of water and sanitation providers in particular to poor consumers. The strategic
focus was on developing information systems (i.e. quantitative data tools and qualitative assessments)
to strengthen the incentives for both the central government and local providers to focus on the quality-
of-service bottlenecks (i.e. operation and maintenance, consumer satisfaction, inclusion, regulation) in
the service delivery chain (i.e. water safety, water extraction, fecal sludge management, and waste
water disposal) to complement the existing high levels of access to low quality water and sanitation
services.

Specifically, this TA contributed to the following intermediate outcomes:
(a) Increased responsiveness of urban water and sanitation service providers to consumers, in particular
    those in the bottom 2 quintiles:
     Quantitative: Through an expansion in the number of utilities under the quantitative
        benchmarking program from 11 utilities in FY08 to more than 57 utilities in FY15. In FY13/14
        alone, the expansion of networks within the benchmarked 34 utilities and the extension of the
        program to a further 23 utilities equated to an additional 3.9 million people receiving water
        services from utilities where operational data is being quantitatively benchmarked.
     Qualitative: The uptake of demand-side consumer satisfaction surveys (against the utility
        benchmarks) by utilities including the hosting of citizen forum meetings in more than 10
        municipalities in FY14/15 was instrumental in improving the accountability of utilities for the
        quality of their water services.
     Poor Inclusive: An additional 48,600 consumers in low income communities served through the
        extension of legal water connections including access to a mobile phone based redressal system
        and bill payment options.

(b) Improved capacity of the Government to monitor and incentivize the quality of urban water and
    sanitation service provision:
     Following the passage of the Water Act (2013), the Water Resource Planning Organization
        (WARPO), Local Government Division (LGD), Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE)
        and municipalities have collaborated on the drafting of rules / by-laws for the implementation of
        the Water Act in urban areas.
     A Bill for the establishment of the Bangladesh Water Regulatory Commission for urban areas has
        been passed by the Local Government Ministry and the National Forum for Water Supply and
        Sanitation and sent to the Law Ministry.
     The Ministry of Local Government has established a Committee to oversee the drafting of a
        National Fecal Sludge Management (FSM) Framework (that will potentially include the
        introduction of a FSM tax to internalize the externalities of poor quality sanitation).
     The Ministry of Local Government has issued guidelines enabling the extension of water and
        sewerage connections into low income communities separate from the requirement for tenure
        security.


                                                                                             5|Page
The major activities supported by this TA over the period from 2011-2015 have been:
     Technical assistance to 57 utilities to annually benchmark water management performance (i.e.
       the provision of benchmarking training, data compilation and cleaning, comparing data
       nationally and internationally through the International Benchmarking Network for Water
       Supply and Sanitation Utilities (IBNet), networking workshops and peer learning visits).
     Technical support to 10 pourashavas to undertake consumer satisfaction surveys (i.e. develop
       the questionnaires, train local enumerators, collate & analyze the data, compare this demand
       side results against supply side benchmarking results, conduct public meetings between elected
       representatives, utility staff and consumers).
     Analysis of fecal sludge management in Dhaka (i.e. the conducting of the Political Economy
       Analysis, Fecal Flow Diagram calculations, Service Delivery Assessment as part of the global
       study on fecal sludge management and consolidating World Bank feedback on the draft of a
       national Fecal Sludge Management Framework developed by the Government).
     Technical support in water utility reform management processes (i.e. hosting of a South Asia
       regional utility managers workshop bringing together global and local experiences of utility
       management reform; the conducting of a detailed technical assessment for Dhaka Water and
       Sewerage Authority (DWASA) on the options for the decentralization of management autonomy
       and the strengthening of management accountability through the zonal benchmarking of service
       delivery performance).
     Analytical support to the Ministry of Local Government in the Implementation of the Water Act
       (i.e. local consultations, workshops, analysis and recommendations to ensure that the rules and
       by-laws for the implementation of the recently passed Water Act (2013) are aligned with the
       Local Government Acts (2009), the Water and Sewerage Authority Acts (1996) and the draft
       Water and sanitation Regulatory Commission Bill (2016)).
     Analysis of the options for extending water and sanitation services to low income communities
       (i.e. support to DWASA in the assessment of the existing water and sanitation service delivery
       status in Low Income Communities (LICs) and the development of a Low Income Customer
       Service Improvement Plan (LICSIP) including the costed public investment requirements. For
       small paurashavas, this included an assessment of the options for leveraging water and
       sanitation service delivery improvements in LICs).

Follow-up recommendations for this TA are:
     the establishment of the Bangladesh Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission
        (BWSSRC) to institutionalize the incentives for water utility benchmarking.
     the deployment of the ‘Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Connect’ mobile application
        (http://www.slbconnect.in/) developed with TA support in India to systematize the
        interrogation of ‘supply side’ utility benchmarking data with ‘demand side’ consumer feedback
        against the same performance indicators.
     to explore the costs / benefits of investing in primary wastewater treatment plants to treat the
        outfalls of the storm water drains that carry almost all of the fecal waste in Dhaka.
     to interrogate kW.hr electricity consumption data from all sewage pump stations and treatment
        plants prior to considering any investment in the expansion of any sewerage system.
     to explore the instruments that government can deploy to leverage those exercising ownership
        rights over low income community (LIC) land and housing assets to also bear the financing
        liability for the investments in water and sanitation asset improvements necessary to meet
        specific quality of service standards.

Background
1. Bangladesh has made significant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal
   (MDG) 7 targets for both improved water supply and sanitation access of the Bangladesh
   population. The recent WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) 2015 shows that 98% of the
   population has access to a protected source while 87% of the population has access to an improved
   water supply. While only 1% of the population currently practices open defecation, 61% of the
   population has access to improved sanitation facilities, another 28% and 10% of the population
   respectively has access to shared or unimproved sanitation facilities1.

2. While access has increased substantially, there are still significant challenges if Bangladesh is going
   to ensure safe, affordable, reliable and sustainable services for all. For sanitation, while there has
   been a significant movement in Bangladesh from ‘open defecation’ towards ‘fixed point defecation,’
   the quality of sanitation coverage is an emerging area of concern, with over 40% of all latrines
   classified as ‘unimproved’ according to the MICS 2012-13. For water supply, while access to a
   protected source is almost universal, severe quality issues mean that only 34.6% of households
   consume water which meets both the Bangladesh standard for arsenic (<=50 ppb) and E. coli (<=1
   cfu/100 ml). 2

3. With regard to urban service provision, piped water supply reaches only 32% of the population1 (and
   only a third or 102 of the 308 Pourashavas), while the growing majority of the urban population
   relies on hand pumps for drinking water. With the intermittent, unreliable and questionable safety
   of piped water supplies, most households that are connected to piped water are forced to treat this
   water for drinking or continue to drink water from hand pumps. Urban sanitation is also largely
   comprised of on-site sanitation with access to basic and improved sanitation improving for the
   poorest segment of the population but still lagging behind the level of access of the richest quintile
   of the population. Across the urban centers of Bangladesh, there is no systematic excreta disposal
   and treatment system. Only Dhaka has a sewerage system serving only 25% of the city but where
   almost all of the effluent, the solid and liquid waste is transferred to low lying areas, canals and
   rivers with little or no treatment3.

4. Given the high levels of access to basic water and sanitation services in urban areas in Bangladesh
   but the low quality of water and sanitation services from that infrastructure, the Government
   through this TA has sought to improve the overall quality of service provision through enhancing
   information systems which are inclusive of the particular characteristics of low income communities
   (i.e. the bottom 40% of the urban population). This sought to (a) increase the responsiveness of
   urban water and sanitation service providers to consumers, in particular those in the bottom 2
   quintiles and (b) improve the capacity of the Government to monitor and incentivize the quality of
   urban water and sanitation service provision through targeted activities directed towards the
   following three areas:
         Urban Water Supply: Quantitative expansion of utility benchmarking (https://www.ib-
            net.org/) and qualitative deepening via exchange visits and consumer satisfaction surveys.
         Urban Sanitation: Development of fecal sludge management and wastewater management
            diagnostic tools and their application in the Bangladesh context.

 Overview of Technical Assistance
 5. This technical assistance (TA) supported the Government of Bangladesh to develop information
    systems that incentivize improvements in the quality of urban water and sanitation services through
    enhancing the responsiveness of water and sanitation providers in particular to poor consumers.
    The strategic focus was on developing information systems (i.e. quantitative data tools and
    qualitative assessments) to strengthen the incentives for both the central government and local
    providers to focus on the quality-of-service bottlenecks (i.e. operation and maintenance, consumer
    satisfaction, inclusion, regulation) in the service delivery chain (i.e. water safety, water extraction,
    fecal sludge management, and waste water disposal) to complement the existing high levels of
    access to low quality water and sanitation services. Specifically, this TA contributed to the following
    intermediate outcomes:

 Process
 6. Knowledge support has been extended to the national and local governments that oversee service
    provision, as well as utilities and NGOs that manage service provision to improve the quality and
    inclusiveness of urban service delivery arrangements. The interventions have included field
    assessments, analytical notes and studies, presentations, study tours and training programs. In
    order to deliver greater impact, some of these have been undertaken in partnership with existing
    and proposed Bank projects, as well as government programs related to urban water supply. The
                                                                                                      8|Page
    areas of support under this TA are in alignment with the government’s overall agenda for the sector
    in terms of strengthening the accountability, capacity and viability of the urban water supply and
    sanitation sector in Bangladesh.

7. The benchmarking process was initiated with 11 utilities in Bangladesh. As there are no sewerage
   systems in Bangladesh (outside of Dhaka), the IBNet format was adapted to purely focus on drinking
   water supply. These utilities were supported to generate the operational data necessary to shift
   from indicators of access to infrastructure to operational indicators of service delivery performance.
   Through the provision of ‘hands on’ training and benchmarking formats, water utility
   superintendents were trained in collection, collation and interrogation of benchmarking data. These
   utilities were then supported to form a network for the routine sharing and comparing of the data
   generated which then formed the basis for the generation of the water utility performance
   improvement plans. These performance improvement plans sought to direct future investments to
   address the areas where the water utility benchmark performance was comparatively poor and
   where the good practices of other utilities potential offered solutions to improve service delivery
   performance. Translating the service improvement plans into investment plans was then sought by
   broadening the engagement beyond the water utilities to include the Mayors of the respective
   municipalities. Over the course of this TA, the benchmarking process of training and handholding,
   collating and uploading to IBNet, sharing data and networking on good practices, preparing
   performance improvement plans and investment plans, managing and measuring water service
   delivery improvements was extended from 26 to 57 utilities.

8. Through the course of this TA the risk of utilities producing supply side operational performance
   data ‘at odds’ with the demand side experience of consumers was managed in several ways.
    The first, was through the generation of demand side consumer satisfaction data on the same
       supply side benchmarking indicators generated by the utility. The focus on using the data to
       drive practical improvements in service delivery performance was achieved by engaging with
       elected representatives of the municipality to arbitrate on the disparities in perceptions of
       performance.
    The second, was to utilize peer pressure within the utility network to drive real service delivery
       performance improvements. Through the rotation of the hosting of benchmarking network
       meetings combined with site visits to ‘best practices’ within the hosting utility the incentives of
       utilities to falsify data and fudge best practices was reduced. On the contrary, this created
       incentives for utility managers to deliver above and beyond the call of duty.
    The third, was through the strategic engagement with the Mayors of the municipalities on the
       interface between routine utility benchmarking performance, municipal investment plans and
       consumer satisfaction. In most cases, the collective influence of the mayors of the municipalities
       was a stronger influence for substantive policy change at the central level (and municipal level)
       than that of the utility managers or the lobby of external technical assistance.

9. The engagement of the TA with utility managers and municipality mayors under the benchmarking
   program highlighted the need for increased influence at the policy level. The regulation of ground
   water resources through the pricing of water animating the drafting of the Water Act (2013)
   provided the basis for this TA to engage with the government to deliberate on the role assigned to
   municipal governments for drinking water and sanitation. The provision of analytical technical
   assistance to the Ministry of Local Government was instrumental in ensuring that the role of Local
   Governments and their utilities was prioritized in the Implementation of the Water Act by the


                                                                                              9|Page
       Ministry of Water Resources and that pricing of water is prioritized in the draft Water and sanitation
       Regulatory Commission Bill (2016).

10. As there are no sewerage systems in Bangladesh (except for Dhaka) and as the utility benchmarking
    process was focused purely on water utilities, resources under this TA were directed towards the
    generation of knowledge on the onsite management of sanitation in Bangladesh preference to
    networked management. Focusing the knowledge generation under this TA on Dhaka (boasting a
    sewerage system servicing 25% of the population of the city4) enabled the pros and cons of on-site
    fecal sludge management versus networked sewerage systems to be elaborated. This included the:
     collation of primary and secondary data necessary to generate the Fecal Flow Diagram (FFD)
     exploration of policies and programs required to generate the Service Delivery Assessment
        (SDA)
     conducting of interviews and mapping of stakeholders for the Political Economy Analysis (PEA)
    for the city of Dhaka. This provided the TA with the knowledge base on which to engage with the
    government to (a) raise the need to address on-site fecal sludge management, (b) the assignment of
    responsibilities for fecal sludge management in Dhaka, and (c) provide advice on the draft of the
    national fecal sludge management framework for Bangladesh.

11. Throughout the course of this TA, support has been directed towards the generation of information
    justifying a poor inclusive approach to water and sanitation service delivery. This has incorporated
    (a) strengthening the focus of water utilities on operational cost recovery from all consumers
    including the poor, and (b) the assessment of effective interventions for delivering improved water
    and sanitation services to the poor. For the former, this TA has prioritized support to DWASA to
    develop systems that enable DWASA to reduce non-revenue water (NRW) including that which is
    lost to the Low Income Community (LIC) consumers of DWASA water. For the latter, this TA has
    targeted the knowledge support to learning from different NGO interventions in Low Income
    Communities (LICs) and translating this into investment modalities by DWASA that can accelerate
    the extension of services to the poor in LICs. This support has been extended to DWASA through the
    World Bank supported Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation Project (DWSSP) specifically through the
    extension of technical assistance for the feasibility, design, procurement of investment options for
    extension of services under the Low Income Community (LIC) component. The lessons learnt from
    the engagement with NGOs and DWASA in low income communities in Dhaka in combination with
    the ongoing engagement with utilities under the benchmarking program providing the basis for the
    development of social and legal options for leveraging those who exercise land ownership rights in
    LICs to make investments to improve water and sanitation services within LICs.

12. It is important to note that the service delivery improvements supported through this TA were the
    result of the investment of resources (financial, human, social, knowledge) by the Government of
    Bangladesh, bi-lateral and multi-lateral Development Partners, the municipalities and the utilities,
    NGOs and civil society. The contribution of this TA was to provide the information management
    systems for the generation of the knowledge to leverage specific targeted service delivery
    improvements that are sustained by substantive policy changes. This also explains why this TA
    directed considerable effort to the collation of government and development partner data-bases to
    identify who is directing what investments, under which programs, to which municipality. Resources
    under this TA were also directed to support the work of the World Bank as the co-chair of the official
    Government platform for coordination in the water supply and sanitation sector. This unique

                              Increased Utility Responsiveness to Consumers
                              14. Increased responsiveness of urban water and sanitation service providers to consumers, has been
                                  assimilated through the compilation of benchmarking data from WASAs and municipalities.
                              Improved Utility Viability (Target = Operating Ratio <1) 5
                              15. The average viability of the water utilities decreased as the program expanded to incorporate
                                  smaller less viable utilities from FY07 to FY15 (i.e. the average operating ratio increased from 0.68 to
                                  1.0). The decreasing viability of Khulna, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Comilla and Sylhet City
                                  Corporations is a function of the high cost of supply and/or challenges associated with recent
                                  changes to adopt the City Corporation governance structure. Despite these decreases in viability, an
                                  average operating ratio of less than 1 indicates that most of the utilities are viable, all be it operating
                                  from a very low base of cost and quality of service.

                              Improved Personnel Efficiency (Target = Staffing ratio <8 per ‘000 connections)6
                              16. Probably, the most notable area of improvement has been the consistent reduction in the staffing
                                  ratio across all utilities, which has decreased from 9.2 staff per thousand connections in the 11
                                  utilities in FY07 to 8.7 staff per thousand connections in 54 of the utilities in FY15. This is associated
                                  with staff reductions and increased performance that does not fully capture the improvements in
                                  efficiency associated with a massive increase in the number of people served as single connections
                                  to households are upgraded to serve to multi-dwelling units and then high-rise apartment buildings.

                              17. There has been a steady increase the average collection efficiency from 74% in FY07 to 77% in FY15.
                                  In general, the average billing and collection efficiency drops as the programme expands to
                                  incorporate new utilities with lower efficiencies and then improves as those individual utilities
                                  become engaged in performance improvement plans to improve their billing and collection cycle.

                                    18. The reduction of accounts receivables has consistently improved with outstanding dues reducing
                                        from an average of 190 days in 11 utilities in FY07 to 99.7 days in 54 of the utilities in FY15. The
                                        major improvements in performance occur within the utilities that have been in the program for
                                        several years (i.e. the accounts receivable in the 39 utilities under the program in FY13 improved
                                        from 110 days in FY13 to 98 days in FY14 but the newly joined utilities pushed the average up to 109

                               Services to the Poor (Target = Revenues from Low-income Consumers Increase by 100%)
                               21. With the establishment of the Low Income Community (LIC) Unit within Dhaka WASA in 2009 there
                                   has been consistent growth in the number of LIC consumers with legal connections. Since this time,
                                   DWASA has increased the number of registered connections in LICs by 870% from the 121
                                   connections in FY09 to a total of 1,174 connections in FY15 serving about 108,800 people on public
                                   land (or about 12% of the 884,000 people that live in public LICs). There is however an estimated
                                   additional 2 million customers living in LICs and paying alternative sources for the consumption of
                                   DWASA water through illegal connections. At an estimated BDT 608 per connection an additional 2
                                   million more connection customers in LICs, should enable DWASA to generate an additional BDT 156
                                   million revenue per year10.
                                         The World Bank was the first donor to allocate USD 10 million dollars to DWASA to scale up
                                            the NGO intermediary model for extending services to LICs. Although this project has
                                            suffered from various procurement challenges, subsequent other ADB and UNICEF
                                            supported projects with DWASA have successfully extended water and sanitation services in
                                            LIC areas.

                               Improved Government Capacity
                               22. Improved capacity of the Government to monitor and incentivize the quality of urban water and
                                   sanitation service provision has been supported through the establishment of regulatory systems to
                                   identify, monitor and share quality of services, including;
                               Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission
                               23. While most of the water supply and sanitation budget is allocated to urban areas, these financial
                                   commitments are insufficient to meet the demands of the urban WSS sector. To increase the ability
                                   of public utilities to raise revenues, the Government drafted a bill for the establishment of the
                                   Bangladesh Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission (BWSSRC). This draft Bill for the
                                   establishment of the BWSSRC has been cleared by the Ministry of Local Government, the National
                                   Forum on Water Supply and Sanitation and is currently with the Law Ministry.
                                        Under this TA, several rounds of comments on the draft Bill proposed that the Water
                                           Regulatory Commission should not be responsible for both the setting of standards as well
                                           as arbitrating on tariffs. The draft Bill was subsequently amended to focus the Commission
                                           on data generation and management, community consultation and arbitration on the tariff
                                           implications of the quality of service standards set by the government.

Rules for the Water Act to Regulate Abstraction
24. In FY13, the government passed the Water Act enshrining the right to water and the responsibility
    of government to license abstraction. In FY14, the WARPO on behalf of the Ministry of Water
    Resources has commenced drafting rule to address the issues of pricing for water resources, the
    delegation of authority for licensing and alignment with other Acts i.e. Local Government
    (Municipal) Acts and the WASA Act. These rules and potential model by-laws for municipal
    authorities are currently under preparation by WARPO with collaboration from LGD.
         This TA has supported various workshops, meetings and analysis bringing together the
            WARPO and LGD, City Corporations and Pourashavas, DPHE and WASAs to deliberate on the
            implications of the Water Act on the existing Municipal / WASA Acts. As a result of these
            several potential areas of alignment between these Acts were identified. One of the most
            promising areas of alignment was the assignment of the authority for licensing ground
            water abstraction compliance to the municipalities whilst retaining the powers of regulating
            failure with the WARPO (on behalf of the Ministry). Another prospective area of alignment is
            the establishment of a regulatory authority for the pricing of water resources.
Policies and Data on the Provision of Services to Low-Income Communities
25. The model for the extension of water and sanitation services to low income communities (LICs) has
    evolved over the last decade in Dhaka. This is primarily a social intermediation model where NGOs
    invest in storage / distribution systems in LICs, establish CBOs and assist them to obtain a registered
    connection. While this model has become well established, its scale-up has been limited by the pace
    of infrastructure investments of NGOs. In addition, given that these CBOs are not registered entities
    the connection with DWASA is generally registered in the name of a single member of the CBO who
    may then be in a position to exploit the assets provided by the NGOs. The acceptance of this service
    provision model by DWASA has led to changes in the DWASA guidelines for the provision of water
    connections enabling connections to be provided into registered and non-registered LICs. However,
    given the large numbers of people in LICs illegally consuming and paying someone else for DWASA
    water, the challenge is to scale-up the legalization of connections in LICs.
          This TA has extended support to DWASA to develop a Low-Income Customers Service
             Improvement Plan (LICSIP). This proposed that DWASA should could scale-up LIC
             connections by (a) introducing some immunity from prosecution for illegal connections, (b)
             streamlining the process for obtaining a registered connection (including reducing the fees
             and introducing a mobile based redressal service) and (c) broadening the criteria for the
             registration of a legal connection to include a trade license or a National Identity Card.
Fecal Sludge Management Scorecard
26. While citizens and government have focused on the eradication of open defecation, only recently
    has there been any recognition of the need to improve fecal sludge management. The government
    has recently established a committee to oversee the drafting of a National Fecal Sludge
    Management Framework for Bangladesh. The first draft of the fecal sludge framework for Dhaka
    city proposed the introduction of a fecal sludge management tax on all households by local
    governments (linked to holding tax) for the public good costs associated with the management of
    fecal sludge. It also suggested the establishment of environmental police, a database of sanitation
    disposal systems and payments for delivery of fecal sludge (all of which could potentially be
    financed and managed as part of the fecal sludge management tax system). While these are
    extremely progressive ideas to improve the management of fecal sludge in Bangladesh, this
    potentially demands the reform of the regulatory systems that govern the containment / emptying /
    transport / treatment and re-use of fecal sludge in Bangladesh.

           This TA has supported several studies of fecal sludge management in Dhaka. This has
            included estimates to enable the calculation of the Fecal Flow Diagram, the Service Delivery
            Assessment and Political Economy Analysis. This analysis found most fecal effluent and
            sludge is simply discharged into the storm water drains. However, given the general high
            levels of satisfaction and low individual costs associated with the use of storm water drains
            for the discharge of fecal matter, challenging this status quo is bound to be difficult.
Model By-laws for Local Governments to Control Wastewater
27. Following several high profile building collapses in Dhaka and an explosion of the property
    development market into high rise apartments, there have been several revisions to the Bangladesh
    National Building Code (BNBC) in regards to the design and construction of sanitary facilities
    including the training of builders, plumbers and masons. Under the code the Local Development
    Authorities and/or Municipalities are delegated the authority to issue land use permits (against
    spatial development plans), building permits (against the building code), occupancy permits
    (building inspection against the approved plans) and revoking builders licenses (against inspection
    non-compliance). Under the 1997 Environmental Conservation Rules, municipalities are also
    responsible to issue No Objection Certificates (NoC) for industries / projects seeking environmental
    clearance from the Department of Environment. While these various rules seem to be clear in
    regards to the allocation of responsibilities, the reality is that none of these procedures appear to be
    followed.
          This TA has supported an assessment of the various rules / standards / codes that relate to
            sanitation in Dhaka. This included feedback to a Ministry of Local Government established
            committee to develop a national fecal sludge management framework for Bangladesh which
            proposed the introduction of a FSM tax (as a component of the property holding tax
            assessment formula) to assess household sanitation status, finance environmental police
            and the purchase of fecal sludge for treatment.

Urban Water Supply: Utility Benchmarking and Consumer Surveys
28. Under this TA, support for benchmarking has focused on incentivizing improvements in the O&M of
    water supply systems through the networking and sharing of quantitative performance data
    amongst a total of 57 utilities in FY14. The validity of supply side data has been strengthened
    through the select support for qualitative demand side compilation of consumer satisfaction
    information. Together, these systems for generating information on the operational performance of
    public water supply providers have provided an information base to address key quality of water
    supply service issues at the policy level (i.e. evaluating quality and raising tariffs through a
    Regulatory Commission, developing a legal basis for regulating ground water abstraction). The
    primary outputs under this component have been:
Benchmarking to Improve Urban Water Supply Delivery in Bangladesh (2014)
29. The water utility benchmarking report for Bangladesh
    https://www.ib-net.org/docs/Bangladesh_Report.pdf
    summarizes the data of the 33 utilities participating
    within the water utility network in the period from 2011
    - 2012 (FY12) against IBNet water utility indicators. This
    includes an analysis of the time series data for the 7
    utilities that initiated this utility benchmarking process in
    2007 and those other utilities as and when they joined
    the network. To improve analysis of utility performance
    across the network this data was also broken down into
    bands depending on the number of water utility
    customers.        Based      on       the   peer    reviewer
    recommendations, this document also includes analysis
    of the institutions (legal, administrative, water resources)
    responsible for urban water supply and sanitation.
    (See Annex 1 for the full utility benchmarking report)

30. Key findings from benchmarking data analysis are that:
      Utility performance is being challenged by urban population growth rates of an average of 3%
         per year which negatively affects many indicators (i.e. coverage rates, hours of supply). Utilities
         experiencing the greatest difficulties are those serving populations of 500,000 to 1 million.
      Utilities are generally covering their operation and maintenance costs from tariffs but the
         tariffs are so low (<USD 0.2/m3) that the utilites can only afford to deliver a low quality service.
      High labour costs (>50% in all utilities) infer low expenditures on maintenance and high
         electricity costs (>29% in all utilities) represent high vulnerability to shock from changes in
         electricity prices.

31. Key findings from the institutional analysis are that:
      The ad-hoc tariff setting by Pourashava Councils has not resulted in tariffs that can generate
         the revenue necessary for utilities to deliver high quality and responsive drinking water
         services.
      The overlap of the roles of DPHE, LGED and and LGIs (e.g. Union Parishad and Pourashavas)
         needs to be clarified in the form of rules and regulations by the Local Government Division.


                                                                                                18 | P a g e
         There is the need for greater delegation of licensing powers to local governments and
          improved enforcement of the regulation of failure under the existing Local Government Acts,
          2009.

Urban Development Assistance Map / Graphs
32. One of the realizations under the utility benchmarking
    process was that multiple donors were working to
    support multiple utilities to improve urban services but
    there was no consolidated central picture of ‘who’ was
    doing ‘what’ and ‘where’. Through the urban LCG, this
    TA supported the preparation of a consolidated map of
    who / what / where for urban development assistance
    making both the front end and back end data available
    to other partners. This has subsequently been updated
    by JICA and ADB for their own purposes
    High resolution map and data sets of Urban
    Development Assistance have been included at Annex 2

33. Working through the urban LCG, this TA then collated
    and uniformly coded urban data sets that included
    water and sanitation in all 316 Pourashavas (JICA),
    mayor affiliation and contact details (USAID),
    pourashava population, water and sanitation access
    details (BBS). Through the urban LCG this data was
    loaded on the WSS Open Data Platform enabling the
    visualization of urban data as well as the downloading
    of the back-end data sets. Utilizing these urban data
    sets, this TA analyzed all of the urban centres in
    Bangladesh against different parameters. This sought                             Source: LGD & Urban LCG data compilation

    to identify to identify priority urban centres for differing water supply and sanitation investment
    projects against the following parameters
     Sanitation Poverty (i.e. open defecation density, latrine access vs poverty and renters)
     Water Poverty (i.e. access to water, poverty vs water access, governance vs political affiliation)
     Hard to Access Water (i.e. saline, arsenic, iron, rock layer, low yield affected water sources)
     O&M Reliability (i.e. operating ratio, coverage, accounts receivable, collection eff., staffing ratio)
              Analysis of the different targeting options for Urban Development Assistance are at Annex 2
DWASA Decentralization (Benchmarking Zonal Management) Report
34. Water supply is being improved city-wide by building district metered areas (DMAs) across DWASA’s
    entire service area. Each DMA will have continuous supply and reach all communities within it,
    including all LICs. DMAs will be rolled out over time with 63 DMAs scheduled to be completed by
    March 2016, covering about eight million of Dhaka’s roughly 15 million people. This TA supported
    DWASA to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the options for introducing delegated zonal
    management within DWASA. The DWASA Zonal Management report has proposed driving down the
    management / budget authority within the utility while holding zonal managers to account through
    the benchmarking of their performance against other zones.




                                                                                                         19 | P a g e
35. The assessment report found that there is limited autonomy at the zonal level. Zonal technical and
    revenue operations are very closely related with one affecting the other but zonal technical and
    revenue operations are not structured under common leadership, but rather run as parallel streams
    each reporting to their functional heads. They are not organized under one administrative unit, and
    therefore do not function as business units which can minimize costs and enhance efficiency. This
    affects effective coordination of deliverables and hence revenue performance. This report also
    found that while DWASA has a Citizen Charter and an outsourced Call Center with an automated
    system for recording complaints and escalating unaddressed complaints at the zonal level, the
    assessment found that there was no central process owner to manage, monitor and evaluate
    customer service / satisfaction.
                  The Diagnostic Report of the Organizational Structure of DWASA is included at Annex 3.

36. Subsequent analysis sought to improve DWASA’s performance by improving its organizational
    structure and human resource management. The development of structural reforms were guided by
    the imperatives to (a) support DWASA’s strategic goals and initiatives; (b) increase efficiency in
    service delivery; (c) increase accountability; (d) increase commercialization of DWASA. The following
    three options were submitted to DWASA on 30th July, 2015 and presented on the 16th August, 2015:
        Option 1: “Basic? Model: Proposes structural improvements within each of DWASA’s existing
                   business streams
        Option 2: “Integrated Zonal Management? Model: Builds up from Option 1 and introduces
                   “joined up? performance management at the zonal level. Each zone is treated as a
                   business unit and headed by a zonal manager.
        Option 3: “Customer-Focused? Model: Making DWASA more commercially oriented, by
                   elevating the commercial unit (currently under Finance) into a separate Business
                   Stream.
    After considering the various options, DWASA indicated interest in moving forward with the
    Integrated Zonal Management Model (Option 2) with some modifications. A major strength of this
    model is that each Zone is organized under one administrative unit, meaning that operations and
    revenue teams report to a single Zonal Manager. This allows the Zones to function as strengthened
    business units, with increased accountability. The model strives to enhance cooperation and
    coordination between technical and commercial teams, minimize costs, and enhance efficiency. The
    final report detailing the organizational structure, outlines of job descriptions for key staffing
    categories, and the revised salary structure was submitted to DWASA in October 2015.
                     The Options Report of the Organizational Structure of DWASA is included at Annex 3.


Utility Consumer Satisfaction Reports / Analysis / Forum
37. This TA supported consumer satisfaction surveys and
    deliberative citizen forums in a total of 10 municipalities.
    This consisted of the following:
         Demand-side survey of consumer’s perception of
            the quality of water utility services
         Analysis against the supply-side benchmarking data
            generated by the water utility
         Deliberative forum with citizen / consumers, the
            pourashava council and utility managers.
    Reports, analysis and minutes of the deliberative dialogue
    were captured in Bangla. A translated version of the

                                                                                            20 | P a g e

                                                                                       21 | P a g e
38. Key findings from this demand-side citizen engagement to validate the benchmarking data and drive
    accountability for performance are:
         While there were differences in the supply-side and the demand-side perception of certain
            indicators, the greatest value-added was the deliberative discussion on these indicators and
            the necessary conditions for improving service delivery performance from both sides.
         There is a need to streamline (and scale-up) this process of demand-side consumer
            engagement. This could be possible by developing a Bangla version of the SLB Connect
            application (http://www.slbconnect.in/) developed with World Bank support in India.

39. SLB-Connect (Service Level Benchmarking - Connect) is an ICT based citizen feedback initiative
    focused on urban water and sanitation services, that was launched with the aim of addressing some
    of these challenges. It leverages the use of emerging ICTs such as mobile to web systems to conduct
    citizen feedback surveys, and make the data available real-time for monitoring, analysis and
    dissemination. The initiative has been operationalized as an extension of the Service Level
    Benchmarks (SLB) initiative of Government of India (GoI), which is aimed at institutionalizing
    performance reporting by urban local bodies. Since the proof of concept in 2012, SLB Connect (SLB-
    C) has been implemented in eight cities covering over 30,000 households. It has also been leveraged
    as part of a national urban sanitation program in India (Swachh Bharat Mission), for conduct of city
    sanitation assessments covering 75 cities. It has also been integrated into the design of a Bank
    supported urban water supply project in Karnataka. Through this implementation experience, SLB-C
    has demonstrated a systematic ICT based approach for implementing citizen feedback processes at
    scale, and using it to improve service delivery monitoring as well as inform service improvement
    plans11.
Utility Benchmarking Training Minutes, Network Reports and Exchange Visit BTORs
40. To expand the utility benchmarking process to over 50 utilities, support was extended for 13 hands-
    on training sessions on utility benchmarking data collation
    and analysis to a total of 119 water utility superintendents,
    finance and billing staff from a total of 59 utilities. These
    trainings in Bangla translating international IB-Net formats
    to operational staff within the utilities including:
     Briefing on utility benchmarking, the International
        Benchmarking Network (IB-Net) and global IB-Net tools;
     Detailed deliberations on the definitions for generating
        the utility benchmarking indicators and interpreting the
        data;
     Hands on practice in the entry of utility benchmarking
        and demonstration of analysis and reporting at the
        country level;
    A translated version of the minutes of the training from the
    10th – 11th May, 2014 at the World Bank Office in Dhaka is
    included at Annex 5.

41. To move from the generation of benchmarking data to the analysis of
    water utility performance, this TA supported a total of 11 workshops for

   utility managers to share their data with peer utilities. This created a form of peer pressure for
   utilities to justify their data as well as allowing strategic areas of performance improvement to be
   identified and shared amongst the network. Some key results from these network workshop reports
   were:
         The development of performance improvement plans to address areas with poor
             benchmarking indicators
         Use of utility benchmarking indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of the turn-around
             program (DWASA)
         Sharing of consumer satisfaction surveys and identification of utilities to undertake
             ‘demand-side surveys’
    Most of the workshop reports are available http://www.bwun.org/.
    The report from the 8th utility network workshop held in Srimangal, Moulvibazar from the 2nd - -4th
    April, 2014 has been included at Annex 5.

42. To move from the sharing of utility performance improvement plans to replicating those
    performance improvements, this TA supported 11 exchange visits amongst utilities. Through these
    exchange visits water utility managers learn from their peers but at the same time they improve the
    accountability of benchmarking data by validating the validity of the data claims by their peers.
    Some of the key results of the exchange visits were:
         the introduction of computerized billing systems
         entering into agreements with banks for the payment of
             bills
         mobile teams for identifying illegal connections / pumps
         development of complaint redressal systems
         escalating the issuing of disconnection notices

    Sylhet from the 23rd – 25th July, 2011 has been included at Annex 5.

WSP / WBI Regional Water Utility Managers Training in Dhaka
43. An Executive Training Program on “Designing and Implementing Successful Utility Reform in Water
    Supply and Sanitation? was conducted by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the World
    Bank Institute (WBI) from April 15 – 18, 2013 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The training was conducted by
    World Bank staff from five country offices as well as Managing Directors of the Uganda National
    Water and Sewerage Corporation and the eThekwini Water and Sanitation Corporation, the Chief
    Executive of Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, and Director of Samatva Infrastructure
    Advisors.

44. This four day in-person executive training brought together senior and middle level managers and
    decision makers from water service providers, relevant government departments (state and local)
    and other stakeholders from across three countries in South Asia, namely, India, Pakistan and
    Bangladesh. Through presentations, case studies, group exercise, guest speakers and interactive
    debates, the training aimed at helping participants to examine the issues that confront management
    of underperforming utilities on a daily basis. Key aspects of the training focused on performance
    benchmarking, public-private partnerships (PPPs), innovation and strategic communication, tariff
    design and revenue, financial challenges, strengthening relationships with CSOs and NGOs, gender
    equity, and the value of integrating ICT into the water sector. Furthermore, the program (i)


                                                                                          23 | P a g e
    incorporated south-south knowledge exchange; (ii) foster interactions among regional utilities; and
    (iii) share best practices and experience of change agents from within the region and globally.

45. The 35 participants from across the South Asia region included 15 Bangladesh representatives from
    the Local Government Division, WASAs and Pourashavas. After the training these participants have
    made contributions to several initiatives currently underway in their respective utilities that
    includes:
         The engaging of trade union leaders in organizational efficiency / reform processes
         The establishment of a water utility training centre in Dhaka WASA
         Undertaking skills development training for the pump operators of various municipalities
                The agenda and participants from this executive training session are included at Annex 6
Harmonizing the Water Act with Municipality / WASA Acts
46. The approval of the Water Act in 2013 (based on the National Water Policy) seeks to ensure the
    integrated development, management, extraction, distribution, usage, protection and conservation
    of water resources in Bangladesh. As per the Water Act, all forms of water (e.g., surface water,
    ground water, sea water, rain water and atmospheric water) within the territory of Bangladesh
    belong to the government on behalf of the people. The Water Act provides for the priority usage of
    water (drinking water > domestic usage > irrigation > fish culture > bio-diversity > wildlife > instream
    flow > industry >salinity control > power generation > recreation > miscellaneous) in areas where
    the water resources is in critical condition. The Water Act requires the issuance of permits/licenses
    for individuals and organizations to extract, distribute, use, develop, protect, and conserve water
    resources including any structures that impede the natural flow of rivers and creeks.

47. To support the harmonization of the Water Act with the existing Municipality and WASA Acts this TA
    provided technical assistance to the Policy Support Unit in the Local Government Division of the
    Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Co-operatives and Water Resources Planning
    Organization (WARPO) under the Ministry of Water Resources. This comprised of
         Analysis of the existing the Water Act (2013), the Local Government Acts [City Corporation,
            Municipality and Union Parishad] and the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) Act
         Consultations with City Corporations and Pourashavas, Union Parishads and WASAs,
            Ministries of Local Government and Water Resources, Donors and NGOs to understand the
            existing laws and rules, practices and challenges in the regulation of water resources.
         Propose central government rules / circulars and model local government by-laws to align
            the implementation of the Water Act with existing Municipal / WASA practices and
            capacities.

48. The key recommendations from this TA support to the development of rules for the implementation
    of the Water Act are:
         Establish a Water Resources Regulatory Commission with the mandate and capacity (social
            and technical) to arbitrate on the price point associated with the standards set by the
            relevant ministries and efficiencies of water resource managers. In water stressed areas this
            could include the introduction of differential tariffs on ground water versus surface water
            abstraction where metered (i.e. BMDA areas) or differential electricity tariffs for agriculture.
         Given the legacy of failure of regulatory systems in Bangladesh associated with a culture of
            political patronage and rent seeking, it is proposed to develop rules and model by-laws
            under the Water Act that systematically separate the regulation of failure (by the central


                                                                                               24 | P a g e

Urban Sanitation: Fecal Sludge and Wastewater Management Diagnostics
49. With high levels of access to basic sanitation infrastructure but very low access to sewerage and
    negligible treatment of fecal sludge, this TA has prioritized the areas of the greatest impact on the
    greatest number of people. In urban sanitation, this TA has focused on the establishment of an
    analytical framework for understanding the disposal of fecal sludge and understanding the impact of
    discharging sewage and effluent into poorly maintained open drains. Working with operational
    colleagues this has extended support for the identification of appropriate non-networked sanitation
    solutions for urban areas that addressing the safe disposal of both the fecal effluent and the fecal
    sludge. Working with the government this has sought to try to address the perverse institutional
    incentives that promote and sustain the indiscriminate disposal of fecal sludge and fecal effluent.
    The primary outputs under this component have been:
Political Economy Analysis, Fecal Flow Diagram and Service Delivery Assessment for Dhaka
50. At the start of this TA, there was little recognition in either policy or practice of the need to collect /
    transport / treat and re-use the fecal waste that is contained in pits and septic tanks across
    Bangladesh. While considerable attention has been focused towards the eradication of open
    defecation and improving the quality of latrines there has been minimal attention to fecal sludge
    management (FSM). More recently, there has been growing recognition of the FSM challenge,
    largely as a result of the WSP Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities highlighting the poor
    status of fecal sludge management in Dhaka City. Since then, an FSM Framework for Dhaka has
    been drafted by BUET with the support of the Gates Foundation while the DWASA sewage master
    plan supported by the World Bank has included proposed the installation of FSM treatment plants.

51. As part of a global study to develop instruments to assess the status of Fecal Sludge Management,
    this TA has supported components of the Dhaka assessment, namely the political economy analysis,
    the fecal flow diagram and the Service Delivery Assessment. Key findings of this report reveal:
          Although there is practically no open defecation in Dhaka, most all fecal sludge and fecal
             effluent is discharged into the storm water drainage system in-spite of the rapid upgrading
             of housing under rules / building codes to the contrary and a sewerage system serving 25%
             of the city. Fecal matter enters the storm water drains either through both direct
             connections and septic tanks, through DWASA sewage lines and DCC drains, through both
             formal and informal pit emptiers.
          Previous assessments of the status of the existing wastewater systems for the preparation
             of the D-WASA Master Plans for Sewerage and Drainage primarily focused on the status of
             the infrastructure rather than the use of the infrastructure. This may have led to the
             erroneous assumptions on the operational status of the sewerage infrastructure. Given the
             fairly standardized nature of the pressures generated in sewerage systems it was possible to
             use electricity data from the pump stations to ascertain the effectiveness of previous
             investments in sewerage systems. In the development of the fecal flow diagrams for Dhaka
             city it became apparent that historical electricity data for pump stations and treatment
             plants would enable the viability of any World Bank investments in any sewerage and
             drainage infrastructure in any city to be more accurately assessed prior to investing based
             on legacy performance.
          Given the general high levels of satisfaction with the use of storm water drains for fecal

           DWASA staff and the apparently low personal costs for the majority of citizens (financial,
           health, fewer blockages) in-spite of strong housing / environmental / professional rules to
           the contrary it is considered essential to separate (a) the central government regulation of
           failure, from (b) the local government licensing of compliance, from (c) the management of
           assets to provide services to improve the incentives for regulatory compliance.
       Given the sheer volume and the massive percentage of fecal waste from Dhaka that is carried
       through the storm water drainage system it is necessary to explore options to monitor and treat
       the storm water. Whilst this is in no way ideal, it is essential to treat the symptoms of the
       existing problem while seeking to address the underlying infrastructural and institutional causes.
       The PEA / FFD / SDA report on Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka has been included at Annex 8

52. The government has recently established a committee for the establishment of a National Fecal
    Sludge Management Framework. The first draft of the fecal sludge framework for Dhaka city
    proposed the introduction of a sanitation tax, environmental police, a national data-base and
    payments for the receipt of fecal sludge. Through this TA, feedback was collated from across several
    units of the World Bank and provided to the Committee. This feedback suggested that:
         the sanitation tax on all households by local governments (linked to holding tax) should be
             clearly targeted for the public good costs associated with the management of fecal sludge.
         the costs of the environmental police and payments for delivery of fecal sludge could
             potentially be financed from the revenues of the imposition of the FSM tax
         the national database of household sanitation could be delegated to local governments to
             be collated as part of their routine Property Holdings Tax Assessment.
                        Feedback on the draft FSM Framework by the World Bank is included at Appendix 8

Low-Income Customers: Delinking WSS Services from Tenure
53. According to the Census of Slum Areas and Floating Population 2014 there are a total of 598,490
    households with 2,235,384 people living in 13,938 slums in all of the city corporations,
    municipalities, Upazila headquarters and urban areas of Bangladesh. These slums are characterized
    by at least four of the following: Poor housing; Room crowding; Poor water supply and
    environmental sanitation; Low socioeconomic status; Lack of security of tenure. Since 1997, this
    represents an increase of 9% in the number of households but 366% in the number of slums. This is
    associated with a huge growth in small and predominantly private low income communities (i.e.
    70% of slums in Bangladesh have less than 24 households). The massive growth in the number of
    slums presents significant challenges to improving the water and environmental sanitation services
    in urban Low Income Communities (LICs).
         The conventional approach of governments has been to seek to transform informal LICs into
            regularized settlements as a pre-cursor to extending water, sanitation and drainage
            infrastructure. This is has proven to be to be extremely complex and has generally failed to
            keep pace with the rapid dynamic process of slum creation.
         An alternate approach has been for the governments to extend networked water and
            sanitation infrastructure services into LICs. However government resistance to this approach
            has been that can confer greater security of tenure to these residents justifying the
            argument that this should be preceded by the regularization of the LICs (as described
            above).
         Another option for governments has been to engage with NGOs and donors to work with
            LICs on the demand side to upgrade the quality of water and sanitation services before
            applying for formal water, sewerage and drainage connections. The primary risk associated


                                                                                            26 | P a g e
             with this approach is that the water and sanitation services provided by the infrastructure
             beyond the meter / connection is not governed by any quality of service parameters.
          Another approach is to forge partnerships with the existing providers of water and
             sanitation services (i.e. retailers, middle men, communities) and those that exercise de facto
             ownership rights over the land and housing within these areas. That is to deploy social /
             legal instruments to safeguard the quality of water and sanitation services where the
             government neither owns the assets nor bears the financing liability for the creation of
             assets.
    Recognizing the importance of the provision of services to the urban poor, this TA has sought to
    explore different options for extending services to Low Income Communities. This exploration has
    been undertaken from both the perspective of utilities (i.e. service providers) and local governments
    (i.e. service ensurers) due to their differing mandates and social / legal / financial capabilities. This
    has included the following activities:
Low Income Consumer Service Improvement Plan (LICSIP)
54. The World Bank supported project DWSSP initially allocated USD 149 million to Dhaka-WASA
    primarily for the upgrading of sewerage and drainage services within Dhaka city according to the
    prioritized investments identified under separate Sewerage and Drainage Master Plans. This project
    also included the allocation of USD 10 million for the extension of water and sanitation services into
    Low Income Communities through the adoption of the NGO social intermediation model.

55. Having suffered from excessive procurement delays, the World Bank supported DWSSP was scaled
    back to USD 76 million. During this time, several of the LICs identified for World Bank support had
    subsequently disappeared being replaced by high rise apartment buildings. Given the growth of LICs
    and the inability of the NGO social intermediary model to catch-up or keep up with the demand for
    services in LICs, this TA has supported DWASA in developing a Low Income Consumer Service
    Improvement Plan (LICSIP) with the express intention of scaling-up the extension of legal
    connections to low income communities as registered consumers. Key findings of the LICSIP baseline
    report are:
         LIC residents generally receive a good and affordable drinking water supply which is:
                o Accessible (an average of 11.6 metres and no source >18 metres from their house)
                o Sufficient (only 14% of residents ‘seldom’ or ‘never’ have enough water)
                o Reliable (on average water is available 18 hours / day)
                o Safe (75% of residents reported good quality water, only 20% treat before drinking)
                o Affordable (average households spend BDT 110/month = 1.2% of monthly income).
            which is almost exclusively supplied by DWASA (but for which DWASA receives less than
            12% of the potential revenues).
         LIC residents generally receive a poor quality yet affordable sanitation service which is:
                o Accessible (56% within the compound and most latrines are nearby)
                o Insufficient (on average 13 households or 60 people per latrine seat)
                o Unsafe (10% hanging, 44% unimproved and 83% unhygienic latrines)
                o Affordable (average households spend BDT 31/month = 0.4% of monthly income).
                and is almost exclusively included in the rent to landlords (i.e. only 9% pay separately).
         Barriers to the extension of formal water connections to LIC residents include:
                o Connection fees (BDT 15,000) and security deposit (BDT 20,000 or 5,000 in public
                     LICs)
                o Lack of clarity on the process for obtaining a legal connection
                o Perception of impermanence (although only 4% of LICs disappeared since 2006)

                                                                                                27 | P a g e
                o   Commercial intermediaries (i.e. CBOs) do not consistently pay their rates
                o   The control over LIC services by powerful mafia / middle men
                o   High cost of piped sewers / drains in LICs
                o   Indiscriminate disposal of fecal sludge (even by formal vacu-tugs)
                                    The Low Income Consumer Situation Report is included at Appendix 9

56. Based on several rounds of consultations, feedback from sector stakeholders and DWASA the LICSIP
    report has proposed the establishment of a LICSIP Project Unit to plan, design, procure, and
    supervise construction of new infrastructure in LICs. This LICSIP Unit will contract NGOs as a
    Customer Service Agents to consult with community members and local zonal offices to develop a
    plan. The LICSIP Unit will contract a construction firm to build new WASA infrastructure and the
    Customer Service Agent will verify the quality and receive a fixed fee for each new registered
    customer. The proposed service delivery options for water supply and sanitation are as follows:
         Water supply options in LICs: includes standpipes in public LICs, pre-paid water dispensers in
            private LICs, meter banks in vulnerable LICs and social businesses in select LICs. To keep the
            barriers to connections low DWASA will require only three conditions (a security deposit of
            BDT 1000, registration for the DWASA mobile billing program, a signed connection
            agreement) to be fulfilled in order to provide an authorized water connection. Customers
            with illegal connections will be allowed to regularize within a limited amnesty period.
         Sanitation options in LICs: includes small bore sewers in stable LICs close to DWASA sewer
            lines, small bore sewers with anaerobic baffled reactors in relatively stable LICs further from
            DWASA sewer lines and settled sewers (septic tanks) in LICs that can be connected to
            sewers.
    The total estimated capital cost of expanding water supply and sanitation services to all
    unserved LICs in Dhaka is BDT 31.4 billion (USD 405 million) of which BDT 1.87 billion (USD 24.09
    million) is for water supply and BDT 29.5 billion (USD 379 million) is for sanitation.
                           The Low Income Consumer Service Improvement Plan is included at Appendix 9
Leveraging Slum Services
57. The delivery of water supply and sanitation services to LICs is particularly problematic. In many cases
    the payment for water and sanitation services is included in rents for housing. In many other cases,
    high quality water and sanitation services allow landlords to charge higher rents. In both cases,
    public investments to improve water and sanitation services can result in higher rents for poor
    people. In this scenario, public investments to benefit the poor in LICs run the risk of primarily
    benefitting the de facto land / house owners and displacing the expenditures of the poor. However
    it is possible for the government to leverage improved water and sanitation services within informal
    / illegal settings without conferring tenure, or securing tenure, or risking the capture of public
    assets. This can be achieved by deploying social / legal instruments establishing some form of
    quality of service agreement with de facto land / house owners (i.e. mafia, middle men, retailers,
    households).

58. Under this TA, some of the social / legal / economic instruments were explored that government can
    deploy to leverage water and sanitation service quality in settings where the government neither
    owns the assets nor bears the financing liability. This comprised of:
        A theoretical framework requiring asset ownership and financing liability to be retained
            together in any public provider partnership. This implies that a responsible public agency
            should not be investing in asset creation (i.e. bearing asset financing risks) in settings where
            ownership rights over land / housing / water / sanitation (de jure or de facto) lie with others.

                                                                                               28 | P a g e
                  An assessment of the de jure and the de facto assignment of the functions of policy,
                   planning, capital creation, operation and maintenance, monitoring and evaluation within
                   the drinking water supply and sanitation subject in Bangladesh to identify the responsible
                   public agency for ensuring the provision of water supply and sanitation services to all.
                  An exploration of the various social / legal / financial instruments that local governments
                   can deploy to leverage services for the poor within LICs. This included an elaboration of a
                   range of options that could be deployed both with and without addressing the issue of the
                   security of tenure (or more importantly the size of the window of tenure).

Lessons Learned
59. This TA has been built on the premise that better access to information on the ‘quality of service’
    bottlenecks at different points in the water and sanitation service delivery chain can create
    incentives for improved decision making by service providers and policy makers. This has shown in
    particular that:
     this external technical assistance (TA) has been able to develop the capacity to generate utility
        benchmarking data but it has not been able to generate sufficient incentives to utilize this water
        utility benchmarking data for service delivery improvements. For this reason, it has been
        proposed that the Bangladesh Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission (BWSSRC)
        can create incentives for the generation and interrogation of this utility benchmarking data.
     deliberative dialogue on the differences between ‘supply side’ operational performance data
        generated by water utilities and ‘demand side’ consumer satisfaction data generated by local
        governments against the same benchmarking indicators can strengthen the accountability for
        the delivery of water supply services that are more accountable to citizen voice.
     both the existing networked sewerage systems and the on-site fecal sludge management
        systems in Dhaka are ineffectual. Interrogation of data on the electricity consumption of
        sewerage pump stations and treatment plants as well as the practices of DCC and DWASA staff,
        formal and informal pit emptiers, property developers and households reveals that almost all
        fecal waste is actually discharged into the storm water drains.
     LIC residents in Dhaka appear to have sufficient, proximate, affordable less reliable but unsafe
        access to drinking water and sanitation services however the levels of access, the reliability, the

                                                                                                           29 | P a g e
        safety and the price of water and sanitation services are primarily mediated by market forces
        that are often distorted by the exercise of control over the ownership of LIC land and assets.

Recommendations
60. While this TA sought to move from the support for the generation of information to the fashioning
    of systems (i.e. institutions) to generate, manage and make decisions based on service delivery
    information there is still a need for support for institutions to interrogate service delivery data. In
    particular, there is a need for future follow up in the following areas:
     While water utilities have the capacity to generate benchmarking data, a system for comparing
        and making tariff decisions based on this data is still pending with the draft Bill for the
        establishment of the Bangladesh Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission
        (BWSSRC). Support for the establishment (and effective functioning) of the BWSSRC is essential
        to create the incentives for utilities to continue to generate the data necessary for the
        calculation of water tariffs and the benchmarking of utility performance.
     While the use of ‘demand side’ consumer satisfaction surveys to interrogate ‘supply side’ utility
        benchmarking indicators has been tested through this TA, this could be simplified and scaled-up
        through the SLB Connect (Service Level Benchmarking - Connect) application developed with
        World Bank TA support in India. SLB-Connect (http://www.slbconnect.in/) is an ICT based citizen
        feedback initiative that can develop ‘demand-side’ citizen feedback to interrogate ‘supply-side’
        generated benchmarking indicators of urban water and sanitation service delivery performance.
     Almost all of the fecal waste of Dhaka city is ultimately ‘collected by’, ‘transported in’ and
        ‘discharged from’ the deep storm water drains. Given the role that these storm water drains
        play as a combined storm water sewerage system, and given the strong political economy in
        favour of the use of the storm water drains for the transfer of fecal sludge, it is proposed that:
             o the Government; explore the cost / benefit of establishing primary treatment facilities at
                 the existing outfalls of these storm water drains (which has not been assessed in either
                 of the Sewerage or the Drainage Master Plans for D-WASA).
             o the World Bank; require all electricity records of all sewage pump stations and
                 treatment plants (or ideally smart kW.hr electricity meters to be installed) to evaluate
                 the effectiveness of pre-existing sewerage systems prior to considering any future
                 investments in the expansion of sewage pumps stations or treatment plants.
     Public investments in extending access to water and sanitation assets in LICs is deeply
        problematic when the ownership rights over land or housing or water or sanitation assets (de
        jure or de facto) is exercised by others. Not only does this enable those who exercise asset
        ownership to benefit from such public investments but it also fails to establish a system to
        enforce water and sanitation service standards. In such contexts, there is a need to explore the
        instruments that governments can deploy to enforce service standards on those who exercise
        the ownership rights on the land and housing assets to also bear the financing liability for water
        and sanitation asset investments. This could include a range of
             o positive incentives (i.e. quid-pro-quo instruments of making public investments in bulk
                 mains if private owners invest in feeder mains, offering lower bulk tariffs for private
                 owners that ‘on sell’ water that meets public service standards, financial rebates for
                 private owners that invest in improved sanitation facilities, tax breaks reducing the costs
                 or certified quality marks increasing the potential retail price for vendors that comply
                 with quality standards), or
             o negative incentives (i.e. an amnesty on prosecution of illegal water connections, a fee
                 waiver on the legalization of illegal water connections, the provision of access rights of
                 rag-pickers to public waste transfer station, the requirement for all vendors to have a

                                                                                               30 | P a g e
            trade license for gaining a water connection for the on-selling of drinking water, fines on
            water asset owners for a failure to meet water and sanitation quality standards).
   Future technical assistance to the government of Bangladesh should be directed to linking the
    systems for the monitoring and evaluation of water and sanitation service delivery to the fiscal
    intergovernmental system for incentivizing the performance of municipalities. This should
    potentially provide technical assistance to identify:
        o the potential monitoring indicators and fiscal systems to incentivize municipalities to
            ensure that all drinking water and sanitation service providers within their jurisdiction
            comply with central drinking water and sanitation quality of service standards.
        o the potential avenues for municipal local governments to access the capacities
            necessary to issue the by-laws strengthening their planning, licensing and monitoring
            processes and build the social capital necessary to support adherence to drinking water
            and sanitation quality of service standards.
        o the identification of the arbitration options to enable the just adjudication on the tariffs
            that need to be associated with quality of service standards (given the implications of
            quality of service compliance on the cost of service delivery).

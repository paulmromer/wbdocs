Rail intermodal logistics—the movement of containerized cargo from origin to destination where a
portion of the journey takes place on rail—have gained significance in North America over the past 10 to
15 years based on cost and operational efficiency. In China, however, the story has thus far been
different. Considering the length-of-haul and commodity characteristics of China’s manufacturing sector,
the country has a persistently low incidence of rail intermodal participation in domestic and international
supply chains. We find that the binding constraints behind the low incidence of rail intermodal services in
China are most likely to be found on the supply side, not the demand side of the equation. Specifically,
the regulatory and institutional environment, which regulates freight tariffs and provides little or no
flexibility for China Railway Corporation (CRC) to tailor services to customer needs, is at the root of this
challenge. This note outlines the success of railways in North America in (a) tailoring rail intermodal
service offerings based on customer needs and willingness to pay; and (b) collaborating with other
logistics service providers so as to concentrate on their core (rail transportation) competency, while
leaving other segments of the end-to-end intermodal supply chain to those most efficient in those
segments. The current policy and economic environment facing CRC seems favorable to pursuing reforms
towards adopting similar practices.

          have a key interest in this function, which could be
          housed within it or within the coordinating unit.
          The National Treasury clearly has strong experience
          in public financial management, but it would be
          necessary to ensure that the Ministry of Finance staff
          also has, or has access to, the technical capacity to
          undertake this function.

            Given the high costs of technical tasks related
          ///




          to agriculture insurance, the GoK should
          consider establishing a technical support unit
          (TSU) to house technical expertise centrally.           ///




          As already discussed, technical functions belong to
          the private sector. Given their costs, however, there
          is significant advantage in having insurers coordinate
          and centralize these functions, and the GoK may
          choose to support them. TSUs are typically present
          in countries where some degree of competition exists
          among private insurance providers or distributers. A
          TSU can have a wide range of responsibilities, such as
          (i) data analysis; (ii) insurance demand assessments;
          (iii) product design and rating, including basis
          risk analysis; (iv) design of operating systems and
          procedures; (v) training for stakeholders; (vi)
          awareness campaigns; (vii) analysis of any public
          subsidies; and (viii) the development of catastrophe
          risk models and other risk assessment tools.

            However, the establishment of a TSU is not
          ///




          the only option. For example, if the private insurers
                             ///




          went the route of a fully incorporated, capitalized,
          and staffed pool insurance company, the TSU
          would not be required, since its functions could be
          performed by the managing underwriting unit of
          the pool.

          Box 3—  Coverage Levels and Premium Rates

          ///           ///




          simulations presented below, for a coverage level of 80 percent, the premium rate would be below the adopted 15 percent cap only for the district
          of Uasin Gishu. In order to meet the 15 percent threshold, it would be necessary to reduce the coverage level to 70 percent for Kajiado, and to 50
          percent for Machakos. These simple examples show the clear tradeoff between cost and coverage of AYII policies. This tradeoff is driven by the
          underlying risk; and where risk proves excessive, insurance may not represent an economically viable proposition

                  Kajiado                           17%                      11%                      7%                       4%

          The case of Machakos suggests how combining seasonal production data in one annual observation may distort the perception of the risk profile
          in the area. The extremely high premium rate estimated for Machakos is due to the inclusion of the March-May rainfall season, significantly drier
          than the October-December one. Seasonal production data would provide different insurance premium rates for the two seasons, leading to
          different risk management recommendations.

          Note: The net income available for consumption depicted in the figure reflects crop income after any loan repayment. It does
          not account for the potential that households might use some part of this for saving before consumption. Thus this should be

          Box 4—  Benefits and limitations of coinsurance pool arrangements
          Coinsurance pools offer these benefits:

            They achieve economies of scale through operating as a single unit with shared (pooled) administration and operating functions. These lead
          ///                                                                                                                                        ///




          to costs savings from (i) reduced staffing requirements (fixed costs); (ii) shared costs of product research and development, and actuarial services
          including rating; and (iii) reduced costs of underwriting and claims control and loss adjustment.

            There are cost advantages to companies when they purchase common account (pooled) reinsurance protection rather than trying to place
          ///




          their own reinsurance program. The advantages arise from (i) a stronger negotiating position with reinsurers; (ii) larger and more balanced
                                             ///




          portfolio and better spread of risk; (iii) reduced costs of reinsurance due to pooled risk exposure; and (iv) reduced transaction costs (reinsurance
          brokerage, etc.).

            There is no competition on rates in a soft market, and pools can maintain technically set rates. Most pools operate as the sole insurance
          ///                                                                                                         ///




          provided or monopoly (as in Austria, Senegal, Spain, and Turkey, for example), and there is therefore no competition on pricing.

            Pools are able to maintain underwriting and loss adjustment standards. Under a pool monopoly arrangement, the pool manager can ensure
          ///                                                                                ///




          that common and high standards are maintained in the underwriting of crop and livestock insurance and in the adjusting of claims. Where
          companies are competing against each other for standard crop insurance business, there is often a problem of varying loss adjustment standards
          between companies.

            Within a PPP, governments can more easily coordinate support to a pool than to individual insurers. Governments seeking to coordinate
          ///                                                                                                               ///




          national agricultural insurance policy and planning and specific support functions (e.g., provision of premium subsidies, research and
          development, education and training) can work more easily with a pool than with individual insurers, each of which may have very different
          priorities for agricultural insurance.

          Coinsurance pools have these limitations:

            When a pool acts as the sole agricultural insurer, lack of competition in the market may result. This could (i) limit the range of products and
          ///                                                                                                   ///




          services offered by the monopoly pool underwriter; (ii) restrict the range of perils insured; (iii) restrict the regions where agricultural insurance is
          offered and/or the type of farmer insured; and (iv) lead to a lack of competitiveness in premium rates charged by the pool.

                form of subsidy. Because they are established by
                legislation, statutory pools take many forms and may
                be structured very differently to a typical voluntary
                pool.

                The legislation may establish a coinsurance pool, but
                not as a corporate body. For example, the pool may
                be established as a contractual arrangement between
                participating insurers. In this case, although the
                legislation would set out the functions of the pool,
                those functions would not usually include acting
                as an insurer, since the pool is not a legal person.
                Of course, the legislation may establish a corporate
                body to act as manager of the pool, but not to write
                insurance contracts.

                The legislation establishing the pool would usually
                provide the pool with exclusive rights in relation
                to the business underwritten by the pool. This is
                necessary to prevent nonpool insurers undermining
                the pool by offering similar insurance products at a
                lower, nonsustainable, price.                                                                                    SECTION

                Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
                has been used to monitor the onset and intensity
                of droughts in the region. The International
                Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) has used
                NDVI series observed throughout each season in a
                particular division to try to quantify through spatial
                econometric technique the potential livestock losses
                due to drought in each season in that division.45 The
                constructed ‘NDVI-based predicted division-averaged
                livestock mortality’ m(NDVIt ) for each division
                in each season thus reflects the division-averaged
                livestock mortality due to drought. As widespread
                droughts have been one of the key causes of livestock
                mortality in this region, we should expect individual
                livestock mortality experience mt to move together
                with m(NDVIt ).

                In order to understand this empirical relationship,
                we describe joint distribution of individual herd
                mortality mt and the predicted division-average
                livestock mortality due to drought m(NDVIt ) with a
                bivariate truncated normal distribution

                f(mt , m(NDVIt ))~N(μm , μm(NDVI ) , σ(m ), σm(NDVI ) , r(mt , m(NDVIt )),
                                          t       t      t         t



                where μm ,μm(NDVI ) represent long-term average levels
                            t         t
                of individual herd mortality and predicted drought-
                related division-averaged livestock mortality rates,
                mt , m(NDVIt ) describe long-term standard deviations
                of the two mortality series, and r(mt , m(NDVIt ))
                represents correlations of the two series observed in
                the empirical data. In the areas with large exposure to
                droughts, we should expect individual herd mortality
                to move together with the drought-related division
                mortality and thus r(mt,m(NDVIt ) ) -> 1.

                Livestock prices are also uncertain. During droughts
                that could cause large livestock mortality, animals
                tend to be weak, and together with lower demand in
                the local market this could cause livestock price to
                drop. We thus describe a joint relationship among
                                                                                             SECTION

          While milk prices could also be uncertain, we observe               other fixed administrative costs. Total premium per
          relatively stable prices across different seasons in                insured TLU is

                     The selected coverage level (80 percent) generates premium
                rates that for some districts would be excessive and not sustainable.         45
                                                                                                   See Woodard et al. 2012 for detail.
                Hence in order to generate more realistic projections, commercial
                premium rates were capped at a maximum of 15 percent. In a

               This should capture the important feature from reality that farmers
          will prefer to satisfy their basic needs before relaying any loan.

               Longitudinal district yield data were detrended assuming an
          average combination of linear, exponential, and moving average
          trend (Stutley’s method). We also used estimated trends in the
          longitudinal data to detrend the two-year yield data.

               Districts considered in low-potential maize zone include Kitui,
          Machakos, and Makueni in Eastern Province and Muranga, Kirinyaga,
          and Nyeri in Central Province. Districts in medium-potential maize
          zone include Kisumu, Siaya, and Nyamira in Nyanza Province; Vihiga
          and Busia in Western Province; and Meru in Eastern Province.
          Districts considered in high-potential maize zone are Nakuru, Trans
          Mara, Trans Nzoia, and Uasin Gishu in Rift Valley Province and
          Bungoma and Kakamenga in Western Province.

          50
               Because our temporal coverage was limited and could results
          in underestimation of actual temporal variations, we decided to
          exploit spatial variations of the area yield within each zone as well
          as with the assumption that variations in area yields within each
          homogenous zones could represent variations of yield realizations
          over time in that zone.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste



Executive Summary

Introduction
At the time of independence in 2002, Timor-Leste had a seriously weak health system with only a
handful of doctors in the country. In this context, the governments of Timor-Leste signed an
agreement and the Cuban Medical Brigade started to train medical students and deploy them in
the country, particularly in rural areas. While the initial massive shortage has now been minimised,
there are concerns over more complex issues including facility functionality, rural retention,
motivation, preferences and competence of health workers. The objectives of this survey were to
understand the labour market dynamics among health workers, to learn more about the
preferences and concerns of health workers, and to assess the skills, competence and motivation
of doctors.

Methods
This survey included four components: a health facility survey, a health worker survey, a discrete
choice experiment (DCE) and direct clinical observations (DCO). A qualitative study was carried
out prior to the main study. The health facilities and health workers were sampled using probability
proportionate to size (PPS). Three field teams collected the quantitative survey data between July
and August 2014. Data were double entered using a customised data-entry program. Associations
between various predictors and outcome variables are presented through descriptive statistics and
statistical tests. Further work could be done in future to examine the relationships between the
three main datasets.

The study has several limitations. One of them is the lack of demand-side information; the sample
only included the health facilities and health workers and did not include any patients. To mitigate
this limitation the survey methodology and instruments were carefully designed so that the results
would not be biased based on health workers’ self -reporting on functionality or performance.

Private health providers are not included in this survey, which is another important limitation.
Private health care providers provide about one-quarter of the health services in Timor-Leste;
including them may have increased the comprehensiveness of the survey. However, the primary
goal of this survey was to inform policy-makers on government health workers.

Findings
Labour Market Dynamics: Findings from the Health Worker Survey
The general health worker survey was administered to 443 health workers, including 175 doctors,
150 nurses and 118 midwives (about 20% of the health workers in the country). The majority (56%)
of health care workers were women, including 58% of the doctors and all of the midwives. The only
exception was nurses, where the majority (64%) were men. Close to 53% of all doctors interviewed
were posted in rural facilities, while nurses were more concentrated in urban areas (70%). Twenty-
one percent of doctors were working in Health Posts (HP), compared to 8% of nurses and 16% of
midwives. Since there were only a few doctors in country in Timor-Leste at the time of
independence, almost the entire cohort of doctors was newly trained; most of the doctors (96%)
interviewed in the survey had less than five years of experience in the sector. The survey shows
that health workers got opportunities to advance to higher types of facility with more experience.

Motivation to join and long-term preferences: The vast majority of staff selected medicine as a
career in order to help people and, generally health workers indicated high levels of satisfaction:

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


only 4% of the respondents indicated that they were ‘unsatisfied’ or ‘very unsatisfied’ with their
work. Intrinsic motivation is also shown by the fact that eight in ten medical staff said that they
would stay in the facility until the last patient was treated – even if they did not receive additional
money for this.

In the long run the majority of respondents would like to continue to work in the government/public
sector, including 99% of the doctors. This was also the case for the broad majority of nurses and
midwives, although 6% of nurses would prefer to move to the private sector. HPs were the least
attractive stations for medical staff, with only 6% of doctors stating a HP as their long-term
preferred facility, although 32% were content to work in Community Health Centres (CHC). Only
22% saw themselves working in rural sucos long term. However, 88% acknowledged that the MoH
would determine where their next assignment would be. The majority of respondents (97%) were
not looking for another job in the short term.

Salary and financial benefits: Wage differentials within each cadre were relatively small, and
income did not vary much by the years of experience, particularly for the doctors. On average, a
doctor with more than ten years of experience earned just US$ 50 more than a newly joined
doctor. More than half of the health staff interviewed believed their salary to be too low. However,
they did not see other labour market opportunities that they would prefer. All medical staff receive
their money through a direct deposit to their bank account and only very few (2%) have
experienced any delays in receiving their money. Very few report private practice (but this may be
under-reported). More non-financial benefits (such as housing and motorbikes) were reported by
doctors and at lower-level facilities. However, only half of them reported that they get either
sufficient fuel or funds to buy fuel for the motorbike, and more than half of all respondents also
stated that these benefits were delayed.

Workload: Although most respondents worked five days a week in HPs, CHCs and
district/regional hospitals (63%, 66% and 54%, respectively), 22% to 36% worked six and
sometimes seven days a week. The number of patients seen by the sampled doctors who
participated in the DCOs was counted; the mean number of patients per day was 10.2, with the
standard deviation (SD) of 7.5. In urban facilities the mean (SD) patient load was 11.5 (6.9)
compared to 9.6 (7.8) in rural facilities. The number of patients also varied by level of facility, with
higher tier facilities having more patients. Forty-five percent of respondents agreed with the
statement that they have ‘too much work to do’. However, we found no clear correlation between
workload and feelings of overload.

Training: Almost all respondents believed that their training adequately prepared them to diagnose
and treat clinical cases in Timor-Leste. When asked how many short-term training sessions (below
30 days) they had attended in the last three years, roughly half of the nurses and midwives
reported doing three or more, while one-quarter did not attend any such training in this timeframe.
At the same time, roughly one-third (35%) of the doctors attended three or more training sessions
and around the same proportion (37%) attended none. Despite all the training opportunities,
roughly half (52%) of respondents stated that ‘there is not enough opportunity to learn current
medical knowledge’.

Although a large number of doctors were in rural areas, it is interesting to see that only 19%
underwent training on community health. Around 75% of doctors indicated that they require training
on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and 64% on Emergency Obstetrics and
Newborn Care (EmONC). The doctors located in urban areas were found to benefit more: roughly
half (51%) of them had attended three or more training sessions in the last year, as opposed to
26% in rural areas.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Older or highly satisfied doctors tended to be less interested in any kind of training, while females
were keener than males to have the opportunities for visits from specialists. Workers in HPs and
CHCs were more interested in specialisation. Highly satisfied doctors had a lower utility for all
kinds of training. Older nurses and midwives, as well as those with more medical experience,
tended to be more interested in any kind of training. Rural facility health workers were significantly
more willing to finish their bachelor’s degrees.

Supervision: Eighty-five percent of respondents indicated that they have a supervisor who is
responsible for providing feedback on their performance. The majority of staff had supervisory
meetings at least every three months, with urban-based staff having more meetings. Supervisors ’
activities were heavily biased toward activities that support technical staff development and quality
control: supervisors observed the consultation, provided health instructions and asked knowledge
assessment questions. Checking records, an administrative task, topped the list of supervisory
tasks. There were no important differences between rural and urban facilities. 75% of all
respondents stated that they felt the need to discuss difficulties with their supervisor within the last
year; most of them (95%) actually discussed the issue with their supervisor and 66% noticed
improvements afterwards.

Challenges: Low salaries were identified as a problem (with 63% agreeing or strongly agreeing),
followed by inadequate opportunities to learn (52%), lack of transport to see patients (50%),
inadequate housing (48%), too much work (47%), security problems (39%), lack of supervision
(30%), lack of feedback on performance (23%), and lack of motivation (20%).

Absence from work: Eight percent of respondents reported being absent from work in the thirty
days before the interviews due to sickness. The percentage was the same across all types of
medical staff. Five percent of staff was absent in that timeframe because of personal reasons. In
the event of an absence, roughly 13% of respondents stated that they were called by the facility
head. In 5% of the cases, the supervisor discussed the absence with staff and 2% indicated that
money was deducted from their salary as a reaction.

Working Environment: Findings from the Health Facility Survey
Sixty-nine health facilities in all thirteen districts of Timor-Leste, including six hospitals, thirty-three
community health centres (CHCs) and thirty health posts (HPs) were visited. The data suggest that
the national and referral hospitals were generally well equipped and that CHCs were moderately
equipped. However, most of the HPs were poorly equipped and lacking basic facilities and
services. The facilities located in rural areas were also considerably under-resourced compared to
facilities in urban areas. The storage conditions of medicines were found to be of concern,
especially in rural areas.

Service availability was typically high in most of the areas except for treatment of HIV/AIDS,
caesarean section and blood transfusion. The HPs offered fewer services than CHCs and
hospitals.

Health Worker Preferences: Results from the DCE
In the DCE the preferences of health workers were explored by giving them the option to choose
hypothetical jobs with different attributes. The findings revealed that the ‘probability of
specialisation’ was the top-ranked most important factor for doctors. Visits from specialists, the
availability of equipment, good housing, working in higher-level facilities and urban locations were
the other significant attributes (by order of importance). Newly graduated doctors were totally
neutral toward wages. For nurses and midwives, in-service training was valued most highly,
followed by transportation, equipment, remote location and housing.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Older doctors valued wages positively and the same was true for males, while females’ coefficient
was negative and strong (-0.003 per dollar). Nurses and midwives valued a higher wage and
factors associated positively with it were age, experience, being male, being a nurse (compared to
a midwife), being married and owning a house, being in the same district as one’s family, working
in a CHC in a rural area, not being provided with housing and having a relatively lower wage and
working in a health facility with a better supply of drugs and equipment.

Nurses and midwives would be ready to give up US$ 194 per month to access workshops, and
US$ 113 to have a motorbike. Having medium scale of equipment availability ranked third place
with a value of US$ 102.

Competence of Doctors: Results from DCOs and Vignettes
In total, 635 cases were observed, mostly in outpatient departments, with 40% in urban and 60% in
rural areas. The vignettes focused on patients presenting with cough, fever and diarrhea.

Knowledge and practice scores: The overall clinical performance, as measured by DCO, of
general practitioners was very good in terms of attitudes (91% score) and moderate at history
taking (57%), health education (50%) and treatment accuracy (69%). However, the average
physical examination performance score was 28%. Lack of examination tools was suspected to be
the one of the reasons they could not perform physical examinations as well as expected; some
healthcare facilities did not even have any examination bed, blood pressure monitor
(sphygmomanometer) or thermometer. The overall average performance score was 62%.

When comparing observations with vignettes (to assess knowledge), there were significant
differences in history taking, appropriateness of treatment and health education. The average
scores for history taking and health education were higher in the vignette group, suggesting a
‘know–do’ gap. However, scores on the appropriateness of treatment were much better for DCOs
than vignettes, which probably means that vignette cases were harder than daily practice cases.

One worrying finding for both observations and vignettes was the low rate of hand-washing –
slightly above 20% in observed cases and below 10% for simulated vignettes. Absence of facilities
cannot explain the low rate in the vignettes.

Determinants of clinical performance: HPs had a negative correlation with clinical performance
when the clinical performance was distinguished by the type of health facility. As HPs were found
to be comparatively poorly equipped, doctors might face difficulties in performing to ideal clinical
practice. The location of the practice also had a significant effect on the clinical performance of
doctors; doctors working in a rural area were less skilled than their counterparts in urban areas,
which again may link to the absence of an enabling work environment.

The clinical performance was also better when consultation periods were longer. The average
consultation time per case was nine minutes. Doctors spent less time in DCOs (eight minutes)
compared to vignettes (ten minutes), which was also statistically significant (p= <0.01). Conducting
the vignettes after work may have permitted this longer focus on each case.

Conclusion
The study highlights some encouraging findings, including the gender balance of health staff
(overall, if not within specific cadres), the concentration of doctors in rural areas, the high overall
reported satisfaction of staff with their work and high intrinsic motivation, the positive intention to
stay in the public sector, the feeling of being well prepared by training for work, the relatively

frequent and satisfactory supervisions reported, and the good attitudes to patients identified in
observations and vignettes. However, some areas require more investigation and investment.

The following recommendations are based on the evidence gathered from this survey:

Ensure Policy Compliance at All Levels
        1. Service availability should match the Basic Service Package (BSP): The survey
           found that the health facilities, particularly the rural ones often lacked services and
           facilities that they are supposed to have according to the BSP. Ensuring policy
           compliance to BSP will not only maintain the consistency of services across the sector,
           but will also improve the functionality of the rural health facilities which will eventually
           encourage health workers to stay motivated to work in rural areas.

        2. Availability of medicines should comply with the Essential Drug List (EDL): The
           drug supplies were frequently inconsistent with the EDL recommendation. Complying
           with the EDL may improve service delivery by reducing the chance of stock-outs and
           misuse of drugs. However, it is possible that there is a functioning decentralised
           mechanism in place, which is effective, but not fully compliant to the central polity. This
           should be investigated before implementing this recommendation.

        3. Clinical guidelines should be enforced: Enforcing clinical guidelines may increase the
           performance of the doctors. However, there are few related issues. First, changing
           practice usually requires a lot of effort. Second, since some health providers may lack
           elements of basic knowledge, the clinical guidelines, which are mostly practice oriented,
           may not be fully effective. And finally, the clinical guidelines in all relevant topics might
           not be available or updated.

Strengthen the Health Human Resource Policy
        4. Ensure salary progression for doctors: The data revealed that the salary difference
           between the junior and senior doctors was very narrow. This may demotivate
           experienced health workers and cause them to leave the public sector or engage in dual
           practice in future. A clear salary progression policy will keep health workers motivated to
           serve in the public sector and will also encourage better performance.

        5. Provide necessary training for health workers: The overall low score on clinical
           competence and the narrow know-do gap indicates doctor’s lack of knowledge in Timor-
           Leste, especially in rural areas. Regular in-service training and visits from specialists are
           highly recommended to increase health worker’s competence. This strategy will also
           improve the confidence of young health workers and motivate them to stay in rural
           areas.

        6. Improve the effectiveness of supervision: While the supervision visits were frequent,
           in most cases these visits were mostly focussed on checking official records. More
           efficient supervision and monitoring tools and exercises are recommended so that these
           visits are more meaningful and action oriented.

        7. Adjust the expectations of health workers on their workload: Nearly half of the
           respondents reported to have a high workload. However, the average number of patients
           consulted, as observed during the survey, did not reflect that statement. It might be
           useful to better understand the reason behind this statement and adjust the workload
           expectation by establishing clear terms of reference for the work.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Improve the Functionality of Health Facilities
        8. Improve the pharmaceutical chain of procurement and distribution: The survey
           results indicate a loosely functioning pharmaceutical chain with an incoherent distribution
           mechanism. A strong, demand-driven pharmaceutical procurement and disbursement
           system in which demand will be raised in a bottom-up process along with a sequential
           distribution mechanism is recommended.

        9. Improve availability of medical supplies: The rural health facilities were frequently
           under-equipped and many health workers expressed this as one of the important
           attributes in deciding workplace. Improving availability of medical supplies in health
           facilities will improve the service delivery and at the same time will enhance the rural
           retention of the health workers.

        10. Improve infrastructure and the access to water, electricity and communication:
            Many rural facilities lacked basic infrastructure including access to water, electricity and
            communication. Improving the infrastructure will optimise service delivery and rural
            health worker retention. An inter-sectoral initiative, involving the other concerned
            ministries, is recommended to identify and prioritize potential development areas, and
            improve the infrastructure of health facilities, including the accommodation of health
            workers.

Further studies on assessing the training gaps, migration and exit to private sector, absenteeism
and dual practice, pharmaceutical distribution, and location preference (urban vs. rural) of health
workers will broaden the understanding on some of the survey findings. A follow-up survey, using
similar methodology to monitor the trend over time is recommended.

This survey highlights some important policy areas that can be addressed to better manage the
health workforce in Timor-Leste and ensure better health service to the population, particularly in
rural areas. The Ministry of Health can consider prioritising the above mentioned recommendations
and group them into short, medium and long term initiatives.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste



1          Introduction
At the time of independence in 2002, Timor-Leste had a seriously weak health system and
human health workforce with only a handful of doctors practicing in the country. In this
context, the governments of Timor-Leste signed an agreement and the Cuban Medical
Brigade started to train medical students and deploy them in the country, particularly in
rural areas. While the initial massive shortage has now been minimised, there are concerns
over more complex issues including facility functionality, rural retention, motivation,
preferences and competence of the health workers. The objectives of this survey were to
understand the labour market dynamics among health workers, to learn more about the
preferences and concerns of health workers, and to assess the skills, competence and
motivation of doctors.


1.1        Background
Timor-Leste had a fragile health system when it became independent in 2002. During the war
preceding independence more than 70% of the country’s health facilities were destroyed or
seriously damaged and only approximately 20 doctors remained in the country (Cabral, et al.,
2013). This radical shortage of health workers gradually started to improve as medical doctors
trained in Cuba by the Cuban Medical Brigade began to return to Timor-Leste in 2004 (Asante, et
al., 2012). However, there is still a shortage of health workers in all categories, including general
doctors, specialists, nurses and midwives.

In 2012, the health worker density in Timor-Leste was 1.3 per 1,000 population (Asante, et al.,
2014). This ratio was below the threshold of 2.2 which was indicated by WHO as the minimum to
have desired level of coverage of skilled birth attended – a proxy indicator widely used to
understand the density of health workforce(WHO, 2006). With the recent, large influx of doctors
trained by the Cuban Medical Brigade the critical shortage of health workers has lessened, but
more complicated issues that are related to human resource management, retention in rural
facilities and the quality of health workers have emerged. In addition, there are concerns over the
readiness-to-serve and functionality of health facilities.

1.2        Health Systems
The people of Timor-Leste have the constitutional right to health, medical care and a healthy
environment. According to Article 57 of the Constitution, ‘All Timorese citizens are entitled to health
care and the State has a duty to promote and protect this right free of charge, in accordance with
its capabilities and in conformity with the law ’ (MoH, 2012).

Timor-Leste has a three-tiered government health system, which includes a National Hospital at
the tertiary level, district hospitals at the secondary level, and CHCs, HPs and outreach centres
known as Servisu Integrado du Saude Comunidade (SISCa) at the primary level (MoH, 2012).
According to the information provided by the MoH, there were five district hospitals, 66 CHCs, 205
HPs and 442 SISCas in country at the time of the survey. However, there are reports that not all of
the SISCas were fully functioning (Martins & Trevena, 2014).

The National Hospital in Dili is the only tertiary care facility in Timor-Leste. It has inpatient,
outpatient and emergency care facilities. It also has specialised services and enhanced laboratory
facilities. The district referral hospitals also have outpatient, inpatient and emergency services but
these hospitals only provide specialist care in four clinical areas: medicine, surgery, paediatrics
and obstetrics-gynaecology. There are thirteen districts in Timor-Leste and five of them have a
referral hospital. The CHCs offer outpatient and inpatient care. Some CHCs are larger and have
dentistal and laboratory facilities. The HPs are the first level of health facilities and only provide
outpatient care. The SISCas are monthly satellite clinics run by health staff from the HPs (MoH,
2012). The MoH plans to deploy three doctors in each CHC and one doctor in each HP (Asante, et
al., 2014).

The private health system is not very well developed in Timor-Leste. In 2011, there were twenty-six
private health facilities in Timor-Leste, which covered about one-quarter of the country’s basic
health service delivery, mostly in urban areas (Asante, et al., 2012). Government health workers
are officially prohibited from private practice in Timor-Leste.

1.3        Health Workforce
There are thirty-six health cadres from eight categories in government health services in Timor-
Leste, as shown in Table 1.

Although, the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) of the International
Labour Organization (ILO) categorises health professionals as ‘health professionals’ and ‘health
associate professionals’ (ILO, 2008), there are practical challenges and standardisation issues in
including all types of professionals under this definition. The health workforce is often defined as
the aggregated total of physicians, nurses and midwives. The World Health Report 2006 used the
aggregated total of these three professional groups to calculate the density of the health workforce
and to compare across countries (WHO, 2006). Doctors, nurses and midwives were considered
health workers in this survey.

The majority of doctors in Timor-Leste are trained, either in Cuba or Timor-Leste, by the Cuban
Medical Brigade (CMB). The CMB started enrolling students in 2004. Until 2007, medical students
were trained simultaneously in Cuba and Timor-Leste. Students enrolled in or after 2008 are
trained in Timor-Leste by CMB in collaboration with the University of Timor-Leste (UNTL). The
program is a six-year Bachelor of Medicine course consisting of five years of medical schooling
and one year of internship in the health facilities across the countries. The important characteristics
of the Cuban medical training program are a commitment to community spirit and serving the
people and the medical doctors sign an agreement with the government to work in public health
sector for at least six years. In addition to the CMB-trained doctors there are some doctors who are

trained in other countries, mostly in Indonesia. Most of the nurses and midwives are trained in
either UNTL or in the Institute of Health Science (Asante, et al., 2014).

1.4        Policy Issues
Lack and quality of infrastructure and limited resources at health facilities are longstanding
problems in Timor-Leste. According to a recent report in The Lancet, there is no Magnetic
Resonance Imaging machine in Timor-Leste and there is only one Computed Tomography scan
machine, which is quite old (McCall, 2014). Facility functionality is worst in rural areas. A recent
article reported that only half of the SISCas were functioning (Martins & Trevena, 2014). A scoping
review and analysis of published literature concluded that access to and use of health services is
one of the top priority areas for Timor-Leste. The review summarised the findings of the survey
reports that 12% of households in Timor-Leste did not seek health care when a household member
was ill and 25% of households were more than two hours away from their usual health care
provider (Deen, et al., 2013).

In most developing countries, the retention of health workers in rural areas is a major challenge.
Timor-Leste is no exception and it also has some unique features. Various push and pull factors
influence health workers’ choices to stay or not stay in rural health facilities. According to the
strategic development plan of the Government of Timor-Leste, all HPs will have at least one
doctor, two nurses and two midwives by 2020 (Government of Timor-Leste, 2011). Most of the
Cuban-trained medical students were enrolled from rural areas and therefore have some incentive
to go back to their areas of origin. However, because of the poor functionality of the rural health
facilities, doctors may be unwilling to work in those facilities. There are also concerns regarding a
lack of supervision and unclear career development paths for those working in rural areas (Asante,
et al., 2014).

While there is a strong political commitment to deploy health workers in rural areas, there are
concerns over the utilisation of the services and the productivity of health workers posted in rural
areas. A recent critical appraisal estimated that the patient load at the primary health care level in
Timor-Leste was on average less than three persons per day (Cabral, 2010). However, this finding
is based on some assumptions and modelling and not backed up by rigorous primary data.

Since the literature suggests that the country’s rural facilities lack infrastructure and supplies,
management function, supervision and opportunities to learn, there is a possibility that the health
workers deployed in these facilities are not motivated. An article published on the tuberculosis (TB)
services in Timor-Leste indicated that there was a lack of ownership by government health workers
(Martins, et al., 2006).

Finally, there are some concerns about the clinical competence and quality of care of the Cuban-
trained doctors (Asante, et al., 2012). Although policy-makers believe that the competence of these
doctors is adequate for the needs of the local health system, there have been no systematic
independent reviews of the doctor’s performance in Timor-Leste (Asante, et al., 2014). A study of
the use of medicine and adherence to the clinical guidelines by non-physician health workers (e.g.
nurses and midwives) in Timor-Leste was conducted and showed favourable results (Higuchi, et
al., 2012). However, there is no evidence about doctor’s clinical performance that could support or
assuage concerns regarding the competence of doctors in Timor-Leste.

All the above information indicates that there is a general lack of evidence in various aspects of the
health labour market in Timor-Leste. This lack of information is mainly caused by the absence of
an integrated information system and lack of properly designed research (Cabral, et al., 2013). A
need for a properly designed sample survey on health workers in Timor-Leste was therefore

identified, not only to gather evidence on some of the complex issues like motivation, preference
and rural retention but also to systematically assess the quality of the doctors working in the
country.

1.5        Objectives
The primary objectives of this survey were to understand:

    1. The labour market dynamics among health workers (especially the prevalence of dual job
       practice and the inflows/outflows between rural and urban areas);

    2. The preferences and concerns of health workers, especially regarding their revenues and
       rural jobs; and

    3. The skills, competence and motivation (i.e. the ‘know–do gap’) of doctors.

It is expected that this survey will provide important information and evidence to health policy-
makers in Timor-Leste to facilitate better understanding of the incentives and constraints of health
workers in the country.

2          Methods
This survey included four components: a health facility survey, a health worker survey, a
DCE, and DCOs. A qualitative study was carried out prior to the main study. The health
facilities and health workers were sampled using PPS. Three field teams collected the
quantitative survey data during July and August 2014. Data were double entered using a
customised data-entry program. Associations between various predictors and outcome
variables are presented through descriptive statistics and statistical tests Ethical clearance
was obtained from both international and national institutional review boards. The
important limitations of this study are the absence of data on demand side (i.e. user)
perspective and not including the private health sector.


2.1        Components
The survey had four main components namely, general health facility survey, general health
worker survey, discrete choice experiment (DCE) and direct clinical observations (DCO). A brief
description of each of the four methods is outlined below.

General Health Facility Survey
This component aimed to gather basic information regarding the sampled health care facilities in
order to understand the working environment. A structured questionnaire was administered to each
of the sampled facilities.

The respondents of this survey were the head of the facility, the person in-charge of the facility, or
the most senior health worker responsible for client services who was present at the facility at the
time of the survey.

The questionnaire covered various dimensions of the health workers’ working environment,
including inpatient service availability, processing of medical equipment, supplies and storage of
medicines, user fees and sources of finance, sources of water and power supply, staff
management and external supervision and disability and gender perspectives.

General Health Worker Survey
Data was gathered on health workers’ demographic characteristics and on various aspects on their
profession. The field team members administered a structured questionnaire to the sampled health
workers within the health facilities for this component.

The general health worker survey questionnaire included modules on job history, preferences and
views on the profession, current job, training, supervision and absenteeism.

Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)
A DCE was carried out to understand health workers’ preferences. Qualitative research was
carried out to identify the job attributes health workers take into account when deciding on rural
postings. DCEs draw on Lancaster’s theory of values, which states that each choice is composed
of multiple attributes, also known as the choice characteristics of interest (Lancaster, 1966).

Assuming that the utility function of health workers follows the random utility theory, the
observation of a large number of choices gives the relative preference of one attribute over the
other across the sample of respondents, and is as such useful in terms of developing policy

interventions. The DCE then consists in a set of choices between (usually) two options that differ in
the value of their attributes.

Prior to the main study a qualitative study was conducted to find out the trade-off between the
number of attributes and their respective values (one attribute can assume more than one value,
e.g. if salary is one attribute, then salary will assume different values in the DCE questionnaire).
Based on the findings from the qualitative study, 16 choice sets were prepared and included in the
general health worker survey questionnaire.

Direct Clinical Observation (DCO) and Vignettes
The skills, competence and knowledge of doctors were explored in the DCOs, in order to provide
the basis for establishing the ‘know–do gap’. This quality of care survey combined a DCO to
evaluate the doctor’s performance in a real clinical setting and vignettes to measure the doctor’s
clinical knowledge and skill in an ideal outpatient setting using a standard simulated ‘patient’. Three
medical researchers from the University of Gadjah Mada were recruited to administer the DCO and
vignette tools. DCOs and vignettes were used for general medical doctors only.

In the DCOs the medical researchers silently observed the entire clinical consultation of the
patients by sampled doctors, using a structured tool to record the attitude of doctors, history taking,
physical examination, diagnosis, treatment and health advice. At the end of the consultation period,
for the same sampled doctors, the medical researchers observed three simulated cases (fever,
cough and diarrhea) where the enumerators presented themselves as patients. The doctors
recorded observations in a structured tool based on the attitude, history taking, physical
examination, diagnosis, treatment and health advice of the simulated consultation.

2.2        Sampling
The purpose of the sampling exercise was to obtain a sample of health facilities and health
workers (in those facilities) with well-documented selection probabilities. The sample was drawn
from six strata: two kinds of facilities (urban and rural) and three kinds of health workers (doctors,
midwives, nurses). Community health workers, administration and support staff were excluded
from the sample. Health facilities and health workers were sampled from all thirteen districts of
Timor-Leste.

The initial idea was to draw a sample of 480 health workers from 60 clusters, with the cluster size
being eight. However, the following practical constraints were noted:

        Many health workers were concentrated in a few large urban facilities; and
        Many facilities (especially rural HPs) did not have eight health workers in total.

To address these constraints the National Hospital and a few other referral hospitals were treated
as if they were more than one cluster. In these facilities, more than two health workers of each kind
were selected and the sample sizes adjusted accordingly. The target sample was complemented
by a reserve sample, to account for contingencies.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste




The sampling was conducted using systematic random sampling with PPS. Based on the
discussed sampling objectives and constraints, a final proposed sample included 458 health
workers in 68 clusters (18 urban and 50 rural), as shown in Table 2. During the data collection 443
health workers were interviewed which means that the response rate was 97%.

Additional subsamples were drawn for DCOs and vignettes. One doctor was randomly sampled
(from the list of sampled doctors) from each facility for this component. The specialist doctors were
excluded for this component, as their clinical skills are not comparable with general doctors. For
DCOs, 10 patients were sampled using systematic random sampling during the fieldwork. If the
anticipated patient number was less than 10 then all patients were observed. For the vignettes,
each sampled doctor was presented with three simulated cases (fever, cough and diarrhoea).

Weights
Since the samples were drawn from various strata, the weights were used to correctly represent
the survey population. The inverse probability was used to calculate the weights of the facility. To
obtain weights for the health workers the clustered weight, i.e. the weight of each type of health
worker within their cluster, was used.

2.3        Survey Implementation

Qualitative Research
In order to gain a contextual understanding and to select the attributes for the DCE qualitative
research was conducted during February and March 2014. During this study, a series of key
informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were administered.

The respondents of the KIIs included the head of Human Resources Planning in the MoH,
researchers and academics from the University of Timor-Leste (UNTL), medical students at UNTL
and health service directors from three districts. Separate FGDs were carried out with groups of
doctors, nurses and midwives.

The attributes and the level of attributes that were explored during the qualitative research included
location (including living close to family), facility types, supervision, health facility equipment,
housing, motorbike, wage, training and workload.

At the end of the qualitative study, seven attributes with 18 levels in total for the doctors and seven
attributes with 19 levels for nurses and midwives were determined. These attributes and levels
were analysed to prepare 16 choice sets for both doctors and nurses.

Literature Review
The existing literature was reviewed in order to strengthen an understanding on the context and
topics. The documents included the Ministry of Health’s policy documents and guidelines, various
survey reports and published journal articles. This review helped to tailor the data collection
instruments and to compare the results with the recommended or existing policy.

Survey Preparation
Prior to finalising the design and survey instruments, an inception visit was carried out in April 2014
and various stakeholders were consulted during that visit. During this mission a workshop was

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


organised at the World Bank office in Dili. Experts and officials from various organisations
(including the MoH, the World Bank, UNTL, WHO, USAID, DFAT and EC) attended the workshop
and provided comments and feedback on the design and data-collection instrument. The inception
mission team also visited different levels of health facilities in one district.

After the inception visit a series of activities were initiated including a literature review to gather
knowledge from the published literature, sampling, developing a survey protocol, finalising the
data-collection instruments, recruitment of medical researchers and field team members,
development of data-entry programming and translation of data-collection instruments into Tetun.
Most of the preparatory activities were carried out during May 2014.

In June 2014, the data-collection instruments were pretested and the tools were finalised. During
the latter half of the month the field teams received two weeks of training, which was followed by
piloting in a health facility.

Data Collection
Three field teams were deployed for data collection. Each team was comprised of a supervisor, a
medical researcher, two enumerators and a driver. The supervisors were responsible for leading
the field teams and administering the health facility questionnaire. The enumerators conducted the
interviews with the sampled doctors, nurses and midwives at the health facilities, and the medical
researchers from Indonesia administered the DCO and vignette tools. The enumerators acted as
‘patients’ in the vignettes.

Data were collected using a ‘paper and pen’ method. Each team interviewed up to eight health
workers per day (four per enumerator). Data collection was completed in eight weeks during July
and August 2014.

Strong quality control procedures were put in place throughout the survey. There was a continuous
presence of international consultants throughout the data collection period. They visited the field
teams to ensure that data were being collected in accordance with the protocol. The field manager
and the supervisors also regularly checked the completed questionnaires to ensure the data
quality.

Data Management
Four customised data-entry programs were developed for the four different datasets (health facility
survey, health worker survey including DCE, DCO and vignettes) using Visual Basic Version 6 and
Microsoft Access. The data-entry programs had various built-in checks for range, outliers and
internal consistency so that only valid responses could be entered.

The data management team consisted of one data manager, four data-entry operators and two
data editors. The data editors manually checked the questionnaires before they were entered. The
data were double entered and any inconsistencies between the first and second entries were
resolved by manually checking the questionnaires.

Once the data were entered the data files were transferred into the statistical software Stata using
the data transfer software StatTransfer. When the data were transferred into Stata, they were
checked for missing values, ranges, outliers and internal consistency.

2.4        Data Analysis

General Health Facility and Health Worker Surveys
Descriptive statistics were primarily used to present the findings of the general health facility survey
and health worker surveys. The statistical software SPPS and Stata were used to generate the
survey results. Sampling weights were used to generate representative results.

For cross-tabulations the health facilities were mostly categorised by locality (urban and rural) and
by type of facility (hospitals, CHCs and HPs). Health workers were categorised by locality (urban
and rural) and type (Cuban-trained doctors, non-Cuban-trained doctors, nurses and midwives).
Where applicable, two-sample tests of proportions were carried out to check the statistical
significance between two groups (e.g. urban vs. rural).

DCE
DCE analyses the relation between the levels of attributes and the choices made by health
workers. Following the random utility theory we estimated a logit/probit model (with a maximum
likelihood function) to analyse the dichotomous choices made by the respondents (McFadden,
1976). The relative importance of each coefficient then generated the Marginal Rate of Substitution
(MRS) between the different attributes.

The basic model for DCE analysis consisted of decomposing the choice made by health workers in
factors from the DCE attributes. Following the utility theory backing the DCE approach, the ratio
between the coefficients associated with each level of attribute reveals the relative importance of
the attributes. The attributes can be included either in their difference or in their level. In this DCE
many attributes were not in continuous scale (e.g. in-service training vs. visits from specialists) and
so, in those cases, a categorical variable was used. However, for all attributes a base category
was always determined as the lowest level of each attribute, i.e. extremely remote, no motorbike,
HP as the facility, poor equipment and poor housing. The wage component was left to infer the
value per dollar of each attribute (or rather its difference with its base category).

The dependent variable was whether the job was selected or not, which took the value one or zero.
To fit such a variable a probit model or a logit model was used, estimated by a maximum likelihood
algorithm.

DCOs and Vignettes
In the DCOs and vignettes, the clinical competence of doctors was analysed by assessing their
knowledge and skill. The descriptive statistics on doctors’ attitude, history taking, physical
examination, treatment accuracy and health education toward real patients (in the DCOs) and
simulated cases (in the vignettes) were analysed.

The quality-of-care survey combined a DCO to evaluate doctors’ performance in a real clinical
setting and vignettes to measure doctors’ c linical knowledge and skill in an ideal outpatient setting
using a standard simulated ‘patient’. Thus the DCO tested the skill/performance of doctors and the
vignettes measured the knowledge. The difference between these two is the “know-do” gap.

In order to create a single score for each observation (  ), the total score was constructed from
each section: attitude, history taking, physical examination, therapy appropriateness and health
education. The response for each item ( ) is either yes or no and is scored as one or zero, while
responses with item scale 1 (well performed/appropriate), 2 (below expectation/somewhat
appropriate) and 3 (not performed/not appropriate), score one, 0.5, and 0 respectively. The

Means were compared using an independent t-test and anova to analyse whether scores were
significantly different between the variables of observations. In addition, regression analysis was
used to explore the determinant factors of doctors’ clinical performance.

2.5         Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from both international and national institutional review boards.
OPM’s Ethical Review Committee and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of
Health of Timor-Leste both reviewed the research protocol and data-collection instruments and
approved this study.

All research participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study. The
participation was fully voluntary and participants had the chance to withdraw at any point. Strict
anonymity was maintained and all identifying information was removed from the datasets.

2.6         Methodological Limitations
There are several limitations to this study; one of the most significant being the lack of demand-
side information. The sample only included health facilities and health workers and did not include
any patients. Naturally, it would have been possible to gather some important information on the
functionality of health facilities and performance of health workers if patients had been included in
the study design. To mitigate this limitation the survey methodology and instruments were carefully
designed so that the results are not biased based on health workers’ self-reporting on functionality
or performance.

Private health providers were not included in this survey, which is another important limitation.
About one-quarter of the health services in Timor-Leste are provided by private health care
providers (Asante, et al., 2014). Including private health providers might have increased the
comprehensiveness of the survey. However, the primary goal of this survey was to provide policy-
makers with information on government health workers and therefore, private facilities were
excluded from this survey. In our understanding the private sector is quite small and in some cases
embedded in the public sector (i.e. dual practice) and therefore migration, from the public sector is
not a significant issue as yet, particularly because most of the medical doctors have graduated in
recent years. However, in future this may appear as another important health policy issue in Timor-
Leste.

The data on health worker absenteeism should be interpreted with caution, as the teams did not
make unannounced visits to health facilities, even though they would have provided more reliable
data on absenteeism. Since the primary objective of this survey was not to gather absenteeism
data the decision was made to exclude unannounced visits, and avoid any potential delay in data
collection.

Finally, for the DCOs there were risks of an observer bias, known as the Hawthorne effect, which
assumes that the performance of health care workers increases because of the presence of an

external observer (Leonard, 2008). To minimise the risk of this bias, patients were sampled
throughout the consulting hours for the sampled doctors. In addition, field team members were
encouraged to keep a ‘low profile’ and to ask participants to perform as they would on a normal
day.

3          Labour Market Dynamics: Findings from the Health
           Worker Survey
This section outlines the findings of the general health worker survey that was administered
to 443 health workers, including 175 doctors, 150 nurses and 118 midwives, and covered
about 20% of the health workers in the country. The data show health workers to be
intrinsically motivated. In the long run, the majority of respondents would like to continue to
work in the government/public sector, including 99% of the doctors. This is also the case
for the broad majority of nurses and midwives, although 6% of nurses would prefer to move
to the private sector. Wage differentials within each cadre were relatively small, and income
did not vary much by years of experience, particularly for the doctors. Forty-five percent of
respondents agreed with the statement that they have ‘too much work to do’. However,
there was no clear correlation between workload and feelings of overload. Almost all
respondents believed their training adequately prepared them to diagnose and treat clinical
cases in Timor-Leste. However, despite all the training opportunities, roughly half (52%) of
the respondents stated that ‘there is not enough opportunity to learn current medical
knowledge’. Five percent of respondents were absent for personal reasons in the month
preceding the interview. Supervision was found to be frequent and appeared to have
positive outcomes in general.


3.1        Characteristics of the Sampled Health Workers
In the health worker survey, 443 medical staff including 175 doctors, 150 nurses and 118 midwives
were interviewed. Since the samples were drawn from various strata, the analysis was weighted
according to the total number of different staff types and the locality of their work (urban or rural).
Approximately 20% of the health workers in the country were sampled. Table 3 describes the
distribution of the sampled health workers compared to the total working in Timor-Leste at the time
of the survey.

Of the 443 respondents, 178 (40%) were male and 265 (60%) were female. Of them, 242 (55%)
were working in urban health facilities and 201 (45%) in rural facilities. Of the 175 doctors, 160
were trained by the Cuban Medical Brigade either in Cuba or in Timor-Leste. The remaining 15
doctors were trained in Indonesia. Roughly 70% of both the nurses and midwives were trained in
Timor-Leste and approximately 29% in Indonesia.

The remainder of the reported findings are based on analyses of the weighted dataset.

As shown in Figure 3, the majority of staff were between 25 and 39 years old – the overall average
age of all respondents was 37.8 years. The doctors were particularly young: 98% were less than
40 years old and the mean age was 29.5 years. The other medical staff were relatively older: only
18% of the nurses or midwives were below the age of 30 and roughly half of them were 40 years or
older. One in four nurses (24%) were above 50 years old.

These findings were probably a result of the fact that, in the past, these types of medical personnel
were recruited (and trained) in Timor-Leste and remained in the country after independence.
However, that is not the case with doctors, who were always scarce in the country. After

independence the majority of the Indonesian-educated doctors left the country, stripping the sector
of most of its medical capacity.

The medical education of doctors was envisaged to improve the access and quality of health,
especially in rural areas. The policy seems to have been successful as close to 53% of all doctors
interviewed were posted in rural facilities.

Only 30% of nurses were interviewed in rural areas, implying that the majority of them work in
urban facilities, while the number of midwives appears to be almost equally split between urban
(53%) and rural (47%) areas. This reflects the MoH’s policy to provide better coverage especially
for maternity health in rural Timor-Leste.

Since there were only a few doctors in Timor-Leste at the time of independence, almost the entire
cohort of doctors is newly trained – most of the doctors (96%) interviewed in the survey had less
than five years of experience in the sector. On the other hand, about half of the nurses and
midwives (45%) had 15 or more years of experience in their area of work.

The level of experience of staff seems to be connected to the placement of staff: 32% of the
respondents who work in HPs had more than 10 years of experience (see Table 5). In higher-level
facilities (CHCs, referral hospitals or the National Hospital), the number of staff with that level of
experience was much higher (61%, 59% and 52%, respectively). It therefore appears that staff with
comparatively less experience started their career in HPs.

The survey shows that health workers with more experience got opportunities to advance to higher
types of facility. This also explains the findings from Figure 5, which shows that almost half of the
medical staff with under five years’ experience (49%) were based in rural Timor-Leste, whereas in
urban areas the same category comprised one-third (34%) of the workforce.

Approximately three out of four doctors (74%) were still working in their first facility (see Table 6).
Fewer nurses and midwives were still working in their first workplace (45% and 42%, respectively).
Thirty-seven percent of the nurses and 34% of the midwives were working in their second facility
and roughly one-quarter (23%) of midwives have worked in three or more facilities during their
career to date. This finding is not surprising because, as mentioned above, in general nurses and
midwives had longer careers than the doctors in the survey.

A little more than half of the respondents (54%) stated that they had spent some time in rural
facilities: 59% of the doctors, 54% of the nurses and 51% of the midwives (see Figure 6).

Table 7 shows that 21% of doctors were working in HPs and 46% in CHCs. On the other hand, 8%
of nurses and 16% of midwives work in HPs.

3.2        Study Choice and Long-Term Career Preferences
When asked about their motivation to study medicine, almost every respondent (98%) referred to
their intention to help people, which speaks of a high level of intrinsic – and not so much monetary
– motivation.

Four in ten doctors trained in Cuba (38%), received a letter of recommendation from the village
head (known as the Chefe de Suco). It was often part of the agreement with the Chefe that these
doctors would go back to their suco for work. However, only 44% of the doctors stated they would

so and would prefer to go elsewhere.

Compared to the other types of staff, midwives were by far the most satisfied with their work (see
Figure 7): 61% of them consider themselves to be ‘very satisfied’ and an additional 38% to be
‘satisfied’ with their work. However, even though nurses (53%) and doctors (51%) indicate
themselves ‘very satisfied’ (the highest level) comparatively less often, generally speaking Timor-
Leste’s health workers indicate high levels of satisfaction. Only 4% of the respondents said they
were ‘unsatisfied’ or ‘very unsatisfied’ with their work.

Doctors in urban areas were more satisfied than doctors working in rural areas: 99% of urban
doctors were either ‘very satisfied’ or ‘satisfied’ compared to 93% in rural areas. In contrast, the
nurses and midwives working in rural areas were more satisfied: 98% of the nurses and all of the
midwives working in rural areas were satisfied compared to 96% and 98% of their urban
counterparts respectively.

In the long run, the majority of respondents would like to continue to work in the government/public
sector, including 99% of the doctors. This was also found to be the case for the broad majority of
nurses and midwives, although 6% of the nurses would prefer to move to the private sector. This
was especially true of those working in HPs, in urban areas.

Most doctors have a desire to move to higher tier facilities later in their career (see Figure 8). This
hints at the challenge in relation to retaining doctors in rural primary health facilities.

Figure 8 shows that, in terms of professional mobility, HPs were the least attractive stations for
medical staff, with just 6% of doctors citing them as their long-term preferred facility. Thirty percent
of the respondents working in HPs would like to stay there in the long run, 27% would like to join a
CHC, and 40% would prefer to work in a referral hospital or the National Hospital.

While the majority of staff currently working in CHCs (60%) would also like to work there in the
future, one in four (25%) would like to move on to a district hospital. Once they have reached a
district hospital or the National Hospital, staff seem likely to stay there. More interesting, however,
was the finding that very few respondents considered ‘moving back’ to a lower level (i.e. from a
CHC to a HP). That is a clear indicator that the work in HPs is considered by most to merely be a
starting point in the medical sector, not a place where one might wish to stay.

The preference for working in an urban area was further underlined by the fact that half of the
doctors would like to work in a district town. An additional 28% would prefer to work in Dili. Only
22% see themselves working in rural sucos.

Figure 9 shows that medical staff felt that there was a limit to their control over their career: 85%
acknowledged that the MoH will determine where their next assignment would be. The sense of a

lack of control is further exhibited by the 70% ‘agreeing’ or ‘strongly agreeing’ with the statement ‘I
am not clear about my career path’.

Eight in ten medical staff exhibit a high level of motivation by saying that they would stay in the
facility until the last patient is treated – even if they would not receive additional money.

Proximity to one’s family was also important (70% believed it is important to work close to where
their family are). While only 40% indicated that they could be close to ‘immediate family members’
in rural areas.

Figure 10 reveals that a sizeable portion of respondents was not strongly against living in rural
areas (42% declared it enjoyable and 47% believed that life in rural areas appeals to them). The
sample size did not allow for an in-depth analysis of the underlying drivers of motivation.
Nonetheless, it appears from the other analyses that a general career goal is to work in urban
areas. Urban health facilities present a better work environment with more career development
opportunities.

The majority of respondents (97%) were not looking for another job in the short run, although the
desire to change jobs in the longer term (5–10 years) was found to be slightly higher (8%). This
can be explained by staff preferences: the majority of them would like to stay in their current
medical area and only very few (4%) have ambitions to leave their clinical position and move into
management (1% of doctors and 6% of nurses).

3.3        Workload
Approximately one in five doctors (18%) believed they had more patients than they could take care
of. On the other side of the spectrum, 19% believed that they could handle ‘a lot more’ patients per
day. Around 60% of respondents, however, think they have just enough patients. Among the
midwives, 24% indicated that they could handle more patients.

It appears that the perceived workload was greater in higher tier facilities. Twenty-six percent of
respondents in HPs reported that they could handle more patients, whereas only 3% in the
National Hospital agreed with the statement.

The number of patients seen by the sampled doctors who participated in a DCO was counted; the
mean number of patients per day was 10.2, with an SD of 7.5. In urban facilities the mean (SD)
patient load was 11.5 (6.9) compared to 9.6 (7.8) in rural facilities. The number of patients also
varied by level of facility, with higher tier facilities having more patients.

Although most respondents work five days per week in HPs, CHCs and district/regional hospitals
(63%, 66% and 54%, respectively), 22% to 36% work six and sometimes seven days a week.

In the National Hospital, 36% of respondents stated that they work five days a week and 43% that
they work six to seven days per week. Four in 10 staff there reported having one day off from work
per week (if at all). This highlights the danger that, in the medium to long term, some medical staff
might suffer from exhaustion.

Looking at the number of working hours per day, it becomes apparent that working in a rural area
usually means an eight-hour workday (97%). In urban areas, on the other hand, the pattern is less
clear; 12% of respondents work more than eight hours and another 8% less than that.

3.4        Salary and Financial Benefits
All medical staff received their money through a direct deposit to their bank account and few of
them (2%) had experienced any delays in receiving their money.

Ninety-seven percent of all medical staff surveyed stated that they do not receive any additional
money or presents from their patients or from drug companies, although 4% of doctors stated that
they had received ‘large gifts’.

Only 7 out of 443 respondents (among them only one doctor) stated participating in private
practice, while 7% of nurses and 5% of midwives stated that they also work in a non-medical
profession. However, these data need to be carefully interpreted as private practice is not legally
permitted in Timor-Leste and therefore, some of the respondents may not have accurately reported
participation.

Doctors received more non-salary benefits than nurses and midwives. As is shown in Table 10,
two-thirds of them receive at least one benefit, while this was only found to be the case for around
one-quarter of the nurses and midwives.

Table 10 also shows that benefits were more widespread in CHCs and HPs than in hospitals,
indicating that there are some existing incentive mechanisms in operation at lower-level rural
facilities.

In terms of the type of benefits, 53% of doctors were provided with a motorbike and 36% of them
were provided with housing. Again, this is lower for midwives and nurses, which suggests these
benefits were specifically created for doctors (see Table 11). Three percent of all staff working in
hospitals were provided with a motorbike as opposed to 38% of those working in CHCs and 40% in
HPs. It can be inferred that most of these motorbikes are for use in rural areas.

When it comes to the maintenance of these motorbikes, however, doctors and midwives were
particularly critical. Only half of doctor and midwives reported that they receive either sufficient fuel
or funds to buy fuel for the motorbike. More than half of all respondents also stated that these
benefits were delayed, with just one in four respondents stating that these were provided ‘always
on time’. This could mean that medical staff must pre-finance (if not pay for) the fuel for their work-
related trips, which could put a strain on their personal income. On the other hand, most medical
staff only have one motorbike which they also ride for personal use. Tracking actual work-related,
as opposed to personal use, and the amount of fuel used might be difficult. It would therefore be
helpful to ascertain the amount of work-related travel medical staff undertake and provide fuel
funds accordingly.

As shown in Figure 13, doctors had an average income of US$ 622, nurses US$ 453, and
midwives US$ 479. With the exception of nurses, incomes were slightly higher for those who
worked in urban areas. This could also be attributed to the fact that more senior health workers
worked in urban facilities.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Figure 14 shows the monthly incomes of health worker category by years of experience. The data
indicate that income did not vary much by years of experience, particularly in regard to doctors. On
average, a doctor with more than ten years of experience earns only US$ 50 more than a new
doctor. This could lead to dissatisfaction regarding wages and benefits among the more long-
serving doctors.

The analysis of the respondents’ share of household income shows that roughly half of the health
workers were the sole contributors. That is the case for all occupational types except midwives. In
addition, in 42% of the cases health workers provided at least half of the household income. Only
one in nine respondents (11%) contributed less than half (see Table 13).

Table 14 shows the breakdown of available money per household after all expenses. About 60% of
the doctors had more than US$ 200 available per household member, whereas for half of the
nurses and one in three midwives the available money amounted to US$ 50 or less.

3.5        Training
Almost all respondents believed that their training had well prepared them to diagnose and treat
clinical cases in Timor-Leste.

When asked how many short-term training sessions (less than 30 days) they had attended in the
last three years, roughly half of the nurses and midwives said they had undertaken three or more
(48% and 52%, respectively). On the other hand, one-quarter of them had not attended any such

training in this timeframe. At the same time, roughly one-third (35%) of doctors had attended three
or more training sessions and around the same percentage (37%) none at all.

Long-term training sessions (30 days or more) had been attended by roughly one-quarter of the
doctors in the last three years, a finding that is not surprising given that most of them had just
completed their medical training. On the other hand, 41% of nurses and 35% of midwives had
undertaken long-term training in the last three years.

Doctors were asked about some specific training sessions and dates of attendance. Figure 15
shows that the majority of doctors (57%) had been trained on TB diagnosis and treatment.
However, other training sessions were much less common: only around one in three doctors (36%)
were trained in HIV/AIDS care and management and 29% were trained on labour and delivery, of
which 5% were trained more than one year ago.

Although a large number of doctors are located in rural areas, it is worth noting that only 19% of
these doctors have undergone community health training. In addition, only 11% had received
training on hypertension, 7% on diabetes and 5% on management.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Table 17 details the number of training sessions that respondents received in the last year. One in
five respondents (19%) received no training. The majority of these respondents work in rural health
facilities. At the other end of the spectrum is a percentage of staff that attended three or more
training sessions. Not surprisingly, the respondents were mostly hospital staff (60%). Staff working
in rural areas (mostly in CHCs and HPs) received considerably less training than those located in
urban areas (and who work in hospitals).

Only two of the doctors stated that they would not require any further training, which means that
almost every doctor interviewed believed they require additional training for their present job.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


As shown in Figure 16, more than three-quarters of doctors indicated that they require training on
IMCI and more than 59% on EmONC. Even though 55% of doctors stated that they received
training on TB in the last year, roughly two out of three think they require additional training on that
subject. Community health, diabetes and mental health were the least desired training topics,
nonetheless more than 40% of the doctors requested them. There were only small differences in
training requests between doctors in rural and urban areas.

As mentioned above, almost every doctor believed their training prepared them to diagnose and
treat diseases in Timor-Leste. Interestingly, more than 75% still believed they require more
training on IMCI to do their job and more than half believed they require training on malaria.
Furthermore, even doctors who had recently undergone training wanted more training in the same
subject. These findings may seem paradoxical, but a possible explanation may be that the request
for further training relates to subject-specific matters, whereas the overwhelming affirmation to the
statement that a doctor’s training prepares them well to diagnose and treat diseases is general in
nature.

The findings outlined in this section should be followed up to better understand why such a
sizeable portion of doctors believe additional training is required for their daily work – and if such
training is actually needed or is merely desired by the doctors.

3.6        Supervision
The vast majority (85%) of respondents indicated that they have a supervisor who is responsible
for providing performance feedback. This proportion is more or less the same across all
professional groups, localities and facility levels.

While more than half (57%) of the medical staff in rural areas were supervised by the District
Health Service (DHS), only 30% of staff located in urban areas were supervised by DHS. In
hospitals, specialist physicians supervised 36% of the health workers; 53% of those working in
CHCs reported to the District Medical Officer. Staff in HPs was either supervised by the District
Medical Officer (41%) or by the Head of the Health Facility (38%).

Roughly eight out of ten respondents (83%) reported that they had meetings with their supervisor
at least every three months, with the majority of staff – except for midwives – having monthly
meetings.

Location plays a role in the frequency of supervisory meetings. Seventy-one percent of
respondents located in hospitals had monthly meetings. In other facilities, such as HPs or CHCs,
this percentage was reduced by half. Still, despite the challenges in organising these meetings in
more rural areas, the majority of staff had supervisory meetings at least every three months.
Roughly one in 10 respondents stated that they only had one supervisory meeting per year and
roughly 2% reported that they did not have any supervisory meetings.

This finding is further verified by respondents’ answers to the question of when the last meeting
with their supervisor took place: while 71% of all respondents reported that a meeting happened in
the preceding 30 days, 9% indicated that a meeting happened more than six months ago. Staff in
HPs seemed to meet with their supervisors most often, with 76% of respondents having met a
supervisor in the last month.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


To understand the quality and contents of the interaction with the supervisor, respondents were
asked: ‘what did your main supervisor do during the last supervisory interaction, for example did he
or she bring something or ask questions? ’ Respondents were allowed to spontaneously answer the
question without category prompts. The responses were recorded with the appropriate code. Only
when the respondent had finished speaking were all remaining items read out and the respondent
asked whether or not their supervisor participated in the additional activities. These answer types
were coded separately. The findings on supervisor activity in rural areas are shown in Figure 18.

In rural areas, respondents highlighted the following supervisory activities: the supervisor checked
records, observed consultations and provided health instructions as well as supplies. These thus
appear to be supervisors’ main activities.

However, only around one in seven (16%) of the respondents spontaneously spoke about the
supervisor asking knowledge assessment questions or checking finances (14%). After prompting,
the percentage of respondents mentioning these categories rose, however, it can be concluded
that these are mostly secondary aims of supervisory visits. The same is true for providing
administrative instructions (11%) and, to a much lower extent, checking finances (4%) or giving
instructions for filling out the Health Management Information System (2%). Therefore, most
supervisory visits in rural areas revolve around the checking of records and observing the (young)
doctors at work, with administrative work taking a backseat.

To understand whether the type of supervision differs between rural and urban areas, the
prompted and unprompted responses were added up. In Figure 19, a similar picture appears
across the two areas:

It appears that the nature of supervisory visits is by and large the same in rural and urban areas,
although ‘checking finances’ seems to be more prevalent in rural areas whereas ‘on the job
training’ happens more in urban settings.

3.7         Challenges
Figure 20 outlines the reported key problems in the current job as reported by respondents. ‘My
salary is too low’ was the statement that a clear majority of health workers agreed with. For roughly
half (52%) of the respondents, a key problem appears to be that ‘there is not enough opportunity to
learn current medical knowledge’. This issue surfaced earlier (see Section 4.5) and might be
connected to how the training that is available is perceived. It may also have something to do with
the overall quality of education that respondents received, as they may feel they do not have
enough up-to-date medical knowledge. Again, closer follow up on these findings is recommended
so as to better understand the drivers behind the sentiments.

Inadequate housing and transportation were also issues for roughly half of the respondents. Again,
these findings would require follow up to understand the nature of the issues involved and their
overall priority, as well as possible solutions should they be required.

Despite the problems mentioned by medical staff, the statement with the lowest level of agreement
was ‘I do not feel motivated’. Nonetheless, around 25% agreed or strongly agreed with this
statement. To understand the reasons for this lack of motivation, a correlation analysis was
conducted. Although all of the statements except for one1 set out in the list correlate significantly2
with the item, the overall correlation coefficients were very low, with the highest being .271 (‘I have
too much work to do’). Therefore, as before, this item should be followed up with staff interviews in
order to understand the drivers for this statement.

When analysed by staff type, differences in two items were found: on a scale from 1 (strongly
agree) to 4 (strongly disagree), nurses and midwives score an average of 2.3 and 2.5 points,
respectively, to the question on transportation. Therefore, on average, nurses and midwives were
less satisfied with transportation than doctors (score of 2.8).The other issue is with salary: here the
midwives’ response was most critical, with an average of 2.0 as compared to doctors’ score of 2.6.




1   That item is ‘We need more staff to take care of all patients ’.
2   This has a significance level of 0.00 on a two-tailed test.

Scale: 1: strongly agree, 2: agree, 3: disagree, 4: strongly disagree

Seventy-five percent of all respondents stated that they felt the need to discuss these (or other
difficulties) with their supervisor within the last year. Most of them (95%) then actually discussed it
with their supervisor, with 66% noticing improvements afterwards.

With that backdrop it is not surprising that the majority of respondents (77%) were ‘(very) satisfied’
with the last supervisory meeting and that their motivational effect is also high: 86% indicate that
they ‘always’ feel motivated afterwards.

Overall, it appears that these sentiments exist across all categories, with no significant differences
between the type of staff, locality or the facility type the respondent works in.

3.8        Absence from Work
As was mentioned in Section 2.6, unannounced visits to health facilities, such as would have
allowed us to capture more reliable data on absenteeism, were not made. In the survey, only 8% of
respondents reported being absent from work in the 30 days prior to the interviews because they
were sick. The same was true across all types of medical staff. However, more than 33% of
doctors stated that they had attended training and were therefore absent from work, although this
ratio was lower for nurses and midwives (with 17% and 28% indicating they had attended training).

Most staff said that they had not been absent in the last 30 days due to personal reasons. To
clarify the type of personal reasons that result in absence, staff were asked ‘regardless of when
that was, why were you away from work for a personal reason ?’ This question was open, meaning
that no answer categories were provided.

One in five (20%) staff stated that they did not go to work because relatives or family members
were sick and roughly the same percentage reported that they were absent when they were sick
themselves. In rural areas, another main reason (15%) was being asked by their supervisor to pick
something up, like salary, drugs or equipment. That reason was less prevalent in urban areas
(8%), possibly because the supply situation is better in urban areas.

Other reasons, such as ‘doing household chores’, ‘taking care of children’ or ‘tiredness from the
job’, were each mentioned by roughly 3% of respondents. Interestingly, however, 9% of rural
doctors mentioned that they were absent because they had to do another paid job at the same
time.

When they were absent, roughly 13% of respondents stated that their absence resulted in a call
from the facility head. In 5% of these cases, the supervisor discussed the absence with the staff
member and 2% indicated that money was deducted from their salary as a result. Overall,
however, it appears that absence for personal reasons is often not followed up or does not have
any consequences. In seven out of ten cases (69%) the respondent does not report any reaction
from the supervisor in the event of their absence.

Although it could be argued that due to the nature of rural areas, supervisors might not be aware of
absences, there is no evidence of this to be found in the dataset. Indeed, it appears that staff
members in the National Hospital were those least likely to be contacted by supervisors in the
event of an absence. This finding could mean various things: it could mean supervisors generally
do not interfere when staff are absent, that they might not be aware of the staff member’s absence
because they do not have much contact with each other, or simply that there is a mechanism in
place that makes the supervisor’s follow-up obsolete (e.g. staff call in to report absences).

To better understand staff absence and supervisors’ reactions, follow up on these findings is
recommended.

4          Working Environment: Findings from the Health Facility
           Survey
This section provides a snapshot of health facilities and their service availability to assess
the working environment of health workers. The field teams visited 69 health facilities in all
13 districts of Timor-Leste, including 6 hospitals, 33 CHCs and 30 HPs. The data suggest
that the hospitals were generally well equipped and that CHCs were moderately equipped.
However, most of the HPs were still poorly equipped and lacking basic facilities and
services. The facilities located in rural areas were also considerably under-resourced
compared to facilities in urban areas. Storage conditions for medicines were found to be
particularly concerning, especially in rural areas.


4.1        Characteristics of Health Facilities
The field teams visited 69 facilities in all 13 districts of Timor-Leste. Of them, 21 (30%) were urban
and 48 (70%) were rural. All three types of health facility – i.e. hospitals, community health centres
(CHC) and health posts (HP) were visited by the field teams. Approximately one-quarter of the
fixed health facilities in the country were visited (see Table 21). It should be noted that the health
facilities have been classified as hospitals, CHCs and HPs for brevity: hospitals include the
National Hospital in Dili and five referral hospitals; CHCs are the intermediary-level health facilities
with or without inpatient services; and HPs are lowest tier health facilities providing outpatient
services and are typically found in rural areas.

* Based on data received from the MoH

All 6 sampled hospitals, but none of the 30 sampled HPs, had inpatient services. Among the 33
sampled CHCs, 18 (55%) had inpatient services; the remaining 15 (45%) did not.

Table 22 presents the number of health workers by type of health facility. The National Hospital
was excluded from this table, as the number of health workers is considerably higher than those in
other hospitals (the National Hospital had 91 general physicians, 18 specialist physicians, 74
nurses and 61 midwives at the time of the survey).

                                             Hospitals                        CHCs                           HPs

3The proportion of sampled health posts is relatively smaller than the other types of health facilities as the HPs are
usually smaller facilities with few staffs in post. Since the health workers were sampled by probability proportion to size
(PPS) the larger facilities were more likely to be sampled.

As expected, table 22 (above) shows the numbers of all health worker types were higher in
hospitals than in CHCs and HPs. The large SD of health workers (especially in CHCs) indicates
that health workers were not found to be evenly distributed across the different types of facilities.

The results presented above are unweighted as they refer to the distribution of the sample
population. Other results presented in subsequent sub-sections are weighted and are
representative at the country level.

4.2        Service Availability
General service availability was found to be in an acceptable condition. As shown in Table 23, the
availability of general services usually followed the MoH’s recommended Basic Service Package
(MoH, 2007).

* According to the Basic Service Package 2007, these services are supposed to be available at hospitals (A), CHCs (B)
and HPs (C)

Only half of referral hospitals reported providing child vaccination services as these services were
being provided by lower tier facilities and by SISCas. Blood transfusion services and caesarean
section services were only available in hospitals and a few CHCs.

The HPs were typically found to provide fewer services.

Table 24 also shows that all of the hospitals have guidelines and treatment provision for domestic
violence. However, the CHCs and HPs frequently lack this service. Almost all the facilities provide
maternity leave for their female staff.

4.3        Infrastructure and Equipment
Access to clean water remains a significant problem, particularly in rural areas, and 18% of health
facilities did not have a fixed source of water. Of the facilities that had a primary water source,
more than half did not have a water source on their premises. Although all the hospitals had water
sources on their premises, more than half of the CHCs and HPs did not (see Table 25). Most of the
facilities (61%) had a piped connection, followed by tubewells or boreholes (7%), protected dug
wells (6%) and protected springs (5%). Three percent of health facilities were using unsafe water
sources, in the form of unprotected wells (2%) and surface water (1%).

All hospitals and most CHCs had access to electricity, but nearly half had experienced interruption
during the seven days preceding the survey and some of them did not have any alternative
sources of electricity. Access to electricity among HPs remains an issue. Table 25 also shows that
72% of health facilities were connected to the electricity grid. Facilities that were not connected to
the grid had alternative sources for electricity and some were connected to the grid and had an
alternative source as back up. Among all facilities, 39% had had uninterrupted electricity during the
seven days preceding the survey.

All hospitals were equipped with functioning landlines, cellular phones and computers and 70%
had an internet connection. However, a considerable proportion of CHCs and HPs did not have
any functioning means of communication (see Figure 23). This has given rise to certain
communication challenges and affects the reporting of urgent cases and shortages of medical
supplies and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, the data show cellular coverage to be quite high
even for HPs, which offers the potential to use mobile phone technology for inventory monitoring
and other communications.

The privacy of patients in client examination rooms met the required standards in hospitals. In
contrast, 58% of HPs did not have any audio or visual privacy in the client examination rooms (see
Figure 24). Forty-five percent of urban health facilities lack privacy in client examination rooms,
compared to 56% in rural facilities, which is not a statistically significant difference (p-value=0.49).

The availability of infection control materials in client examination rooms, by type of material and
type of facility, was widely varied. For example, more than 90% of the facilities had alcohol-based
hand rub and disposable syringes, but only 7% had eye-protecting goggles. More than half of the
facilities did not have any infection control guidelines in the client examination room.

data showed that the availability of drugs was inconsistent across levels of facilities. For example,
none of the HPs should have Ceftriaxone, which is a third-generation injectable cephalosporin drug
and should only be administered in the case of severe infections. HPs had significantly fewer of the
drugs mandated for all levels.

* According to the Essential Drug List 2010, these drugs are supposed to be available at hospitals (A), CHCs (B) and
HPs (C).

All of the hospitals and CHCs and 93% of the HPs had the facility to store medicines at the health
facility; however, the storage conditions of these medicines were not ideal in the majority of the
facilities. Based on visual observation by the survey teams, there was evidence of rodents or pests
in the medicine storage room at 50% of the health facilities, and in 41% of the facilities the storage
room was not well ventilated (see Figure 25).

5          Health Worker Preferences: Findings from the Discrete
           Choice Experiment
In the discrete choice experiment the survey team explored health worker preferences by
giving them the option to choose hypothetical jobs that varied by mixed attributes. The
findings revealed that the ‘probability of specialisation’ was the top-ranked most important
factor for doctors. Visits from specialists, availability of equipment, good housing, working
in higher-level facilities and urban location were the other significant attributes (by order of
importance). Newly graduated doctors were totally neutral toward wages. For nurses and
midwives, in-service training was valued most highly, followed by transportation,
equipment, remote location and housing.


5.1        Setting-up the Experiment

Concept

Discrete choice experiments draws on Lancaster’s theory of values (1966), which states that each
good/option is actually composed of many attributes, or characteristics, which are valuable.
Assuming that utility function of health workers follows the random utility theory (McFadden 1974),
then, the observation of a large number of choices will give the relative preference of one attribute
over the other. The DCE then consists in a set of choices between (usually) two options that differ
in the value of their attributes. In this study, the two options were two jobs which had various
attributes (characteristics or dimensions) and each of these attributes had different levels.

Selection of the Attributes and Levels
The attributes of a DCE are the features of each job. A qualitative study was conducted to prepare
the attributes and levels for DCE. The qualitative study involved key informant interviews (KII) with
national and district level managers, in depth interviews with public health researchers, in depth
interviews with medical students at UNTL, focus group discussions (FGDs) with midwives/nurses
and FGDs with medical doctors. All the qualitative data was recorded and analysed. The attributes
and their levels that were used for the DCE analysis are listed below.

Creation of the Experiment
The goal in building the choice set was to obtain as much information as possible with the smallest
amount of choices possible. Indeed, respondents may become tired and bored quickly and will
then put less effort into selecting the best option. A maximum of 16 choices is recommended. In

order to get the most of these observed choices, the lowest variance possible (the D-efficiency), is
required.

For practical reasons it was decided that all health workers would face the same 16 choices,
instead of 72 as would be optimal for the D-efficiency criteria. This reduced efficiency to 97%. In
addition, some restrictions were included to avoid unrealistic jobs, such as a CHC in a very remote
area. This further lowered efficiency to 93%. The job attribute levels were same in one choice (Job
A) of all 16 sets, while the other choice varies in its attributes levels.

The creation of all possible sets, as well as the optimisation to find the best combination of 16
choices was made using the macros for SAS. More details on the design of the choice set can be
found in Annex C.

Analysis of the DCE Data

If the Random Utility Theory holds, one can estimate a logit/probit model (with a maximum
likelihood function) to analyse the dichotomous choices made by the respondents

                                              Choice (0/1)= B*X

where X is a vector containing the differences between the level of the attributes of each option.

The relative importance of each coefficient will give the Marginal Rate of Substitution between the
different attributes.

5.2        Descriptive Statistics for Doctors, Nurses and Midwives
The discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisted of 16 job choices that were made by health
workers: each choice is called a set. The sets presented to doctors were different from those
presented to nurses and midwives in regard to levels and the number of levels within each
attribute, but the attributes themselves were the same. Only two health workers did not fill in the
DCE section. The sample is composed of 173 doctors, 150 nurses and 118 midwives. Each health
worker made 16 choices, so a total of 7,056 choices were made among the 14,112 single jobs
proposed to the health workers. This is the level of observation for the DCE analysis.

The health workers made choices between two hypothetical jobs: job A and job B. They were then
asked whether they would refuse both jobs. The table below describes for each set the percentage
of health workers selecting job A over job B, as well as whether or not the health workers would
refuse both jobs.

An average of 39% of the medical doctors would choose job A: the minimum is 23.7% for set
number 3 and the maximum is around 56.6% for set 11. The nurses and midwives had averages of
54.5 and 53.1 respectively, and their ranges were [42%–65%] and [46%–64%]. The fact that health
workers were found to be split over the choices indicates that there was some balance in utility
between the jobs proposed and that some trade-offs were made: the data should carry a lot of
information. The refusal rate is 19% (of all health workers pooled).

The team also verified that individual health workers made trade-offs and did not have monotone
preferences: only 3.6% picked only A jobs or B jobs (see Annex C). The ‘both jobs refusal’ rate
was also kept in mind for regression analysis (2% would refuse all jobs: see the ‘both jobs refusal’
analysis in Annex C).

A typical DCE evaluation is to check whether respondents always selected a response based on
the levels of only one attribute. A large proportion of doctors’ choices show dominance in regard to
education, which is understandable and not abnormal.

The ultimate goal of a DCE is to understand the relation between the levels of attributes and the
choice made by health workers. The table below shows the job selection rate when features of the
job are present or absent, as well as the correlation between the job selections. If the number of a
set was large enough and the array perfectly orthogonal, the percentage of job choice would be a
good indicator of the utility derived from that attribute.

However, given that the number of sets is small and that a correlation between the levels of all
attributes could not be avoided, it is not possible to directly infer utility from this table. Nonetheless,

it is still an indicator of preferences and the reader might be interested in these descriptive
statistics.

Overall, these statistics show what could be expected: better health facilities, educational
prospects and housing were more associated with job selection, while the relation with motorbikes,
wages and locations was less clear.

The results for the nurses and midwives were much less contrasted. The categories low wage
level, good housing, no training and bachelor’s degree, good equipment and very remote location
were mildly negatively associated with job choice.

On the other hand, remote location, medium equipment, workshops, CHC location and better
wages were preferred (with robust lower weights for the constant job option).

5.2.1       A Bias Against Job A?

For the doctors, the striking fact is that the items that were most present (because they are in job
A) were usually not preferred. This reflects the fact that only 38% of the doctors picked job A over
job B, and that preference for job A had a very high weight in the computation of these means.
However, it is puzzling that all the lowest level of the attributes were systematically preferred to the
higher levels if the higher levels were in job A: very remote is preferred to remote, poor equipment
is preferred to medium equipment, no training at all is preferred to workshops, no motorbikes were
preferred to jobs with motorbikes, and jobs with income set at US$ 610 were preferred to jobs with
income set at US$ 710.4

When considering explanations other than a genuine utility difference, one can only speculate that
there is a bias against job A. However, the jobs seemed balanced and job A reflects very well the
situation of many health workers: only the income is a bit higher. It is possible that the doctors



4To investigate a bit further, the same table was created for subsamples : removing the ‘specialization’ dominant items,
working with only HP –based doctors or excluding those working in HPs and those who choose only one option. This did
not change the results. However, if we keep only job B, or if we give job A a lower weight (1/16), the table is very different
and the numbers are more coherent with regard to expectations concerning utilities (see working excel file).

responded strategically; they might have thought that they were going to be given job A, which
might be of lower quality than their present position.

5.3        Multivariate Analysis for Doctors

5.3.1      Basic Results

The Regression Results
The first basic regression had many positive coefficients, as it was decided to keep the less valued
category as the base category for the regression. The largest and most positive coefficient is on
the higher probability of specialisation, which means that training is the attribute with the largest
range between its best level and its lowest level. Beside specialisation, specialist’s visits to the
doctor’s facility are also a valued type of training. Good and medium-level equipment were also
important to doctors, and they preferred to be in a CHC rather than in a HP. Urban location was
preferred to remote and extremely remote, but it seems that an extremely remote location does not
carry a different value to a remote location in the eyes of the interviewed doctors. As for the
personal advantage preferences of the doctors, good housing was first, while wages and having a
motorbike did not seem to be important at all: the coefficients were negative, but non-significantly
different from zero. These results are robust to the exclusion of those who systematically picked
either job A or job B. Further robustness checks were performed, as described in Annex C.

Reading the MRS Table
The full MRS table can be found below (based on the all-sample regression). The horizontal rows
of this table represent the items that are being traded in (compared to their base category), while
the vertical columns represent the items that are traded for. The coefficient in each cell gives the
quantity of how much the column item needs to be changed in order to get one row item.

A MRS that is equal to -1 between A and B means that you exchange one A for one B. A MRS
more negative than -1 indicates that more than one column item needs to be relinquished in order
to get one row item. On the contrary, a MRS that is between -1 and 0 means only a portion of the
column item is relinquished to get the row item. If the MRS is above 0, the signs of the coefficients
are different. In that case, one item is considered as bad and the doctors would have to ‘accept’
that bad item in order to get the row item.

Take the second row for example, staff can ask how much doctors are willing to pay in order to go
from an extremely remote location (base category) to an urban location. Traded for itself (second
column), the MRS is equal to -1, which is logical: they are worth the same. As for the third column,
it gives the MRS with good equipment, which has ‘poor equipment’ as the base category. The
coefficient is -0.850, which means that the ‘urban’ item is worth 0.85 ‘good equipment’. If we
believe the utility theory on which this method is based, we can say that for, the doctors, the utility
of a move from an extremely remote location to a urban location equals only 83% of the utility that
they would obtain if they had medium-level equipment instead of poor equipment. We can also
observe the corresponding reverse MRS: row 3 is medium equipment and its MRS with urban
location (column 2) is 1.18: thus, doctors would trade the medium equipment for 1.18 times the
benefit they get from an urban location.

In the regression presented above, it is noteworthy that remote location (compared to extremely
remote), having a motorbike (compared to not having one) and wage all have negative coefficients.
This is counterintuitive and these items are considered as bad. As a result, the MRSs are positive
when compared to items considered desirable. For example, the MRS between motorbike and
medium equipment is 0.122: the counterintuitive interpretation of that is that doctors would have to
be compensated with 0.12 ‘medium equipment’ in order to accept the ‘bad’ item motorbike. The
fact that wage is not valued is problematic. In the literature it is commonplace to evaluate the value

of each item of a DCE by computing its marginal substitution rate with the monetary term: if this
one is null or negative, all the MRSs are upside down, since it implies that workers then would pay
money to get bad things and need to be paid to have the items they value. The interpretation of
these results is therefore rather complicated.

Policy Implications

Based on this MRS table, policy-makers are able to understand the trade-offs between the various
attributes of jobs. If policy-makers want to change health workers’ behaviour using market forces,
this reveals exactly the level of other attributes that would make health workers adopt that
behaviour.

The focus of the survey was to find out which incentives would encourage doctors to move to
remote or extremely remote areas. It is therefore good news to see that this coefficient is not very
high in the regression. The ‘urban’ row demonstrates that it is worth only 85% of a medium
equipment level and only 52% of good equipment. Therefore, improving facility levels and the
availability of drugs and medical equipment would be largely enough to compensate for an urban
location with a low equipment level. As for training, visits from specialists or a higher probability of
specialisation would also incentivise doctors to work in non-urban settings as opposed to urban
settings where they would not have such an opportunity. Practicing in a rural CHC would also give
a 51% increase in satisfaction, compared to doctors in an urban HP (MRS CHC-urban = -1.51).
Good housing would increase satisfaction by 86%.

The table below highlights the urban column and adds the statistical significance. The p-value
gives the mean estimate of the population that would pick the urban attribute, over the other
attribute listed. Providing higher probability of specialisation or visits from specialists would
apparently make 99% of the doctors select a non-urban workplace. Good housing is more
important for 95% of the doctors. A medium level of equipment would convince two-thirds of the
doctors to move to a remote or extremely remote area, while 32.5% would rather stay in an urban
area.

Policy Implications
Of course, policy-makers might not want all doctors to move to rural areas. Designing a policy that
would provide good training, good facilities and good housing in remote areas would largely
exceed the objective and thus create imbalances. Therefore, based on the policy-makers’

objective, further simulations can be carried out to create incentives that would make a certain
percentage of doctors want to opt to move to remote or extremely remote areas.

Policy-makers must arbitrate based not only on effectiveness and targeted objectives, but also on
cost. The implementation of each attribute should be evaluated so that a cost can be associated
with objectives and policy changes. Policy implementation decisions can then be weighed against
the costs. Some policies also have system-wide positive externalities (such as good equipment),
while others are exclusive to recipients (such as good housing). These externalities should also be
considered while designing policy.

Moreover, policy-makers can revise current policies based on these findings. For example,
motorbikes appear not be valued. The results from this survey seem to indicate that this policy
could be discontinued.5

5.3.2      Multivariate Analysis

The basic regression does not allow us to distinguish the effect of doctors’ specific characteristics,
although this could be very relevant to policy-makers, as some subgroups may be more sensitive
to some attributes. Observing the preferences inferred from the DCE based on doctors’ current
situation regarding the DCE attributes is also important. A few control variables related to doctors’
personal situation were selected including, their studies, their medical experience and their medical
situation (see Table 36). Stated preferences were avoided, as they appear in the same field as the
DCE and the preference effect might be diluted between the job choice and the stated preferences.

5 However, it should be noted that any conclusions drawn depend on the good execution of the experiment and a good
understanding from participants of the exercise. It was noticed that many respondents had difficulties decontextualizing
their responses and might have thought that they would still keep their motorbike – if they had one. Further modeling
could be undertaken to control for the worker’s situation.

Since the econometric framework incorporates the individual doctor’s fixed effects, any control at
the health worker level cannot be included. However, the controls as interaction terms with the
DCE levels can be included. The coefficient will be interpreted as the extra effect to the base for
that specific group. The single control regression results for doctors are included in Annex A.
Below a few features are highlighted, by attributes.

Location
Male doctors expressed the greatest preference for urban locations. Married health workers
disregarded extremely remote locations, while non-married health workers would actually prefer to
go to extremely remote locations rather than merely remote ones. Doctors owning a house or
working in a different district from their family were not willing to go to an urban area. Doctors in
HPs would rather not go to urban areas, while those working in a CHC had a strong dislike for
extremely remote areas. As for their experience, having worked in a HP did not affect their
preferences, but those who had worked in a CHC or a hospital were more inclined to prefer urban
areas compared to those who had not. The letter of recommendation that some doctors received
from local rural authorities was associated with a preference for remote locations and an aversion
to an urban workplace. Doctors reporting themselves satisfied or highly satisfied with their job
would not take urban jobs, while those who were unsatisfied showed a very strong preference for
urban workplaces. Doctors with housing would prefer to go to urban areas, but those with good
housing would actually prefer rural locations. Doctors who have a motorbike would prefer an urban
or remote location to an extremely remote one. A heavy workload is associated with indifference
between urban, remote or extremely remote workplaces. Workers reporting a lack of drugs and
lack of supervision did not value urban locations; they stated remote areas as their preference.

Equipment
Good or medium-level equipment becomes less important with doctors’ age. Females valued it
more than males. It was less valued by doctors in HPs and rural areas and those with a good level
of satisfaction with their job. Doctors with higher wages did not stress the importance of equipment
as much as lower paid doctors. Those who reported a lack of drugs and lack of equipment did
place more value on the quality of the equipment.

Training
Older doctors tended to be less interested in any kind of training, while females were keener than
males to opt for visits from specialists. Workers in HPs and CHCs were more interested in
specialisation, but the former were more interested in visits from specialists than their colleagues in
CHCs. Workshops, which were not significant in the overall regression, are significant for workers
in rural areas. Workers who had ever worked in a hospital were less interested than the other

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


respondents in additional training. On the contrary, workers trained by the Cuban Medical Brigade
showed a significantly higher level of interest in workshops and visits from specialists in the field.
Highly satisfied doctors had a lower utility for all kinds of training. Already having good housing or a
motorbike increased the utility of all training types.

Health Facility Type
Female doctors were found to be less keen than males to be working in a CHC. Workers located in
HPs and in rural areas were also are less interested in the CHC attribute than their respective base
categories. Doctors who felt they had good housing were also more interested in being in a CHC
than the others, as do doctors who are better paid. Respondents who worked in facilities that lack
drugs and equipment were, however, less interested in going to a CHC.

Housing
Being female, married and living in a different district than one’s family and working in a CHC were
found to be characteristics that make housing more valuable. On the other hand, working in a HP
or in a rural area makes it less attractive. Doctors who have any housing value good housing less
than those with no housing provided, and those who already have good housing report similar
preferences to their base category (i.e. poor housing and no housing). Doctors with higher wages
valued housing less, and those in facilities lacking drugs and lack equipment valued it more.

Motorbike
While a motorbike is not valued in the all-sample regression, it does become valuable for doctors
who are married and those who have family in another district, especially if their family is in an
urban district. Respondents who have a motorbike reported that they value it very much, as
opposed to those who do not have one. This is the strongest relation regarding that feature,
although those who evaluated the level of equipment and the level of supervision as significant,
also valued motorbikes.

Wage
Wage was not valued in the main regression. However, the interaction terms revealed that it hides
a variety of conflicting opinions: older doctors valued wage positively and the same was true for
males, while female doctors’ coefficient was negative and strong (-0.003 per dollar). HP workers
and rural workers saw it as a good. Those doctors that received a letter from the local authorities
facilitating their entry to the programme and those with heavy workloads also valued wages
positively. Doctors with a higher wage also tended to give higher weight to the wage component of
jobs than their colleagues with lower wages.

5.3.3      Modelling

In order to know what variables are really important, it would have been necessary to include the
controls together to ascertain their respective importance. Doing so with interaction implies a
regression with the base, as well as 25 controls*11 interactions. Including all these in a maximum
likelihood search leads to no convergence and is beyond the scope of this report.

5.4         Multivariate Analysis for Nurses and Midwives

5.4.1       Basic Results

The Regression Results
The first basic regression had all positive coefficients, except that a good level of equipment is
negative (but not different from 0) and not stronger than a medium level of equipment. Unlike for
doctors, the wage had a positive coefficient of 0.0012 per dollar. The difference between the wage
levels was US$ 95, which corresponds to a ‘coefficient’ of 0.12, i.e. almost the same as remote
location or equipment. Location matters too: a remote area was preferred to both urban and
extremely remote locations, but urban was significantly preferred to extremely remote. CHCs, good
housing (over poor housing) and motorbike (over no motorbike) also had positive coefficients
significantly different from zero.

These results are robust to the exclusion of those who systematically picked either job A or job B.
By taking into account the fact that many health workers would refuse both jobs, however, the
results are slightly changed. This is discussed in the subsection on ‘ Robustness check of
nurses/midwives’ in Annex C.

Reading the MRS Table
A description of how to read an MRS table is in Section 5.3. The full MRS table for nurses and
midwives can be found below (based on the all-sample regression). The table contains too much
information to be described in detail. However, it should be noted that since wage was positively
valued by nurses and midwives, the last column indicates the value of each item (compared to
their base level). This is much more intuitive than the MRS between non-monetary items.

Policy Implications
All variables are relevant in some way and could help to design an optimal medical staff
compensation package. As the stated interest is to make remote or extremely remote work
locations more attractive to health workers, this item will be discussed in more detail. However, it
should be stressed that urban location seems to be less desired than remote location, although it is
found to be more appreciated that an extremely remote location. The policy question then
becomes how to attract nurses and midwives to extremely remote places.

According to the model, there are several options in terms of encouraging nurses/midwives to
leave urban locations for extremely remote places. The value of an urban location is estimated at a
wage difference of US$ 56 per month. Several items have a larger value: for example, nurses and
midwives would agree to give up US$ 102 per month in order to secure a medium level of
equipment (instead of poor). Having a motorbike or good housing in an extremely remote location
would make the extremely remote location more attractive than the urban one (if the urban job
does not have a motorbike/good housing).

It would be more difficult to incentivize health workers to move from remote locations to extremely
remote locations, as its value is found to be much higher at US$ 103 per month, which is about the
same value as medium-level equipment compared to poor equipment. Only a motorbike (US$ 113)
and workshops (US$ 191) were more valued.

Table 39 below gives the percentage of nurses and midwives who would pick an urban job over
the other attribute listed. Only 10.49 % of nurses and midwives would pick an urban location while
89% would prefer a remote work. It doesn’t seem that there is a shortage of nurses and midwives
keen to work in remote areas: it is the nurses and midwives’ preferr ed work location. Rather, the
lack of interest is for extremely remote areas, which would attract only 1 health worker in a
thousandth in the absence of corrective policies. The most effective policy to make extremely

remote areas attractive would include workshops (95%), followed by providing a motorbike (78%
would go), medium level equipment (73%) and provision of good housing (64%).

5.4.2      Multivariate Analysis

Similar to the analysis with doctors, a few control variables related to nurses and midwives’
personal situation were selected including, studies, medical experience and their medical situation
(see Table 41). Their stated preferences were avoided, as they are in the same field as the DCE
and the preference effect might be diluted between the job choice and the stated preferences.

The single control regression results for the nurses and midwives are included in Annex A. These
single control regressions can be seen as descriptive statistics reporting the mean preference by
groups of health workers. The main features of the regression results are outlined below, by
attribute.

Location
Overall, nurses and midwives preferred remote areas and urban areas to extremely remote
locations. This was true especially for those who own a house or are provided with good housing,
are married and are already in rural areas. Nurses and midwives that earn more money tended to
avoid extremely remote locations. Being in a HP or in a CHC was rather associated with a negative
preference for an urban location.

Equipment
A preference for good or medium-level equipment was positively related with nurses and midwives’
age and medical experience, particularly if they were female and married. CHC workers valued it
much more than those assigned to HPs, even though rural health facility staff were keener to
report a high value on equipment. Health workers with good personal conditions (i.e. a
motorbike/good housing) placed more emphasis on the value of equipment at a job. Conversely,
high earners tended to put less value on equipment. Difficult working conditions, however, made
equipment more valuable: heavy workload along with a lack of drugs, equipment and supervision
resulted in a higher value on the material conditions of the work place.

Training
Older nurses and midwives, as well as those with more medical experience, tended to be more
interested in any kind of training. Females were more interested than males in attending
workshops. Nurses put a higher value on training than midwives, who seemed to be indifferent
regarding that aspect. Rural facility health workers were significantly more willing to finish their

bachelor degree. Health workers working in a different district than their families did not particularly
value training and workshops. High satisfaction rates were associated with a lower level of interest
in training. Nurses and midwives that had higher salaries were less interested in bachelor’s
degrees. This reflects the fact that they already have a degree, as wage is set based on the
number of years passed at nursing school and not on experience or market power.

Health Facility Type
Nurses, midwives and older, married females preferred working in CHCs. Home owners preferred
working in HPs or hospitals over CHCs. There seemed to be a strong effect based on where the
respondent currently worked: health workers in HPs favoured the HP facility type over CHCs, while
CHC workers preferred CHC facilities.

Housing
Midwives were less interested in good housing than nurses. Health workers with motorbikes
preferred housing significantly more than those without one. Difficult working conditions (i.e. lack of
drugs and supervision, heavy workload, lower satisfaction) were correlated with a greater
appreciation of housing.

Motorbikes
Motorbikes were more appreciated by nurses (compared to midwives) that are older, more
experienced, married, male, who live in the same district as their family, and are in HPs. Those
who have a motorbike already had a very large and positive coefficient, while those who did not
have one seemed to be indifferent to that attribute.

Wage
A higher wage was found to be positive. The factors associated positively with higher wage were
age, experience, being male, being a nurse (compared to a midwife), being married and owning a
house, being in the same district as family, working in a CHC in a rural area, not being provided

6          Competence of Physicians: Findings from the Direct
           Clinical Observations and Vignettes
This section outlines the results of the DCOs and vignettes. Medical doctors scored 92% in
attitudes, 57% in history taking, 28% in physical examination, 69% in treatment accuracy
and 50% in health education. The average total score was 62%. Working in urban health
centres and time taken for consultation were two factors that were statistically significant
as the determinants of clinical performance. The lack of knowledge of the doctors was
significantly associated with non-performance. However, the lack of motivation and lack of
equipment and supplies in the health facilities were not statistically significant.


6.1        Characteristics of the DCO and Vignette Cases
The field team observed 635 cases, of which 255 (40.31%) were in urban and 379 (59.69%) were
in rural areas. In terms of the types of health facility, the team observed 128 case-patients at
hospitals, 305 cases at CHCs and 199 cases at HPs (see Table 42).

Patients who were observed in DCOs were mostly visiting outpatient departments (98%). The rest
of the sample was in emergency (0.7%) and in inpatient (0.9%) departments. The primary
symptoms of the patients were fever (12%), cough (27%), diarrhoea (5%), and other (56%). In
addition, each sampled doctor examined three vignette cases with three chief complaints – fever,
cough, and diarrhoea. The team obtained 193 ‘case’ observations in vignettes.

6.2        Doctors’ Characteristics
Seventy-one general doctors participated in this component of the study. They were working in
three different types of healthcare facility: hospitals (19%), CHCs (42%) and HPs (34%). The
health care facilities were located in both urban (38%) and rural (62%) areas of Timor-Leste. The
average age of the doctors was 30 years.

6.3        Clinical Performance
The scoring system was based on the criteria described in the observation tool, then analysed into
two categories: DCO and vignette. The intent was to compare actual clinical performance and
knowledge by using two different methods to assess clinical quality among doctors in Timor-Leste.
(Leonard & Masatu, 2005). In this regard, DCOs describe what doctors do in their daily practice,
while the purpose of the vignettes was to measure their competency.

Figure 26 describes the average clinical performance of all observations. The total score was
broken down into five components: attitude, history taking, physical examination, treatment, and
health education. The overall clinical performance of the general practitioners was very good in
terms of attitude and moderate in regard to history taking, health education and treatment.
However, the average physical examination performance score was extremely low compared to
other areas.

Lack of examination tools was suspected to be the reason for the apparent underperformance in
regard to physical examinations. Some health care facilities do not even have any examination
beds, blood pressure monitors (sphygmomanometer) or thermometers, making it seemingly
impossible to do complete physical examinations.

A more specific description of the score, based on the method used (DCO or vignette), is below.
DCOs and vignettes were compared based on the score of each component one by one. The
significant statistical difference in regard to history taking, treatment, and also health education
between DCO and vignettes can be seen in Table 45.

* Significant

The significant difference that was found in the total score indicates that doctors did less with real
patients than they did in simulated cases. This means that overall, doctors have better knowledge
and skills than they actually demonstrated in their daily clinical practice (Aung, et al., 2012).

Contrary to findings in relation to total score, the treatment scores were better for DCOs than for
vignettes. There are some possible causes of this unusual result. First, in the vignettes the
scenario, diagnosis and appropriate treatment were predetermined, based on the guidelines. In the
DCOs, however, the cases varied a great deal. In those cases, the appropriateness of treatment
was based on the knowledge of the medical researchers. The expectations regarding the
appropriateness of treatment were higher in vignettes compared to DCOs. For example, in the
vignette diarrhea case, doctors were expected to prescribe zinc and implement fluid replacement
therapy for dehydration; some of the doctors did not meet those criteria. Second, the limited
availability of drugs in health facilities was a factor. Doctors could only prescribe the drugs they had
available, regardless of the ideal treatment for a particular disease. For example, Promethazine – a
first-generation antihistamine – was often prescribed, no matter what the diagnosis was.
Respondents said this was because the only drug available was Promethazine. In the vignette, on

the other hand, they were free to prescribe any drugs they thought suitable for the case,
irrespective of actual availability.

For history taking and health education, better scores were achieved in the vignettes, consistent
with the total score mentioned before. The primary reason was that the quantity of time spent on
the vignette was longer than they had for DCOs. Vignettes were carried out after doctors had
finished their work. With no real patients to see they automatically had more spare time to do the
vignettes than the DCOs. Another reason was that, in the vignette, the team members sometimes
interrupted and reminded doctors when they forget to do a section (mostly relating to health
education). The vignette allowed the team to ascertain their knowledge level and assess their
ability.

The mean, standard deviation and the range of the DCO and vignettes scores are tabulated in
Table 46and Table 47.

6.4        Attitude
The attitude of doctors was generally very good. Figure 27 shows the comparative score on the
attitude of the doctors towards patients.

In more than 80% of cases they welcomed and greeted the patients. They were very polite to their
patients, made eye contact and were empathetic. Almost all of the patients had a chair to sit on. In
this respect, there was no signifficant difference between vignettes and DCOs. Thus, doctors were
found to treat their patients appropriately, both in real and in simulated cases.

6.5        History Taking
Generally, doctors’ history taking performance was better in vignette cases, although there were
some questions that they asked more frequently in DCOs. The questions in the DCOs related to
the presence of a cough, sore throat and pain during swallowing, as well as social history inquiries.
In order to properly understand the DCO and vignette result, it is important to know that the most
febrile cases in DCO were common cold cases, which related to upper respiratory tract infection.
Whereas, the fever case in the vignette was malaria.

These two conditions have different signs and symptoms; in other words, they have very different
clinical presentations. Thus, in the DCOs doctors frequently asked questions about upper
respiratory tract symptoms (i.e. cough, sore throat, pain during swallowing) compared to the
vignettes. In addition, in the DCOs they also asked about social history, especially food that the
patients consumed before the onset of the illness.

Doctors’ performance on cough-related history taking was better in the vignettes than the DCOs.
However, the vignette case for cough was pulmonary TB, in contrast to the DCOs which were
dominated by common cold symptoms. This explains why specific questions for TB were asked
more frequently in vignettes than in DCOs (e.g. on weight loss and night sweats). This is similiar to
the fever-related history taking.

The history taking performace in regard to diarrhea was similar for DCOs and vignettes, which
means doctors used their knowledge well. Nearly all of the doctors asked about the duration,
frequency and consistency of the stools. The least asked questions in this section related to family
medical history, past medical history, and whether the patients had already received treatment for
the diarrhoea or not.

Figure 31 illustrates that almost all doctors performed at least one physical examination. However,
very few medical doctors performed all four vital sign checks (respiratory rate, blood pressure,
heart rate, temperature). As was mentioned before, many facilities were not equipped with

important diagnostic tools such as thermometers and blood pressure monitors. In the vignette,
doctors could simulate any examination they felt was needed, even when there were no actual
tools to use. For example, when they wanted to check the patient’s temperature but did not have a
thermometer they could substitute a pencil for a thermometer. This is probably why the
temperature checking rate was higher in vignettes than in DCOs. The other important finding
relates to hand-washing. The hand-washing rate in DCOs was slightly above 20% and for vignettes
it was below 10%. Doctors were expected to wash their hands before and after the physical
examination as it is a precautionary routine procedure in clinical practice. However, while some
facilities had handrub or handsoap and tap water other facilities did not, meaning doctors cannot
always perform hand-washing.

Figure 32 shows doctors’ physical examinations and diagnostic tests on fever cases in both DCOs
and vignettes. The percentage of doctors who adviced to carry out any relavent physical
examiation was below 20%. No routine diagnostic tests were advised in the DCOs. However, in
about 30% of vignettes, medical doctors adviced for a malaria test. No medical doctors did a widal
test in any of the DCOs or vignettes to rule out typhoid fever.

Figure 33 shows doctors’ physical examinations and diagnostic tests on cases presenting a cough.
In general, below 40% of cases were diagnosed using a physical examination. The diagnostic tests
were more prevalent in vignettes than DCOs. As the vignette case was TB, just above 30% of
doctors performed a sputum microscopic test, which is the main confirmation test for TB.

More than 80% of doctors explained the diagnosis, related appropriate health education, and built
a good realtionship with their patients. Overall the vignette cases were better than the DCOs, as
vignettes allowed doctors more time to communicate with their patients.

6.8        Determinant Factors of Clinical Performance
When clinical performance was distinguished by type of health facility, HPs had a negative
correlation with clinical performance. As discussed earlier in this report (Section 3), HPs are poorly
equipped. Therefore, doctors might face difficulties reaching the standards of ideal clinical practice.
Since CHCs and hospitals are much better equipped than HPs, they might allow better
performance than HPs.

Based on the regression results, the location of practice had a significant effect on doctors’ clinical
performance. Those working in a rural area were less skilled than their counterparts in urban
areas. It is also evident from another study (Ziller & Lenardson, 2009) that, even though the
government has provided housing and transportation facilities, doctors working in rural areas face
many difficulties in their daily life. Sometimes they run out of water and electricity both in their
houses and clinics and it is difficult for them to travel due to ruined roads. Moreover, supplies of
medical equipment, stocks of drugs and also the number of medical professionals in rural areas
are limited. These factors may all contribute to doctors’ clinical performance.

The time taken for clinical consultation also had a significant association. The clinical performance
was better in cases where the consultation periods were longer than in others. The average
consultation time per case was eight minutes. Medical doctors spent less time in DCOs (six
minutes) compared to vignettes (10 minutes), which is a statistically significant difference (p=
<0.05).

To find lack of performance causes, a non-quality score was generated from the inverted DCO and
vignette consolidated score. The causes of non-quality were then categorised by three factors: (i)
physicians do not know, as can be checked with the inverse of vignettes score for each physician,
(ii) physicians cannot do, because lack of equipment and supplies, as measured by the health
facility survey, and (iii) physicians do not want, as measured by the lack of motivation reported in
health worker survey.

As shown in Table 49 and Figure 36, lack of knowledge of the medical doctors had a significant
relationship to their performance. However, lack of motivation and lack of equipment and supplies
in the health facilities were not significantly associated with the non-quality (i.e. lack of
performance) of the doctors (Figure 37 and Figure 38).

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste



7          Conclusions
This study is the first of its kind since Timor-Leste’s independence and provides useful insights into
current and future challenges. The study has combined a number of research tools to produce a
rich dataset on the state of health facilities, health worker characteristics, experiences and
preferences, as well as competencies and performance. The findings across the reports are
generally consistent with each other and indicate strong correlation on causal factors.

The findings are described in the report and can be further triangulated in the future in order to
generate useful policy advice for the government of Timor-Leste. This section highlights some
areas with potential policy implications.

7.1        Policy Implications

Functionality of Rural HPs
The survey has brought to light some of the challenges of bringing Timor-Leste’ rural health
infrastructure up to standard. The availability of a fixed water source and stable power supply is
strongly associated with the tier of health facility: availability is lowest for HPs, followed by CHCs.
Hospitals have the most stable power supplies and fixed water sources. A significant percentage of
rural HPs did not have access to a permanent water source and only one-third of all HPs always
have access to electricity (from a variety of sources). During the seven days preceding the survey,
only 39% of all facilities had uninterrupted electricity. A considerable percentage of CHCs and HPs
did not have any functioning means of communication. There is no form of privacy (private room,
visual or audio privacy) in 58% of HPs. Only 43% of HPs are equipped to sterilise metal
equipment. The availability of 11 supply items was consistently lower in rural facilities; pulse
oximeters and oxygen cylinders were particularly scarce. The availability of a selection of 23
antibiotics and antimalarials decreased by tier of health facility (barring two exceptions); availability
was lowest in HPs. The HPs also offered fewer services than CHCs and hospitals. A comparison
of expected service delivery and actual service delivery at that level has not yet been undertaken.

These findings highlight the urgency of equipping HPs, in particular, to mandated standards. This
effort will not only improve patient care but also help to retain health staff and improve their
performance. Some of the differences between the knowledge and practice of health workers, as
evidenced by vignettes and observations, may well be attributed to the lack of necessary
infrastructure and equipment at the HP level.

Implications for Pay Policies
One of the interesting findings of the study is the relative lack of importance of wages for doctors.
This is in line with a number of recent DCEs in other countries, although it should be noted that
most were conducted with medical students, who are likely to have different priorities to more
seasoned professionals. In Ghana, a study found that a relatively high value was placed on
housing and workplace attributes, as compared with increases in salary (Kruk, et al., 2010).
Studies from Kenya and South Africa suggested that better educational opportunities or rural
allowances would be most effective in increasing the uptake of rural posts while in Thailand better
health insurance coverage would have the greatest impact (Blaauw, et al., 2010). Finally, in
Tanzania, a recent study found that offering continuing education after a certain period of service is
one of the most powerful recruitment instruments the authorities have available, although
increased salaries and hardship allowances will also substantially increase recruitment in rural
areas (Kolstad, 2011).

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


In the Timor-Leste context, young doctors may see themselves as already better off (with a salary
of US$ 610 per month) compared to other civil servants. In that case, their preference for
professional development opportunities as opposed to increased wages may be reasonable.
Although there are concerns about low salaries, very few health workers appear to be planning to
change jobs in the short term, and intrinsic motivation is high. Salaries are received regularly and
dual practice opportunities appear to be low.

It also appears that the public policy on wage raise for health professionals is not fully functioning
and the current civil service wage structure is not related to performance. It is difficult to predict
whether having a performance based reward system would be effective or not in this context as it
will be dependent on the progression of competing opportunities including private sector
development and even overseas opportunities.

Nevertheless, it is important to review salary progression over time to ensure that there are
incentives to stay motivated and perform to or above standards, given the relatively flat salary
progression for doctors (but not nurses and midwives) highlighted in this report.

Training Policies
The survey has highlighted some apparent anomalies in relation to training. Namely, that despite
reporting being able to do their job and having received relatively recent training in most cases, the
majority of respondents reported that they have not had enough opportunities to improve their
knowledge. It is important to understand these results more deeply. It may be that the quality of the
training was not satisfactory, or that there is a mismatch in terms of the type of training available
(for example, although a large number of doctors are in rural areas, only 19% underwent training
on community health, while 75% of doctors indicate that they require training on IMCI and 64% on
EmONC). Additional training may also be valued for other attributes, such as per diems or time
away from work.

Training is a powerful job attribute that appears to determine job choice, including location. The
fact that urban health workers enjoy more training adds to the attraction of urban jobs. Access to
training should therefore be determined by both training needs and the incentive it provides (e.g.
rural/urban). Younger doctors, female doctors and those in CHCs and HPs tend to value training
more. Providing specialisation options may well be highly effective in retaining doctors in rural
areas.

Rural Attraction and Retention
HPs are clearly regarded by many as a starting point for their career, as only 30% of HP staff
reported a desire to continue at that level long term (compared to 60% of staff at CHCs). Although
the DCE results are difficult to interpret, they show that non-financial job attributes can be traded to
make rural jobs more attractive. Training (both visits from specialists and a higher probability of
specialisation), as well as providing housing, better equipment and transport, would convince more
doctors and other staff to take up and remain in rural service. Women, unmarried doctors, those
who have worked in HPs, and those with a letter of recommendation from their local authority
appear to be more receptive to working in remote or very remote areas.

At present, in-kind benefits do appear to be more targeted at rural postings, but it is important to
ensure that supportive supplies (e.g. fuel for motorbikes) are adequate and timely. Improved
security and more consistent feedback and supervision would also address the challenges
commonly raised across the workforce as a whole.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


Planning for the Workforce
There are a number of issues surrounding health workforce planning that have emerged from the
study. Sixty percent of the sampled health workers were based in urban locations. Planners need
to consider whether this reflects the desired workforce allocation and, if not, how to change it. In
particular, it is striking that nurses and midwives are more focused in urban areas than doctors,
which may not be appropriate.

The fact that the current cohort of doctors were largely recruited at one time (after independence)
may also pose challenges in the future, as they are likely to seek advancement and retirement
around the same time, leaving possible gaps. This ‘cohort’ effect can be mitigated by implementing
a human resources for health planning exercise to determine how many health workers, by cadre,
will be required in the future, at each facility tier. This will inform the need for further training of
doctors, and identify the number of current doctors who would be able to transition to higher-level
facilities.

Improving Performance
The areas that were low-performing in the vignettes and observed cases should be investigated
further to understand how performance can be improved, beyond addressing the infrastructure and
equipment challenges highlighted above. In particular, the low scores for physical examinations
and the relative absence of hygiene precautions such as hand washing should be examined and
addressed through training, supervision and mentoring. These efforts should be focused on, but
not exclusive to rural areas and HPs. Health workers desire for additional training in the health
worker survey, in-service training being a significant attribute in DCE and the narrow know-do gap
in DCO and vignette – these all commonly indicate a lack of knowledge of health workers.

Compliance to Clinical Protocols
The survey findings suggested that doctors’ knowledge was better than their practice, and since
the consultation time was one of the significant determinants, it can be assumed that the clinical
performance of doctors can be improved by ensuring compliance with clinical protocols. This can
be achieved by regular in-service training, monitoring and active performance management.

Workload
The workload of the doctors working in Timor-Leste is not too high. On average the doctors in
hospitals, CHCs and HPs consult 13, 11 and 9 patients respectively which is low compared to
other countries. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians survey 2013, on
average family physicians consult 19 patients per day.6 In UK, GPs typically consult 30-40 patients
in a day.7 A nationally representative health facility survey in Bangladesh reported a mean of 37
patients per health worker at the sub district level health facilities (FMRP, 2005). However, a
significant percentage of the health workers have reported that they are over-worked. It is
important to investigate the reasons behind this perception. It is possible that the health workers
are often busy with administrative work. It is also important to manage the expectation of the
workload.

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


7.2        Recommendations
Based on the important policy implications discussed above, recommendations have been grouped
into three broad themes and priority areas identified for Timor-Leste’s health workforce policy and
planning.

Ensure Policy Compliance at All Levels
        1. Service availability should match Basic Service Package (BSP): The survey found
           that health facilities, particularly the rural ones often lacked services and facilities that
           they are mandated in the BSP. Ensuring policy compliance to BSP will not only maintain
           the consistency of the services across the sector, but will also improve the functionality
           of the rural health facilities which will eventually encourage health workers to stay
           motivated to work in rural areas.

        2. Availability of medicines should comply with the Essential Drug List (EDL): The
           drug supplies were frequently inconsistent with the EDL recommendation. Complying
           with the list may improve health service delivery, as it would likely reduce the chance of
           stock-outs and misuse of drugs. However, it is possible that there is a functioning
           decentralised mechanism in place, which is not fully compliant to the central polity, but is
           effective. This needs to be investigated before implementing this recommendation.

        3. Clinical guidelines should be enforced: Enforcing clinical guidelines may increase the
           performance of doctors. The following issues should be considered when forming policy
           implementation strategies. First, changing practice usually requires a lot of effort.
           Second, since some practitioners lack some basic knowledge, the clinical guidelines,
           which are mostly practice oriented, may not be fully effective. And finally, the clinical
           guidelines on all relevant topics might not be available or updated.

Strengthen the Health Human Resource Policy
        4. Ensure salary progression for doctors: The data revealed that the salary difference
           between the junior and senior doctors was very narrow. This may demotivate
           experienced health workers and cause them to leave the public sector or engage in dual
           practice, if opportunities arise. A clear salary progression policy will keep health workers
           motivated to serve in the public sector and will also encourage better performance.

        5. Provide necessary trainings for health workers: The overall low score on clinical
           competence and the narrow know-do gap indicates lack of knowledge of the doctors in
           Timor-Leste, especially in rural areas. Regular in-service training and instructional visits
           from specialists are highly recommended for health workers so that the competence
           level is increased. This will also improve the confidence of young health workers and
           motivate them to stay in rural areas.

        6. Improve the effectiveness of supervision: While the supervision visits were frequent,
           it was revealed that, in most cases, these visits were mostly concerned with checking
           official records. More efficient supervision and monitoring tools and exercises are
           recommended so that these visits are more meaningful and action oriented.

        7. Adjust the expectations of health workers on their workload: Nearly half of the
           respondents reported to have high workload. However, the average number of patients
           consulted as observed during the survey did not reflect that statement. It might be useful

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


             to better understand the reason behind this statement and adjust the workload
             expectation by establishing clear terms of reference for the work.

Improve the Functionality of Health Facilities
        8. Improve the pharmaceutical chain of procurement and distribution: The survey
           results indicate a loosely functioning pharmaceutical chain with an incoherent distribution
           mechanism. Implementation of a demand driven strong pharmaceutical procurement and
           disbursement system in which demand will be raised in a bottom-up process and a
           sequential distribution mechanism is recommended.

        9. Improve availability of medical supplies: The rural health facilities were frequently
           under-equipped and many health workers expressed this as one of the important
           attributes to decide workplace. Improving availability of the medical supplies in health
           facilities will improve the service delivery and at the same time will enhance the rural
           retention of health workers.

        10. Improve infrastructure and the access to water, electricity and communication:
            Many rural facilities lacked basic infrastructure including access to water, electricity and
            communication. Improving the infrastructure will optimise the service delivery and rural
            retention. An inter-sectoral initiative, involving the other concerned ministries, is
            recommended to identify and prioritize potential development areas, and improve the
            infrastructure of health facilities, including the accommodation of health workers.




7.3        Further Studies
Further research/ studies will broaden the understanding on the topic and will also answer some of
the causal relationships (answering “why?”) of the study results. These are:

         1. Assess the training gaps: Further studies can be carried out to understand the
            training gap of the doctors working in Timor-Leste. This will not only help to understand
            the need for training for the existing health workers but will also guide adjustments to
            the medical curriculum, so that the future health workforce is adequately trained.

         2. Migration and exit to private sector: Migration to other countries and exit to the
            private sector may emerge as a problem in future. Moving forward, this potential
            development should be monitored using the M&E data.

         3. Absenteeism and dual practice: Because unannounced visits to the health facilities
            were not made, the reported prevalence on absenteeism and dual practice may be
            underestimated. Further studies can be carried out to better understand these issues.

         4. Pharmaceutical distribution: Since it was beyond the scope of the study, the nature
            and extent of the malfunctioning pharmaceutical chain was not fully explored. However,
            initial findings suggest that there are some concerns in this area. A qualitative study
            should be conducted to better understand the issues with pharmaceutical distribution in
            Timor-Leste.

         5. Preference of health workers in terms of rural posting : Some health workers,
            especially nurses and midwives preferred rural posting over urban. A follow-up

Health Worker Survey in Timor-Leste


              qualitative study, to understand the reasons for this preference, will enhance
              understanding and may be useful for the future scale-up of health worker deployment
              policy.

         6. Follow-up survey to monitor the trend over years: The health sector in Timor-Leste
            is rapidly changing. Some of the findings and the policy implications may change in
            future because of this rapidly changing context. A follow-up survey using a similar
            methodology should be conducted in 3-5 years to monitor the trend over time and to
            adopt the policies accordingly.

7.4        Way Forward
This survey has highlighted some of the important policy areas that can be addressed to better
manage the health workforce in Timor-Leste and ensure better health service to the population,
particularly in rural areas. The Ministry of Health can consider prioritising the above mentioned
recommendations and can group them into short, medium and long-term initiatives.

We also suggest disseminating these research findings to the appropriate audience and organising
policy dialogues so that the recommendations from this survey can be taken into consideration for
appropriate policy implementation.

Annex C               Additional Information on DCE Analysis

Design of the choice set

Main effects

There were seven attributes and 19 levels for the DCE of the medical doctors. All the possible jobs
combinations summed up to a total of 864, which is the full factorial design. However, there are 12
main effect to estimates (i.e. 12 differences within attributes) and that the choice set will be
saturated with only 13 choices made: at least 13 choices will have to be observed to capture the
main effect.

Number of Choice Sets

If we wanted to have a fully orthogonal and balanced array, we would need 72 choices, i.e. a
multiple of 9 (for the uneven number of levels attributes) and 8 (to account for the even). This
would guarantee an efficiency of 100%. However, handling 72 choice sets in the field for such a
survey would not be practical. We decided to work with only 16 sets. This choice works well for the
multiple attributes with 2 levels. However, the balance and orthogonality will not be fully enforced
for the attributes with three levels: there are 18 violations of balance and orthogonality, which
makes the D-efficiency fall from 100% to 96.15%. It is not dramatic. Asking a respondent to make
18 choices would decrease the number of violation to only 10 and increase the D-efficiency to
97.1%. However, this would lengthen the questionnaire and it was decided not to increase the
questionnaire.

Restrictions

Another component to include is that some combinations of attributes are very unlikely and would
make the responses incoherent. Indeed, location level “extremely remote” and facility type
“Community Health Centre” will never go together and having this suggestion would add some
confusion. A maximisation of the efficiency was then found on the constraint that these items are
never combined. This further lowers the D-efficiency of the orthogonal array to 93.1%

The reader will be interested to know that combining location and health facility into 5 levels would
give a smaller factorial, but a greater number of main effect (saturation point: 14). The optimal
orthogonal array would count 120 choices (against 72). In terms of efficiency: The D-efficiency for
16 choices would be 93.9, i.e. 0.8% more efficient than when we split that elements and add the
restriction in the design. It was decided to split them and ask the respondent to make choices on
location and facility type separately and avoid confusion.

Creating the Choice Set

The program SAS and it's macro %mkt* were used to perform the computations and design the
choice set. First, the most orthogonal array (i.e. to account for the restrictions) was selected using
the %mktEx macro (i.e. the full factorial design without the restricted cases). Using this array, the
jobs were selected and associated in pair by the %choiceff. The algorythm, of the fedorov type that
search many possible combinations and pick the best local maximum as overall maximum. Here,
choiceff maximizes the variance of the parameters. Not necessarily by assuming a linear model to
capture the main effect.

SAS version 9.2 onward gives the D-efficiency criteria for all the proposed options. However, this
task was performed using SAS 9.0.The task was repeated several times as to obtain the best
efficiency.



Monotone Preference Annex
The table below displays the percentage of HW that choose job A over job B. It is also well
balanced: most health workers alternate their choices: only 3.6% of the workers systematically
picked only job A or only job B. About 90% of the HW selected between 3 and 13 job As (out of
16). It is good practice in DCE to withdraw HWs who systematically picked one job from the
analysis.

Both Jobs Refusal Analysis
The same analysis was performed for the refusal rate. Twenty-seven percent of the HWs
interviewed did not discard both jobs for any sets. On the upper bend, 2.04% rejected both jobs for
all sets. For the robustness check, the regressions will include a specification where those who
would have refused all jobs in all sets are considered as if they accepted all. Another specification
will include the refusal rate of only those who refused fewer than half the sets.

Attribute Dominance Analysis
It is possible that some HWs made their choices based on the level of one attribute only. Although
this preference might be genuine, they must be flagged and reported. The table below shows the
percentage of HW that consistently chose the level indicated (when available) over other options
available. The number of occurrence of each level in a choice set where it can be chosen over
another level of the same attribute are displayed in the columns “N”. Attributes’ leve ls that are often
dominant (high percentage) and that have high number of appearance are considered as
dominant. The MDs show a strong dominance for the higher probability of specialization, even if
the number of occurrence is small (4). Visits from specialists and practice in a community health
centre (CHC) also are dominant in 17% and 13% of the cases. Nurses and midwives did not show
a specific pattern, dominance is either small or has too few occurrences to back it up.

MD Robustness Checks
As was highlighted in the descriptive statistics section, some HWs would have refused the jobs and
maybe the choice. This can influence the interpretation of the results and deserves interest. The
possibility that respondents paid less attention to these sets with two unattractive jobs, or that they
randomly picked one cannot be discounted. It would not be unusual to believe that they refused
both because neither has appeal and therefore, no real trade-off is to be made.

Adding to the regression the crude variable for whether both jobs would be refused is not possible
in the context of a fixed effect regression, since most of the effect would be captured by the fixed

effect. To understand better how the refusal plays out, those choices could be dropped, however,
this would reduce the number of appearance of some jobs or items more than other and the
orthogonal array created for the DCE would lose its properties.

Approximately 500 jobs were analysed (i.e. 1,000 observations). The findings are robust to the use
of a less stringent definition of “both job refusal”, by not excluding those emanating from doctors
who reported they would refuse all the sets (reg bis) or those who would refuse more than 50% of
the sets (reg ter). The preference reported for the non-refusal jobs are markedly different: remote
areas become less attractive than extremely remote, and good equipment.

It was preferable to decompose the effect of each DCE attribute into the effect of the MDs that
thought they wouldn’t refuse both and those who would. Concretely, the DCE attributes were
interacted with the refusal variables. Those who would have picked one of the jobs now display a
positive coefficient on wage, a negative coefficient on remote (and therefore would prefer
extremely remote), are less interested in visits from specialists, find a positive utility in having a
motorbike and are extremely satisfied to be working in a CHC (highest coefficient). The sets that
would be refused were dragging up the remoteness coefficient, while pulling the CHC down.

Robustness Check of Nurses/Midwives
As was highlighted in the descriptive statistics section, some HWs would have refused the jobs and
maybe the choice. As for the MDs, the regressions with interaction terms for the set containing jobs
that would both be refused are reported here.

Preferences for jobs that would not be refused are different: location preference against extremely
remote places is stronger. Medium good equipment is not different from zero anymore, while good
equipment becomes very important. Housing and motorbike become more important. But the
positive coefficients on workshops, bachelor degree, CHC workplace and wage are all driven by
sets that would be refused. There is little robustness to the inclusion of the refusal of sets for these
items. However, the direction of preferences for the location, motorbike and housing items are
stable and the fact that these attributes are valued is robust.

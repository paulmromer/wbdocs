II. Methodology
Between June and July 2014, 201 stakeholders of the WBG in Madagascar were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors
working on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 101 stakeholders participated in the
survey (50% response rate).
Respondents received and returned questionnaires via email or courier services. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Madagascar; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Madagascar; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Madagascar: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   Madagascar is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): their familiarity with the WBG, its
   effectiveness in Madagascar, WBG staff preparedness to help Madagascar solve its
   development challenges, the WBG’s local presence, its collaboration with the UN, the
   WBG’s capacity building in Madagascar, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Madagascar, and in which sectoral areas
   the WBG should focus most of its resources.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Madagascar, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Madagascar’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the extent the WBG helps build existing country systems, the importance for the
   WBG to be involved in thirty four development areas, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness
   across these areas, such as public sector governance/reform, education, peace and stability,
   domestic private sector development, and rural development.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is adequately staffed locally and the contribution of the WBG’s
   technical assistance to solving Madagascar’s development challenges.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Madagascar: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Madagascar and which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country. They were asked what areas the
   country would benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would
   benefit most from other donors. Respondents were asked what the WBG should do to
   improve collaboration with the UN in the field.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Madagascar, which WBG agencies they work with, their geographic locations, and
   whether they think that the IFC and the World Bank work well together.

  Given the large number of respondents specializing in education, private sector development, and public sector
governance, cross-sectoral analyses were conducted to examine if respondents from these three sectors dominated
the overall responses to the multiple choice questions about development priorities and sectoral areas which can
contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the country.

      Respondents across stakeholder groups and sectoral focuses all tended to agree that
       “energy? and “domestic private sector development? are the greatest contributors to
       Madagascar’s economic growth.
      More than a quarter of respondents also indicated that “anti corruption? is a top
       contributor to Madagascar’s economic growth. Among these respondents, those who are
       from CSOs, private sector/financial sector/private banks, ministries, PMUs and
       consultants working on WBG projects were significantly more likely to believe so than
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.

       likely to indicate that “energy? is the greatest contributor to Madagascar’s economic
       growth.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
      There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’ ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in “foreign direct investment.? Respondents from ministries, PMUs, and
       consultants working on WBG projects had the highest ratings, whereas respondents from
       media had significantly lower ratings.
      Respondents across sectoral focuses gave statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in all areas.
      Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 62) that primarily
       informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
       “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
       areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Madagascar,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty four
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Madagascar.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets; and,
               The WBG’s effectiveness at decentralization.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Madagascar, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets;
               The WBG’s effectiveness economic growth;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic privates sector development;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
               The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

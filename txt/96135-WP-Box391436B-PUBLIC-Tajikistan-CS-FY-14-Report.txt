I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding of how
        stakeholders in Tajikistan perceive the WBG;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Tajikistan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Tajikistan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the WBG in Tajikistan;
            Overall impressions of the WBG’s effectiveness and results, knowledge work and
               activities, and communication and information sharing in Tajikistan;
            Perceptions of the WBG’s future role in Tajikistan.
       Use data to help inform Tajikistan country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In January-February 2014, 475 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Tajikistan were invited
to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations;
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; and other organizations. A total of 272 stakeholders participated in the survey (57%
response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier and returned it accordingly. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Tajikistan; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Tajikistan; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing in
Tajikistan.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Tajikistan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Tajikistan is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   in Tajikistan, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved in Tajikistan.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Tajikistan, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Tajikistan solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner in Tajikistan. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and
   weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Tajikistan, with
   which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, and in which sectoral areas the
   WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services) in Tajikistan.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent
   to which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Tajikistan, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Tajikistan’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments,
   and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across twenty-six development areas, such as economic
   growth, governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Tajikistan: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Tajikistan.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues in Tajikistan and how they prefer
   to receive information from the WBG. Respondents were also asked about their level of
   agreement that they know how to find information from the WBG, that the WBG’s websites
   are easy to navigate and useful, that the WBG is responsive to information requests, and that
   the WBG provides sufficient public information in local languages.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Tajikistan, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 121 respondents (91% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from multilateral agencies were
        combined with respondents from bilateral agencies; respondents from private sector
        organizations were combined with those from the financial sector/private banks;
        respondents from NGOs, community based organizations, trade unions, and private
        foundations were combined into the “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the
        office of a minister, the office of a parliamentarian, PMUs, and independent government
        institutions were included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the
        office of the President, the office of the Prime Minister, and consultants/contractors
        working on WBG-supported projects.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Dushanbe. Because of the
        small number of respondents from other areas, these locations were combined under the
        “Other? category for all further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 70). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings of the
        WBG’s effectiveness across most of these twenty-six development areas in Tajikistan.
        For the most part, respondents from local governments, bilateral/multilateral agencies,
        and CSOs tended to give higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness, whereas
        respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to give significantly
        lower ratings.
       There were significant differences across geographic locations in respondents’ ratings of
        the WBG’s effectiveness across all of these twenty-six development areas. Respondents
        from Dushanbe tended to give significantly lower ratings than respondents from other
        geographic locations.
       There were significant differences in ratings of stakeholders who professionally
        collaborate/work with the WBG and those who do not collaborate/work with the WBG
        across eleven of these twenty-six development areas. For the most part, respondents who
        professionally collaborate/work with the WBG tended to give lower ratings for the
        WBG’s effectiveness than those who do not. Those areas with significant differences
        were:
             “Information and communications technology?;
             “Transport?;
             “Gender equity?;
             “Private sector development?;
             “Foreign direct investment?;
             “Trade and exports?;
             “Economic growth?;
             “Energy?;
             “Job creation/employment?;
             “Equality of opportunity?; and
             “Global/regional integration?.
       Education specialists (who comprise 19 percent of the sample) gave statistically similar
        ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in the education sector as compared to other
        respondents.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 51) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups, geographic locations, and levels of collaboration
        with the WBG can be found in the Appendix.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Tajikistan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Tajikistan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Tajikistan, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Tajikistan
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of agreement
        that the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Tajikistan and that its work is
        aligned with what stakeholders consider the development priorities for the country
        compared to respondents in the FY ’03 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement across
        all of these areas of the WBG’s work. Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies
        tended to have the highest levels of agreement, whereas respondents from
        academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to have significantly lower levels of
        agreement.
       Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with these statements (including the indicator questions).
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly higher
        levels of agreement with the indicator statement “Overall the WBG currently plays a
        relevant role in development in Tajikistan? than respondents who do not collaborate/work
        with the WBG.

* Shared prosperity – The World Bank Group aims to promote income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in
each country. This involves achieving economic growth which is inclusive of all sections of the society. Inclusion demands equity
so that it becomes the focus point. The incomes of the bottom 40 percent of a nation’s population will be tracked through a n ew
Shared Prosperity Indicator; the GDP growth data alone is not sufficient.

Executive Summary
Limited state capacity to carry out core government and service delivery functions poses a
major constraint in postconflict countries, especially those with low income levels. There are
multiple avenues for strengthening or re-developing overall public service capacity. The purpose
of this note is to explore one of these avenues—public sector training institutes—in depth, to better
understand its potential, limitations, and opportunities. In principle, such institutes have the
potential to provide sustainable, relevant, and recurrent training at a reasonable cost. For these
reasons, a number of postconflict countries are seeking to establish or revive public service
training institutions, often with development partner support. The focus on public service training
institutes in this note is not intended to imply that classroom-based training is the only or
necessarily best mechanism for improving public sector performance; rather, the intention is to
take a close look at the potential and limitations of this particular mechanism.

With regard to scope, the research carried out for this note primarily focuses on developing
a detailed understanding of how civil service institutes are established and function, and to
reflect on available information about their impact. The selection of case study countries and
institutes was targeted to deliver comparative insights into what is achievable in low-income
postconflict context. This note synthesizes the findings from case studies covering three countries
and four public service training institutes: Rwanda (Rwanda Management Institute [RMI]);
Uganda (Civil Service College Uganda [CSCU]); and Liberia (Liberia Institute of Public
Administration [LIPA] and the Financial Management Training Program [FMTP]).
Methodologically, the note is based on in-country interviews and data collection focused around
the respective institutes of public service training, as well as a desk-based review of data and
relevant secondary sources.

Public sector training efforts are one among a number of variables that are expected to be
relevant to building public sector capacity. The overall ‘ecosystem’ of factors include the
recruitment function (decisions about who from the general pool of available civil servants applies
for and is selected into public employment), pay, and also on-the-job experience. Furthermore,
the institutional context, the availability of non-salary resources (for operating costs and
investments), and crucially, organizational and management factors (the level of performance that
is expected and whether civil servants are motivated to perform the tasks and duties assigned) also
matter. Training most often comes into play after recruitment decisions are made, but can also take
the form of pre-service induction or selection into the civil service through special training
programs.

As explored in Section 3, the overall country context with regard to levels of general
education and initial government effectiveness are challenging in low-income postconflict
environments. Uganda, Rwanda, and Liberia are low income, but have seen rising per capita
incomes since the respective end of conflicts. The level of aid dependency has been particularly
high in Liberia and lowest for Uganda. With regard to educational enrollment and attainment,

                                                                                                   3
Rwanda and Uganda have literacy rates above the regional average for Sub-Saharan Africa, while
Liberia’s rates have been below. Across headline indicators of government effectiveness, Rwanda
performs best and shows a steady or increasing trend; Uganda started at a level similar to Rwanda
in the mid-2000s, but is since seen as having declined somewhat; and Liberia is rated as having the
least public sector quality/effectiveness, with recently increased ratings for budget management
dimensions of the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). The size of the civil
service relative to the total population is relatively similar across all three countries.

The general policy rationale for establishing institutes of public service has been to improve
national public sector capacity; while a key choice involves investing in longer and more
in-depth or shorter-term training. Section 4 highlights the distinction between programs that are
focused on delivering short in-service training courses to civil servants across government and
those that aim to build capacity through longer degree programs related to specific core
government functions. FMTP has entirely focused on longer-term courses to develop a missing
cadre of accounting and procurement professionals for Liberia; while RMI has offered short as
well as half- and full-year courses, with the latter being delivered by external partners. At the
opposite end of the spectrum, CSCU has so far focused exclusively on short-term, job-specific
courses, and has most systematically sought to reach subnational civil servants in a context of
significant decentralization.

Management and funding arrangements have been crucial; while facilities vary across cases
and over time. With the exception of LIPA, each institute sits under a government ministry.
Formally, each has a director who manages day-to-day operations and each has a dedicated
campus. One interesting aspect is that facilities vary with regard to scale and not every institute
relies solely on its campus to deliver courses: the CSCU ‘caravan’ (equipped bus) traveled to cities
across the country, particularly to remote locations, to offer core courses and train subnational
public officers prior to the completion of the college’s facilities; and this approach has been
continued. The institutes studied receive funding from a variety of sources, which include
allocations from the national budget, revenue from fee-based services, and grants or loans from
development partners. With the exception of FMTP, all institutes faced some challenges to raise
sufficient funds to fulfill their mandates.

Regional and international partnerships play an important role. All of the schools studied
have ongoing relationships with domestic institutions and additionally with external organizations.
FMTP has been fully externally funded, with the intention to transition the program into a
department at the national university in future. Regionally, it has been linked to the Association of
Accountancy Bodies of West Africa (ABWA) for curriculum development and the award of
certificates. RMI has had partnerships with Maastricht University (Maastricht School of
Management [MSM]), as well as with institutes in South Africa and in Korea. CSCU was assisted
in its curriculum development by the Ontario Public Service and the Institute of Public
Administration of Canada (with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency

                                                                                                   4
[CIDA]).

To deliver training, a mix of some permanent staff with consultants recruited from the
public sectors has worked well. With regard to staff, a key theme across the three wider-reaching
institutes (LIPA, CSCU, RMI) is that staffing plans envision a higher number of core
administrative and management employees than are actually in place. With regard to faculty, both
CSCU and RMI hire short-term staff but from different pools (experienced civil servants versus
consultants), and with different impacts on the quality of training delivered. In terms of the
selection of students, ensuring a good enough ‘match’ between those taking a training is important.
By design, the CSCU selection process is less demanding. For RMI, the list of training
beneficiaries for RMI’s short courses is drawn from ministries, departments and agencies’ (MDA)
training plans and compiled by the National Capacity Building Secretariat (NCBS). For LIPA,
Liberia’s Civil Service Agency (CSA) jointly carried out a capacity needs assessment that led to
the development of a national training policy that shaped the national civil service training
program; while it proved more challenging to collaborate on the identification of specific civil
servants for training. FMTP selects its students through a highly competitive process, fitting with
its role as a training institution that prepares cohorts for public service.

Information about impact is still very limited and should be a key focus going forward.
Section 7 summarizes the information that exists about impact, based on data collected by the
institutes, their parent ministries, or development partners, and complemented by in-country
interviews. Attribution is noted as a key challenge, given that wider effectiveness of the public
sector is driven by a range of factors of variables that must jointly move toward greater capacity.1
One available indicator across all institutes studied is the number of people trained, measuring the
output of the training efforts. In Liberia, LIPA was able to reached 3 percent of the civil service
over the course of 6 years; CSCU roughly 1 percent in 2 years; and Rwanda Institute of
Administration and Management (RIAM)/RMI 9 percent in 5 years. The relative share of core
civil servants (setting aside teachers, health workers, and police staff) reached is higher; but still
limited. The section also examines more qualitative evidence on the quality of training, including
the perceptions of public offers who have been through courses at each school.

Key Cross-Cutting Findings
Based on the granular look at the experience of establishing public service training institutes
in three countries that have emerged from conflicts and are seeking to build greater
government capacity, the note draws the following insights:




1
  In principle, one might expect that governments that invest in establishing or reviving schools of public service also
seek to make complementary efforts at strengthening the public service; however, even if this holds true, resistance
may be greater in other areas such as merit-based recruitment or effective performance management. Given the note’s
scope, this cannot be examined comprehensively.

                                                                                                                      5
   Public sector training institutes are relatively low-cost. LIPA, FMTP, and CSCU all
    cost roughly between US$1–2 million dollars a year to operate (albeit optimal budgets
    that would allow further improvements are likely to be in the US$3–4 million range).
    This is a rather low-cost investment relative to potential savings on out-of-country
    training and reliance on technical assistants.

   Effectiveness of institutes remains as yet uncertain, with some positive indications.
    Given that none of the institutes have implemented systematic monitoring and
    evaluation (M&E) so far, reliably assessing whether they are effective at increasing
    individual and ultimately institutional capacity is not possible for the time being.

   Developing sufficient reach is a key challenge. In Liberia and Uganda, so far, annually
    only 0.5 percent of civil servants are reached through institute-based training; in
    Rwanda, the rate has been about 2 percent per year. While not all civil servants need
    to be reached through training, getting to a ‘critical mass’ requires a significant scale
    of training.

   Public sector training efforts are more likely to be well calibrated and have an impact
    if there is an effective institutional interplay shaping the capacity-building efforts.
    While institutes of public service are best at focusing on delivering quality training,
    this needs to be complemented by efforts at identifying what training is needed and for
    whom. In Rwanda, the NCBS plays a pivotal role in this regard; and in Uganda the
    Ministry of Public Service has done so; in Liberia, this complementary link has been
    weaker.

   Linking recruitment to in-depth pre-service training is potentially an important
    avenue towards increasing impact; but in postconflict situations there is also
    inevitably a need for significant in-service training. In-depth and short-term training
    can be combined within one institute, as in the case of RMI; or take more separate
    forms as in Liberia. Recruiting based on competitive entrance exams can help to select
    and then grow key staff, but such a system is more demanding to establish. Short-term
    training has an important role to play given also some of the specific conditions of a
    postconflict country: staff often come together from very diverse
    backgrounds—including having spent time abroad or fighting—and ethnic diversity
    and divisions may need to be addressed.

   Monitoring of impact requires greater attention and from earlier stages—and this can
    benefit from targeted development partner support. As the case studies indicate, there
    are intentions for better monitoring, but these remain at early stages. Public service
    institutes or their managing secretariats can be crucial hubs for collecting information
    about what training has been delivered and which agencies and individuals received

                                                                                           6
           what training—including courses delivered by these institutes themselves, and ideally
           also through other capacity-building efforts.

Resulting ‘Good Ideas’ for Developing Effective Institutes in Challenging
Environments
Beyond these cross-cutting findings, each of the countries and institutes revisited for this
study had some features that stand out as worth considering by others:

          Getting the leadership structure and selection of good leadership right is important
           for establishing well-performing institutes. The cases highlight the importance of a
           leader who is passionate about the mission of the institution, but who can also
           champion the institute with relevant supervising ministries and among political and
           fiscal decision makers.

          To select good management and establish effective relationships with other relevant
           institutes requires political backing and attention especially during critical early
           periods.

          Utilizing a pool of civil servants as trainers complemented by in-house staff. A big
           risk of institutes of public administration in a low-income country is that it is difficult
           to attract sufficiently good staff for delivering quality courses. Contracting
           experienced civil servants as trainers seems to be a better model compared to
           contracting freelance consultants; while in addition, some in-house capacity to help
           trainers shape their courses appears to make an important contribution to the quality
           of courses.

          Delivering of quality training early on contributes to creating demand and
           credibility; and appropriate partnerships can help strengthen performance during
           early periods. In particular CSCU has managed to deliver training that appears to be
           perceived as well designed and relevant, and this has started to lead to additional
           demand. International and regional partnerships can help in delivering initial good
           training even in a challenging environment.

          A mobile approach offers an interesting option for reaching subnational levels.
           Reaching local government staff is increasingly important as populations expand and
           more functions are devolved in many countries. Establishing permanent regional
           subsidiaries would be (too) costly in many situations. The ‘caravan approach’ as used
           in Uganda prior to the construction of CSCU’s campus proved feasible and
           cost-effective.

          Long-term partnerships with other more well established institutes—both regional
           and international—can make important contributions. Where these partnerships have
                                                                                                    7
            been effective they included longer-term relationships, allowing individuals involved
            to interact repeatedly over time, and to gain sufficient understanding of the context to
            be able to provide quality and relevant inputs; and sustained inputs to developing and
            also delivering course content

Further Knowledge Agenda
The note suggests the following aspects as key priorities for further analytic work that can
feed into considerations about how best to stabilize fragile states and achieve greater
resilience, which continues to rise as a key priority for the international community. Especially for
low-income countries, capacity development of the public sector is a crucial aspect of achieving
more effective and well-performing institutions.

      With regard to training as such, it would be valuable to generate a wider range of
       empirical insights including some Francophone African countries, as well as low-income
       fragile states in other regions.

      An exploration of the modalities and effectiveness of on-the-job mentoring and
       complementarity with classroom-based courses.

      The organization of and options for improving recruitment functions—either early on or
       once relatively poor recruitment has taken place on various scales.

      Work on employment conditions and security of tenure and how to weigh a potential need
       for public service renewal with the need for preventing politicized layoffs (for example,
       after a turnover in government); this would help calibrate technical advice on how to shape
       civil service legislation in postconflict contexts.

      Identification of what works with regard to performance-oriented management in
       challenging environments as a key complement for utilizing strengthened individual
       capacity.

1. Motivation and Scope
The purpose of this note is to explore how institutes for public service training have been
established and operate in fragile and low-income contexts. One motivation for this work is to
provide insights for planned World Bank project support to such institutes in South Sudan and
Somalia. Furthermore, this analysis continues the process of developing operationally relevant
analysis on different aspects of public sector strengthening in postconflict contexts to inform
international engagement on capacity strengthening. The note builds on recent reports covering the
‘big picture’ of institutional development (as summarized in the 2011 World Development Report
[WDR]) and complements existing work on the specifics of strengthening public financial
management in postconflict settings (World Bank 2012). It is one contribution among several
currently being developed by teams around the Bank on public services in postconflict contexts.

Limited state capacity to carry out core government and service delivery functions poses a
major constraint in postconflict countries, especially those with low income levels. The
importance of capacity constraints and challenges faced when addressing them are highlighted in
the 2011 WDR, work on public financial management (PFM) strengthening, and other analysis.
These constraints have a variety of underlying drivers and possible remedies (World Bank 2004;
UNDP 2010). They affect the ability of the civil service to deliver public goods and services, and
also to absorb and manage aid.

There are multiple avenues for strengthening or re-developing overall public service
capacity. These include reforms to recruitment, pay and performance management practices, as
well as ensuring the availability of resources for civil servants to carry out their assigned function.
As is well recognized, capacity has both institutional and individual aspects.

The intention of this effort is to drill down into one particular mechanism of capacity
strengthening to better understand its potential, limitations, and opportunities. A common
approach to capacity building is to provide training, opportunities for on-the-job learning, and
mentoring to civil servants. As discussed below, this can take a range of forms from out-of-country
degree programs to workshops, twinning arrangements with technical assistants, and job coaching
programs. Among these, the institutionalization of in-country training through schools of public
service has been regaining greater attention in recent years, alongside a wider focus on the need for
relevant and quality post-secondary training in lower-income countries.

National public sector training institutes hold the potential for providing sustainable,
relevant, and recurrent training at a reasonable cost. Schools of public administration can be
expected to play a role in transitioning from reliance on technical assistance, and to reduce the
need for costly trainings abroad, which typically can only reach a limited number of staff. As
McKechnie has argued in 2004, “because country capacity is already scarce in a post -conflict
country, sending people out of the country for training and meetings does not make sense, unless
absolutely essential, and can slow reconstruction; instead, such activities should be used


                                                                                                     9
selectively and targeted for results? (World Bank 2004). Furthermore, institutionalizing training
through establishing institutes or schools of public administration could, in principle, help move
beyond a situation of well-intended but often somewhat random, and possibly repetitive short-term
courses funded by an array of different development partners. It may also help to move away from
overly generic courses not sufficiently grounded in the respective country’s laws, regulations, and
administrative practices.

Reacting to this impetus, a number of postconflict countries are seeking to establish or
revive public service training institutions, often with development partner support. Bank
country teams have received a number of requests for support to these institutes, including most
recently in South Sudan and Somalia. To better calibrate assistance for these efforts, it was decided
to review the experience with civil service training in three countries that relatively recently
experienced postconflict rebuilding: Rwanda, Uganda, and Liberia. A small grant from the
Governance Partnership Facility enabled the review.

This note’s focus is not intended to imply that classroom based training is the only or
necessarily best mechanism for improving public sector performance. As discussed in
Sections 2 and 7, the overall ecosystem of public sector capacity includes a number of factors, and
the impact of successful initiatives in any one area will depend on progress being made also in
others. However, individual skills as well as understanding of government processes and ways of
working by individual civil servants can be assumed to matter and to require attention in
postconflict contexts—and is in line with a wide range of public and private sector institutions
offering various degrees of specific, tailored training. Consequently, training—if well delivered
and pertinent—can be assumed to play a potential role in reducing capacity gaps. Section 9 sets out
what further analytic efforts would be most relevant for generating more comprehensive insights
across related aspects of rebuilding public services.

With regard to scope, the research carried out for this note primarily focuses on developing
a detailed understanding of how civil service institutes are established and function, and to
reflect on available information about their impact. While Section 2 situates public sector
training in the web of other factors that are expected to be relevant to building public sector
capacity, it is beyond the scope of this effort to provide a comprehensive assessment of these
factors for each of the case study countries. The note briefly covers the country context to provide
a sense of the overall level of development and the postconflict trajectory of each of the three
countries included (Section 3).

The selection of case study countries and institutes was targeted to deliver comparative
insights into what is achievable in a postconflict context. Thus, the focus is on three countries
which have been overall relatively successful in establishing or beginning to establish more
effective governance after a period of conflict. We expect that these would be most likely to
provide relevant lessons for countries such as South Sudan and Somalia. Thus, the review


                                                                                                  10
deliberately focuses on countries that have relatively recently experienced conflict and have begun
the process of rebuilding within the last 10–20 years.

This note synthesizes the findings from case studies covering three countries and four public
service training institutes: Rwanda (RMI); Uganda (CSCU); and Liberia (LIPA and FMTP).
There are other long-established and well-regarded public service training institutes in Africa—for
example, the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) or the Kenya
School of Government. However, these are less directly comparable to the types of institutions that
can be developed in more fragile and less advanced environments. As is discussed in the empirical
sections, these leading institutes in the region are potentially important for postconflict contexts,
but specifically in their role as hubs for cross-country (South-South) collaboration, for example, on
curriculum development, training of trainers, and other activities.

Methodologically, the note is based on in-country interviews and data collection focused
around the respective institutes of public service training, as well as a desk-based review of
data and relevant secondary sources. In particular in Liberia and Uganda, the team was able to
work closely with the public sector governance staff based in country who have been involved in
the support for the public service institutes covered.

The analysis proceeds as follows: Section 2 briefly lays out the variables shaping public sector
capacity, and sets out how civil service training programs contribute. Sections 3–6 summarize the
key findings across the case studies: Section 3 discusses the country context for each of the three
countries, and in particular their educational and public sector trajectories; Section 4 summarizes
the policy rationale for the establishment of the respective training institutions —CSCU, LIPA,
FMTP, and RMI, as well as how their overall objectives were linked to the contexts set out in
Section 2. Section 5 covers the institutional and management arrangements, physical
infrastructure, cost and partnerships for each institute (the ‘inputs’); and Section 6 describes their
faculty, staff, curriculum, trainees (the ‘outputs’). Section 7 concludes the discussion of key
findings, examining what can be said about impact based on the limited evidence available.
Section 8 draws emerging conclusions and implications from this analysis and outlines what
additional analytic work will be most valuable to further develop our understanding of ‘what
works’ with regard to developing public sector capacity in postconflict environments. The four
detailed case studies covering the CSCU, LIPA, FMTP, and RMI are included as annexes.

2. Public Service Training: One Mechanism among Several
Rebuilding public sector capacity is a key priority in low-income and fragile contexts. As set
out in the 2011 WDR on Conflict, Security, and Development, there is a mutually reinforcing
relationship between the transformation of institutions and restoring confidence in the state. To
restore confidence in the state requires that the latter is actually able to function and deliver
tangible outputs—such as policing, initiating the rebuilding of infrastructure, and organizing
service delivery (see OECD 2010; UN-WB 2015).


                                                                                                   11
Yet establishing a civil service that is actually able to deliver is typically challenging . On the
one hand, there is often a dearth of qualified staff, especially in environments with low human
development and where education systems have eroded because of a prolonged period of conflict.
In fragile contexts, building public sector capacity often has to start from a very limited base.
Furthermore, qualified staff may be particularly hard to find for positions outside of main urban
centers.2 On the other hand, moving towards greater capacity is also a political challenge: there are
often pressures to recruit staff based on security and patronage considerations (for example, from
groups able to threaten renewed violence or otherwise crucial for the political settlement) as much
as on merit.

The overall ‘ecosystem’ of factors influencing public sector capacity is laid out in stylized
form in Figure 1. There is a long-standing discussion that public sector strengthening entails more
than individually focused training (Schaffer 1974; McCourt and Sola 1999). Public sector capacity
emerges from a range of factors which jointly shape civil servants’ ability and incentives to
perform, and thus the effect of initiatives in any one area depend on what happens with regard to
other areas (McCourt and Eldridge 2003). Furthermore, overall public sector performance
emerges from both the formal-legal provisions in place, as well as how these are implemented in
practice. Nonetheless, individual capacity and learning of ‘how to do things’ matters; and
particularly so in environments when governments have only recently been reestablished, and
frequently, many new legal provisions and business processes are being introduced in the public
administration.

With regard to the overall ecosystem, a first factor is the availability and quality of basic,
secondary, and tertiary education, which shapes the capacity of the pool of potential civil
servants (‘1’ in Figure 1). This pool does not necessarily need to be very large, given that a civil
service only makes up 2–3 percent of the adult population (see also Box 1). However, governments
in postconflict contexts often have to compete with an influx of nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), development partners, and private sector activities—from banks, to hotels, to
breweries—as well as with continuing opportunities for migration or remaining in the diaspora.
The smaller the pool of educated citizens, the higher the risk that government cannot recruit or
retain staff with sufficient general or specific qualifications across MDAs and levels of
government.

  With regard to capacity, there are a range of situations. Some countries emerging from war were previously states
and had relatively developed administrative systems. Others emerge from conflict as new states (that is, Kosovo,
Timor, and South Sudan). Levels of development prior to and after conflict can also vary (for example, Iraq as
compared to Liberia). This note primarily addresses a situation of low-income states that have experienced conflict.

Box 1. What is a ‘Public Service’ and Public Service Training?
Countries vary with regard to who is considered a public servant, and the employment conditions offered. The main
focus of this note is on civilian employees, that is, staff on the public payroll but not part of the military or
paramilitary forces. Furthermore, this note centers on core administrative functions at central and subnational
levels. A significant share of the public service is typically made up of teachers, health services staff, engineers and
other specialists, and the police—and for these, the main relevant training is delivered through sector training
institutions such as teacher or nurses training institutes and police academies.

Core policy, administrative and fiduciary cadres, including technical cadres with policy and general administrative
roles—range from staff in central-level line ministries to tax collection and the managing public funds, to Human
Resources (HR) and payrolls management, and the delivery of core services such as issuing birth certificates,
licenses, and so on. Core staff are deployed across different core and line ministries and agencies, as well as across
levels of government.

The terms ‘civil service’ and ‘public service’ are used interchangeably in this note. ‘Public service training’ is used
here primarily to describe training targeting general administrative and policymaking and oversight roles and
requisite knowledge.

Further crucial factors for civil service capacity are the recruitment function—decisions
about who from the general pool applies for and is selected into the civil service (‘2’), pay
(‘3’), and on-the-job experience (‘4’). In principle, governments should seek to develop a
relatively small civil service that is reasonably well paid,3 recruit the best and the brightest they
can attract, and retain those that perform so as to develop institutional memory and experience.
Yet, in many postconflict countries, factors such as political affiliation/association with military
leaders, regional considerations, legacies of who was or remained employed during conflict, and
family or community linkages play a significant role and shape how the recruitment function takes
shape in practice.

The degree to which this weakens capacity relative to what would be feasible for a country
depends on the distance in qualifications—and motivation—between the pool of potential
applicants and those who actually are selected into the public service. The nature of the
postconflict situation and a country’s legacy will determine whether initially there are many or few
civil servants with longer experience—which can be both a boon and a burden.4 Once postconflict
rebuilding begins, it is in principle valuable if newly recruited civil servants remain in post for
some time to build essential ‘on-the-job experience’—provided that they have some incentive to
perform. Furthermore, where a public sector pension scheme is missing (as is frequently the case
for some time into postconflict settings), a share of positions may be held by ‘legacy’ civil servants
in their late 60s, 70s, and even 80s; and the scale of this problem can grow as time passes without
a retirement scheme in place.

Related crucial factors for civil service capacity are overall organizational and management
factors. An overall environment of expecting performance and an ethos of integrity, and whether
civil servants are motivated to perform the tasks and duties assigned (overall blue area and ‘5’)
plays an important role. Political decision makers, ministers, governors, and county
commissioners at subnational levels, and senior civil servants ‘set the tone’ with regard to what is
expected of individual civil servants. This can take the form of deliberate ‘performance
management’ or be more informal. Decisions about promotions are an important way for signaling
whether performance in the public interest is expected, or whether other criteria dominate. If many
staff are not recruited on meritocratic criteria, this can also (negatively) affect performance as staff
recruited based on connections may feel protected from potential disciplining or dismissal for
nonperformance.

In most conflict countries, overall organization and the incentives set by policymakers are
not optimal, not least due to the pressures prevailing in a ‘fragile limited access order’ as

  There is a growing literature on levels of pay for public servants, with partially contradictory findings about
adequate levels of pay. Here we just take the basic assumption that in principle pay needs to be sufficient to compete
with alternative options in postconflict environments especially for higher-level professional and managerial cadres.
4
  For a discussion of contrasting legacies see Srivastava and Blum (forthcoming); for example, while Sierra Leone had
a central civil service that was largely intact at the end of the conflict, East Timor is an example where almost the
entire service had to be newly recruited.

                                                                                                                   14
characterized by North et al. (2012). There is, however, substantial variation—with a greater
emphasis and true focus on performance and integrity in some environments, and much less so in
others.5 When political leaders and senior managers signal that a given public sector unit must
deliver on assigned functions, this can provide crucial incentives to ensure that good staff is
promoted or placed in key positions, and to shed the most incompetent recruits, leading to
improvements over time.

Training and learning (‘6’) is a factor that most often comes into play after recruitment
decisions have been made for core civil service cadre, but can also take the form of
pre-service training based on a selection into a specific program.6 Structured civil servant
learning can take a range of forms, including on-the-job mentoring and twinning arrangements
with more experienced civil servants or technical assistants; secondment and action learning; as
well as classroom-based training. More informal learning also occurs when civil servants absorb
the norms and behaviors encouraged by the presence (or absence) of performance management
systems as discussed above.7

In addition to how staff are selected, managed, trained, and paid, the availability of
resources (‘7’) also plays a role, and in many postconflict and other poor countries this poses
a challenge. While resources (operating and capital budgets) need not be ample, a minimum is
needed to fulfill tasks. If civil servants are not provided with required forms, basic office
equipment, or electricity, they will often struggle to do what is expected. Especially during early
postconflict periods and for subnational levels of government, even basic infrastructure such as
office space or desks may be missing or may need to be used by multiple staff. A lack of minimal
resources, or the fact that these are only available intermittently reduces capacity and can also
affect motivation negatively. This can entail a negative circle: the lack of basic resources affects
the public service, and in turn, efforts at collecting taxes and ensuring that public funds are well
managed suffer.

From among these factors, this note focuses on the aspect of training and learning; and
specifically on whether national schools of public service can play an effective role in
strengthening civil service capacity during a postconflict period. The general purpose of
training and other structured learning is to provide specific skills relevant for functioning in the
public service—for example, basic legal knowledge, knowledge of processes and rules, as well as
knowing how to use relevant information technology (IT) applications, or training on specific
areas such as accounting and procurement. Participants in any such training would be expected to

5
  To some extent, this is a ‘common pool’ problem. If a single political appointee hires some relatives, he or she gains
local standing, while the cost is borne by society overall and the effect on the public administration of a single instance
is limited. However, if many hiring managers behave similarly, and much of the hiring into the public service is
affected, then the overall system becomes dysfunctional.

have sound numeracy and literacy skills, acquired through primary, secondary, and possibly
tertiary education. If many civil servants do not have a good enough general education, specific
civil service training becomes more challenging. Schools of public administration may also be
well placed to facilitate employee socialization and early establishment of norms; provide initial
orientations on new laws or policies; or equip a select group with high-level skills accredited with
qualification in accountancy or management. The assumption here is that such schools will
typically exist alongside other efforts at strengthening individual and institutional capacities, such
as knowledge transfer by technical assistants and other ‘on-the-job’ learning; ideally through
deliberate complementarities, efforts at building systems and institutions, and so on.

Getting training and structured learning ‘right’ can be difficult—reflecting some of the
wider challenges of ‘capacity-building’ efforts (see Box 2). A large number of actors engage in
the aftermath of conflict, and this is often matched by weak country capacity to be specific about
needs and to coordinate technical assistance (TA). Given uncertainty and urgency, incentives for
stakeholders to focus on longer-term investments are often weak. Attention of humanitarian and
development partners tend to be focused on ‘getting service delivery up and running’. Technical
assistants are put in place for core management and fiduciary functions—either directly in core
ministries or in project implementation units—and service delivery is contracted out as rapid
solutions to missing capacity within a country’s public service (see Srivastava and Blum
forthcoming). This overall set of incentives and ‘modus operandi’ is typically paired with efforts at
institution and capacity building through ‘on-the-job’ mentoring and course- or classroom-based
training.

For on-the-job training, TA contracts often include provisions that technical assistants are
expected to mentor and coach counterparts. However, in practice, mentoring frequently falls
short—for example, owing to language difficulties, limited incentives for technical assistants to
transfer knowledge, fragmentation, and poor monitoring and follow-up. When civil servants are
not selected properly in the first place, technical assistants may also face counterparts with limited
capacity and interest to absorb information, or at least with very significant knowledge gaps that
would need to be addressed (such as basic IT literacy) to create a basis for job-specific knowledge
transfer. Moreover, the impact of these efforts is particularly hard to measure—so even if there is
some transfer of knowledge and skills it is hard to assess the degree and pace of progress.

The default mode of classroom-based training in postconflict contexts is the provision of
short-term courses delivered by consultants. Such training is often offered only a few times and
based on foreign curricula that may not be relevant to the context or that makes unrealistic
assumptions about prior knowledge. Many courses are delivered by foreign consultants, who may
not have specific country knowledge; and due to this, the content tends to be ‘academic’ or generic
rather than closely linked to day-to-day needs. Other training is directly linked to specific IT
systems, for example, and may be quite practical, but cannot be sustained and repeated, carrying
the risk that turnover erodes the capacity that has been developed. Training outside the country can

                                                                                                   16
be costly and takes civil servants away from their posts for extended periods of time. Furthermore,
capacity building can also set the stage for a ‘culture of training’ in the emerging public service
that can become unsustainable as development partners begin to focus on recovery efforts.

The key issues to be analyzed in this study are whether in-country institutes of public
administration indeed have the potential to ensure that capacity building takes a more
long-term approach, is better matched to training needs, and becomes more
institutionalized. Anecdotally, there is a wide variation in the performance of such institutes
across Africa and countries in other regions—and hence it is important to understand better if and
how they can be (reasonably) successful in low-income postconflict environments. Related to
these questions, the note explores whether such institutes or schools can or could possibly serve as
hubs to coordinate overall training needs and delivery; and possibly also to establish better
monitoring of ‘what works’, who has been trained, and progress achieved, including through
on-the-job training.

Box 2. The Concern with Capacity Development and Its Arrival in Fragile States’ Contexts
The emphasis on capacity building in development has fluctuated over time; including the extent to which this is
equated to ‘all development efforts’ or seen as something more narrow and distinct. As noted in a 2005 B ank
evaluation of Capacity Development for Africa, the definitional boundaries are loose:

    “the reasons for weak public sector performance are deeply rooted. Whatever pragmatic steps can be
    taken under the rubric of capacity building can be only a small part of the solution. Yet there is little
    empirical evidence to clarify what part of the problem international capacity building support can best
    help to solve; in what order capacity needs should be addressed; what can be expected of different kinds
    of interventions and why; and how knowledge of such processes as organizational change, learning, and
    incentives should shape capacity building efforts. There is not even a shared definition of what
    constitutes capacity building support.?

The literature draws a distinction between individual capacity and organizational capacity, and societal
capacity as a third dimension (Greijn et al. 2015; UNDP 1993; World Bank/OED 2005; World Bank/IEG 2008).
Possibly because the boundaries of ‘capacity building’ are so wide, there is surprisingly little specific information
on training efforts targeting civil servants and their relative efficacy, and despite the substantial literature on
capacity development, there are few studies dealing with the role played (potential or actual) by schools or institutes
of public administration as a specific mechanism.

The emphasis on capacity building in postconflict contexts is more recent . It is informed by general policy
considerations about development effectiveness in fragile states, as set out in Busan and the ‘New Deal’. The
commitment to rebuilding and aid coordination led by national governments in principle presupposes extensive
state capacity. A key concern for capacity building in postconflict environments is how to address capacity gaps
and how to transition from significant reliance on technical assistants to greater reliance on domestic capacity
(World Bank 2004; UNDP 2010; Srivastava and Blum, forthcoming; Bhatia and Prasad, forthcoming).


While being well aligned with the aid effectiveness agenda for fragile and postconflict states,
it is important to keep in mind that a focus on training can also be politically expedient.

                                                                                                                      17
Nearly any government will like to be seen as promoting capacity of its own civil
servants—whether it is serious about public sector performance or whether its actual efforts in this
regard are more limited or constrained. Governments may pursue the training of civil servants who
were selected because they participated in a war of independence, or that are seen as more loyal to
the new government, and also those selected for reasons of patronage and various
relationships—rather than starting off with selecting the most qualified applicants available. This
review focuses predominantly on the issue of ‘what works’ for establishing national training
institutions; but as will be revisited in Section 9, these wider issues and how to include them in
overall efforts to strengthen capacity in postconflict countries also need to be considered.

3. Contexts: Uganda, Rwanda, and Liberia
This section provides a brief overview of the public sector and education trajectories in each
country reviewed—Uganda, Rwanda, and Liberia. While it is not possible to map the entire
‘ecosystem’ of factors described above given the scope of this study, the section provides the
essential context in which the efforts to establish or revive public sector training institutions has
taken place; including in particular the evolving situation of general education attainment,
historical legacies, a sketch of overall efforts made at rebuilding the civil service, and available
data on public sector effectiveness (CPIA clusters and Worldwide Governance Indicators [WGI]
for government effectiveness). The section provides an initial data overview; individual country
data are discussed further in the following subsections.

Table 1 maps the gross national income (GNI) per capita and the relative level of aid
dependency. All three countries are low income, but have seen rising per capita incomes since the
respective end of conflicts. The level of aid dependency has been particularly high in Liberia; and
lowest for Uganda.

primary completion rates still pose a challenge. Among the three countries, secondary enrollment
has risen highest in Liberia, but has also increased significantly in Uganda and Rwanda.

Across all indicators of government effectiveness, Rwanda performs best and shows a steady or
increasing trend. Uganda had started at a level similar to Rwanda in the mid-2000s, but is seen as
having declined somewhat; and Liberia is rated as having least public sector quality/effectiveness,
with recently increased ratings for budget management dimensions of the CPIA. These ratings
provide a quick glimpse of the overall trend in government quality and effectiveness over the past
decade. The trends are revisited when discussing the impact of public service institutes in Section
7.

The size of the civil service relative to the total population is relatively similar across all
three countries as reflected in Table 3; while in absolute figures, Uganda has the largest service,
corresponding to being the country with the largest population. Importantly, of the total number of
civilian employees, typically well over half is made up of teachers, health-service staff, and the
police.

3.1 Rwanda
Rwanda’s development progress over the last two decades represents a remarkable
turnaround in the wake of the 1994 genocide. A highly strategic approach to development
centered on a clearly defined set of national goals has paid off, with high growth rates, a decline in
poverty, a reduction in inequality, and progress on nearly all development outcomes (World Bank.
Rwanda Country Partnership Framework FY14–18). Rwanda’s Vision2020 lays out the targets of
achieving the millennium development goals by 2015 and becoming a middle-income country by
the end of the decade (World Bank 2012). Vision2020 acknowledges the central role of a
well-functioning public service and skilled workforce for reaching these targets, identifies low
capacity as a bottleneck to state transformation, and calls for the rapid development of public
sector skills.8

The 1994 genocide severely impacted Rwanda’s already weak public sector capacity, with
many qualified civil servants fleeing or being killed (World Bank 2012). With regard to formal
education, by the end of the 1990s, 2.7 percent of public servants in Rwanda held a university
degree and 36 percent held a certificate. On the one hand, this figure had increased to 79 percent of
the workforce holding a university degree by 2005.9 On the other hand, Rwandan public sector
remained quite young and with limited work experience; in 2010 it was found that 76 percent of
civil servants had been in government for 4 years or less. In line with the prevalence of recent
hires, 60 percent of civil servants were between the ages 25 and 34 years. A 2009 skills gap
assessment found Rwanda had only 60 percent of the required technical skills nationally (World
Bank 2012). One specific challenge in the Rwanda context has been the shift away from French to
English as the official language.

Improving education has been a key focus of the government, and as reflected in Table 2,
there is evidence that progress is being made across indicators for levels of education . The
primary completion rate increased from 46 percent in the early 1990s to 59 percent in 2013.
Similarly, secondary enrollment moved from 16 percent in the early 1990s to 31 percent in 2011.
Tertiary enrollment increased from 0.6 percent in the early 90s to nearly 7 percent in 2012. Despite
these increases, Rwanda still performs below the regional average, as well as the average for
fragile and conflict-affected states on all three indicators. Meanwhile, literacy rates have been

  World Bank 2012. Many civil servants viewed as unqualified or not having the correct degrees for the positions they
held were dismissed between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s.

                                                                                                                  23
comparable with the regional and FCS average.

Since the end of conflict, the government has taken a number of steps to address the
country’s public sector administration challenges. One set of reforms focused on structural
issues, and involved the rationalization and reorganization of the public sector. The government
restructured departments and functions, retrenched and redeployed staff, established a code of
ethics, standardized recruitment processes, and improved pay for the remaining civil servants. In
1998–99, the civil service was downsized; 6,000 workers were dismissed because they were not
qualified and 6,500 ghost workers were removed from the payroll. Salaries for remaining civil
servants were increased 40 percent.

Another set of reforms focused on capacity building. In 2005, a Multi-Sector
Capacity-Building Program (MSCBP) was initiated to direct the preparation and implementation
of capacity-building action plans, and it targeted both human resource development as well as the
institutional work environment. The plan focused on the public sector, private sector and civil
society. The Human Resources and Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA) was
established to coordinate the MSCBP. In 2009, the Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat
(PSCBS) took over HIDA’s responsibilities. Sitting under the Ministry of Finance, its mandate
was to coordinate capacity development across the public sector and to manage a national
capacity-building fund (CBF). Linked to the national planning and budget cycle, government
agencies and ministries would submit training and capacity-development plans, which were
consolidated by PSCBS into a national plan. In 2015, PSCBS was transformed into the NCBS with
an expanded mandate to coordinate training for the public sector, private sector, and civil society.

Thus, one issue that stands out in Rwanda is the fact that the government pursued capacity
strengthening through several of the mechanisms highlighted in the previous section. It
targeted increasing general education, a renewal of the civil service, and recruiting staff with
higher levels of education, as well as through creating a strong system for performance
management, known as imihigo, that has globally attracted attention (World Bank 2012; Scher and
Macauly 2014). Training efforts targeting civil servants were one element of this wider pursuit of
building an effective state (and effective security capabilities).

As reflected in Figure2, the CPIA ratings for Rwanda compare favorably to the regional and
fragile states averages and it has been a relatively strong performer as compared to other case
study countries. Since 2005, Rwanda’s public sector management and institutions cluster average
has been higher than Sub-Saharan Africa and other FCS including middle-income countries.
Further, at a time when this indicator was falling for the Sub-Saharan region overall,
Rwanda’sperformance gradually improved. Rwanda’s rating for quality of public administration
has been somewhat more flat, but has also been higher than the regional and FCS average.

3.2 Uganda
Uganda experienced relative stability after independence in 1962, until a 1971 military coup

                                                                                                 24
led by Idi Amin Dada. The coup initiated a period of political and economic turmoil
characterized by violence, economic decline, and the politicization of the civil service. The
country saw an initial return to stability in 1986 when the National Resistance Movement took
power, led by Yoweri Museveni. Yet violent conflict with the Lord’s Resistance Army continued
in Uganda. Since 2006, there have been no major security incidents.10

Since regaining peace, Uganda has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa with
an average growth rate of 7.6 percent during 2006–2010 and 5.5 during 2011–2013 (World
Bank 2015). Since the 1990s, it has seen improvements across development indicators, including
many for education (Table 2). As was the case with Rwanda, its primary completion rate, as well
as enrollment in secondary school and in higher education, have still been lower than the
Sub-Saharan and fragile states averages. Despite lower enrollment rates than regional averages,
Uganda’s adult literacy rate (73 percent in 2010) has been comparable to or slightly higher than
regional or fragile states averages, and above the rate for the other case study countries. Prior to the
establishment of the CSCU in 2012, policymakers noted that civil servants at the center of
government were generally well qualified in terms of formal education, but were still not able to
deliver high-quality public administration.

With regard to public sector management, during the 1990s, the government set out a
strategy to address major challenges through three initiatives (a) financial management and
accountability reforms; (b) a decentralization and local government development program; (c) a
Public Service Reform Program (PSRP). While there was some progress on the first two
initiatives, gaining traction on the third proved more difficult. For example, it was felt that that the
public service was large, costly, and inefficient. There was also a perception that positions within
the civil service had been granted on the basis of loyalty rather than qualifications. To address this,
a number of structural reforms were introduced, including reducing the number of civil servants
(by 1996, it was reduced by half), putting in place a civil service hiring freeze, and reducing the
number of government ministries from 38 to 17. Yet, at the same time, the number of
semi-autonomous government agencies (and staff employed by these agencies) increased steeply
during this period, providing a channel for continued political hiring (Mwenda and Tangri 2005).

In 2004, the government’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan (2004–2008) identified public
sector management as a key constraint on sustaining high rates of economic development
and poverty reduction. It identified six obstacles to improved performance: skills gaps and weak
management; weak performance and accountabilty; inefficient and overextended government
organizations; disabling work enviornment; poor pay; and absence of sustained support for reform

from political and technocratic leadership.11

As reflected in Table 2, though there has been progress on many development and economic
indicators, government performance has not seen a pattern of sustained improvement over
time. Rather, there was a significant initial postconflict improvement, followed by a more recent
decline. As reflected in Figure 2, CIPA indcators show a steady decrease in the public sector
management and institutions cluster average starting 2008–2013, from a level well above regional
averages to around the regional ‘norm.’ Indicators reflect some improvement in 2014, especially
for the budgetary and financial management cluster. The public administration rating has been flat
since 2005. This steady decline has been from a relatively higher starting point than the other case
study countries, Sub-Saharan Africa, and FCS.

3.3 Liberia
At the end of Liberia’s civil war in 2003, one of the new government’s greatest challenges
was the lack of capacity to carry out core government functions, especially with regard to
public financial management. Public administration had already been in decline from the 1980s
onward, and was further eroded by 14 years of civil conflict during which many qualified civil
servants fled. During the early postconflict period from 2003 to 2005, the National Transitional
Goverernment focused on short-term measures necessary to consolidate peace and stabalize the
country. Compunding the challenge of starting from very low levels of education and literacy (see
Table 2), high-level ministerial positions were awarded to previously warring factions, rather than
on the basis of formal qualifications to run government agencies.

With regard to its education trajectory, the literacy rate in Liberia started from a much
lower point than regional or the other case study comparators, and has remained low (at
roughly 43 percent in 2004 and 2007). Its primary school completion rate dropped from 65 to 58
percent between 2006 and 2014, but the transition to secondary schooling is quite high. Secondary
school enrollment was low at the end of the conflict (35 percent), but increased to 45 percent by
2011. Tertiary school enrollment has remained relatively steady between 2.5 percent in 2000 and
3.9 percent in 2010.

With the election of Presdient Johnson-Sirleaf in 2005, the focus shifted to longer-term
reconstruction including with regard to public administration and financial management. A
key priority was ensuring proper and efficient use of budget resources, and assuring donor partners
that their assistance was being well managed—in a context of very high aid dependency (see Table
1). 12 In collaboration with the Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), and European Union (EU), the government designed the
Liberia Governance and Economic Management Action Plan (GEMAP), giving internationally

recruited experts direct fiduciary control over key processes. This became the basis for donor
engagement around economic governance over the following years.

To address the decline of the civil service during the war, the government adopted a Civil
Service Reform Strategy in 2009. The strategy laid out an ambitious agenda to be implemented
over a three-year period. However, it produced mixed results in part due to limited capacity,
coordination, and funding. A pay reform strategy was developed in 2010, and civil servants are
now routinely paid better and on time compared to 2005. Continuing challenges include retirees in
active service due to lack of a public sector pension scheme, weak payroll compliance, still
relatively low pay, and poor alignment between skills and functions.13

From March 2014 to May 2015, Liberia experienced a devistating outbreak of Ebola, which
put a strain on the country and disrupted the functioning of public sector institutions. This includes
the FMPT and LIPA, which were closed for some time during the epidemic. Research for this note
was carried out during the Ebola period. The medium- to long-term impact of the epidemic on the
government capacity is still uncertain.

According to governance indicators, with regard to the overall public administration
trajectory, Liberia started from a very low level but has gradually seen some improvement .
As reflected in Figure 2, Liberia’s CPIA rating for the public sector management and institutions
cluster average has seen an improvement since 2012 at a time when the Sub-Saharan Africa
average was declining overall. Its quality of public administrating rating has stayed flat since 2009,
and is well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average—though comparable to the FCS average.

4. Policy Rationale and Objectives
Decisions about the policy rationale for establishing public service training institutes were
shaped by the specific capacity challenges facing each country. Their objectives and setup
were influenced by the specific ‘mechanisms’ policymakers hoped to influence through training
(though to a greater or lesser extent for each institute). Further, there is a distinction between
programs that deliver short-term, in-service training to civil servants across government, and those
that focus more narrowly on developing a ‘missing cadre’ through long-term, degree programs
related to specific core government functions.

As discussed further below, in Liberia (LIPA) and Rwanda (RMI), existing schools were
‘reestablished’ as part of setting up new government structures in the wake of conflict; while
the CSCU in Uganda and Liberian FMTP were established to address specific training gaps.
In the case of Uganda, this was the absence of critical performance management skills. In Liberia,
the gap was a missing cadre of financial management professionals. One common feature across
all four schools is the very clear decision to provide quality training in country. This was felt to be

                                                                                                             27
more cost-effective, as well as more likely to transfer locally relevant knowledge and skills. As
noted by the director of the CSCU “training abroad is in most cases not suited to the local
conditions… institutes can draw on foreign expertise (through partnerships) to design and deliver
the training under local conditions which is both effective and efficient.? For degree programs, it
was also hoped that in-country training would increase the likelihood that graduates remained in
country when the program was complete.

4.1 Rwanda Management Institute (RMI)
RMI was established to address eroded civil service capacity in a strategic and
well-coordinated manner. As noted above, the government has taken a number of steps to
address the country’s public sector administration challenges since the end of conflict in 1994. One
set of reforms focused on structural issues, and involved the rationalization and reorganization of
the public sector. Another set of reforms focused on capacity building, including the initiation of a
MSCBP, the establishment of a capacity-building agency, and the reestablishment of a
management development institute (MDI) to train civil servants.

RMI is the successor organization to the Centre Rwandais de Formation des Cadres
(CRFC), an institute originally established in 1963. In 2001, as part of structural reforms to
government, the CRFC was reestablished as the RIAM. In 2013, the decision was made to
reestablish RIAM as the RMI, a public corporation with a training, research, and consultancy
department.

RIAM targeted public servants already in their post and was the only MDI in Rwanda with
a mandate to deliver training to the public sector. In 2007, RIAM’s mission was expanded to
include capacity building for public, private, and civil society employees. Today, RMI targets the
same expanded audience. According to policy documents, its mission is to “ensure capacity
building for the national workforce through training,? and “facilitate and deliver relevant and
effective learning? (RMI 2015a). As discussed in Section 6, courses have included long-term
programs for government leadership, English language training to facilitate the transition to the
new official language, as well as short-term courses targeting public servants at large.

14
   One possible date for a return to stability is 1986, when President Museveni took power. However, violent conflict
with the Lord’s Resistance Army continued; 2006 reflects the year violent clashes with the LRA declined

                                                                                                                  28
Since its establishment, functionally, RIAM/RMI has been a facilitator of training for public
servants. On the government side, ministries identify and submit training needs to the NCBS,
which compiles these into an annual national capacity building plan. Specific needs related to
public administration (as opposed to technical training for health, education, or agricultural
extension workers) are used to set RMI’s training calendar. RMI then hires consultants and
provides facilities to carry out this training. RMI also acts as a hub through which donor partners
have delivered training. Training programs have targeted a variety of cadres. While open to the
public sector, private sector, and civil society, recipients of trainings have mainly been public
servants. NCBS-funded programing has been mostly short term (1–2 weeks) and focused on
in-service or topping up skills of the entire civil service. Partner-delivered training has included
some short-term workshops, but many have been longer-term degree programs. These have been
more narrowly targeted at developing a core management cadre. As discussed further below,
programs have included an MBA for senior government officials, as well as post graduate degrees
in human resource, financial, and project management.

4.2 Civil Service College Uganda (CSCU)
In Uganda, the CSCU was established to address a gap in performance management, rather
than in formal qualifications or technical skills. As noted above, public sector effectiveness saw
an initial postconflict improvement, followed by a more recent decline. Prior to the establishment
of the CSCU, a Ministry of Public Service training needs assessment found that civil servants
generally held degrees, certificates, and other training relevant to their technical profession. Yet
the public service was still perceived to be underperforming. While acknowledging that
institutional and structural conditions contributed to the underperformance, it was felt that overall
performance could be improved with targeted capacity building to “equip the personnel of public
institutions with the competences to perform their everyday duties.?15

It was felt that existing public administration training available in Uganda was not
sufficiently oriented toward the day-to-day work of civil servants—including cadres such as
local government officials, health workers, and the police. Though other public administration
programs are available (including at the Uganda Management Institute [UMI] and Makerere
University), it was felt that a national training institution for civil servants would contribute to
improving the overall quality of the public sector by continuously upgrading and refreshing the
skills, knowledge, and attitudes of public servants.16 As described in CSCU policy documents, the
goal is to “rebuild the public service value system, common ethos, ethics and accountability? and
“ensure that Public Officers possess knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to perform their jobs
effectively, take on new responsibilities, and adapt to changing conditions? (CSCU 2014b, 11) On
the one hand, the CSCU was seen as a way to ensure that people with a good general education
were familiar with civil service rules and regulations. On the other hand, training at the CSCU is
viewed as a performance management tool for reshaping civil servants’ behavior day to day—with

the aim of strengthening commitment to integrity and a public service orientation.

4.3 Liberia Institute of Public Administration (LIPA) and Financial
Management Training Program (FMTP)
LIPA was established to provide broad capacity development mainly through short-term
training. LIPA is the successor organization to an institute originally founded in 1969 which had
ceased to function during the civil war. As part of a wave of early postconflict reforms undertaken
in 2003, LIPA was revitalized with a mandate to contribute to the development of viable and
productive organizational capabilities by improving managerial skills. LIPA is seen as the main
provider of in-service training to civil servants—though it also runs courses for other interested
students.

In contrast, three years after the re-founding of LIPA, the FMTP was established to recruit
and develop a cohort of strong financial management and procurement professionals
through competitive selection combined with long-term training and special incentives. At
the end of the civil war, the Ministry of Finance and donor partners recognized the absence of
national financial management professionals as a critical constraint. As noted above, in 2005–06,
the government and donors had agreed to establish a Liberia GEMAP, through which international
experts would essentially co-manage Liberia’s revenue and expenditures for several years. The
establishment of the FMTP was a strategy to train national staff to fill key positions and take over
from technical assistants. Public finance courses at the University of Liberia (UL) were already
overenrolled, and LIPA was already overstretched with its mandate to provide broad-based
in-service training to the civil service and public at large. It was felt that a new more focused and
in-depth program was needed, and one that included competitive and merit-based selection into
the program to ensure the quality and integrity of trainees.

With high-level backing from the Ministry of Finance and the support of LIPA, the CSA,
and the UL, the FMTP was established in 2006. The objective was to recruit young, qualified
Liberians into a rigorous program to equip them with the necessary skills to carry out core
functions. After two years of full-time coursework, graduates receive an MBA degree and are
required to serve in government for four years. They are placed with a ministry, department, or
agency and receive a special pay package (see Annex 3 for further details). From the outset, the
intention was to use the program to scale up capacity over several years, and subsequently to
merge it with the UL.

LIPA and the FMTP illustrate the emerging distinction between two models for public
sector training institutes noted above. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that existing civil
servants would need to be trained to strengthen the overall capacity of the public service. Further,
skills would require updating over time. On the other hand, more in-depth training was required to
develop a ‘missing cadre.’ It was agreed that LIPA would offer short courses targeting the
capacitation of existing civil servants, while the FMTP would invest in long-term training for
financial management staff. With the intention of creating greater impact, this more narrowly
                                                                                                  30

5. How Do the Institutes Function: The Inputs
5.1 Institutional and management arrangements
Each of the institutes studied is a government-run institute. Table 7 summarizes institutional
arrangements across the cases, and a further detailed description of these arrangements can be
found in the individual case studies at the end of this note. In the case of CSCU, the choice of a
public (that is, government-run) institute was intentional; privately run training in public
administration is available in Uganda, but is felt to be overly generic (see Annex 1).
Policymakers note the importance of providing directly job-relevant skills as well as of building a
common ethos within the public sector. It was felt this could only be achieved by a program
directly managed by government. In the case of Rwanda, RIAM was a public agency and then
reestablished as a public corporation (RMI)—with the intention to gradually make the institute
more independent. Perceptions that RIAM/RMI has not been as successful as initially hoped may
be driving this.

With the exception of LIPA, each institute sits under a government ministry. Both CSCU and
RMI sit under their countries’ respective Ministry of Public Service. RMI also has a close
relationship with the NCBS under the Ministry of Finance. As noted in Section 3.1, NCBS
develops the annual national capacity building plan and manages Rwanda’s CBF. Once the annual

                                                                                                                      31
plan has been established, NCBS contracts RMI to deliver short courses targeting critical skills
gaps. In this respect, RMI is a service provider for NCBS and accountable to the NCBS for the
quality of services rendered.

FMTP sits under the Ministry of Finance, and also maintains close relationships with other
government institutions. The FMPT and UL have signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) under which the UL designs curriculum and awards degrees to graduates. The CSA
collaborates by identifying positions for graduates in government ministries, departments, and
agencies. This stands in contrast to LIPA, which has not found it easy to coordinate training with
the CSA. LIPA is a public agency and does not sit under any ministry; the Director General (DG)
is considered equivalent to a cabinet minister and reports to the President of Liberia.

Formally, each institute has a director who manages day-to-day operations (see Table 7).
With regard to management, the experiences of CSCU and RMI highlight the important role of
strong leadership, especially early on. The task of setting up the CSCU fell under the mandate of
the MoPS Commissioner for HRD. The Commissioner has been a champion of the college since
very early on in the policy-making process. A wide range of stakeholders attribute the early
successes of the CSCU to her leadership and dedication. She has been (and continues to be)


                                                                                                                   32
actively engaged in all aspects of the CSCU, forging partnerships, designing curriculum,
navigating internal bureaucratic procedures, overseeing construction, and marketing the college to
different clients. Though an acting director has been in place since June 2014, responsibility for
overall functioning of the college is still shared with the Commissioner HRD.

In contrast, from 2007 to 2012, RIAM/RMI has had three DGs—of which two were dismissed
for poor management—and for long periods had only an acting or interim director in place.
Because of this, RIAM faced difficulties making major decisions or carry out long-term planning.
The lack of consistent, effective leadership is perceived to have negatively impacted RIAM’s
ability to deliver. As laid out in a 2012 draft strategic plan, it was felt that RIAM ‘struggl ed to
implement its strategic priorities and has lacked well-defined goals and objects’ (RIAM 2011b).
The plan noted that RIAM focused on reacting to immediate demands, in part because of lack of
permanent leadership. With its transformation to RMI, a General Director was appointed and has
been in place since 2012.

5.2 Physical infrastructure
Table 8 summarizes the physical infrastructure available to RMI, CSCU, LIPA, and the
FMTP. Though each school has dedicated facilities, it should be noted that these vary with regard
to their complexity. The FMTP, for example, occupies rooms in a Ministry of Finance building.
Further, though the CSCU currently has its own dedicated facilities, the program piloted an
innovative model for mobile delivery of training. Before construction of CSCU buildings was
complete, the MoPS supplied a mobile unit with instructional supplies (computers, speakers,
projection screens, loudspeakers, and so on) that was used to reach subnational levels which play
an important role in governance and service delivery in Uganda.

The CSCU ‘caravan’ (equipped bus) traveled to cities across the country, particularly to
remote locations, to offer core courses; this approach was used to train 2,545 public officers
before the completion of college’s facilities. The ‘caravan approach’ reduced the cost of
transportation for participants by 97 percent and reduced overall costs by 19 percent compared to
having students come to the college facility.17 CSCU officials report that the vehicle has not been
difficult to supply or maintain, and none of the equipment has yet broken down or gone missing.
Because of its cost-effectiveness, stakeholders plan to continue using this innovative approach
especially to deliver training services to hard-to-reach local governments.

5.3 Cost and sources of funding
The overall costs of running public administration institutes have been relatively low, with a
variety of funding modalities. Table 9 reflects the estimated annual budget of each institute, as
well as the estimated annual budget required to carry out planned programming, which is generally
higher than actual funds available. With annual budgets of US$1–4 million, the cost of local
institutes is low relative to other avenues for capacity development such as overseas training or
filling gaps through the use of technical assistants.18

*Note: This figure does not reflect the cost of graduates’ salaries.

Diverse funding models were established for the institutes analyzed. In principle, two main
models are possible: under the first model, the school receives funding from the public budget or
from another source such as development partners, to fully cover all overhead and training costs,
and therefore does not need to charge fees either to MDAs or individual students. Under the
second model, annual training budgets are provided to MDAs, which can then choose how to
allocate those funds—for example, on courses held at the national public sector institute or
elsewhere. This requires the national institute to compete for students, and to charge fees on a
cost-recovery basis.

The first option can give the institute more certainty of funding if allocated budgets are broadly
adequate and if budget execution is aligned with plans, but can reduce the incentives to respond to
MDA needs. The second modality provides a strong incentive to be responsive, but if it is the only
modality, may make it challenging to cover core administrative costs (and creates incentives to
attract additional students who are not public servants); and also creates a risk if budget allocations
to MDAs fall short during the year. To ensure adequate funding for an institute in fiscally highly

18
  An exact comparison of costs is difficult, since having a national institute of public administration may reduce
reliance on TA over time, but will not do so completely or quickly; similarly, it may reduce, but not eliminate the need
for training abroad, in particular for rigorous academic study and special courses (for example, in macro-fiscal
modeling). The cost of a single international TA provider in an FCS often runs to around US$200,000 to pay for fees
and flights, and higher if per diems have to be added.


                                                                                                                     35
constrained and often volatile environments it may be best to allow the use of various modalities
(for example, some core budget funding plus some charges for courses or other forms of
generating own revenues).

In Liberia, LIPA receives an annual allocation from the national budget to cover a share of
operating expenses; while FMTP has been fully donor funded. The roughly US$1 million
budget allocation to LIPA covers 4 to 5 months of operating costs, and in addition, its employees
are on the public sector payroll. LIPA has also been supported by donor partners, and charges fees
for its courses on a cost-recovery basis. However, there have been problems collecting these fees
from ministries, departments, and agencies that send staff for training. LIPA reported that an
estimated US$2–5 million a year would be required to carry out all activities as planned.

In contrast, the FMTP has been entirely funded by two Bank projects (Economic Governance and
Institutional Reform Project, and subsequently, the Integrated Public Financial Management
Project). The program’s budget is approximately US$1.25 million per year. It does not raise
own-source revenue. The conception of FMTP as a time-bound program that would eventually be
merged into the UL made this option possible, and lifted the need to seek financial sustainability
that most other institutes would face.

In Rwanda, funding for RIAM was allocated as a line item in the national budget, while the
successor institute, RMI is expected to gradually raise more revenue through fees. While
receiving most of its funds from the budget, RIAM was already allowed to raise funds through the
provision of services or by renting its property. However, in 2011, own revenue raised by RIAM
made up only 2 percent of its annual budget (RMI 2012, 48). As a public corporation, RMI will be
expected to rely less on national budget allocations and more on fees charged for services. This
includes covering the cost of staff salaries. The NCBS which oversees the capacity-development
efforts, reimburses RMI for short courses delivered based on the number of people who complete
the training. The fee charged for public sector staff is roughly US$58 per day. For the private
sector, the cost is roughly US$88 per day. RMI’s annual action plan estimates the institute will

need roughly US$4.3 million to achieve its planned activities. In addition, donor partners have
funded specific programs at RMI.

The establishment of the CSCU was financed by the Bank’s Uganda Public Service
Performance Enhancement Project (UPSPEP), which contributed US$6 million toward:
construction of CSCU facilities in Jinja (US$2 million), operationalizing the CSCU (US$2.5
million), strengthening policy research (US$0.5 million), and supporting implementation of
innovative ideas (US$1 million). As of December 2014, the CSCU had not yet received any budget
allocations outside of the Bank-financed project, and there are no mechanisms in place to allow
CSCU to retain any revenue generated from services or rental of facilities. Discussions were
ongoing between stakeholders at CSCU, as well as within the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Public Service about how best to strike a balance between the models described above
(financing from public budget versus from cost-recovery fees). One specific concern was how to
ensure that CSCU stays responsive to MDA needs, while also ensuring affordability and access for
less well-off subnational districts that have limited training budgets.

5.4 Internal and external partnerships
All of the schools studied have ongoing relationships with other domestic institutions, and
additionally with external organizations. All institutes had partnership arrangements—with
regional schools of public service, regional professional associations, and international institutes
of public administration. In addition, the relationship with donors has not only entailed funding,
but also advice on training content and curricula design. The following highlights some of these
arrangements, and a more in-depth discussion is provided in the detailed case studies located at the
end of this note.

The FMTP stands out as well-functioning example of collaboration with other government
institutes. As noted above, the UL collaborates on curriculum design and awards degrees to
graduates. Further, the CSA arranges placements for graduates in the public service. This stands in
contrast to the experience of LIPA, which has had difficulty in coordinating selection of students,
curriculum design, and monitoring of results with the CSA. Additionally, FMTP was established
in collaboration with Bank staff who helped shape the objectives and scope of the program (that it
would provide in-country training to young professionals), as well as its recruitment
procedures—which has a reputation as being extremely competitive (see Section 6.2).

For the CSCU, there was also a strong working relationship with Bank staff supervising the
UPSPEP. Additionally, from 2006 until 2014, CSCU had a twinning arrangement with the
Government of Ontario (GoO). GoO and Ministry of Public Service officials built sustained, close
working relationships. As the result of multiple engagements over time, they jointly identified the
need for training in leadership development, competence-based recruitment, and performance
management. Curriculum for these modules was developed jointly, and were the first modules
delivered by CSCU.



                                                                                                 37
For RMI/RIAM, the role of partnerships has been central. As discussed further below, RMI
does not have strong in-house capacity to design or deliver courses. Rather it has served as a
coordinator of programs executed by nationally recruited consultants or executed by faculty from
foreign universities or national civil service training institutes, with funding from development
partners. Courses delivered by faculty from abroad have been well received. Graduates have
received degrees from these partner universities, which has enabled RMI to offer in-country
degree programs even though it is not itself accredited. A core partnership has been that with
Maastricht University (MSM) which began in 2000. Beyond delivery of training, the partnership
has included mentoring of RIAM/RMI staff on the daily management of the institute, as well as
assistance in carrying out institutional assessments and developing two strategic plans.

6. Faculty, Curriculum, and Training: The Outputs
6.1 Faculty and staff
With regard to staff, across the three wider-reaching institutes (LIPA, CSCU, RMI) staffing
plans envision a higher number of core administrative and management employees than are
actually in place. For CSCU, this may be driven by the fact that it had been operating with
minimal staff while its facilities were under construction and before it could scale up operations.
For RMI, repeated leadership changes (as noted in Section 5.1) appear to have limited the
institute’s development in recent years.

As teaching faculty, both CSCU and RMI use short-term contracted staff, but use different
sources with differing impacts on the quality of courses offered . For the CSCU, trainers are
active members of the public service from a wide array of ministries and local government, who
are contracted on an as-need basis.19 Parent ministries pay trainers’ regular salaries for the time
they are away from the office. The CSCU pays travel, per diem, and teaching allowances
equivalent to US$200 a day, which is considerably less the estimated US$500 a day it would cost
to hire from the private sector. In addition to cost-effectiveness, representatives from MoPS noted
it is easier to replace instructors who cancel at the last minute because of the large pool of certified
trainers on whom they can draw. Instructors receive support prior to running courses. They arrive
early to prepare material, practice lectures with CSCU full-time staff, and receive extensive
coaching. Feedback from civil servants who have taken CSCU courses reflect that instructors are
seen as credible, in particular because they are active public servants with relevant experiences to
impart.

   If full-time trainers are eventually required, there are regulations in place that would allow CSCU to second
certified trainers from their parent ministries to the college on a full-time basis.

Short-term contract trainers are seen to be a constraint on the quality of training for RMI .
For the delivery of NCBS-funded short courses, RMI relies on consultants hired on a part-time
basis. After the training calendar is developed in alignment with NCBS, RMI advertises for
consultants. As described below, RMI coordinates with consultants on the development of
curriculum. If a specific course is offered multiple times in a year, multiple consultants may be
hired. Training department staff reported it can be difficult to find one person with the availability
to conduct every session. While some consultants may come back each year, most do not. If
approved and implemented, the new organizational structure will put more emphasis on ‘in-house’
capacity to build curriculum and carry out short course training.

6.2 Selection of students
Ensuring the correct ‘match’ between those entering a classroom and the training offered is
critical if training is to be effective. Of the four institutes studied, FMTP has the most rigorous
selection process, through a competition which is open to all Liberians between the ages of 21 and
40 years. Interested candidates are invited to apply, and those who meet academic selection criteria
are invited to take an entrance aptitude exam. The 60 applicants with the best score are invited to
interviews, and 30 are invited to join the FMTP program. The process is generally viewed as
rigorous by students, faculty, and government agencies. In part, this system evolved because the
program is funded solely by a development partner who insisted on such a process.

All three other institutes mainly train civil servants already in post, and mostly take on
students without ex ante testing. By design, the CSCU intends to reach all public officers in each
courses’ targeted cadre. Thus, it is more a matter of matching public officers with the right course,
rather than selecting the most qualified candidates for a narrow program. Because the CSCU was
only recently established, and because there is a backlog of public service staff to be trained, it has
begun by engaging selectively with interested MDAs and local governments. So far, the client
MDA determines how to select or nominate trainees. The Ministry of Transport and Works, for
example, invited all 78 U3 and U4-level staff (senior and technical officers) to participate in
performance management and all 56 U1 and U2 staff (from heads of department to principle
officers) to participate in leadership and management development. Technical courses are attended


                                                                                                                 39
by civil servants requiring a specific skill set. For example, Public and District Service
Commissioners were trained in competency-based recruitment.

                          Selection of Students                              Perceived to be Well Targeted?

           training beneficiaries is drawn from MDA training          interest has not been a problem, but ensuring the
           plans.                                                     right ‘level’ of training based on job level or

           For longer courses sponsored by partners, selection        For partner programs, the experience has been
           varies. For some, applications have been vetted and        mixed. While some have managed to get the
           students admitted on the basis of their                    ‘right’ group in the room, others have had
           qualifications.                                            difficulty attracting the target audience.

For RMI, the list of training beneficiaries for RMI’s short courses is drawn from MDA
training plans and compiled by NCBS. Beneficiaries are matched with courses according to
generic interest areas, not based on their job level, previous training, or a needs assessment of
skills gaps. A 2013 institutional assessment of RMI identified this as a constraint to delivering
high-quality training. For programs delivered through partners, selection has varied. For one of the
MBA programs delivered by MSM, applications from government and outside of government
were encouraged. These applications were vetted and students were admitted on the basis of their
qualifications. Some places were reserved for RIAM staff. A similar process was conducted for
courses offered through the South African Public Administration Leadership and Management
Academy (PALAMA). A call for applications was circulated to ministries. Applicants were vetted
and admitted on the basis of qualifications.

For LIPA, there has been an expectation that Liberia’s CSA would participate in the
identification of civil servants in need of training, especially with regard to new recruits, but
this has not happened as envisioned. Though the CSA is mandated to recruit personnel equipped
with the requisite capabilities for entry into the civil service, it has not sent newly hired staff to


                                                                                                                          40
LIPA for induction and orientation, or to address any specific skills gaps. Stakeholders noted that
getting to this level of synchronization would require further investment, institutional
collaboration, and integrated information management. One lesson emerging from the experience
of RMI and LIPA is the crucial role played by other public sector agencies (MDAs, and
respectively NCBS and CSA) in matching civil servants with the right type of training.

A key consideration in the case of LIPA, RMI, and CSCU is the relatively weak link between
student selection, participation in courses, and career progression; there is a direct link only
for the FMTP, which places graduates in positions with government ministries.
There are two potential ways to make this link: by using training to competitively select
high-potential staff or to make certain training mandatory for holding certain positions (those
taking on responsibilities such as managing budgets for an agency, for example). Partly the limited
link seen with LIPA, RMI, and CSCU is related to the still limited coordination between the
institutes and public sector agencies. For example, though there was an expectation that Liberia’s
CSA (which has responsibility for recruiting personnel) would assist LIPA to identify civil
servants in need of training, coordination between the two has been limited. Another factor driving
the limited link with career progression is related to the capacity of the institutes to deliver —for
example, CSCU and MoPS officials expressed a desire to make induction at the college mandatory
for all new civil servants, but there were perceptions that CSCU was not yet ready to train all
incoming new staff. A further factor is the limited ability of the institutes to monitor which civil
servants have been trained (see Section 7) and to link this with systems for human resource record
keeping.

6.3 Curriculum design
Tables detailing courses offered by LIPA, FMTP, RMI, and CSCU are provided in the case studies
below. An overview is provided in Tables 13 and 14.

A key finding is that curriculum design—and especially whether it is well matched to the
actual learning needs of civil servants—is influenced by the effectiveness of collaboration
with other institutions, especially those with a mandate to assess capacity needs. While RMI,
LIPA, and CSCU seek to deliver relevant training, other agencies are tasked with carrying out
needs assessments or managing processes to identify skills gaps. Thus, the relevance of the
institutes’ curriculum depends in part on the quality of these processes—which is not always
something the institutes are in a position to influence. Financing-related incentives also play a
role—both RMI and CSCU offer tailor-made courses that are designed for the specific needs of the
MDA which funds the curriculum design and delivery of a course.

For both the FMTP and the CSCU, curriculum is designed to strengthen the performance of
existing or incoming civil servants. Efforts are made to ensure courses are related to specific
country regulations, procedures, and norms. For the FMTP, consultations were held with the
program’s partners (Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, the CSA, the Public

Procurement and Concessions Commission, the UL, and LIPA). The curricula is updated at least
once a year to ensure specific course contents are up-to-date and reflect the demand of the client
MDAs. For the CSCU, not only is curricula adapted to the country context, it is delivered by civil
servants already in their post who are familiar with the details of the regulatory environment and
its application in practice. As noted by the Director of CSCU, the emphasis has been “on short
courses that focus on specific missing skill set [which] is of great significance to civil service
capacity building…training is designed and implemented as a solution to a performance
challenge.?

CSCU offers two types of training, general ‘cross-cutting’ courses and ‘tailor-made’ courses
for specific MDAs and local governments. “Cross-cutting? courses target specific cadres of the
public service and cover key skill sets for each group. These were developed with the financial
support of the Bank UPSPEP20 and through a twinning arrangement with the GoO. For these
courses, inputs to the curriculum came from a needs assessment of the public service, the
development of competency profiles for certain cadres of jobs, and a document review, as well as
interviews and workshops with Ugandan senior managers. For tailor-made courses, MDAs or LGs
approach the CSCU with a specific request. The curriculum is then designed in collaboration with
the client-MDA or LG to meet specific needs.

When LIPA was revitalized in 2003, it conducted a national capacity-needs assessment in
collaboration with the CSA. This included the circulation of questionnaires, focus group
sessions, and interviews with 5 percent of civil servants.21 Newspapers publications and feedback
from public sector leadership, observation studies, and feedback from MDIs in West Africa
influenced the formulation of the curriculum. Customized courses are designed as per the need of
requesting institutions. In most cases, the process for amendment and or update to the curriculum
is influenced by feedback from students, participants, and client institutions, changes in
government policy decisions, and development strategies. This is done every three years. As of
2015, LIPA is in the process of updating its curriculum.

In Rwanda, for NCBS-funded short courses, once the calendar is set, RMI recruits
consultants who are responsible for delivering training, as well as designing the specific
content for each course. Consultants then draw up specific curricula for their sessions. Detailed

course outlines, as well as power points, reading lists or other training material is developed by
consultants. In some cases, the same basic courses were offered multiple times to the same
audience. Further, in contrast to CSCU which builds in time for coaching its trainers, RIAM/RMI
has not yet been able to provide very strong mentoring, guidance, or quality control over
consultants’ work. For programs offered in collaboration with partners, the focus has been on the
delivery of Masters, MBA, diploma, or certificate programs, as well as workshops, mostly
delivered by partner institutes on RMI’s campuses. Partners adapt this training to the Rwandan
context both through the independent efforts of their own trainers and in consultation with RMI.

7. What Can Be Said About Impact?
As set out in Section 2, the effectiveness of the public sector is driven by a range of factors or
‘ecosystem’ of variables (see Figure 1), and the impact of successful initiatives in any one
area will depend on whether other variables jointly move toward greater capacity . As a
result, even a rigorous, credible program may have limited effect on moving the entire system
toward greater capacity if other mechanisms do not also move in the same direction. Furthermore,
even if overall improvements in government capacity/effectiveness can be observed, there is a
problem of attribution.

Furthermore, there has as yet been no effort at systematically monitoring impact. None of
the institutions has yet established systematic monitoring and follow up either at the individual
level or at the level of administrative units—albeit some plan to do so in future. The Bank has
assessed the success of its support for CSCU, but this does not entail a specific monitoring of what
participants have retained from their courses or how they have been able to use this in their jobs.22

While noting these limitations, this section summarizes what information on impact is
available—mainly the number and ratio of staff reached through different levels of training, and
key existing information on whether training was perceived as useful and effective. As this section
notes, several of the institutes plan to strengthen impact monitoring going forward.

7.1 Number and ratio of civil servants trained
As discussed further below, what we can say about impact is limited by the scope of this
study, and by the data the institutes, parent ministries, and donors have collected. One
available indicator across all institutes studied is the number of people trained. Given the
functionality outlined in Section 5, Table 16 provides an overview of the number of civil service
staff reached since the respective establishment of each institute.

available for the support to RIAM, and the Liberia operation is yet to be completed.

Note: * This reflects the estimated number of civil servants graduating from specific programs or short courses
offered. Individuals may enroll in more than one course a year, or may enroll in multiple courses a year. Private
citizens may enroll for training, but are not reflected in the figures above.
** This line reflects the number and percent of civil servants sent to LIPA for training by their employer. A further
1,168 Liberians have self-enrolled and paid their own way through LIPA, many of whom may be civil servants. In
total the institute has reached 2,653 Liberian citizens. If all were public sector employees, LIPA would have reached 6
percent of the civil service.

In Uganda, as noted above, the CSCU began delivering courses through the ‘caravan
approach’ in 2011 and reached 2,545 civil servants through this modality. Before its official
opening in November 2014, the CSCU had trained an additional 108 public officers on its campus
in Jinja. As noted in Section 3, the CSCU trains public officers serving in a wide array of functions,
including local government officials, health workers, and the police. It has not yet sought to
provide induction or other courses for teachers (which account for slightly over half of all public
sector employees). In total, the CSCU has reached 2 percent of the civil service, excluding teachers
(and just under 1 percent if one includes teachers).23 Of the newly recruited public officers who
joined central MDAs since 2011, the CSCU has trained 36 percent, as reflected in Table 17. It is
worth noting that the CSCU outperformed the expectations of the Bank UPSPEP results
framework, which set a target of only 600 public officers completing a specific training course.24

In Rwanda, between 2010 and 2015, RIAM/RMI trained 9,135 civil servants through short
courses, workshops, MBA, and diploma programs. This is roughly 8 percent of the civil
service—and by far the largest number and share of staff reached among the institutes reviewed
here. MBA, MA, and diploma programs targeting mid-level and senior managers have reached
204 civil servants (see Table 18). In a recent action plan, RMI has set out a goal of training 22,532
public servants through government-funded programs between 2013 and 2018. To achieve this
goal, it would need to reach roughly 3,750 participants a year, about 1,700 a year more than have

With regard to LIPA, 1,485 civil servants have attended training between 2007 and 2013
(Table 19). Roughly 80 percent of these were sponsored by government; the remaining 20 percent
of civil servants paid their own way, or were privately sponsored. LIPA has provided training to an
estimated 4 percent of Liberia’s public service. An additional 1,168 Liberians have completed
coursework at LIPA. Since January 2007, 60 percent of people trained at LIPA have been men, 40
percent have been women.

Since its establishment in 2006, the FMTP graduated 111 people from the two-year financial
management component, and 54 people from the procurement component. For the financial
management component, 14 percent of the first cohort were women. For the second, the figure was
only 4 percent, but increased to 24 percent for the third cohort. Of those accepted into the fourth
cohort, 9 percent were women.

Note: An additional 30 people are being trained in the procurement component, but have not yet graduated.
* Data was collected before graduates from ‘Cohort 4’ had completed their four years of service with their assigned
MDA.

Overall, these figures indicate that reaching an entire civil service through public sector
training efforts is challenging. The Ugandan experience indicates in particular that in-country
organized training can target training public servants at subnational levels in ways that a less
institutionalized and country-led effort would struggle to do. The NCBS-organized and
contract-based delivery in Rwanda has allowed the widest reach, but this has also entailed some
weaknesses and variation in the quality of courses delivered.

In-depth training—as provided to some groups at RMI in Rwanda and through FMTP in
Liberia—focuses on a much smaller group; while it has in principle the potential to deliver
very important core and specialized cadres. The performance and career development of these
trainees would be most important for subsequent follow-up—and could be compared to similar
staff who received training abroad—to understand whether the investments made have an impact;
and also the potential for cost savings relative to out-of-country training. Furthermore, for
short-term courses targeting broader cohorts, it could be attempted to monitor whether there are
unit-wide improvements for example, in processing information and following rules as intended
that can be observed once a critical share of staff have participated in training courses. To do so
would require baseline (pre-training) and subsequent (post-training) assessments for the overall

effectiveness of specific units.

7.2 Quality of the training

CSCU
Given that the CSCU is still new and not yet at full capacity, it is not yet possible to fully
understand the impact the college will have on civil service performance in the longer run.
There are some early indications of possible positive impact. The public officers interviewed for
this report 25 mentioned the importance of the practical training offered by the CSCU. In
comparison to other in-service training they had received—which was academic, abstract, or
based on case studies from other countries—it was noted that the college’s programming focuses
on skills necessary for the day-to-day jobs of civil servants. It was also noted that CSCU trainers
were dynamic and engaging, capturing the attention of even those who were initially most
skeptical or uninterested in the course. Multiple people interviewed for this study mentioned that
both the relevance of the material and dynamic trainers convinced them to recommend CSCU to
other colleagues or to send their employees through the college.

In a 2014, CSCU carried out an evaluation on the post-training application of learning
focusing on an induction course for Deputy Chief Administrative Officers (DCAOs) held in
November 2013. In this evaluation, the CSCU reports 95 percent satisfaction (‘very good’ or
‘excellent’). DCAOs reported they gained knowledge (33 percent ‘significant’, 49 percent
‘somewhat significant’) and skills significant for their job (79 percent) (CSCU 2014a, 11). The
evaluation also notes that as part of the course, it became apparent that DCAOs were not using
computers in their daily work. Most handwrote memos and other material, which were typed by
secretaries and revised by hand. As a result of the training, DCAOs report using their laptop
computers more frequently, especially MS Word and email functions. In interviews for this case
study, the head of the Public Service Commission reported that after District Commissioners
attended training on competence-based recruitment, complaints about hiring practices from some
of the most ‘troublesome’ districts decreased.

RMI
Based on interviews carried out for this report, it emerged that there is some
disappointment with RIAM/RMI’s performance among stakeholders. This largely has to do
with issues around management of the institute, which then affected its ability to deliver, and also
appears to be one of the drivers of the 2013 reorganization of RIAM into RMI. On the positive
side, since its establishment, functionally, RIAM/RMI has been able to serve as a coordinator of
training for public servants, and as a hub through which partners have delivered training. Partner
programs in particular have been viewed quite positively. One successful example was the 2003–

25
   Approximately 20 public officers from the Public Service Commission, Ministry of Works and Transportation,
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Public Service were
interviewed for this report.


                                                                                                             49
2004 MBA program for government officials delivered by MSM. Those involved report that the
cohort of young, energetic civil servants graduates who went through the program are now
ministers, ambassadors, and other senior level offices. A tracer study is being developed to better
understand the impact of this program.

LIPA and FMTP
There has been limited reporting on the quality of training at LIPA, or perceptions of
impact. This has been attributed to the poor coordination between LIPA and the CSA, whose
mandate would include monitoring the outputs and outcomes of civil service training. On the other
hand, stakeholders interviewed for this report provided positive feedback on certain aspects of the
courses, including from local government and the Ministry of Education. Positive comments were
given with regard to courses targeting women leadership in particular. In addition, the willingness
of some civil servants and the demand from non-civil servants indicates that there is a perceived
benefit to completing the training at the institute.

The FMTP is perceived to be rigorous, and there has been great demand from within MoF
and from line ministries for FMTP graduates. This seems to be driven by the caliber of
graduates, who are seen to be the most computer-literate and competent public finance
professionals in the country. Stakeholders interviewed for this report also provided positive
feedback. One graduate of the procurement program reported that he was better able to connect the
theoretical components of public procurement with the legal framework and practical elements of
day-to-day procurement management. Others attribute the increases in accountability;
improvements in open budget preparation; and timely reporting on national expenditure to the
contributions of program graduates. To move beyond perceptions, a graduates’ monitoring scheme
has been introduced to monitor the extent to which graduates are applying knowledge and skills
acquired during training. It also aims to assess the impact of graduates’ contribution to
procurement and financial management activities at the ministries and agencies where they were
deployed.

An evaluation of the FMTP was conducted in January 2013, indicating some of the savings
that can be made when well-trained national staff become available. After completing the
coursework, FMTP graduates are given four-year placements with government MDAs. At the end
of these four years, there is an expectation that graduates will be absorbed into the regular civil
service and onto the nominal rolls of their ‘host’ agency. Given that a first batch of graduates was
slated to complete its four years of service under their FMTP compacts in April 2013, the report
commented on the absorption and regularization of ‘alums’ into the civil service. It found that as of
January, 34 percent of graduates had already been absorbed onto their ministries’ payroll. The
report also found that FMTP graduates had specifically been assigned to specialized projects
funded by donors. Here, the goal to replace external TA with competent, and less expensive,
national staff seems to have succeeded. The report found that the salary of other project staff was
almost three times higher than that of the FMTP graduates. The key challenge for the sustainability


                                                                                                  50
of impacts of the program is whether graduates will be willing to work for lower regular public
sector salaries and for how long.

7.3 Institutes’ performance and trends in overall public sector effectiveness
It is worth considering how the tentative impacts of the institutes observed here correspond
with the CPIA and WGI government effectiveness trends laid out in Section 3. Given the
problems of attribution noted in Section 2, it is not possible or sensible to draw a causal link
between training efforts made and overall governance trends. However, it is useful to locate these
schools within the wider context of these trends, and whether they appear to have corresponding or
diverging trajectories.

A corresponding trajectory between the quality of training institutes corresponds to the
quality and/or trends of overall perceived public sector effectiveness could also be expected
due to reverse causation—for example, a country with an already better-functioning public
sector could be expected to have a higher likelihood of establishing a well-functioning public
service training institute. In sum, for Liberia, there is some correspondence in trends between the
establishment of LIPA and the FMTP and gradual improvement in indicators, but interestingly,
less so for Rwanda and Uganda. It is important to underline that the number of cases considered
here is very small and was selected to include challenging but reasonably successful postconflict
cases.

For Liberia, government effectiveness and public administration quality is seen as gradually
improving from an initially very low base. LIPA has been reestablished with some success;
while there is still a long way to go with regard to increasing the reach and quality of training, and
also of establishing an effective relationship with the CSA. FMTP has been stronger, but this has
been achieved while operating as an externally funded and supervised ‘enclave’. According to
CPIA data, progress has been greater for PFM than for public administration generally. 26 This is
consistent with the fact that particularly intensive attention has been focused on PFM
strengthening, through GEMAP and the FMTP as an associated effort. It remains to be seen
whether the upward trend can be continued as the country recovers from the shock of the 2014–15
Ebola crisis.

Rwanda has developed the best-performing public administration among the group; and
governance data indicate that significant gains were made in the early 2000s —coinciding
with the early period of RIAM’s existence. Yet this presents a puzzle; though RIAM/RMI has
carried out training on the largest scale of the institutes reviewed here (and targets a further
quantitative expansion), there appear to be weaknesses in the quality of the short courses offered,
as well as in matching the right staff with the right training opportunities. Since 2007, the institute
also suffered from several turnovers in leadership. This stands in contrast to the overall perception

26
  Budget management received a CPIA rating of 3.0 for 2013 and 2014; the quality of public administration rating
has remained at 2.5.


                                                                                                               51
of comparatively effective governance in Rwanda.27 Establishing a monitoring system may be
particularly valuable; and Rwanda is likely to be an interesting case to revisit over time, as over the
coming decade, a high ratio of core civil servants at central and subnational levels should have
been reached by training efforts. The coordinating role played by NCBS is also an important asset
in principle.

In contrast to Liberia and Rwanda, public sector performance in Uganda is seen to have
made gains in the 1990s, but then to have largely stagnated and according to CPIA data,
having declined in particular with regard to PFM since 2010. Thus, key gains were made
during the initial postconflict period.28 In this case, the link takes a different form: the effort to
establish a training institute responded to the perceived stagnation in gaining further effectiveness,
as indicated by some of the policy documents highlighted in Section 4.2. If the renewed attention
to improving public sector governance that this motivation signals will truly be effective remains
to be seen in the coming years.

8. Conclusion: Interesting Findings and Emerging Lessons
This note has sought to take a granular look at the experience of establishing public service
training institutes in three countries that have emerged from conflicts and that have been
seeking to build greater government capacity. These efforts have been supported by external
partners, including the Bank. The empirical range of experiences included here is limited—in
particular, the team did not visit any countries where efforts were made but failed altogether.
Keeping these limitations in mind, the following insights can be drawn from the experiences
reviewed:
        (a) Public sector training institutes are relatively low-cost. LIPA, FMTP, and CSCU all
             cost roughly between US$1–2 million a year to operate—albeit optimal budgets that
             would allow further improvements are likely to be in the US$3–4 million range. This
             is a relatively low-cost investment, relative to potential savings on technical assistants
             and out-of-country training. For investments in FMTP-style programing that can
             contribute to replacing international technical assistants within 2–3 years and also for
             in-country in-depth senior management training as offered through RMI, the
             cost-effectiveness is most directly measurable, while for other training programs the
             effects are more diffuse.

         (b) Effectiveness of institutes remains as yet uncertain, with some positive indications.
             Given that none of the institutes have implemented systematic M&E so far, reliably
             assessing whether they are effective at increasing individual and ultimately


27
   As in Liberia, the rating for budget management has been somewhat higher than for public administration, with the
former rated ‘4’ on the 1–6 scale since 2006, while the latter is rated 3.5 (with a single rating of 4 in 2010). See Figure
2.
28
   The CPIA rating for PFM slipped from ‘4’ to ‘3.5’ and then ‘3’ since 2010. For 2014, it increased again to 3.5. The
CPIA rating for public administration has remained at 3 for the past decade.


                                                                                                                        52
              institutional capacity is not possible for the time being. Short-term courses are
              generally not able to fundamentally address skills gaps; but if civil servants have at
              least ‘good enough’ general training, they can make a difference in understanding
              processes and specific (and often recently introduced) public sector rules and
              systems—similar to in-house training run by many types of public and private
              organizations around the world. Available evidence suggests that participants assess
              training positively—but this would need to be corroborated through more robust
              assessments such as systematic surveys and performance assessments prior to
              trainings, as well as after some time after trainings has elapsed.

        (c) The two cases of in-depth courses covered—those offered by the FMTP and run at
            RMI—still significantly rely on external partnerships; however, bringing them
            ‘in-country’ seems cost-effective and is likely to have positive spill-over effects (for
            example, FMTP has hired and trained local faculty to deliver courses enabling repeat
            training for multiple cohorts which is often needed in fluid postconflict contexts; and
            country-based in-depth training may reduce the tendency of such staff being lost to
            international migration—while trained staff may still leave the public sector after
            their required years of service). It is also relevant to recall that most countries which
            are widely recognized as having pursued successful public sector strengthening have
            used training institutes as one element in pursuing this goal. This is the case for
            example, both in Malaysia and Ethiopia, as well as many EU accession and
            neighborhood countries.

        (d) Developing sufficient reach is a key challenge. As the cases analyzed indicate, the
            challenge of reaching a significant share of staff is high: in Liberia and Uganda, so far,
            only 0.5 percent of civil servants are reached through institute-based training
            annually; while in Rwanda, the rate has been 1.8 percent per year. Thus, in principle
            reaching just 20–30 percent of staff would take about one decade in Rwanda, and at
            current rates four decades in Liberia and Uganda.29 Governments and development
            partners may jointly want to consider how such rates can be increased, for example,
            through developing some initial simple options for ‘multipliers’ who bring training
            back to their administrative units, and some initial simple use of virtual training. In
            addition, this challenge speaks to the need for establishing systematic training efforts
            as early in a postconflict situation as possible.

        (e) Public sector training efforts are more likely to be well calibrated and have an impact
            if there is an effective institutional interplay shaping the functioning of
            capacity-building efforts. In Rwanda, NCBS sets the training calendar and identifies
            trainees. In Liberia and Uganda, the CSA and Public Service Commission
29
  Since short-term courses offered by development partners and TA efforts often continue in parallel, the actual
number and share of staff reached through some form of training is higher; but it is even more challenging to
systematically track who was trained in what.


                                                                                                                   53
      (respectively) have yet to make attendance at induction training mandatory or link
      training with career development. The Ministry of Finance plays an important role in
      guiding the FMTP. Thus, policymakers wishing to support effective training need to
      consider the wider context, and how best to calibrate and link institutes’ mandate and
      functions.

(f)    Linking recruitment to in-depth pre-service training is potentially an important
      avenue towards increasing impact; but in postconflict situations there is also
      inevitably a need for significant in-service training. In-depth and short-term training
      can be combined within one institute, as in the case of RMI; or take more separate
      forms as in Liberia. Recruiting based on competitive entrance exams can help to select
      and then grow key staff, but such a system is more demanding to establish. Short-term
      training has an important role to play given also some of the specific conditions of a
      postconflict country: staff often come together from very diverse
      backgrounds—including having spent time abroad or fighting—and ethnic diversity
      and divisions may need to be addressed. Moreover, there is often a significant creation
      of new rules and regulations in postconflict situations, and short-term courses can
      greatly help staff to be familiar with regulatory requirements. For shorter programs it
      may be sensible to establish a basic screening of general qualifications needed to
      absorb the material being presented, and to ensure that civil servants are matched with
      the right level of training. Screening and competitive recruitment tend to be politically
      more sensitive and challenging than training as such for the reasons noted in Section
      2.

(g) Monitoring of impact should be considered and established early; and more effort
    needs to go in this direction—including support from development partners. As the
    case studies indicate, there are intentions for better monitoring, but these remain at
    early stages. Public service institutes or their managing secretariats can be crucial
    hubs for collecting information about what training has been delivered and which
    agencies and individuals received what training—including courses delivered by
    these institutes themselves, and ideally also through other capacity building efforts.
    Further, as discussed by the Director of the CSCU, tracer studies can help to establish
    “whether a training solution works or not, identify challenges and opportunities and
    help to design workable solutions.? Better impact monitoring would begin to provide
    a better handle on the process of capacity development in postconflict environments,
    and how these efforts can be improved. Being able to demonstrate impact could also
    facilitate attracting sustained funding. Establishing monitoring mechanisms may need
    some early provision of funds and advice from external partners, as most postconflict
    governments are not able to provide more than a minimum for operating such
    institutions.




                                                                                            54
             Specifically, institutes may consider tracking information that could address two sets
             of questions: (a) did the individual trainee absorb material covered in the course? and
             (b) did specific institutional capabilities targeted by the training improve? The first
             could be assessed through a simple pre- and post-test. The second could be tracked by
             following up with managers or internal or external clients of those trained.
             Specifically, institutes could try training sets of participants from the same ministry or
             agency to increase the ‘saturation’ of training on legal provisions, processes, and
             systems. Following up about whether specific processes have improved within
             specific agencies or departments would then be easier to assess compared to tracking
             individual performance or contribution to improved ways of working.

Beyond these cross-cutting findings, each of the countries and institutes revisited for this study had
some features that stand out as worth considering by others:

            Getting the leadership structure and selection of good leadership right is important
             for establishing well-performing institutes. The cases highlight the importance of a
             leader who is passionate about the mission of the institution, but who can also
             champion the institute with relevant supervising ministries and among political and
             fiscal decision makers. Linked to this is the importance of political support, which
             came from the President in the case of Uganda and from the Minister of Finance in the
             case of the FMTP. Conversely, RMI indicates that problems with leadership selection
             and continuity affect an institute’s performance.

            To select good management and establish effective relationships with other
             institutions (for example, Ministries of Public Service and the MDAs sending
             participants for training) requires political backing and attention especially during
             critical early periods. In all three countries studied here, political leadership has
             sought to strengthen public services, while also pursuing competing goals to different
             degrees (ensuring political loyalty, balancing different vested interests).

            Utilizing a pool of civil servants as trainers complemented by in-house staff: A big
             risk of institutes of public administration in a low-income country is that it is difficult
             to attract sufficiently good staff for delivering quality courses, and the range of course
             material to be delivered is quite wide as discussed in Section 6. Therefore, some
             outsourcing is sensible. Contracting experienced civil servants as trainers seems to be
             a better model compared to contracting freelance consultants; while in addition, some
             in-house capacity to help trainers shape their courses appears to make an important
             contribution to the quality of courses.

            Delivering of quality training early on contributes to creating demand and credibility
             and partnerships can help strengthen performance during early periods. In particular,
             CSCU has managed to deliver training that appears to be perceived as well designed


                                                                                                     55
             and relevant, and this has started to lead to additional demand. This aspect is
             challenging at early postconflict stages, but can be addressed. FMTP benefited from
             close partnership with Bank teams. With regard to the courses themselves, the most
             well-received programs at RMI early on were delivered by MSM. CSCU benefited
             from a long and collaborative relationship with the GoO. These successful
             partnerships were sustained over a number of years.

            A mobile approach offers an interesting option for reaching subnational levels.
             Reaching local government staff is increasingly important as populations expand and
             more functions are devolved in many countries. Establishing permanent regional
             subsidiaries would be (too) costly in many situations. The ‘caravan approach’ as used
             in Uganda prior to the construction of CSCU’s campus proved feasible and
             cost-effective. Going to counties rather than delivering courses at a central campus
             also allowed the CSCU staff to assess the overall context in which subnational staff
             carry out their assigned functions and contribute to resolving bottlenecks beyond
             ‘training’ (for example, the absence of laptops was a key constraint on IT literacy and
             actual use of IT for day-to-day operations).

            Long-term partnerships with other more well established institutes—both regional
             and global—can make important contributions. Where these partnerships have been
             effective for RMI and CSCU, they go beyond one-off inputs such as development of
             curricula or a strategic plan. Rather they included longer-term relationships, allowing
             individuals involved to interact repeatedly over time, and to gain sufficient
             understanding of the context to be able to provide quality and relevant inputs; and
             sustained inputs to developing and also delivering course content. The overall
             recovery and strengthening of tertiary education in Africa in particular offers
             opportunities for increasing regional relationships between more developed schools
             of public service in the region and those in countries in earlier postconflict phases,
             such as South Sudan and Somalia (both of which have strong ties in particular with
             Kenya and Uganda).

Overall, the experiences reviewed here indicate that what has been achieved by the four
programs reviewed has benefits, but is still limited with regard to making a dent in
postconflict capacity constraints even in the narrow sense of closing or reducing specific
skills and knowledge gaps. A clear benefit relative to short-term courses delivered by consultants
contracted directly by development partners is the fact that course materials have been more
tailored and that curricula can be retained and repeated. For the majority of civil servants reached,
training still remains short-term, and there is as yet little systematic follow-up. Short-term courses
may have benefits where most public servants have the required general skills for their positions,
and where training can focus on specific areas, new regulations, or similar issues (as in Uganda).
Where existing skills tend to be weaker and more uneven (as in Liberia and other postconflict


                                                                                                   56
countries such as South Sudan, Somalia, or East Timor), in-depth investments in key cadres, as
well as training in general skills will be important complementary efforts.

Thus, in each postconflict country, governments and development partners may need to
carefully consider options for the delivery of public service-focused training efforts. This
includes options for offering sequences of courses that can build greater knowledge over time, and
for more in-depth pre-service training of 3–12 months, possibly in combination with some on the
job induction. Reaching a sufficiently large number of existing and newly recruited staff through
more in-depth training would, however, imply a higher cost—which so far both governments and
development partners seem reluctant to incur. There may also be opportunities to deliver at least
some training virtually, as public sector staff increasingly have at least some computer access and
literacy.30 Again, investments in monitoring of effectiveness will be essential for capturing what
types of investments can best deliver tangible increases in capacity; and this will require some
political will to ‘open up’ to surveys and other ways for monitoring impact.

9. Priorities for Further Work
Stabilizing fragile states and achieving greater resilience continues to rise as a key priority for the
international community. Especially for low-income countries, capacity development of the public
sector is a crucial aspect of achieving more effective and well-performing institutions. Noting the
range of factors that influence public sector capacity in Section 2, this study has honed in on one
particular mechanism—that is, delivery of training through in-country, government-managed,
public sector training institutes.

In parallel to this effort, complementary granular evidence on several related factors and how they
evolve in postconflict environments is beginning to emerge, for example, through case studies on
pay (Bhatia and Prasad, forthcoming) and on how choices are made between building capacity and
outsourcing service delivery (Srivastava and Blum, forthcoming). While all of these are important
contributions, there are a number of issues which still need to be covered, or for which evidence
from a wider range of countries/experiences is needed.

The following aspects are suggested as key priorities for further analytic work. These are
identified as priorities with regard to providing policymakers and development partners in
postconflict environments with important insights for shaping capacity strengthening efforts.

              With regard to training as such, it would be valuable to generate a wider range of
               empirical insights, possibly adding at least three further experiences) including some
               Francophone African countries, as well as low-income fragile states in other regions.

  These could be distributed on plug-and-play devices rather than online, given that access to higher-speed internet is
mostly still limited and costly.


                                                                                                                    57
               An exploration of the modalities and effectiveness of on-the-job mentoring and
                complementarity with classroom-based courses; and assessments of the effectiveness
                of these modalities. As noted in Section 2, this is often prescribed as part of TA, but is
                widely perceived as not very effective—but without a clear evidence base. It would
                also be interesting to explore options for impact monitoring that cover both
                classroom-based and on-the job training, in particular for staff in core MDAs where
                significant TA is prevalent (Ministries of Finance, planning agencies, Ministries of
                Civil Service, revenue agencies, and so on). Efforts at building impact evaluation
                systems into capacity development in several low-income, postconflict countries have
                been initiated (for example, in Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and
                South Sudan), and should yield first results over the coming 2–3 years.31 To deliver a
                set of policy-relevant insights, the rigorous but narrow focus of IEs may still need to
                be complemented with wider monitoring efforts.

Regarding other factors in the ‘ecosystem’ shaping public sector capacity:

               The organization of and options for improving recruitment functions—either early on
                or (more challenging) once relatively poor recruitment has taken place on various
                scales.

               Further work on levels of public sector pay in a wider range of postconflict and other
                low-income countries—with regard to pay scales and their composition and options
                for flexibility in volatile environments, fiscal affordability, competitiveness with
                salaries offered by development partners and NGOs, and motivation. Initial studies
                have recently been completed (Prasad 2015; Srivastava et al., forthcoming), but this is
                an area in which further work would be valuable.

               Work on employment conditions and security of tenure and how to weigh a potential
                need for turnover with the need for preventing politicized layoffs (for example, after a
                turnover in government); this would help calibrate technical advice on how to shape
                civil service legislation in postconflict contexts.

               Further work on the composition of public employment relative to key service delivery
                areas: basic data on the civil service—such as total numbers employed, distribution
                across levels of government and across sectors—remains surprisingly scarce; making
                it more challenging to provide evidence-based recommendations on good practices in
                this regard.

               Experiences with establishing public sector pension schemes after a period of
                conflict. The need to establish such schemes recurs across postconflict countries; and

31
     See http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEVIMPEVAINI/Resources/ieGovern_flyer.pdf.


                                                                                                       58
            while such schemes remain missing, a renewal of the civil service often remains
            difficult. However, fiscal costs as well as the institutional arrangements for
            administering such a scheme can pose important challenges—and learning lessons
            from experience would provide an important input.

           Identification of what works with regard to performance-oriented management in
            challenging environments. As the experience of Rwanda and several other countries
            indicate, clear political communication and commitment to achieving results is
            essential for making significant gains in government effectiveness. At the same time,
            many efforts at transferring specific mechanisms for performance-oriented
            management in low-capacity environments have not been successful, and can even
            distract from efforts at establishing basic functionality. Understanding better where
            and how to invest in performance management in postconflict countries could
            potentially be important.

As further empirical work is carried out and becomes available, a more comprehensive analysis
should become possible in the sense of seeking to identify the relative contribution made by each
of these factors, as well as their sequencing over time.

Annex 1: Civil Service College Uganda
The CSCU was established under the Ministry of Public Service in July 2010 at the written request
of the President of Uganda. Planning for and construction of a facility began in June 2010.
Simultaneously, CSCU began training civil servants through an innovative process known as the
‘caravan approach’. This provided a mobile training van with all the facilities required to support a
learning intervention and trainers would move in the van to wherever they needed to be in the
country and provide training. Construction of facilities located in Jinja, about 1.5 hours outside
Kampala, was completed on June 2014 and classes on campus began in September 2014. The
college was officially opened by the President of Uganda on November 17, 2014.

Rationale for establishment
From 1969 to 1992, Uganda had a national training institution, the Institute for Public
Administration (IPA), which was part of the Ministry of Public Service. Its mission was to provide
training to mid-level civil servants across government, and it offered courses to university
graduate recruits into the Ugandan Public Service. Initially financed and staffed by development
partners, the IPA faced a number of management and budgeting challenges over the course of its
twenty-year history. These included reliance on MoPS for decisions on key management functions
like hiring, firing, and disciplinary actions. Because IPA did not manage its own budget and was
not a signatory on its own checks, its funding could be easily reallocated to other ministry
priorities. Further, rather than attract top quality teaching staff, the IPA became a place to ‘park’
civil servants who had failed in other posts (Kalebbo 2005).

Given these challenges, the IPA was privatized in 1992 and transformed into the UMI. Its mission
became “to strengthen leadership, management, and institutional capacity of public and private
sector organizations, NGOs and CSOs? (Kalebbo 2005). UMI continues to offer courses in public
administration and offers degrees up to the post-graduate level. Yet, stakeholders interviewed for
this report felt that UMI’s programs were not sufficiently oriented toward the day-to-day work of
civil servants. It was felt that, though other public administration programs are available in
Uganda, a national training institution for civil servants would contribute to improving the overall
quality of the public sector by continuously upgrading and refreshing the skills, knowledge, and
attitudes of public servants.32

A 2012 Ministry of Public Service training needs assessment found that civil servants generally
were well educated with degrees, certificates and other training relevant to their technical
profession. Yet the public service was still perceived to be underperforming. While
acknowledging that institutional and structural conditions contributed to the underperformance, it
was felt that overall performance could be improved with targeted capacity building to “equip the
personnel of public institutions with the competences to perform their everyday duties?33

                                                                                                                  61
This vision was laid out in national development policy (NDP) documents, including the NDP I,
which identified establishment of the civil service college as a mechanism for developing a
“skilled, able and committed? public service (CSCU 2014b, 11). The establishment of a college
was seen as contributing to the objectives of Uganda’s PRSP, especially the development of
effective leadership and management.34 CSCU policy documents reflect this mission, describing a
mission to “rebuild the public service value system, common ethos, ethics and accountability? and
“ensure that Public Officers possess knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to perform their jobs
effectively, take on new responsibilities, and adapt to changing conditions? (CSCU 2014b, 11).

Institutional setup and management arrangements
The task of setting up the institute fell under the mandate of the MoPS Commissioner for HRD.
The Commissioner has been a champion of the college since very early on in the policymaking
process. A wide range of stakeholders attribute the early successes of the CSCU to her leadership
and dedication. She has been and continues to be actively engaged in all aspects of the CSCU,
forging partnerships, designing curriculum, navigating internal bureaucratic procedures,
overseeing construction, and marketing the college to different clients.

Formally, management arrangements include a Director who oversees day-to-day operations and
reports directly to the Permanent Secretary, as well as a Management Committee with
representatives from across government. An Acting Director has been in place since June 2014,
though in practice responsibility for overall functioning of the college is still shared with the
Commissioner HRD. Overtime, it is hoped the Director of the CSCU will assume full
responsibility for day-to-day management while the Commissioner HRD will set the policy
direction of the college under the Ministry of Public Service. The Management Committee has met
three times. It is chaired by MoPS with representatives from Ministry of Local Government;
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development; Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry
of Education and Sports; Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Makerere University,
Jinja District Local Government, and the CSC.35

Facilities
The CSCU has dedicated facilities in Jinja municipality, about two hours’ drive outside of
Kampala. Under Phase 1 of construction, with US$2 million in funding from the Bank UPSPEP
the Government of Uganda refurbished the main training building. This contains 4 training rooms,
3 large conference rooms, 3 small meeting rooms, a library, closed and open plan office space for
staff, a board room, a document center, and a sick bay. There is space and equipment in place for
preparing all training material on site (printing, copying, and binding). At full capacity, the CSCU
facilities can accommodate up to 500 trainees at a time.

There are no dormitories, and so trainees who need to stay in Jinja overnight use local hotels.

                                                                                                                 62
There is no dedicated CSCU transportation for trainees, either within Jinja from hotels to the
college or back and forth from Kampala. Trainees receive allowances that cover the cost of
transportation to and from Jinja. Phase two envisions construction of dormitories and a cafeteria.
However funding for this phase has not yet been identified.

The CSCU building has Internet hookups and there are plans to add Wi-Fi. When visited in
November 2014, a shipment of laptops from the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) arrived and was being assembled in the library. No books or reading materials were
available. The building has videoconferencing facilities, though these have not yet been tested.
Phones lines in the CSCU connect directly to MoPS.

While the CSCU building was still under construction, the MoPS supplied a mobile unit with
instructional supplies (computers, speakers, projection screens, loudspeakers). The ‘caravan’
traveled to cities across the country to offer core courses. This ‘caravan approach’ allowed 2,545
public officers to be trained in core and tailor-made courses prior to the completion of CSCU
facilities. CSCU officials report that the vehicle has not been difficult to supply or maintain, and
none of the equipment has yet broken down or gone missing. Because of its cost-effectiveness,
stakeholders plan to continue to use this innovative approach especially to deliver training services
to hard-to-reach local governments. The CSCU estimates the cost savings associated with this
approach is 19 percent, compared to having students come to the college facility.

Faculty and staff
As of November 2014, the college employs five technical officers (a director, two program
managers for training, one assistant program manager and one program manager for
administration), one library information staff, three office attendants, two drivers. An IT specialist
from MoPS supports the college on an as-needed basis. These are all national staff and employees
of the MoPS. The vision is to increase the number of permanent staff over the next year to a total of
25, including the director, five program managers, five assistant program managers, ten program
officers, and four support officers. Currently, CSCU is working with the MoPS to draw up job
descriptions and hire additional personnel through the Public Service Commission.

Trainers are active members of the public service from a wide array of ministries and local
governments. Civil servants can choose to volunteer for the program, though only those
recognized as good performers in the relevant material are invited to attend a ‘train the trainers’
session. These sessions review both the material covered in core courses, as well as facilitation
skills. As of November 2014, the CSC has certified 255 subject matter and generic training experts
(CSCU 2014b, 16).

Certified trainers are used on an as-needed basis. Parent ministries pay trainers’ regular salaries for
the time they are away from the office. The CSCU pays travel, per diem, and teaching allowances
equivalent to US$200 a day, which is considerably less the estimated US$500 a day it would cost
to hire from the private sector. In addition to cost-effectiveness, representatives from MoPS noted


                                                                                                    63
it is easier to replace instructors who cancel at the last minute because of the large pool of certified
trainers on which they can draw.

Instructors receive support prior to running courses. They arrive early to prepare material and
practice lectures with CSCU full-time staff, and receive extensive feedback. If full-time trainers
are eventually required or demand for specific courses temporarily increases (due to a new wave of
hiring for example), there are regulations in place that allow the CSCU to second certified trainers
to the college on a full-time basis. Feedback from civil servants who have taken CSCU courses
reflect that instructors are seen as credible, in part, because they are active public servants with
relevant experiences to impart.

Curriculum and selection of students
Responsibility for the overall management of public service training sits with the MoPS. However,
each MDA and local government controls its own training budget and can determine the type of
learning attended by its staff.36 All public servants have the opportunity-obligation to attend five
days of in-service training in a year.37 In March 2010, it was estimated that this translates into
demand for roughly 1,250,000 days of training a year.38 As noted earlier, the MoPS CSCU is not
the only institution offering public administration programs in Uganda and so it must compete
with private institutes, other government agencies, and various workshops or conferences for these
in-service days and for MDA training budgets.

The CSCU courses are designed to be practical to the day-to-day jobs of civil servants. Two types
of training are offered. ‘Cross-cutting’ courses target specific cadres of the public service and
cover key skill sets for each group (induction for incoming public officers, performance
management for mid-level managers). For ‘tailor-made’ courses, MDAs or LGs approach the
CSCU with a specific request. The curriculum is then designed in collaboration with the
client-MDA or LG to meet specific needs. These focus on skills, knowledge and tasks related
directly to the Uganda Public Service. It is unclear whether CSCU will begin to develop training in
specific core government functions (for example, procurement, finance, accounting), and if so
how they would compete with other programs. For example, Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning sends staff to professional organizations (Society of Company and Commercial
Accountants or Certified Public Accountants) for skills upgrading.

Since 2011, the CSCU has delivered the following cross-cutting training: induction targeting all

newly hired or newly promoted officers; early leadership targeting grade levels U1–U239 with
plans to expand to U3–U7; leadership and change management targeting U1–U2; public
procurement and contract management targeting U4–U6 and competence-based recruitment
targeting all central and local public service commissions. An M&E course is under development,
with the support of Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), targeting all
government M&E and policy planning units.

All cross-cutting courses are adapted on the basis of an assessment of the specific needs of the
ministry or cadre being trained. For example, local governments and central ministries recently
sent senior managers to performance management training. In this case, the issues discussed were
relevant to the grade level of staff in attendance. When these courses are offered to individual
ministries, material is adapted as much as possible to the ministry’s needs. For example, it was felt
frontline Ministry of Health staff were not fully aware of their role as civil servants or their role in
the overall government system. The induction course for local government medical and health
staff specifically address these issues. As a result of this adaptation, the distinction between
cross-cutting and tailor-made programming is somewhat blurred.

Induction, leadership, performance management, and competence-based recruitment courses were
developed with the financial support of the Bank UPSPEP40 and through a twinning arrangement
with the GoO (details of this partnership are described below). For these courses, inputs to the
curriculum came from a needs assessment of the public service, the development of competency
profiles for certain cadres of jobs, and a document review, as well as interviews and workshops
with Ugandan senior managers. The GoO partners developed a ‘prototype’ course, which was
reviewed, adapted to the Ugandan context and approved by Ugandan counterparts. Courses were
then delivered to Ugandan MoPS civil servants in Ontario. These civil servants became core
trainers at the CSCU. The public procurement and contract management curriculum was
developed in collaboration with the Ugandan Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assists
Authority (PPDA). While CSCU trainers covered most of the core material, the PPDA sent its staff
to cover, in detail, the specifics of new regulations.

The CSCU intends to reach all public officers in each courses’ targeted cadre. However, because it
was only recently established, and because there is a backlog of staff to be trained, the CSCU has
begun by engaging selectively with interested MDAs and local governments. So far, the
client-MDA determines how to select or nominate trainees. Ministry of Transport and Works, for
example, invited all 78 U3 and U4 staff to participate in a performance management course and all
56 U1 and U2 staff to participate in a leadership and management development. Technical courses
are attended by civil servants requiring the specific skill set. For example, Public and District
Service Commissioners were trained in competency-based recruitment.


                                                                                               66
Being nominated by a ministry to participate in a course does not ensure that public officers show
up to training on time, for the entire duration of the course, or at all. Currently, there are no
sanction mechanisms in place for public servants who fail to attend courses. Nor can the college
recoup the costs for students who do not show up. However, CSCU trainers call civil servants who
have not shown up on the first day of training to invite them to participate. This has had a positive
effect on the attrition rate. Ministry of Works and Transport estimates that 90 percent of those
invited to participate were able to attend.

Note: * Individual civil servants may take more than one course at the college; these numbers reflect the individuals
passing through each course rather than through the college overall.

Currently, there is no official link between training and career development. Though it is hoped
that cross-cutting courses will become a requirement for confirmation of newly hired officers to
their post, as well as for promotion. While this is an aspiration of CSCU leadership and staff,
capacity to meet the demand generated by such a requirement is not yet in place.

The CSCU keeps a record of all public servants who have been through their training programs. It
has a tracer program in place to track the effectiveness of its courses. College staff envisions a
program that follows up with each trainee that passes through the institution, as well as their
managers, to (a) encourage these public officers to implement what they learned and (b)
understand whether courses have led to changes in the day-to-day performance of public officers.
Currently, the CSCU does not have the capacity to follow up with all of its trainees in this manner.
However, it has successfully implemented a tracer study on the induction of local government
deputy chief administrative officers.

Financing
Because the college sits under the MoPS, its procurement and financial management functions are
still tied to the ministry. Though not typically done for directorates of the ministry, the
Commissioner for HRD was able to set up a dedicated bank account for the CSCU. This facilitates
better monitoring and controls over CSCU funds, and makes it more difficult for CSCU funds to


                                                                                                                   67
be spent on other MoPS functions. It also helped build trust with partners and client ministries.
However, to access or spend funds in the account, the Permanent Secretary must sign off. This has
led to delays in meeting financial obligations.

The establishment of the CSCU was financed by the Bank UPSPEP, which contributed a total of
US$6 million toward construction of CSCU facilities in Jinja (US$2 million), operationalizing the
CSCU (US$2.5 million), strengthening policy research (US$0.5 million) and supporting
implementation of innovative ideas (US$1 million). The CSCU Five Year Strategic Business Plan
envisions four possible sources of funds moving forward: Government of Uganda, donor partners,
chargeable programs, and mobilized funds (grants, fees from facilities rental). Efforts to identify a
sustainable approach that balances these four sources are ongoing.

Table 1.3 shows projected CSCU expenditures over the past five years. By FY15/16, when the
college is expected to be fully operational, the annual cost of in-service training is expected to
reach US$1.7 million a year. Given that the facilities have only been open for one month, the
college is still in the process of establishing accurate estimates for operation and maintenance.
Because the building is under a defect warranty and because the center has only just begun training
on-campus the full implications of utilities bills are yet to be established.

As noted above, each MDA and LG is allocated a training budget and can choose to spend this
funding in any number of ways (workshops, conferences, private sector, or professional
organizations’ certification programs). This model lends itself to a cost-sharing approach in which
MDAs and LGs pay for services, and the CSCU competes for students and revenue. Another
approach would be to allocate some or all of the national training budget to the CSCU, in which
case the college could offer services free of charge. Stakeholders saw benefits to both approaches.

Under cost sharing, it was suggested that the CSCU would face pressure to remain relevant to



                                                                                                         68
clients and provide cost-effective programming. On the other hand, there was a concern that
without dedicated funding to cover overheads, full-time staff, operating and maintenances costs
there would be a risk to sustainability. Currently, there are no mechanisms in place to allow CSCU
to retain any revenue generated from services or rental of facilities. There was also a concern that
even if it were very cost-effective, some local governments (whose training budgets have not
increased for several years and are eroding in value) would be unable to afford training for their
staff, even at the CSCU. A hybrid model was proposed during interviews, in which GoU funds
would be made available to the CSCU to subsidize training of low-income LGs or MDAs.
However funds would need to be requested annually on the basis of a work plan and demonstration
of outputs in the previous year.

Since its establishment, some cost sharing has already taken place. Table 1.4 reflects the estimated
cost per student per day of training at the Jinja facility, which is estimated at US$127. The cost of
the caravan approach would be roughly US$103, assuming savings for 19 percent. Under cost
sharing, the client MDA or LG pays travel allowances and per diem for each trainee, while the
CSCU covers trainers per diem and allowances, material, and refreshments, as well as operating
and maintenance costs.

Partnerships
The CSCU collaborated with several partners on establishment, curriculum development, and
financing. These partners have largely been international. Other than the representative from
Makerere University who sits on the steering committee, there are no partnerships with training
institutes in country, though discussions are underway to possibly establish these. There is no
relationship with regional accreditation or associations.

As noted earlier, the Bank supported the establishment of the CSCU through the UPSPEP, which
closed in June 2014. The project provided for upgrading and refurbishing existing premises under
phase 1; operationalizing the college through development of a vision and business plan;
strengthening of policy research component; and implementation of innovative ideas. The college
received support and mentoring from the project task team leader, and there was a strong working
relationship with the MoPS Commissioner HRD.


                                                                                                  69
The Institute for Public Administration of Canada (IPAC) partnered with the MoPS and CSCU.
Through IPAC, the GoU had a twinning arrangement with the GoO, which started in 2006 and
concluded in 2014.41 The GoO worked closely with the MoPS and CSCU beginning with a needs
assessment, a three-week job shadowing program in which MoPS worked side by side with HR
personnel, and a pilot workshop to develop core learning programs. Out of this initial engagement
it emerged that there was a need for leadership development, competence-based recruitment, and
performance management training. As noted earlier, Ontario partners developed a ‘prototype’
course. Once reviewed and approved by Ugandan counterparts, courses were delivered to
Ugandan MoPS civil servants in Ontario. These civil servants became core trainers at the CSC. It
seems clear that the close and long-running relationship between the GoO and the MoPS was
highly influential in the selection and development of initial programming, as well as ensuring that
programming was well adapted to the needs of the MoPS.

The government of Estonia has partnered with CSCU as part of the college’s programs to
strengthen policy research and provide support to implementation of innovative ideas. They
partnered on research in the tourism sector, which resulted in the creation of tourism and
investment centers in Jinja and Entebbe. Discussions about continuing this relationship with
regard to the establishment of ‘one stop shops’ for service delivery are under discussion.

Annex 2: Liberia School of Public Administration
Rationale for establishment
The LIPA is the successor organization to an institute originally founded in May 1969 through an
act of the legislature and with the support of President Tubman. The rationale for establishment of
the IPA was to improve the performance of civil service providers through in-country training of
mid- and senior-level public servants. The institute was operationalized through a partnership with
USAID and the New York Institute for Public Administration (NYIPA). LIPA officially opened
its doors in 1972, after seventeen Liberians successfully completed Masters Degrees at NYIPA
and returned home to staff the institute. However, in the wake of the civil war, LIPA was largely an
institute in name only. By 2004, it did not carry out any training, and received only about 25
percent of its allocated budget—which primarily went to pay staff salaries.

As noted in Section 3, at the end of Liberia’s civil conflict, the Transitional Government
implemented a number of institutional reforms. As part of this, LIPA was revitalized starting in
2003. Its legal mandate is to develop viable and productive organizational capabilities by
improving the managerial skills as well as to provide leadership and develop guidance, conduct
research and carry out consultancy services, and perform studies of systems and procedures in the
public and private sectors. LIPA’s vision is to operate at local, national, and international levels,
providing state of the art services to transform minds towards improved competency for effective
service delivery and sustainable development. Its mission is to improve democratic governance
and managerial capabilities for efficiency and effectiveness at all levels in the public, private, and
nongovernmental sectors by providing capacity-building support for sustained quality service
delivery through training, research, and consultancy services. Consequent of its mandate, in
conformity with the emerging strategic national vision, LIPA strives to provide quality service to
the cabinet, the legislature, the judiciary, line ministries, autonomous agencies, development
partners, as well as NGOs, private sector, professional bodies, and civil society.




                                                                                                   71
 Box 2.1. LIPA Objectives
        Operate broad-based top to bottom in-service training programs for government employees.
        Develop training programs for middle- and upper-level employees.
        Create and improve capabilities needed for administering economic and social development program.
        Enunciate a career development program by identifying specific career ladders, encouraging in-service

Institutional setup and management arrangements
Formally, LIPA is meant to report to the President of the Republic of Liberia via the Board of
Directors that oversees the management of the institution’s day-to-day activities. The Board
includes representatives from the Governance Commission, CSA, UL, Commission on Higher
Education, and a further three non-statutory members. The DG of LIPA also sits as a member of
the Board. The Chair of the Board is appointed by the President.

LIPA’s management team is headed by the DG, who can be called on to report to Cabinet in the
absence of the Board. Between 1972 and the end of the civil war in 2003, LIPA has had six
Directors General. Since 2003, LIPA has had two Directors General, the first appointed in 2003
and the second appointed in 2013. Initially, the DG was assisted by two deputies, this was
increased to three Deputy DGs from 2003. Each is responsible for the one of the three core
constituent divisions: Administration and Management; Training and Development; and Research
and Consultancy. The DG and his three deputies are appointed by the President of the Republic of
Liberia.

Facilities
LIPA’s rents an administrative building and training center building in the diplomatic enclave of
Monrovia for US$70,000, US$90,000, and US$20,000, respectively. The facilities are managed
through the General Services Agency and institutional procurement is conducted in line with the
Public Procurement and Concession Commission (PPCC). The Department of Administration has



                                                                                                               72
the general services division to handle cleaning and maintenance. LIPA’s buildings have five
classrooms with an occupation capacity ranging from 25, 30, 35, 45, and 50 people. There is a
currently non-functional mini-IT lab for students’ research, as well as a computer lab for training
purposes. The 25 computers in this second lab were donated by the Bank in 2008 and are
considered to be out of date.

LIPA facilities do not include dormitories. Because it is centrally located, students from Monrovia
commute daily from their homes. For those traveling from outside of the capital, a housing stipend
should be provided by the sponsoring ministry, department or agency. Students then stay with
relatives or in hotels. Similarly, LIPA does not provide transportation to its facilities. Students
traveling from outside of the capital receive travel stipends.

As part of an expansion plan, LIPA has recently procured 25 acres of land for a new headquarters
located along the Montserrado-Margibi highway. Construction of new facilities is expected to cost
US$30 million; it has currently mobilized US$4 million from a USAID Sustainable High Impact
infrastructure for Education and Agriculture Project.

Faculty and staff
At the end of the conflict in 2003, LIPA had a staff of 70 people. Many did not come to work or
had other jobs, and so the DG at the time let roughly 40 people go. New faculty members were
recruited from the UL, as well as from ministries.42 As of 2015, LIPA again has a total personnel
of 70 people including the DG. The personnel is divided accordingly: 15 in-house faculty; 10
regular part-time faculty; 30 adjunct faculty drawn on from time to time depending on existing
programs to augment faculty strength; and 15 administrative support staff.

LIPA’s senior administrative staff are all Liberians. They have post-graduate degrees from
recognized universities in Western and African countries, and are long-term public servants who
have grown through the ranks of leadership. The teaching staff is mostly local, but also includes
few international faculty members from partner institutions. Their qualifications range from MS,
PhDs, advanced post-graduate diplomas in specialized areas.

The strategy for hiring permanent staff and faculty members is the merit-based appointment
approach through advertisements and interviewing. They have specified job descriptions and their
salaries are civil service based pay. Training specialists make between US$35–65 per credit hour.
Salaries are perceived to be low, though it is unclear whether this impacts the motivation of staff,
who largely see their work as a form of public service.

Curriculum and students
LIPA offers various levels of trainings including short-term competency courses and long-term
graduate professional development courses. There are also customized courses offered on request

                                                                                                 73
of the client organization. Short-term competency courses are designed to build and strengthen the
core competencies of participants who may already have been in active service. This level
comprises basic administrative, financial management, and procurement courses. Long-term
professional development courses are examinable courses offered at both certificate and diploma
levels. To enroll, one must have obtained an undergraduate degree and the award of the credentials
for each program is based upon the satisfactory completion of all the course work. This level

When LIPA was revitalized in 2003, it needed to develop new curriculum. To do so, it conducted a
national capacity-needs assessment in collaboration with the CSA. This included a circulation of
questionnaires, focus group sessions, and conducting interviews with 5 percent of civil servants.43
Newspaper publications and feedback from public sector leadership, observation studies, and
partnerships from MDIs in West Africa influenced the formulation of the curriculum. Customized
courses are designed based on the need of the requesting institutions. LIPA’s curriculum
development is done in line with international best practices for curriculum designs and from other
MDIs. Recently, courses were added to consider the evolving realities faced during the Ebola
crisis. A new round of curriculum validation is under way in 2015, and is expected to align with the
government’s Agenda for Transformation and Vision 2030.

In most cases, the process for amendment and/or update to the curriculum is influenced by
feedback from students, participants, and client institutions, changes in government policy
decisions, and development strategies. This is done every three years in line with international best
practices of the MDI method for curriculum designs and development.

LIPA conducts a pre-training evaluation before major training enrollment. This determines the
present academic status, skill set, gaps, and limitations. This process informs issues in the curricula
and helps faculty adapt the syllabus and make adjustment in the training. Further, students are also
assessed throughout training on the basis of classroom assignment of individuals and groups,
presentation done, and examinations and special projects (research papers) given to professional
development courses students. It measures their skills, knowledge and attitude and their ability to
analyze situations after studies.

The instructional period for courses is 3 hours, twice a week for the morning session and 3 hours,
twice a week for evening session. There is a plan to run a full day of instructional period effective
academic year 2016, as soon as the administration accrues a bigger space for the school facilities.
Teaching and or course presentation is via both instructional and workshops facilitation (70
percent experiential learning methods and 30 percent theoretical). LIPA’s student population has
reached roughly 350 students per four-month term. There are usually three to four terms per year.
Fees vary according to the category of the registered course.

As noted above, courses are open to civil servants as well as to private sector, civil society, and the
general public. LIPA’s training calendar indicates which courses are open to civil servants
specifically, and which are open to anyone wishing to enroll. Since January 2007, 1,485 civil
servants have gone to LIPA for training (table 2.3). Of these, 80 percent were sponsored by the
government of Liberia; the remaining 20 percent paid their own way or were covered by private
sponsorship. In interviews, it was noted that many civil servants ‘self-sponsor’ to improve their
skills or career prospects. An additional 1,168 Liberians enrolled in courses at LIPA, either
through self- or private sponsorship. As reflected in table 2.3, a little over half of LIPA’s clients
pay their own way—though there are perceptions among stakeholders that the number of students
paying their own way is much higher (80 percent). Since January 2007, 60 percent of people
trained at LIPA have been men, 40 percent have been women.

Note: Individual civil servants may take more than one course at the college; these numbers reflect the individuals
passing through each course rather than through the college overall.

There has been an expectation that Liberia’s CSA would assist LIPA to identi fy civil servants in
need of training, especially with regard to new recruits. The CSA’s mandate includes recruiting
personnel equipped with the requisite capabilities for entry into the civil service. One way to
ensure new staff are fully equipped would be to send them to LIPA for induction and orientation,
as well as to use LIPA to fill in any specific skills gaps. However there is a perception among
stakeholders that this sort of close collaboration between the CSA and LIPA has not fully
materialized. While closer engagement between LIPA and the CSA could potentially benefit
newly hired staff, as well as those interested in a more skilled workforce, reaching this level of
collaboration would require further investment, integrated information management, and specific
interventions that will guide such alignment. In the absence of this, there has been limited
reporting on the impact of the trainings conducted by on Liberia’s capacity-development
initiatives.

Financing
LIPA estimates that it requires a minimum budget of US$2–5 million to operate effectively for
over an annual program cycle. LIPA is supported by fiscal allocations from the central
government; salaries are paid by Ministry of Finance, and LIPA is allotted an additional US$1
million annually from the national budget. This is meant to cover operating expenses, but is not
adequate and only covers roughly 4 to 5 months of operational expenses.

LIPA’s leadership has designed a cost-recovery program that is minimal in most instances. The
fees collected for course work depend on the level and course duration (see table 2.3). The lowest
is US$50–100 for short-term competency-based programs, and US$150–500 for long-term
diploma, professional programs. Customized courses are paid for, at negotiated fees. Up to 50–65
percent of fees are not being paid. Major GoL entities are not cooperating in their obligations to
settle payments for training of their personnel. Fees collected from students/trainees and the
national budgetary allocation cannot duly support the running of the institution. The present
leadership has submitted an act of legislation that will grant it autonomy status to enable the
institution to engage aggressively in the negotiation of funding with external partners.

LIPA has its own bank account. The DG authorizes spending based on request from the end-user’s
department. LIPA handles its own procurement in compliance with the GoL’s PPCC regulation.
An act of legislation that will grant LIPA autonomous status was submitted to the President's
Office through the Governance Commission and is awaiting submission to the National
Legislature for approval.

Partnerships
LIPA has developed several collaborative partnership including USAID, the Bank, the UNDP,
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and other international NGOs. It is a member of the
network body of MDIs in Africa including the African Management Development Institute
(AMDIN), the West African Management Development Institute (WAMDEVI) and the African
Association of Public Administration and Management (AAPAM). It currently it collaborates with
its partner institutions including the GIMPA, the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria
(ASCON), the Gambian Management Development Institute (MID), and the Institute of Public
Administration and Management (IPAM) in Sierra Leone. Together, these institutions drive the
implementation of the public sector management program in the West African subregion,
sponsored by the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF). Over the past few years, Liberia,
through LIPA, and with support from ACBF scholarships, has coordinated the training of 40
specialists in post-graduate (Masters) degrees in Public Sector Management from the GIMPA.
Additional partnerships include an agreement with a Ghanaian firm to conduct oil and gas training,
responding to the country’s emerging oil industry.

Specifically, GIMPA and IPAM’s collaboration has been in the areas of faculty exchange and
provision of facility for special scholarship programs as provided by regional public sector
institutions (such as the African Capacity Building Foundation and West African Management


                                                                                               79
Development Institute). These partnerships are focused on sharing staff, management and
instructional responsibilities, curriculum development and are established through memoranda of
understanding. This is accomplished via the relationship with the African MDI network. Some
stakeholders note that these partnerships have not lived up to their full potential—with only
limited exchange of faculty and ideas in practice.

Annex 3: Financial Management Training Program
Rationale for establishment
At the end of Liberia’s civil war one of the new government’s greatest challenges was the lack of
capacity to carry out core government functions, especially with regard to public financial
management. At the end of the conflict in 2003 the Ministry of Finance was destroyed, and most
professionals had fled the country. A key priority was ensuring proper and efficient use of budget
resources, and assuring donor partners their assistance was being well managed.44 To address this
priority Liberia undertook actions to mitigate fiduciary risks in the short run, and to build the
capacity of national staff to take over critical functions in the long run.

From 2003 to 2005, the focus was on establishing basic financial management functionality; from
2005, it shifted toward development of more complex systems.45 In collaboration with the Bank,
IMF, USAID, and EU, the government designed the Liberia GEMAP, a program which mobilized
and recruited international experts to implement direct fiduciary management of the country’s
most vulnerable institutions. At the same time, it was recognized that GEMAP would support
improvements in the short term, but that international capacity substitution would not be
sustainable over the long run. The FMTP was designed to recruit and train national staff with the
capacity to take over critical functions.

Initially, the program began as a capacity-building initiative implemented by the Bank through a
US$0.45 million Low Income Countries Under Stress trust fund grant. The initiative had
high-level support from the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance, who recognized the need to
transform the public financial management capacity of government and wanted a training program
housed in the ministry. In 2005, the MoF provided 10 classrooms and a large hall to train existing
civil servants in accounting, internal audit, external audit, budget preparation, cash management,
and procurement. Short-term courses were offered to controllers in line ministries, and other
financial management staff.

In 2006, the FMTP was officially established under the MoF with financial and technical support
from the Bank. It was founded in collaboration with the Liberia CSA, the UL, and LIPA. The
FMTP recruited its first batch of 30 students into its two-year MBA program in 2006; these
students began their coursework in 2007 and graduated in 2009. Graduates enter the civil service
for a minimum four years upon completion of the program. Later, the FMTP added a procurement
component to its program.

Facilities
The FMTP is housed in the former Budget Bureau building of the MoF, and shares this space with
other government entities. Its facilities include classrooms, a laboratory, and administrative
offices. The school has two classrooms: one for the Intensive Procurement students and one for the

MBA students. Additionally, there is a computer lab that is mainly used by the MBA students,
which is equipped with 30 desktops that are all connected to the Internet. The students are each
assigned a laptop with all relevant software installed including Microsoft Office suite and
Antivirus. The laptops enable students to make use of the wireless access points in their classroom
to access the Internet for their assignments. There are also several offices for administrative staff.
FMTP does not have dormitories or provide transportation for students. However, because the
program is considered equivalent to a full-time job, students receive monthly stipends which cover
the cost of living.

Institutional setup and management arrangements
There was some debate about how to build national capacity to manage public finances in Liberia.
Some advocated for sending civil servants overseas for training. However, individuals working
with the Bank to support the MoF made a strong case for within country training. Both the UL and
LIPA expressed interest in hosting an in-country program. Yet given the capacity gaps facing the
country—including within existing institutions of higher learning—the decision was made that a
new, tailor-made initiative was needed. It was agreed to take an approach that facilitated
collaboration between a number government institutions, each drawing on its relative strength and
mandate. From the outset, the FMTP was viewed as a medium-term program, which would be
used to build up capacity over several years, and then would be scaled back and eventually merged
with the UL.

In 2006, an MoU was signed between the FMTP and the UL under which the UL would design
curriculum and award MBA degrees to graduates of the FMTP. Similarly, the CSA would
collaborate by finding posts for graduates in government ministries, departments, and agencies.
The Ministry of Finance & Development Planning (MFDP) agreed to be the ‘parent’ ministry for
the program, as well as to provide facilities.

The Governing Body, which provides strategic direction to the FMTP, is chaired by the Minister of
Finance and includes the DG of the CSA, the President of UL, and the DG of LIPA as members.
The Director of the FMTP is responsible for the effective operation of the program and serves as a
non-voting member of the Board. There have been two FMTP directors since the initiative was
established.

Faculty and staff
The FMTP permanent faculty is made up of a director, registrar, resident coordinator, national
team leader, two IT specialists, and an international curriculum specialist. There are a total of 8
junior staff comprising janitors, drivers, and office assistants. Part-time lecturers are drawn from
the Ministry of Finance, UL, and the private sector (2). During the lifetime of the program, the
number of part-time faculty has ranged from 8 to 20.

The FMTP’s senior administrative staff including facilitators has MBAs with emphasis in finance,
procurement, and public administration. They have managed schools of higher learning and


                                                                                                   82
universities. They are both local and international. They are hired on competitive basis for both
international and national staff. All international and national administrative staff are full time
while all national teaching staffs are part-time. The Director teaches at a Masters level at Liberia’s
largest university.

Curriculum and students
The FMTP has two streams of training: financial management and procurement. The financial
management component is a two-year program. As described in more detail below, the program
selects and trains cohorts of 30 students through a competitive recruiting process. Applicants must
have earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting, Economics, Business, Public
Administration, or Management, and must be willing to work in both urban and rural areas of the
country. While they are enrolled in the program, trainees in the MBA program complete an
internship at the end of each semester at assigned ministries, agencies, or commissions.
Participants who complete the program earn a Masters in Management degree, with emphasis in
Financial Management, awarded by the UL. By December 2012, the two-year program had
completed 3 training circles and graduated 83 out of the 90 people who initially enrolled (see Table
1).

Because of the success of the financial management component, the FMTP initiated a national
procurement accreditation and certification program. This one-year course is conducted under the
auspices of the FMTP Governing Board, and graduates are awarded post-graduate diploma in
Public Procurement Management. The structure and contents of the curriculum are compliant with
the Public Procurement and Concessions Act of 2005, University of Liberia Graduate School of
Business (ULGSB) requirements, as well as Bank, African Development Bank, and other
multilateral funded procurement and generic good practices.

* Data was collected before graduates from ‘Cohort 4’ had completed their four years of service with their assigned
MDA.

For both the financial management and procurement component, courses are run on the academic
guidelines of the ULGSB. Courses are held during the day, and run for a minimum of 14 weeks.
The FMTP is seen as a rigorous, full-time academic program with a focus on the practical skills
students need to work in the public sector, rather than as part of ‘in-service training’ (which is
more the role envisioned for LIPA). High-level consultation and consensus building were used in
the curriculum development process. In particular, consultations and discussions were held
between the FMTP team and the FMTP partners—the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning, the CSA, the PPCC, the UL, and the LIPA. This resulted in curricula and modules that
were acceptable to program partners.

Further, the curricula was designed to ensure students were prepared for future jobs with
government—so courses combine a focus on academic and job related skills. Individual syllabus
contents reflect the objectives desired to be achieved in each course. The target is 50 percent
knowledge transfer and 50 percent skills development. A non-credit Skills Development for
Employment course (covering dedicated management and leadership development subject areas)
has been designed to expose students to the components of the public sector personnel capacity
development program. The training methodology adopted for course delivery is experiential and
highly participatory; the emphasis of course delivery is largely based on practical case study and
simulation exercises.

The curricula updated at least once a year to ensure specific course contents are up-to-date and
reflect the demand of the market. Draft revisions are discussed with the FMTP partners,
principally the PPCC and the UL for their consent and approval.

As noted above, for the MBA program, students are selected competitively. An advertisement is
placed in the newspaper and online. All interested candidates within a specific age range are
invited to apply (21–40 to allow students sufficient time to complete the training and work for
government before retirement). Those who have the required grade point average (2.7 or higher)
and meet the selection criteria are invited to take an entrance aptitude exam (based on old Graduate
Readiness Examinations [GRE]). The 60 applicants with the best scores are invited to interview
with a panel made up of representatives from the FMTP’s partners. From this pool, the best 30 are
accepted into the program.

Once offered a position in the program, students sign a contract witnessed by the CSA, the FMTP
director, and the Ministry of Justice committing to complete the two-year MBA and serve in
government for four years immediately following graduation. There is an expectation that students
treat the program like a full-time job. Classes run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. Through the
Bank-funded Economic Governance and Institutional Reform Project (and later the Integrated
Public Financial Management Project), students are sponsored with full scholarships: tuition is
fully covered and each receives US$200 stipend each month. If participants drop out of the
program or if they do not serve for a full four years after graduation, they are expected to repay this
scholarship.

                                                                                                    85
Upon completion of the program, the CSA places MBA and procurement graduates in government
ministries, departments, and agencies. Graduates receive a special salary, which has its own line
item in the budget. For the MBA, the minimum starting salary is US$800 a month; for
procurement, it is US$700 a month. Every year, graduates can receive a salary increase of up to
US$100 a month. Most civil servants make between US$400–600 a month. Reportedly, this has
caused some difficulties for relationships between regular civil servants and FMTP graduates, who
are perceived to be young people who have benefited from a Bank project. After four years,
graduates are expected to be rolled over onto the payroll of their ‘host’ MDA. There have been
some concerns about whether ministries will be able to offer similar salary levels.

A graduates’ monitoring scheme has been instituted. The objective of the exercise is to monitor the
extent to which the graduates were applying the knowledge and skills acquired on the program,
and to assess the impact of their contributions on the procurement and financial management
activities at the ministries and agencies where they were deployed.

Financing
The FMTP is a public program, funded by the Bank and managed by the Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development. The school budget is approximately US$1.25 million per
year, which has been fully covered under the Economic Governance and Institutional Reform
Project, and later the Integrated Public Financial Management Project. The program does not raise
any revenue for sustainability purposes.

Partnerships
As described earlier, the FMTP was established in collaboration with Bank staff, who have been
actively engaged throughout the program’s existence. The Bank advisers to the program helped
shape the direction of the FMTP that it would train young professionals in country and equip them
with the practical skills necessary to rebuilding the government’s financial management capacity.
Bank advisers also helped shape the student recruitment processes, which currently has a
reputation for being quite rigorous and selecting the most qualified candidates for the two-year
MBA degree.

Additionally, as also noted above, the FMTP works in close collaboration with other government
institutions. For example, the CSA helps to place graduates in government ministries,
departments, and agencies (this stands in contrast with LIPA, which has had more difficulty
coordinating training with the agency, see the LIPA case for further details). Further, there is great
demand from within MoF and from line ministries for FMTP graduates. This seems to be driven
by the caliber of graduates, who are seen to be the most computer-literate and competent public
finance professionals in the country.

The FMTP is also supported by the ABWA, which offers the Certified Accountancy Technician
qualification.

Annex 4: Rwanda Management Institute
Rationale for establishment
The RMI has existed under different names and with different mandates since 1963, originally
established by the government of Rwanda with bilateral support from Belgium. The CRFC
focused on training Rwandan civil servants to take over the administration of the newly
independent country (RIAM 2012). It offered short courses targeting professionals already in their
posts. It focused largely on administrative skills, but also offered some vocational training, for
example in agriculture. CRFC continued to receive support from the Belgium cooperation
program until 1987, at which time the center was officially handed over to the government of
Rwanda and placed under the Ministry of Public Service (RIAM 2012).

In the wake of the 1994 genocide, a number of institutions were redesigned, consolidated, or
replaced. In the context of these larger countrywide changes, in 2001, CRFC was reestablished by
law No: 25/01 of 19/04/2001 as the Rwanda Institute of Administration and Management (RIAM)
under the Ministry of Public Service and Labor. Under the newly adopted ministry-agency model
of governance, 46 RIAM was to be an implementer of MoPS’s capability-building policies. It
provided training to public servants already in their post, and was the only MDI in Rwanda with a
mandate to deliver training to the public sector.47 In 2007, RIAM’s mission was expanded to
include capacity building for public, private, and civil society employees with a focus on the
“science and technical knowhow in administration and management.?48

Broadly, RMI and its predecessor, RIAM, can be understood as one component of efforts to
strengthen the public sector in Rwanda. Strategically, the institute was intended to address the
country’s capacity-building challenges through strong, in-country training. Initially, there was also
an expectation that through setting its training calendar each year, RIAM could help focus and
coordinate public sector training efforts.




46
   In the early 2000s, the government also moved to a ministry-agency model of administration. The number of
agencies increased from 49 in 2006 to 82 in 2010/11. The rationale behind this reform was to allow agencies operate as
executive unites at arms-length from national government ministries.

In 2013, the decision was made to reestablish RIAM as the RMI, a public corporation with a
training, research, and consultancy department (see law No. 52/2013 of 28/06/2013). Both RMI
and its predecessor RIAM have had a focus on supplementing ‘technical’ skills (accounting,
medical, engineering) with soft skills such as computer or English language skills. For both, the
mandate has included training for public sector, private sector, and civil society. Under the new
arrangement consulting and advisory services were added to RMI’s mandate, and it will be
expected to raise its own revenue. The reorganization of RIAM into RMI is still ongoing, and RMI
has inherited many of the organizational capacities and legacies of RIAM.

Today, RMI’s mission is to “ensure capacity building for the national workforce through training.?
Its strategic objectives are to “facilitate and deliver relevant and effective learning; provide
performance improvement advisory services, provide thought leadership through applied research
and knowledge management; build strategic, managerial professional and technical capability of
RMI in order for the organization to effectively fulfill its mandate? (RMI 2015a).

Institutional setup and management arrangements
While RIAM was a public institute, RMI is a public corporation. It has legal personality,
administrative and financial autonomy and is managed in accordance with general provisions
governing Public Institutions. 49 Like RIAM, RMI sits under the Ministry of Public Service
(MIFOTRA). It also has a close relationship with the NCBS, which consolidates institutional
capacity plans into the national capacity building plan and manages Rwanda’s CBF. Linked to the
national planning and budget cycle, government agencies and ministries submit training and
capacity-development plans to NCBS, which are consolidated into a national plan. Once the
annual national training plan has been consolidated, NCBS provides finding for RMI to deliver
short courses targeting critical skills gaps (previously PSCBS contracted RIAM). In this respect,
RMI is a service provider for the NCBS and so responsible to the secretariat, even if not formally,
legally responsible.

RIAM was governed by a board of directors and managed by a General Director. According to a
2012 institutional assessment, RIAM’s board of directors met regularly and provided strategic
direction to the institute. According to the law establishing RMI, the board of directors is the
“governing and decision-making organ? for the institute. Members of the board are appointed by
Presidential order, and according to regulations should be selected from different sectors on the
basis of their competence and expertise. Thirty percent of seats are reserved for women. Seats on
the board are not specifically reserved for particular ministries, agencies, or institutions of higher
education.

Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the DG. Since its establishment, RIAM faced
management challenges. From 2009 until June 2012, RIAM/RMI has had three DGs—of which
two were arrested for management challenges—and for long periods had only an acting or interim

director. Because of this, RIAM faced difficulties making major decisions or carrying out
long-term planning. The lack of consistent, strong leadership is perceived to have negatively
impacted RIAM’s ability to deliver. As laid out in a 2012 draft strategic plan, it was felt that RIAM
‘struggled to implement its strategic priorities and has lacked well-defined goals and objects’
(RIAM 2011b). The plan noted that RIAM focused on reacting to immediate demands, in part
because of lack of permanent leadership. With its transformation to RMI, a General Director was
appointed and has been in place since July 2013.

Facilities
RMI facilities are owned by the government and managed by RMI in accordance with public laws
and regulations and other procedures. RMI has a campus in Kigali as well as Murambi, Muhanga
District, Southern Province. Previously, both also served as the campus to RIAM, as well as the
CFRC.

The Kigali campus consists of two buildings. The first is moderately furnished and at full capacity
can accommodate up to 100 trainees—though tables and chairs would have to be added to several
rooms to serve this number of trainees. A canteen is available and could cater tea or light meals. A
second, newer building is rented out to the British Council, which offers English language training.
Many of RMI’s workshops, diploma, and MA programs that are offered in collaboration with
partners are delivered at the Kigali campus.

Most of RMI’s short courses take place at the Murambi campus, roughly an hour’s drive from
Kigali. This campus has three classrooms that can accommodate 30 people each. It is connected to
the internet through fiber optic cables, and there are Wi-Fi connections in the IT lab and
administrative buildings. The IT lab is equipped with roughly 50 desktops. It was not possible to
verify that computers were equipped with financial management and other software used by civil
servants in their daily jobs.

The Murambi campus has a cafeteria that can cater breakfast, lunch, and dinner for trainees. It also
has dormitories that can house 60 trainees. Construction was recently completed on a new
dormitory that will be able to accommodate 75 people once furnished. Transportation to the
Murambi campus is paid for by trainees’ parent ministries. However, trainees themselves do not
receive travel stipends, rather their parent MDA pays providers directly.

Faculty and staff
RMI’s organizational structure was approved by management and the Board of Directors in
November 2013 and was approved by Cabinet in July 2015. During the interim period, RMI
continued to operate under RIAM’s structure.

RIAM’s approach to carrying out training was to partner with international institutes to deliver
longer-term degree, diploma, and certificate course, and to hire external consultants to design and
deliver short courses aligned with NCBS’ national capacity building plan. It employed a core


                                                                                                  90
group of administrative and training staff to coordinate these efforts. A situational analysis carried
out in 2011 found 23 staff in place at RIAM, of these three were trainers (RIAM 2011a, 18). The
analysis raised the limited number of full-time, in-house training staff as a constraint on RIAM’s
ability to deliver high-quality training. It also found that staff responsible for training had “limited
or no experience in working in the professional domains they teach.? The report also noted that
“staff are moved into positions for which they are not qualified or do not have the relevant
experience? and that there was limited mentoring or guidance for these staff (RIAM 2011a, 12).

As of March 2015, RMI employs 21 staff, of which 4 are mapped to the training department (RMI
2015b). A 2013 institutional assessment indicated that more staff would be needed. The report
recommended approving the new organizational structure, which would increase overall staffing
to 40 and the training department to 10 full-time staff.

For the delivery of NCBS-funded short courses, RMI relies on consultants hired on a part-time
basis. After the training calendar is developed in alignment with the NCBS national capacity
building plan, RMI advertises for consultants. As described below, RMI coordinates with
consultants on the development of curriculum. If a specific course is offered multiple times in a
year, multiple consultants may be hired; training department staff reported it can be difficult to
find one person with the availability to conduct each session. While some consultants may come
back each year, most do not, posing a challenge for quality control. In the past, RIAM made initial
investments to strengthen in-house training capacity through train-the-trainers and
partner-delivered MBA, diploma, and certificate programs. If approved and implemented, the new
organizational structure will put more emphasis on ‘in house’ capacity to build curriculum and
carry out short course training.

Consultants are paid US$200–250 a day. Contracts cover preparation and reporting (2–4 days), as
well as the delivery of training (5–10 days). For a five-day short course, consultants receive
roughly US$1,400. For ten-day courses the fee is roughly US$2,800. These fees are considerably
higher than the monthly salary of RMI training staff.

MA, diploma, or certificate programs offered on RMI’s campus have been delivered through
partner institutions. As described below, these include MSM, the PALAMA (now the National
School of Government [NSG]). Partners have brought trainers from their own institutes to RMI, or
have recruited additional experts to carry out courses jointly with other RMI trainers.



                                                                                                     91
Curriculum and selection of students
As noted above, the training delivered by RIAM and now RMI can be divided into two broad
groups. The first group comprises NCBS-funded short courses and the second MA, diploma, or
certificate programs, seminars as well as workshops, offered in collaboration with partners. Some
tailor-made training has been offered at the request of specific ministries, departments, or
agencies, but this has not made up the bulk of RMI’s business. At the time of writing there were
also ongoing discussions about the possibility of offering information and communication
technology (ICT) related training for civil servants, as well as developing eLearning opportunities.
In July 2015, these activities were launched.

The development of RMI’s training calendar begins with the submission of capacity-building
plans to NCBS, which are submitted by MDAs as part of the national budget cycle. These plans are
consolidated by NCBS and organized according to national priorities. RMI then develops a
calendar of short courses targeting skills identified by the national plan. NCBS then procures RMI
to deliver on the calendar. The same process was carried out with RIAM-PSCBS.

Once the calendar is set, RMI recruits consultants who are responsible for delivering training, as
well as designing the specific content for each course. The basic terms of reference for each course
are developed by RMI and staff meet with consultants at the beginning of the year to go through
what each course would ideally cover. Consultants then draw up specific curricula for their
sessions. Detailed course outlines, as well as power points, reading lists, or other training material
are developed by consultants.

One challenge arising from this model is that RIAM/RMI’s ability to deliver training to meet
critical capacity gaps is tied to and somewhat constrained by the quality of requests being sent to
and compiled by NCBS. Annual capacity-building plans submitted by MDAs are more of a wish
list based on requests from staff, rather than an actual assessment of the capacity gaps in particular
agencies. Similarly, these plans identify broad areas of training, but not necessarily the specific
skills or ‘level’ required—that is, ‘human resource management’ rather than ‘management of
personnel records’ or ‘for entry-level administrative staff’. Conducting public sector training
needs assessments had been the responsibility of MIFOTRA, which was reassigned to NCBS’s
predecessor agency (the PSCBS) and now sits with NCBS.

Additionally, the limited number and capacity of RIAM/RMI staff in the training until, along with
challenges arising from staff turnover, as described above, were seen as a limiting factor on
curriculum development. As a result, the same basic courses were offered multiple times to the
same audience. It seems some civil servants took the exact same course two years in a row. People
with very different job profiles and levels of management experience were often placed in the
same basic training (entry level staff being trained alongside senior management).

RIAM/RMI reaches roughly 2,000 civil servants a year through its short-course program; since
July 2010, it has trained 10,193 civil servants. RMI has set out a goal of training 22,532 people


                                                                                                   92
through government-funded programs between 2013 and 2018. To achieve this goal, it would need
to train roughly 3,750 people a year, which would require increasing the number of people
attending courses by roughly 1,700 a year.

The list of training beneficiaries for RMI’s short courses is drawn from MDA training plans and
compiled by NCBS. Beneficiaries are matched with courses according to generic interest areas,
not based on their job level, previous training, or a needs assessment of skills gaps. A 2013
institutional assessment of RMI identified this as a constraint to delivering high-quality training.
The challenge of matching the right person with the right training was also raised with regard to
workshops offered with partners and is discussed further below. A list of short courses offered is
provided in Figure 2.4.

For NCBS-funded short courses, RIAM/RMI offers certificates of attendance, but not certificates
on the basis of competencies gained. RMI does not test or track what students know before
attending or after completing modules. For internal M&E purposes, RMI tracks outputs ( the
number of people trained) rather than outcomes ( improved performance). This is understandable,
as measuring outcomes of capacity training is complex and outcomes can be difficult to measure
and attribute. RMI has laid out plans to trace the impact of training, including a tracer study of
students who completed the 2003–2004 MSM MBA program.

Note: *Individual civil servants may take more than one course at the institute; reflects the individuals passing through
each course rather than through the institute overall.

Course offered by partner institutes have been perceived to be quite strong. These focus on the
delivery of Masters, MBA, diploma, or certificate programs, as well as workshops. Generally,
these have been programs offered by partner institutes in their home countries. Partners adapt this
training to the Rwandan context both through the independent efforts of its own trainers and in
consultation with RMI.

Selection of participants in these programs has varied. For the MBA offered with MSM,
participants from government and outside of government encouraged to apply. These applications
were vetted and students were admitted on the basis of their qualifications. A similar process was
conducted for courses offered through PALAMA. A call for applications was circulated to
ministries. Applicants were vetted and admitted on the basis of qualifications. For workshops,
getting the right people at the table seems to have been more challenging. Senior-level officials,


                                                                                                                      94

may send representatives from their office to take their place.

Financing
Funding for RIAM was allocated in a line item in the national budget, and RIAM submitted an
Action Plan and Budget to Ministry of Finance (MICOFIN) annually. RIAM was also able to raise
funds through the provision of services or by renting its property. In 2011, revenue raised by
RIAM made up 2 percent of its annual budget (RMI 2012, 48). A situational analysis from 2011
found that there was ‘no strategy in place to decrease its reliance on central government funding.’
As a public corporation, RMI will be expected to rely less on national budget allocations and more
on fees charged for services. This includes covering the cost of staff salaries. RMI’s annual action
plan estimates the institute will need roughly 4.3 million dollars to achieve its planned activities.

RIAM/RMI has been paid by NCBS for short courses based on the number of people who
complete the training. Attendance is checked and trainees must sign in every day—this
information must be submitted to NCBS as proof that training was delivered. This is a strong
quality control mechanism that is in place to ensure CBFs are not spent unless actual training is
received. Yet, this also makes budgeting difficult. If a course has been prepared for 50 people, but
only 25 arrive on the first day and only 22 return each day to complete the training, RMI is only

Partnerships
RIAM/RMI have maintained partnerships with a number of international institutes of public
administration. The focus of these partnerships has largely been to provide MBA and diploma
courses, as well as some workshops and short courses. Partners close role in developing and
delivering training has been discussed above.

RIAM/RMI’s relationship with MSM began in 2001. Stakeholders identify the initial MBA
program offered in 2003–2004 as the most successful outcome of the partnership. The program
was a result of cooperation between Rwanda and the Netherlands. It was initiated at the request of
the Minister of Public Service (MIFOTRA), who envisioned an MBA program focused not on the
private sector but rather adapted for senior government officials. Beyond delivery of training,
collaboration between the two institutions has included mentoring of RIAM/RMI staff with regard
to the daily management of the institute, as well as assistance in carrying out institutional
assessments and developing two strategic plans.50

RIAM/RMI’s partnership with the South African NSG, formerly PALAMA, began under the
umbrella of a regional capacity development project funded by the CIDA. The project covered
Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan, and the regional coordination office was located on the
RIAM/RMI campus. NSG was engaged to implement the project, which included delivering
which included delivering Executive Development Post Diploma Program in Executive
Leadership.

Most recently, on February 27, 2013, RMI signed an MOU with the Korea Institute of Public
Administration which focuses on establishing Integrated ICT supported project training (that is,
eLearning).




50
  RMI strategic plans were developed on a consultancy basis. The Regional Capacity Building Project hired MSM to
develop RMI strategic plan under CIDA funds through PALAMA.

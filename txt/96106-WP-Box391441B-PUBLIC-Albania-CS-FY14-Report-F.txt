This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Albania perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Albania regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Albania;

II. Methodology
In April—May 2014, 512 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Albania were invited to
provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
248 stakeholders participated in the survey (48% response rate).
Respondents received the questionnaire via post, courier or email and returned it accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Albania; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Albania; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing in Albania.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Albania: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Albania is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Albania, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved in Albania.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Albania, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Albania solve its development challenges, their agreement with various
   statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective
   development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and
   weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Albania, with which
   stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the WBG
   should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what reasons
   respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Albania, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Albania’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Albania: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the WBG should play in Albania in the near future, to indicate what the
   WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Albania, and which services the WBG
   should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Albania, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 198 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2012 and 200 respondents (73% response rate) who completed the country survey in FY
2010. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from the office of the President,
        Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of a minister;
        consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-supported projects/programs were
        combined with respondents from PMUs; respondents from bilateral agencies were
        combined with those from multilateral agencies; respondents from the financial
        sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
        respondents from NGOs, trade unions, and private foundations were combined into the
        “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, local
        government, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other? category. There were
        no respondents from community based organizations.
       Note that the number of respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks (39%
        in the original respondent base) was weighted for all analyses in order to reduce sampling
        bias and make FY14 and FY12 sample frames comparable (see Appendix F for details).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Area of Primary Specialization




    When more than 15% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of specialized
    areas in question H2 in Appendix I), analyses are done to see these respondents’ views about the development
    priorities in Albania, the areas of development that would contribute most to poverty reduction and economic
    growth, which areas the WBG should focus its attention and resources on, and importance and effectiveness of
    the WBG’s work in specific sectors.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Tirana and Durres.
        Because of the small number of respondents from other areas, these locations were
        combined under the “Other? category for all further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 92). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Albania, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the overall
        effectiveness of the World Bank (IBRD) and the IFC, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the World Bank’s and
        IFC’s overall effectiveness in Albania. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at social protection;
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at food security;
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at anti-corruption.
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at urban development;
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at crime and violence; and
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at trade and exports.
       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Albania, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment;
               The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and
               The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Albania or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Albania, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop
more effective strategies that support development in Albania.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of the Inte rnational
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which lends to governments of middle-income and
creditworthy low-income countries; the International Development Association (IDA), which provides interest-
free loans and grants to governments of the poorest countries; 3) the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
which is focused exclusively on the private sector to help developing countries achieve sustainable growth by
financing investment, mobilizing capital in international financial markets, and providing advisory services to
businesses and governments; 4) the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which works to
promote foreign direct investment into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and
improve people’s lives and fulfills this mandate by offering political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors and
lenders; and 5) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which provides
international facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes. When responding to the survey,
please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which you are most familiar.

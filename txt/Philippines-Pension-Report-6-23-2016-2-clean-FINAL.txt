This report was prepared at the request of the Philippines Social Security System (SSS) to analyze key
challenges and propose reform options to improve the sustainability and expand the coverage of old age
income protection for private sector workers. A simulation employing the Pension Reform Options
Simulation Toolkit (PROST) found that the SSS scheme will face outflows greater than inflows in about
20 years and depletion of its assets in about 28 years. Fortunately, its medium-term financing issues can
be addressed through the gradual introduction of parametric reforms that shield workers and retirees
from abrupt changes in contributions and benefits. At the same time, the Philippines faces a challenge
to improve the defacto coverage of workers by Social Security, and to increase the income protection
coverage of the elderly. Options suggested include SSS measures to leverage its identification system
and introduce a special instrument for informal workers. Rather than introducing matching contribution
subsidies to expand coverage, it was suggested to broaden the scope of beneficiaries eligible for social
pensions. Beyond the scope of the SSS, additional measures were suggested including those to improve
the access and efficiency of contributions and payments systems, strengthening mobile-money
platforms and efforts to improve access to savings instruments, particularly for small and isolated
savers. The report points out that the key means of improving coverage lies beyond the scope of social
security or pensions, namely, to improve the quantity and quality of wage-based employment.

This report was prepared by Mark Dorfman and Tatyana Bogomolova of the Social Protection and Labor
Global Practice of the World Bank in response to a request by the Philippines Social Security System
(SSS). The report was prepared as part of the World Bank Group Philippines Programmatic Analytical
and Advisory Activities Project in Social Protection and Labor (P148753) under the guidance of
Aleksandra Posarac, Lead Economist and Program Leader for Human Development and Poverty in the
Philippines. Peer reviewers were Robert Palacios and Philip O’Keefe. The regional practice manager
overseeing the work was Jehan Arulpragasam. The team preparing the report benefited significantly
from open discussions with staff of the SSS, GSIS, and DSWD over 2015-16. Training in the use of the
Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) was undertaken for SSS staff in Manila in May 2015.
The report has benefited from earlier World Bank reports, particularly on jobs and labor markets.1

                     Philippines – Review of the Social Security System
                                    Executive Summary

This report was prepared at the request of the Philippines Social Security System (SSS) to analyze key
challenges and propose reform options to improve the sustainability and expand the coverage of old
age income protection for private sector workers. Changes in qualifying conditions, contributions and
benefits are proposed to improve the sustainability of the SSS, provide greater incentives to participate,
and improve risk coverage. Measures are considered to improve coverage including new instruments
aimed at informal workers, improving the efficiency of collections and payments and broadening the
eligibility for a Social Pension.

Like many countries worldwide, Social Security in the Philippines faces challenges to its sustainability
in part due to a gradual aging of the population. Over the next 35 years, the old-age dependency ratio
(those over age 60 as a proportion of those who are working-age) is projected to almost double from
about 12 percent in 2015 to 22.5 percent in 2050. Higher old age dependency ratios, coupled with little
change in the relative size of the working-age population, will place increasing pressure on working-age
individuals to provide support for elderly family members as well as on the country’s social security
system and other old age support programs. Projections of the SSS financial flows undertaken using the
Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) indicate that the scheme will face outflows greater
than inflows in about 20 years and depletion of assets in about 28 years. At the same time, the SSS will
continue to face the challenge of maintaining adequate SSS contributory benefits in the face of limited
contribution histories, so that retirees have sufficient support in old age.

Fortunately, the projected medium-term financing issues can be addressed through the gradual
introduction of parametric reforms that shield workers and retirees from abrupt changes in
contributions and benefits. At the same time, some parametric reforms have been proposed to
improve the participation incentives and risk coverage. These reforms could include the following:2

   Unify the SSS old-age benefit formula for all vested members to improve the incentives for
    participation and promote greater equity among workers with different incomes and lengths of
    service;
   Replace the current discretionary indexation of benefits with full and automatic inflation-based
    indexation to help protect retirees against inflation during retirement;
   Extend the wage base for determining benefits and “valorize? the wage base according to the
    average covered wage growth, which would equalize lifetime income replacement between those
    with high and low growth in lifetime wages as well as equalize effective income replacement
    between those whose base is during periods of rapid/slow wage growth;
   Gradually increase the retirement age to 65 years and increase it in the future in accordance with
    increases in life expectancy at retirement age, which will improve the sustainability of the SSS
    scheme;
   Gradually reduce the benefits accrued each year for service after a reform date to a level that
    achieves sustainability over the long term consistent with the other parameters; and

 PROST has been used to simulate these parametric reforms. These simulations provide the basis for an evidence
based assessment.

                                                     - vii -
   The contribution rate could be gradually raised in the future to improve the long-term balance,
    although any increases need to be considered in the context of the overall tax wedge, as such
    measures will likely affect worker coverage and compliance which are also SSS objectives.

At the same time, the Philippines faces a challenge to improve the defacto coverage of workers by
Social Security, as well as to increase the income protection coverage of the elderly. As with many
countries, ensuring informal workers are de facto covered by contributory social security has proven to
be particularly challenging as such workers generally have low and volatile incomes along with other
social and health risks to consider. Around 75 percent of Filipino workers are informally employed and,
while almost all workers are required to contribute, only about 22 percent of those employed actively
contribute to the SSS (and another 3.4 percent to the Government Social Insurance System – GSIS).
With this low labor force coverage, elderly coverage has also been challenging, albeit the Philippines has
been fortunate to have a non-contributory Social Pension which protects the poorest elderly from
poverty.

Going forward, a key challenge will be to increase both types of coverage level of such programs to
ensure that a larger swath of workers contribute and ultimately benefit from their contributions.
Worker coverage in the Philippines is below what it could be due to several factors, including high levels
of informality in the labor market and characteristics in the design of the contributory social security
scheme which may be ill suited to the variable incomes of informal sector workers.

Several options are suggested for the SSS to improve coverage. Administrative reforms could focus on
measures to make it easier and cheaper for informal sector workers to make contributions, monitor
accounts and receive payments. The identification system of the SSS including its de-duplication
capability could also be leveraged to provide more unified identity across institutions. The SSS might
also want to consider introducing a special instrument for informal workers which is designed to align
with their needs and preferences. Such an instrument could be a voluntary, defined-contribution
savings mechanism that offers annuitized benefits at retirement. It should permit partial withdrawals in
the case of defined events such as extended unemployment, catastrophic health events or disability and
natural disasters. Finally, the level and timing of contributions should be flexible to align to the variable
incomes of informal workers.

Although several countries have considered matching contribution subsidies to expand coverage, our
analysis suggests that a more effective alternative would be to broaden the scope of beneficiaries
eligible for social pensions. The poor and vulnerable workers are unlikely to be able to afford the
contribution and the fiscal costs could be substantial depending on the benefit level, match and
targeting. Alternatively, broadening the scope of beneficiaries who are eligible for social pensions could
increase elderly coverage with an immediate impact and in a more cost-effective manner.

Beyond the scope of the SSS, additional measures could strengthen the coverage of social protection
for informal workers. Measures can be taken to improve the access and efficiency of contributions and
payments systems, including measures to strengthen mobile-money platforms. Moreover further
measures are needed to improve access to savings instruments, particularly for small and isolated
savers. Finally, some further improvements to the strong Social Pension have been proposed, including
broadening eligibility to the bottom 40 percent of eligible households; providing automatic annual price
increases in benefits; conducting periodic program assessments of targeting outcomes; and conducting
periodic reviews of the benefit adequacy.

                                                    - viii -
Improvements in SSS sustainability and the instruments and delivery systems for social security
coverage comprise only one part of a broader strategy needed to better protect the vast majority of
workers in the Philippines with low, intermittent and variable sources of income. The most important
and sustainable remedy to improve social security coverage is to improve the quantity and quality of
wage-based employment – measures which are beyond the scope of the SSS scheme design or delivery
systems. Low worker coverage and contribution densities mirror the limited steady wage-based jobs for
most Filipino workers. Low and intermittent incomes often from small companies or agriculture, self-
employed or single proprietors present formidable challenges both to economic stability as well as
provide a weak basis for contributing to social security. Measures are needed to reduce the barriers to
employment generation, which include a weak investment climate and costly business, tax, and labor
market regulations. Moreover, weaknesses in skills need to be addressed. Overall, higher productivity
jobs are essential for coverage expansion. Measures are needed on numerous fronts to strengthen the
quality of growth and job creation including measures to combat the causes of informality, such as
removing barriers to competition and growth in real sectors and addressing barriers to formality
including taxes and labor market provisions.

                    Philippines – Review of the Social Security System


    I.      Introduction

1.      In early 2014, the Philippines Social Security System (SSS) that administers mandatory social
security for the private sector workers in the Philippines, approached the World Bank, seeking advice
on two key concerns: (i) how to increase the de facto coverage of social security (de jure, all employed
persons in the Philippines are mandated to contribute to SSS), and (ii) how to ensure long term
sustainability of the SSS. Regarding the latter, the SSS in particular wanted the World Bank team to
check the SSS’s own actuarial projections to make sure that they are technically robust. The World Bank
team responded by simulating long term fiscal situation of the SSS, as well as several reform options
employing the World Bank’s Pension Reform Options Simulation Tool (PROST) and training the SSS
actuarial team to use it.

2.       This report was undertaken in response to a request by the SSS and thus focuses on the SSS
although other pension and social security schemes such as the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS), Social Pensions, and voluntary pension savings instruments are highlighted. A separate note that
looks at the GSIS is currently being prepared. In addition, the Philippines Social Protection Team is
looking at the coverage and impact of the social pension program as part of the forthcoming Social
Protection Review. Furthermore, while SSS provides old-age, disability and survivors’ benefits, this
report looks focuses on the old-age scheme.

3.       This report summarizes the World Bank team findings and recommendations in response to
the two key questions posed by the client. The report is organized as follows. The next section describes
the demographic and economic conditions that affect the demand for and financing of pensions and
social security in the Philippines. Section III then describes and discusses key programs for old age
income protection, with particular emphasis on the SSS scheme. Section IV lays out options for
parametric changes aimed at improving SSS sustainability and ensuring adequacy of benefits. Section V
outlines various measures to expand the SSS coverage of the informal sector. The final section concludes
with a summary of proposed reform options and longer-term considerations (Section VI).

    II. Demographic and Economic Conditions

    A. Demographic Profile

4.       The Philippines is a young country compared to many other countries in the world. However,
similar to many other countries and although with a lag, it is facing a challenge of an aging population in
not so distant future. Compared to most of its regional peers, the pace of aging in the Philippines has
been relatively slow. The Philippines had one of the youngest population profiles in the region in 2015
and is aging at a rate somewhat slower than most other countries. The pace of growth in old age
dependency rates has also been slower and less severe for the Philippines than for other countries in
East Asia and other middle-income countries (Figure 1), and the starting point in 2015 was less severe
compared with most other countries in the region.

5.      However, some convergence between countries is expected with the continued drop in fertility
rates. The relative proportion of children in the overall population has declined, driven by a significant
decline in fertility rates during the last 60 years: from 7.4 children per woman in 1950-55 to 3.0 in 2010-
2015. The Philippines thus had one of the lowest dependency ratios compared with regional peers in
2015. Convergence is expected over the coming 35 years as many countries in the region are projected
to approach replacement fertility of about 2.09 in the years ahead (Figure 2).3

6.       The projected demographic trends signal that the Philippines will be facing the challenge of an
aging population in not so distant future. The old-age dependency ratio (those over age 60 as a
proportion of those who are working-age) is projected to almost double from about 12 percent in 2015
to 22.5 percent in 2050 (Figure 3). The aging of the population is projected to impact the economic and
social landscape and the way people work and live, including on labor market participation well beyond
current retirement age, the social security arrangements and their sustainability, the cost of health and
elderly care and so on. The good news is that the Philippines is still a young country, with opportunities
and time to learn from other faster aging countries.

7.      Workers covered by the SSS have considerably higher old age dependency ratios when
compared with the broader population, which is a key determinant in the sustainability of the SSS
scheme (Figure 1). This is consistent with trends in other countries in the region, as fertility rates among
the covered population tend to be lower than for the population as a whole, and life expectancy at
retirement age also tends to be higher. A key reason for this may be that the current contributors and
beneficiaries tend to be wealthier urban workers who have lower fertility rates and higher life
expectancies and belong to the group of workers with formal employment and stable tenure.

8.      Going forward, in about quarter of a century, increases in the SSS old age dependency ratio
along with flattening of the relative size of the working-age population will begin to have significant
implications for pensions and social security policy. In general, pension schemes such as the SSS that
are financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or partially funded basis will face increasing outflows due to
increasing numbers of retirees. At the same time, they will face moderating inflows as the number of
contributors will be limited by the delayed effects of declining fertility rates. At the household level,
aging means that families will have to support more retired members with a smaller ratio of working
household members to those too old to work.

    B. Labor Market

9.     The Philippine labor market is characterized by high levels of informality.4 The World Bank has
estimated that around 75 percent of Filipino workers are informally employed. The National Statistics

4
 See World Bank, Philippine Development Report: Creating More and Better Jobs , September 2013, p. 72. The
report defines informal workers as including self-employed workers (not including employers); unpaid family
workers; and wage workers with no written contract, social insurance, or protection from dismissal. The data
source was the 2008 Informal Sector Survey (ISS) 62 of the National Statistics Office (NSO). Administrative data on
the population covered by SSS by firm size was not available. See also World Bank, Republic of the Philippines,
Labor Market Review, Employment and Poverty, Report Number: AUS8661, January 22, 2016.

                                                                         -4-
Office (NSO) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) estimate that around 90 percent of
Filipinos work in micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSME) or as own-account workers. The
NSO broadly defines the informal sector as those enterprises that fall outside the purview of
government regulations. Operationally, the informal sector includes the agriculture and informal
services sectors, the latter of which includes wholesale and retail trade, transportation, communication,
and storage.

10.      Although wage and salaried workers account for about 55 percent of total employment,
many of these workers do not contribute to the SSS, and many do not receive adequate protection
under the Labor Code. Only about 38 percent of wage workers indicate that they contribute to the SSS
or GSIS. About 40 percent of wage workers have some level of protection from dismissal; about one-
third get compensation in the case of dismissal; and about one-third get some form of paid leave, sick
leave, and/or maternity/paternity leave (Table 1). The remaining workers are either own-account (33
percent) or unpaid workers in family micro-enterprises (12 percent) that generally have even lower
levels of protection. Agricultural workers have the highest degree of informality, with more than 90
percent of workers experiencing low levels of protection and high levels of income insecurity.

11.     Such high levels of informality can be explained by both worker characteristics and the nature
and composition of jobs. Barriers to employment generation include a weak investment climate and
costly business, tax, and labor market regulations. Workers also have a limited skill set, in part due to
the substantial outmigration of skilled workers. The result is that “the vast majority of workers have
remained trapped in low-wage and low-productivity jobs in the informal sector, with limited
opportunities to move up the job ladder.?5

12.     The high level of informality and wage distribution have important implications for social
security participation. There are significant and understandable challenges in the enforcement of
contribution compliance requirements in an environment characterized by high levels of informality.
Weak enforcement leads many employers either not to participate or to selectively participate only for
long-term workers. This is aligned with workers’ interests to the extent that employees may also seek to
avoid remitting employee contributions or may collaborate with employers to under-report wages.
Moreover, very limited job security, low wages and other potential risks such as loss of health generally

leads workers to prefer immediate compensation rather than waiting until retirement6. Short-term risks
such as loss of income or health, or investment in children’s education may tend to be much higher
priorities for workers than saving for retirement.

    C. Elderly Living Arrangements and Sources of Income7

13.     Living arrangements and sources of income are important to elderly vulnerability and poverty
and thus have implications for the design of contributory pensions or non-contributory social
assistance. Elderly living with non-elderly potentially have access to the labor income of non-elderly, but
they are similarly vulnerable if there is insufficient income or if the household falls into poverty. Such
undiversifiable risk is one of the rationales for elderly assistance programs such as the Social Pension
scheme in the Philippines.

14.      Data on elderly living arrangements provides a strong rationale for using the household as the
basis for targeting the Social Pension program. More than 80 percent of Filipino elderly live with non-
elderly, although this ratio decreases somewhat as the elderly get older (Figure 2). The proportion of
elderly as heads of household also decreases with age. At the same time, the proportion of elderly living
alone and living only with elderly increases with age. This data underscores the rationale for using the
household as the basis for targeting the Social Pension program. The national household targeting
system - Listahanan is used to identify poor elderly who may qualify for the social pension program if
they meet other program specific requirements based on a per-capita income estimates.

  This section was substantially limited by the absence of household survey data that indicates the sources of
individual income tabulated by five-year cohorts. This analysis examined elderly employment data in an effort to
get a fuller picture of their income sources and vulnerability.

15.      In terms of income sources, labor force participation is noticeably high among the working-
age population, particularly at higher ages, indicating the importance of labor income to households.
Total labor force participation peaks during the ages of 45-54, although men are beginning to leave the
labor force as women continue to increase their participation (Figure 3). By ages 55-64, total labor force
participation remains at almost 70 percent. Although elderly Filipinos are employed less as they age,
labor force participation remains high until they are unable to work. About one-third of workers ages
75-79 report to have worked.

age. As Filipinos reach the legal retirement age of 65, their relative employment in government and
private enterprises declines substantially from about one-third to about 21 percent at ages 75-79, with
further decline for older workers (Figure 4). Among older workers with employment income, self-
employment income grows from about 58 percent of the total for those ages 58-64 to over 75 percent
for those age 80 and above. As indicated in Figure 4, the proportion of elderly that are employed
understandably falls from 65 percent from ages 58-64 to only 15% at ages 80 and above as individuals
lose the capacity to work.

17.      As the elderly age and rely less on employment income, other income sources such as intra-
household transfers and asset-based income take on substantial importance (Table 2).8 For those
elderly living with non-elderly, asset-based income and transfers represent almost one-third of
household income. Those elderly either living alone or with all elderly rely much less on labor income
and much more on asset income than multi-generational households. Notably, pension income is not
significant, accounting for only about 12-13 percent of total income for households comprised of all
elderly and even less for those living with non-elderly.

     D. Poverty and Inequality

18.     Poverty incidence in the working-age population provides some indication of the difficulty
individuals have in contributing to payroll-tax based social security arrangements. As of mid-2014,
about one-fifth of households and about one-quarter of individuals in the Philippines fell under the
national poverty line.9 Rural and agricultural workers are particularly vulnerable to poverty and
represent the bulk of the working poor as well as urban workers who have informal and low-skilled jobs
who are vulnerable to poverty.10 Labor force status has little impact on the risk of poverty and indeed
the majority of working age poor are employed.11 Workers in private households (such as domestic
workers) and family-operated businesses or farms—who comprise relatively smaller proportions of the
total population—have the highest poverty incidence (Figure 5). Understandably, the self-employed
have higher risk of poverty when compared with wage workers in both rural and urban areas.12

19.      Poverty incidence among the elderly was lower than for other age groups, possibly because of
family support/living arrangements and accumulated assets. In 2013, poverty incidence among the
elderly (11 percent) was significantly lower than the national average (over 25%), lower than for the
working-age population and was less than half that of children age 14 and under (29 percent) (Figure
6).13 This pattern, which is consistent with many countries worldwide, may be partly explained by many
elderly having children to support them and some having accumulated assets in retirement. As of 2013,
almost half of the poor in the Philippines were children, while only 5.7 percent of the total were elderly.
From a policy perspective, this distribution of poverty suggests that scarce resources for transfers should
consider poverty prevalence across lifecycle when using the age of recipients as an eligibility criteria.

20.      In addition to the challenge of poverty, the Philippines faces high levels of income and welfare
inequality. The income Gini coefficient for the Philippines was 48.0 in 2012, one of the highest in the
region.14 Almost half of the income was received by those in the top quintile, while those in the bottom
quintile received about 6 percent (Figure 7).

       E. Conclusions

21.      To conclude, the following were the major findings of this section: The Philippines has a
relatively young demographic profile though the proportion of elderly is increasing. The labor market is
characterized by high rates of informality for the Philippines per capita income level with such high
levels attributed to worker characteristics and the nature and composition of jobs. About 80 percent of
the elderly live in households with non-elderly, and often both contribute to the household and depend
on other elderly and non-elderly household members when they cannot work. Understandably,
employment by the elderly decreases as individuals get older. Poverty incidence among the elderly was
lower than for the working age population and much lower than for children. There is also very high
income inequality.

       III. Social Security and Pension Programs for Private Sector Workers

22.     This section describes the SSS scheme, including its programs for informal workers, private
voluntary supplementary schemes, and the DSWD Social Pension. The discussion of supplementary
schemes and the Social Pension has been limited to their importance as part of coverage expansion
options. The section does not discuss the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) or contributory
Home Development Mutual Fund, also known as the Pag-IBIG Fund.

23.      The SSS is a defined-benefit scheme for private sector employees, including the self-employed.
The scheme has three benefit formulas, essentially providing the best of: (i) 40 percent of the wage base
for those with 10 years of contributions, (ii) PHP 300/month + 20 percent of the wage base for 10 years
and 2.0 percent per year of contributory service for each year thereafter, or (iii) PHP 1,200/month (Table
3). Annuitized benefits can be received after 10 years of contributions at age 60 for most workers, 55
for miners, and 65 for the self-employed. Age 65 is the mandatory retirement age. Indexation is
discretionary based on the observed level of inflation and the financial position of the fund. The
applicable minimum pension depends on the years of contribution, with a minimum benefit of PHP
1,200/month after 10 years of contributory service and PHP 2,400/month after 20 years of contributory
service.15

24.      The SSS is a partially funded scheme with mandatory contributions. Contribution rates are 7.4
percent for employers and 3.6 percent for employees, or 11.0 percent total for both. The self-employed
pay the full 11.0 percent contribution. Although there is a minimum covered wage of PHP 1,000/month,
this is waived for participants in the AlkanSSSya program for informal sector workers, described in
greater detail below.16 The maximum covered wage is PHP 16,000/month or about 100 percent of the
average wage for covered workers.

  As stated in the Introduction, this report does not discuss disability, survivorship, and work injury benefits.

  The minimum covered wage ranges from about 200 to 400 percent of the legal minimum wage, which varies by
region. See Department of Labor and Employment, National Wages and Productivity Commission, 2016,

     2. Coverage

25.      Although de-jure worker participation in the pension schemes is mandatory, actual or de-
facto coverage rates are low. The legal requirement for participation extends to all workers including
self-employed, temporary, and informal sector workers. However, although there are over 30 million
accounts with the SSS, only about 25 percent of the employed contribute on an active basis (Table 4).13
In 2013, about 17.8 percent of the working-age population and 25.8 percent of the labor force had
contributed more than a month to either the SSS or GSIS. This level of worker coverage is roughly
consistent with that of countries at a similar level of per capita GDP (Figure 8).18 A key reason for the
strong correlation between worker coverage and per capita income is that the proportion of wage-
based income tends to be higher in countries with higher levels of per capita income.

13
   Active contributors are defined as those who have contributed at least one month in the past 12 months. It is
possible that inactive members may have more than one account. We have no way of identifying multiple
accounts which could be associated with individual members. It should be noted that these “de facto? coverage
rates are only a fraction of the “de-jure? coverage which is close to all workers engaged in economic activity.
14
   The data point in the figure refers to worker coverage for both the SSS and GSIS combined.

             (Contributors as a percent of the working-age population in 2012 / GDP per capita – log scale)




26.     The average density of SSS contributions in the Philippines is relatively low, suggesting that
many workers are not participating for a substantial portion of their work lives. The average
contribution density at retirement - measured as a proportion of a full work life from youth through
retirement age - was about 26.5 in 2013. Such relatively low contribution densities, weaken individual
replacement rates, affecting the adequacy of benefits.

27.     In terms of beneficiary coverage, only 14.2 percent of those age 60 and above receive an old
age pension from the SSS. One reason for the lower coverage rate of the elderly compared to the
working population is that many older workers reach retirement age with insufficient years of
contributory service to qualify for annuitized benefits. Very high levels of co-residency suggest that most
of those without pensions will be covered by other means including intra-household transfers,
remittances, and earnings from assets as discussed earlier.

28.      The SSS has made substantial efforts to increase coverage by expanding the scope of
employers and workers required to contribute. With respect to legal coverage, by 1960, all employers
with at least one employee were required to contribute.19 The self-employed were required to
contribute beginning in 1980, with self-employed professions then expanding to farmers, fisherman, and
others in the 1990s. However, the actual implementation of the legal mandate for coverage has been
costly and difficult to enforce, largely due, as discussed above, to the labor market situation of workers
in the Philippines (prevailing informality and non-contract, intermittent employment).

29.     SSS member applications are accepted from self-employed people such as entrepreneurs,
freelancers, and informal sector workers, as well as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and non-
working spouses of active members. Those eligible for voluntary SSS membership, such as OFWs and
non-working spouses of active SSS members, can apply for their own SSS number through the SSS
website. The SSS number issued can be converted from temporary to permanent status by presenting
any accepted supporting documents, such as a birth or baptismal certificate or valid passport.

30.     The SSS also initiated measures several years ago to make it easier for informal sector
workers, the self-employed, and voluntary contributors to contribute. According to Mesa-Lago (2011),
a system of Automatic Debt Arrangements was put in place to support informal worker contributions
through accredited banks through automatic account deductions or over-the-counter transactions.20
Minimum deposit requirements were lowered for savings accounts at such accredited banks.
Unfortunately, participation in these arrangements was very limited. The SSS also began to accredit
cooperatives as collection agents for self-employed and voluntary contributors in 2011.

31.     In 2012, the SSS launched the AlkanSSSya program with the aim of broadening the actual
coverage to include the self-employed and informal sector. The program targets low- and limited-
income workers such as tricycle drivers, farmers, market vendors, fishermen, and other self-employed
individuals.21 It aims to establish a piggy bank-like savings program in which the daily discipline of
contributing at least PHP 10 could, over time, support a meaningful level of social security benefits.
After three months of contributions, members are entitled to sickness, maternity, or funeral benefits.
Educational loans are available after 12 months of contributions, disability loans after 36 months, and a
pension claim after 10 years (at retirement age).

32.      The SSS has partnered with informal sector groups (ISGs) and worker associations to facilitate
collections and to market the AlkanSSSya program. Associations such as the association of tricycle
drivers have helped serve as channels for worker registration, collections, and information disclosure.
The SSS has also established a system of savings bank boxes at various locations where workers can
deposit their daily contributions. At the end of 2014, the SSS had an estimated more than 122,000
members participating through over 1,200 ISGs.22

33.     There are also severance arrangements and voluntary occupational and personal pension
provisions operating outside of the scope of the SSS which could contribute towards coverage
expansion and supplementary benefits (See Box 1). Although the tax advantages which will be available
for Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA) are unlikely to be a meaningful incentive for
informal workers (many of whom do not pay personal income taxes), such accounts can provide a
meaningful supplement for middle-class self-employed and other workers.

           Box 1:     Severance and Voluntary Occupational and Personal Pensions Arrangements
     Mandatory benefits provided by employers at retirement are established by law but such laws are generally
     not enforced. The Mandatory Retirement Pay Law of 1992 stipulates that all private sector employees are
     entitled to a payment at retirement (optional at ages 60-64 and mandatory at age 65) equivalent to a half
     month of salary for each year of service. This benefit is provided by the employer and is in addition to benefits
     provided by the SSS.

     Voluntary occupational and personal pension plans are offered by “pre -need? and life insurance companies
     as well as can be directly provided by employers. “Pre-need companies? are authorized by the Insurance
     Commission to provide plans that are contracts providing for future payments. These pre-need pension plans
     have been in place since 1977. Pre-need plans often have a combination of endowment insurance and
     deferred annuities with life insurance policies in the event of death before retirement. Pre-need plans have
     also been available for other life events such as college savings. In August 2015, 12 out of 16 licensed pre-need
                                         19
     companies offered pension plans. Insurance companies are also authorized to offer endowment and annuity
     contracts, which are considered life insurance contracts under the Philippine Insurance Code.

     In 2008, the Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA) law established a common framework for tax-
     free private pension schemes . The authorities have since been putting in place operational, regulatory, and
     supervisory infrastructure to support the schemes. Although the schemes were supposed to begin operations
     in 2015, at the time of this writing, it seems that the authorization of providers or initial offering of the scheme
     has not yet taken place. The PERA will offer considerable tax advantages for participation, including a 5-percent
     tax credit for contributions up to PHP 100,000 yearly (PHP 200,000 for OFWs), tax exemption on fund
     accumulations, and tax-free withdrawals at age 55 and above (after contributing for at least five years). In the
     case of death, PERA assets are to be distributed to heirs tax-free (even if it happens before turning age 55).


34.      To summarize, coverage and contribution densities are low in large part due to limited steady
wage-based sources of income for many Filipino workers. Payroll-based contributory social security
schemes tend to be most effective in covering individuals with steady wage incomes, however, most
Filipino workers have intermittent work, often work in small companies or agriculture, or are self-
employed or single proprietors. The SSS has made substantial efforts to increase coverage by expanding
the scope of employers and workers required to contribute. The SSS also initiated measures several
years ago to make it easier for informal sector workers, the self-employed, and voluntary contributors to
contribute. Automatic Debt Arrangements were put in place to support informal worker contributions
through accredited banks through automatic account deductions. Moreover, the SSS launched the
AlkanSSSya program with the aim of broadening the coverage of the self-employed and informal sector.

       3. Sustainability

35.      Baseline projections of SSS system finances using the Pension Reform Options Simulation
Toolkit (PROST) suggest that the SSS faces a challenge to achieve long-term sustainability, albeit some
time to adopt parametric reforms to address the challenge. Financial surpluses are projected for
roughly the next 20 years, after which time projected deficits would eliminate fund assets about eight
years later (Figure 9).23 The projected fund life for the SSS is therefore about 28 years extending to

23
 These projected estimates are based on several assumptions such as anticipated coverage levels, growth in real
wages, and real returns on investment assets. Actual outcomes will likely differ from the projections to the degree

about 2044.24 Projected system finances deteriorate over time, as the SSS system old age dependency
ratios increase, leading to payouts in excess of revenues of over 1.0 percent of GDP by about 2060. The
baseline projections produced similar results as the SSS 2011 Actuarial Assessment thereby effectively
providing an external validation of the SSS actuarial results.25

36.     Much of the projected deterioration in the sustainability of the SSS stems from an aging profile
of contributors and retirees along with a benefit formula and qualifying conditions that over time
cannot be fully supported by contribution levels. An important driver is the projected number of
contributors and retirees (Figure 10). The SSS is a maturing scheme, with many of its initial participants
having reached or reaching retirement. The relative growth of the retiree and beneficiary populations
will become more rapid during the projection period, resulting in growing system dependency ratios.


that the underlying assumptions differ from actual experience. Appendix 3 provides sensitivity analysis to
illustrate the impact of alternative assumptions.
24
   The fund balance is defined as: (contributions + investment income) – (benefits paid + other expenses). The
fund life is defined as the number of continuous years during which projected fund assets are positive.
25
   The PROST projections were made using end-2013 SSS administrative data. Although the projections were
prepared in consultation with SSS staff, the Bank validated the major model assumptions. Staff compared the
projections and isolated the reasons for the (minor) differences in results between the PROST baseline projection
on the one hand, and the SSS 2011 Actuarial Assessment, on the other. The fund life termination of 2044
compares with the SSS Actuarial Assessment projection of 2042. The differences are immaterial for a long-term
actuarial assessment and can be attributed to several factors including differences in the base year used in the
projections, inflation assumptions, applicable contribution rates, and the cap on covered wages assumed.

These increasing system dependency ratios result in projected benefit payments that over time are
higher than contributions and investment returns.

37.     On the other hand, the baseline projections also suggest that the Philippines can enact a
gradual program of parametric reforms that can strengthen sustainability while at the same time
avoiding abrupt changes to benefits, eligibility conditions or contribution rates. As discussed below, a
gradual approach to implementing parametric reforms can achieve sustainability while preserving
acquired rights. A comparison of selected countries in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region shows that
public schemes in other countries face sustainability challenges, as well, albeit generally in a more
pronounced form that the Philippine’s case (Table 5).26




26
  The comparison should be read with caution, because there is no common framework for benchmarking
sustainability across countries. Such a framework would require a common projection methodology, including a
framework for long-term assumptions for key variables, which is currently not available.

       4.    Adequacy and Equity

38.      Examining replacement rates for full-term workers, the Philippines was found to promise a
benefit from the SSS comparable to several other countries in the EAP region. OECD estimates of full-
term replacement rates suggest that the Philippines has a gross replacement rate of about 38 percent,
just below the ILO target of 40 percent and below the OECD average of about 54 percent (Figure 11).27
A comparison with other EAP countries shows that replacement rates in the Philippines for middle- and
low-income covered workers are higher than in several countries but lower than in China and Vietnam
which have distinct socialist histories leading to higher replacement rates.

39.    Discretionary indexation of SSS benefits has failed to keep up with inflation over the past two
decades, affecting adequacy. Indexation on average covered only about 60 percent of growth in the
consumer price index (CPI) over the past two decades. Moreover, there were substantial multi-year lags
between the adoption of indexation adjustments.

40.      In terms of equity, the distribution of pension income is concentrated in higher-income
households (Figure 12). Almost half of the share of contributory pension benefits goes to those in the
top decile of the income distribution, and almost 80 percent of the share goes to those in the top three
deciles. Not only is the share of pensions concentrated in the upper deciles, but pension income as a
proportion of household income also is highest in the upper deciles, with pension income representing
almost 5 percent of total income for the top decile.

41.     The distribution of pension benefits largely mirrors the profile of contributors. Contributors
tend to be higher-income workers with steady wages. These workers tend to be relatively well off in
retirement, as well.

    5. Identification and Delivery Systems

42.       One particularly noteworthy administrative feature of the SSS (and GSIS) is the use of an
identification system for their members, including biometric identification and smart-cards. An
executive order in 2005 required all government agencies and government-owned and controlled
corporations (GOCC) to streamline and harmonize their identification systems. In 2008, the social
security identification system was identified as the core of the Unique Multi-Purpose Identification
(UMID) system, and the SSS was instructed to lead in the streamlining and harmonization of the ID
systems of all government agencies and GOCCs. Although the UMID card has been characterized as a
unified card for transactions of four government agencies, namely: SSS, GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG
(Home Development Mutual Fund), the databases are not linked between the agencies and there is no
process for deduplication across agencies. In April 2015, the SSS announced the release schedule for its
own UMID card, which can be used to view an individual’s SSS profile and account, statistical
information, SSS premiums, history, SSS loans, and balances.



                                                                   - 21 -
43.       Importantly, the SSS database has de-duplication/reconciliation processes so that those
members with SSS UMID cards can be ensured to be unique. Authentication is done initially through
verification of birth certificates and establishment of biometric identifiers. Validation can be done at SSS
offices as well as in banks. Inquiries are web-based, with authentication through pin numbers.28 The
database of members will be materially strengthened as the SSS gradually issues UMID cards to replace
earlier identification.

44.     Measures have also been taken to improve SSS delivery systems. Registration has been
automated online, and contributions and loan repayments can also be done online through two banks,
including through a large network of ATMs. An online service portal (My.SSS) allows SSS members to
have exclusive access to their contributions and membership records, make online transactions, and
request copies of their records as needed. The online portal is not yet available on mobile phones,
although efforts are being made to provide it in the near future.

     B. Social Pensions

45.      As stipulated by the Senior Citizens Act, the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD) has provided a Social Pension benefit for indigent senior citizens since 2011. As of 2015, the
scheme covered about 940,000 individuals or about 20 percent of those aged 65 and above (Table 4).
Since its inception, the benefit has been PHP 500 (about US$10.70) per month, paid quarterly. The cost
in 2015 was about PHP 6.0 billion or 0.08 percent of GDP, having risen substantially since 2014 with a
reduction in the age of qualification from 77 to 65 (Table 6).

                                             Table 6:    Social Pension Budgets

46.      Aside from being identified as poor by the national household targeting system Listahanan,29
beneficiaries must meet other eligibility criteria. The beneficiary must: (i) be frail, sickly, or with
disability; (ii) not receive a pension such as from SSS, GSIS, or an occupational pension; and (iii) be
without a permanent source of income, compensation, or financial assistance from his/her relatives to
support his/her basic needs. From 2011 through 2014, the benefit was limited to those age 77 and
above, but since January 2015, the beneficiary must be 65 years old and above. Applicants must obtain a

  Listahanan is a national household targeting system hosted by DSWD. Originally, it was established in 2008 to
support the conditional cash transfer program. In 2009/10, data from about 11 million or 60% of Filipino
households was collected of which 5.3 million were identified as poor. In 2010, a presidential decree was issued
obliging all government agencies to use Listahanan to identify poor beneficiaries of Government’s poverty
reduction programs. In 2015, DSWD collected information from 75% of Filipino households (15.1 million) to
update Listahanan. Listahanan uses a proxy means method to estimate per capita income of surveyed households
and provincial poverty lines to identify the poor. The list of poor households are verified by communities for
accuracy and transparency, before being finally determined.

Senior Citizen’s Identification Card (OSCA ID) issued by local government units (LGUs). Obtaining such
an ID requires other valid identification or a birth certificate.

47.     Payments are made quarterly as follows: (i) direct cash payments are made to beneficiaries by
designated Disbursement Officers of DSWD; (ii) funds are transferred to the LGU that is charged with
disbursing to final beneficiaries; and (iii) door-to-door delivery can be done by an identified social
provider.

48.       The DSWD program compares relatively well to its peers in the EAP (Table 7). The key design
variables for elderly assistance programs are the benefit level and indexation, means testing, and age
and other eligibility conditions. These parameters are established in light of the fiscal resources available
to support the benefit as well as tradeoffs with other development priorities. Table 7 provides a
comparison of the Philippines Social Pension with other elderly assistance programs in the EAP region.
One should however keep in mind that programs are not strictly comparable, because of differing
eligibility requirements.

49.      The benefit level appears to be adequate for most elderly poor. The benefit represented about
8.3 percent of GDP per capita in 2014. While the benefit covers only about 28 percent of the national
per capita poverty threshold, it is very close to the poverty income gap on a per capita basis. However,
the benefit level is not indexed, subjecting beneficiaries to price risk. No adjustments have been made
since it was introduced in 2011 resulting in a decline in the real value of the benefit by about 15 percent.
However, the coverage was extended by lowering the qualifying age from 77 to 65, indicating that the
tradeoff was in favor of expanding the coverage.

50.     Some concerns have also been raised over possible targeting errors. As no targeting system is
perfect, targeting errors could include exclusion errors (individuals who are poor and should get a Social
Pension benefit but do not) and inclusion errors (individuals who should not be classified as poor but
have been and have therefore qualified for Social Pension benefits). The Listahanan update in 2015 is

expected to correct the errors to a large extent. In addition, there is a mechanism through which any
individual may demand to be reassessed.

     IV. Parametric Reforms to the Social Security System

51.      In this section we present options for the reform of the SSS scheme parameters that the SSS
may consider to strengthen its financial sustainability. At the same time such reform options can also
improve the incentives and equitability of benefits. We used the Pension Reform Options Simulation
Toolkit (PROST) to project the baseline and the impact of four reform packages.30 The packages of
reforms are intended to serve as examples to illustrate the impact of changes in parameters and
qualifying conditions. The packages involve those key design parameters and eligibility conditions which
can be adjusted to achieve the desired objectives. Our intention is to illustrate the impact of each
reform as well as the interactive effects between the different reform packages. The projected financing
gap was evaluated (to assess sustainability), and replacement rates were calculated (to assess
adequacy). Table 8 summarizes the parametric reforms and the rationale behind them, and Table 9
summarizes the projection results for each of the reform packages.

  The Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) is a proprietary modeling program developed by the
World Bank which has been used to simulate pension and social security finances and evaluate reform options in
over 100 countries worldwide (See Annex 1).

52.    Four packages of parametric reforms for the SSS have been evaluated which are intended to
achieve sustainability, strengthen incentives for participation and wage reporting, improve the
coverage of inflation risks during retirement, and moderate the contribution rate to ensure
affordability.32 Although the four packages of reforms evaluated can together achieve these objectives,
we suggest that the authorities use the proposed parametric changes as a starting point to further

31
  Key assumptions are provided in Annex 1.
32
  One reform program which the Bank did not model was a Filipino proposal to increase SSS pensions by 2,000
PHP per month. Logically, a piecemeal pension increase of such a large magnitude (over 50% on average) without
concomitant public subsidies or increases in contributions would have a profound adverse impact on the
sustainability of the SSS. Such adverse impact on SSS system finances would place a substantial additional burden
on SSS members to sustain their promised benefits. Alternatively, some of the future promised benefits may not
be able to be delivered unless alternative financing sources are found.

evaluate a combination of reforms that best weighs the tradeoffs between fiscal cost, sustainability,
adequacy and coverage suggested. Projections can be useful in helping policymakers identify the
package of parametric reforms that would best meet their objectives for the SSS.

53.     The objective of the reforms proposed in Reform Package 1 (Reforms A-C) is to improve the
incentives for participation and to promote greater equity among workers of different incomes and
different service lengths. Reform A would harmonize the accrual rate and equalize the incentives for
workers to contribute regardless of their service histories. Reform B would extend the wage base and
valorize the base according to covered wage growth.33 This would remove a subtle regressive effect of
the current benefit formula whereby the lifetime income replacement rate is equalized between those
with sharp increases in lifetime wages and those with lower increases.34 Reform C would establish
automatic inflation indexation of benefits to protect retirees from inflation during retirement. This can
improve worker confidence in the ability of the benefit to smooth consumption during retirement, thus
improving the cost-benefit ratio from the workers’ perspective.

54.     The three reforms in Package 1 (A-C) would have impacts on the sustainability of the SSS
scheme and on replacement rates both for new retirees and for all retirees (Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure
15). Establishing a linear accrual rate would somewhat improve sustainability, as workers with between
10-20 years of contributions would receive lower replacement rates. Valorization of the wage base
would increase the replacement rate and reduce sustainability, more than offsetting the improvement
through the linear accrual rate. Automatic indexation of benefits to inflation would somewhat affect the
financing gap because the growth of benefits through indexation would be substantially better than
those observed over the past two decades. Together, the package of three parametric reforms would
increase the financing gap by about 14 percentage points and move up the break-even point from the
baseline 2036 to 2030 (Figure 13).




33
   This would be a gradual process whereby the salary reference period could be increased at a pace consistent
with recordkeeping capacity, such as increasing the wage base at a pace of one year per year after the reform is
established. To illustrate the effect of reform A
34
   On average, cross-country data suggests that those with high incomes at retirement tend to have sharper rises in
wages during their work histories compared to those with relatively low salaries. As a result, if one were to
calculate the individual lifetime replacement rate —that is, the benefit under the existing benefit formula as a
proportion of the lifetime individual covered wage (valorized or indexed by the growth in the average wage) —
those individuals with high pre-retirement incomes would have higher replacement rates compared to workers
with low incomes, assuming that both types of workers have the same work histories.

55.       The second reform package to gradually increase the minimum retirement age from 60 to 65
would increase incentives to work longer and improve sustainability (Figure 14, Figure 15).
Subsequently, the retirement age could be increased to in line with increases in life expectancy at
retirement age to maintain a life expectancy of 15 years at retirement.35 Increasing the minimum
retirement age by 5 years would decrease the projected years in retirement by about 3.4 years thereby
having a significant impact on SSS financial sustainability (Figure 16).36 By comparison, over the past 35
years, life expectancy at age 60 has increased 0.7 percentage points and is projected to increase further
by 1.8 percentage points over the coming 35 years. Regional data suggests that the Philippines had
relatively low life expectancy at retirement ages in 2015 (Figure 17). Increasing the retirement age is an
essential parametric reform which results from the gradual decline in the fertility rate among the SSS-
covered population and the increase in life expectancy. These same characteristics have led many
countries globally to increase the retirement age and put in place stronger incentives to keep individuals
in the labor force as they get older. In addition, the benefit provided for retirees retiring earlier than the
minimum retirement age should be subject to an actuarially fair benefit penalty, and those retiring after
the minimum retirement age should receive an actuarially fair supplement that would have the effect of
ensuring actuarial fairness of benefits among those retiring at different ages, therefore removing the
current disincentive to work longer.37 The penalties and supplements would also enable workers to
make retirement choices that fit their needs and circumstances.




35
   Although we chose a target life expectancy at retirement of 15 years, other targets could also be modeled and
considered. The logic of aligning the retirement age with life expectancy at retirement contributes to a financial
balance by maintaining a fixed number of years in retirement as life expectancy increases at the retirement age.
36
   These figures are based on mortality for the entire country. Cross-country data suggests that it is very likely that
the SSS retirees have longer life expectancies at retirement ages.
37
   In addition, the labor law provides for mandatory retirement at age 65, which this analysis suggests should be
eliminated.

56.     The impact of the third reform package (which would gradually reduce the marginal accrual
rate) would be a gradual reduction in replacement rates at retirement and some strengthening in
system finances (Figure 14, Figure 15).38 This would reduce rights accrued after initiation of the reform
and would not impact rights accrued prior to the reform. The replacement rate and financial flows
would be only fully adjusted after about 40 years. The impact on the financing gap would be a reduction
(from the scenario for Package 2) from 36 percent of GDP to 23 percent, a reduction of 13 percentage
points.

57.      The fourth reform package illustrates the quantitative effect of an increase in the total
contribution rate from 11 percent to 15 percent (Figure 14, Figure 15). Such an increase begins in 2031
under the assumption that it would make limited sense to levy a contribution increase in the short term
based on financial flows that only become negative over the long term. This package of contribution
increases need to be considered in the context of the overall tax wedge as discussed further below.39

58.      Finally, for illustrative purposes, a variant on the fourth reform package was modeled which
increases the total contribution rate sufficiently to eliminate the projected financing gap by 2080
(Figure 14, Figure 15). Eliminating the financing gap would require an 18 percent contribution rate
beginning in 2031. Table 10 illustrates the effects of such contribution increases for workers at different
wage levels. A contribution rate increase is not suggested to be enacted in the short-run because the
demographics, coverage and financial flows will change over time and could end up being more
favorable than projected currently. Rather, it is suggested that this issue of a long-term contribution
rate required for financing equilibrium be revisited with each SSS actuarial valuation and that a decision

38
   The reduction in the accrual rate by 0.5 percent per year and the timing over five years is meant as a reference
point only. The actual reduction and phasing should be calibrated to the circumstances, including the political
economy dimensions.
39
   As noted above, the level of contribution increase and the phasing are meant as illustrations of the effects. The
actual reform parameters adopted should be determined with the support of additional modeling.

sustainability, future increases should be considered in the context of the overall tax wedge, as such
measures will likely affect worker coverage and compliance. The tax wedge is the overall set of
additional costs of labor in addition to wages and includes social security contributions, health insurance
contributions, personal income tax rates, severance payments, the cost of minimum wage policies, and
any other non-wage labor costs. As suggested in Figure 18 below, marginal tax rates are very steep, so
just these costs represent a substantial cost for labor and create a strong incentive for wage under-
reporting and tax avoidance. It is therefore important to model different levels and timing of increases in
the contribution rate and reductions in the marginal accrual rate to see which mix can best achieve the
sustainability objective, while also managing the affordability of contributions and adequacy of benefits.

60.       Together, these parametric reforms could have the effect of improving sustainability,
adequacy, equitability, and participation incentives (Figure 19). The proposed and modeled parametric
changes would improve the projected long-term sustainability of SSS financing, improve inflation risk
coverage (through indexation), strengthen work incentives (through retirement age and benefit
adjustments), and improve equitability among workers with different salary profiles (through an
improved benefit formula). Transition provisions have been proposed which aim to make the
adjustments in benefits and contributions smooth, thereby avoiding disruptive shocks to workers and
retirees. Of course, achieving sustainability is not without cost, namely in terms of increased
contributions and reduced marginal benefit levels.

        V. Options to Consider to Improve Coverage

A. Overall Considerations to Increase Social Security Coverage and Income Protection in
   Old Age

61.      The most important and sustainable remedy to improve social security coverage is to improve
the quantity and quality of wage-based employment – measures which are beyond the scope of the
SSS scheme design or delivery systems. Low worker coverage and contribution densities mirror the
limited steady wage-based jobs for most Filipino workers. Low and intermittent incomes often from
small companies or agriculture, self-employed or single proprietors present formidable challenges both
to economic stability as well as provide a weak basis for contributing to social security. Measures are
needed to reduce the barriers to employment generation, which include a weak investment climate and
costly business, tax, and labor market regulations. Moreover, weaknesses in skills need to be addressed.
Overall, higher productivity jobs are essential for coverage expansion.

                                                               - 33 -
62.     Measures to increase worker coverage are needed to increase the probability that workers
will have a steady source of income from social security once they reach old age. Support elderly
receive from other household/family members are subject to non-diversifiable unemployment, health,
and natural disaster risks, which the elderly can only diversify with alternative sources of income in
retirement. Moreover, the large number of elderly who are dependent on household income support is
increasing and they are living longer, so household incomes will have to support a growing number of
elderly dependents. Finally, workers may be more inclined to take occupational risks and make more
risky entrepreneurial investments if they can be assured that they will have some level of income in old
age and will be protected from poverty.

63.       As elsewhere in the world, contributory schemes such as the SSS face particular challenges in
covering workers that have low and intermittent incomes, regardless of whether or not contributions
are mandatory as they are for most workers in the Philippines. Informal workers generally have low
and intermittent incomes and therefore face severe constraints in setting aside savings or social security
contributions. They also often have needs (e.g., education of children, investment in self-employment
or building a house), as well as face risks that may have greater relative importance for savings than
smoothing income in retirement. In addition, the delivery system and collections channels may be
inaccessible or inefficient, posing important transactions costs.

64.      Given the high degree of informality in the Philippines, aligning social insurance design and
delivery system with the needs of informal workers will be critical to expanding coverage. The
schematic diagram in Figure 20 below illustrates how generic elements of social insurance design and
implementation can be aligned with the needs of informal workers. The diagram shows how savings and
social insurance policies and programs can build upon common foundations of identification and
delivery systems. Moreover, it points out how micro-savings, social insurance, and health insurance
programs can have important synergies in providing risk protection for informal sector workers.

65.      This analysis has identified several interventions that could help improve workers coverage in
the Philippines. These interventions, which are discussed in greater detail below, include:

   Strengthening the unique identification system across institutions;
   Improving the platform for delivery (including collections, data management, and payments);
   Making it easier and more efficient to save by strengthening the efficiency and coverage of savings
    instruments; and
   Establishing an SSS instrument to better suit the needs of informal sector workers.

build upon the de-duplication capabilitya of the SSS unified multi-purpose identification card (UMID). The

workers with contracts. One exception is that members of the AlkanSSSya scheme can make
contributions according to their own schedule, and the minimum monthly covered salary of PHP 1,000 is
waived. Members are also entitled to personal and housing loans the same way other workers are. Yet
the 10 year vesting requirement effectively excludes some workers with short work histories from
participating. Finally, although workers under the AlkanSSSya scheme are not subject to minimum
contributions, they still benefit from minimum pensions. Although this technical issue has yet to
become a big concern, it does suggest a need to consider an instrument more focused on informal
worker characteristics.

69.     The SSS might want to consider introducing a special instrument for informal workers which is
designed to align with their needs and preferences. Such an instrument could be structured as a
defined-contribution savings vehicle that also offers annuitized benefits at retirement. Such benefits
could be additive to benefits received from the defined-benefit SSS pensions. Pension calculators could
communicate projected benefit levels at different retirement ages, including benefits for workers with
contributions in both the defined-contribution and defined-benefit SSS schemes. Moreover, partial
withdrawals could be permitted in the case of defined events such as extended unemployment,
catastrophic health events or disability and natural disasters. Finally contributions should be voluntary
and at the level and timing appropriate to each worker (such as the approach with the AlkanSSSya
program. Together, these features could make such an SSS instrument more attractive than the current
defined-benefit SSS instrument for informal workers.

70.      One reason for considering making a new SSS instrument voluntary is that enforcement of
mandatory contributions from informal sector workers has proven to be costly and largely ineffective
in the Philippines and in many countries worldwide. The manpower required to scrutinize the financial
reporting of small firms and the self-employed effectively is substantial so many countries have sought
other means of improving collections such as merging income tax and social security payroll tax
collections and using the different incentives of each to assist in identifying evasion. Many countries link
business licensing to tax and social security and some have established mechanisms for linking social
security payroll taxes to sub-contracting services to firms or individuals.

71.     Although several countries have considered matching contribution subsidies to expand
coverage, our analysis suggests that this would not be the most effective instrument for coverage
expansion in the Philippines as follows: (i) those poor and vulnerable workers who could access the
subsidy are unlikely to be able to afford the contribution; and (ii) the fiscal costs could be substantial
depending on the benefit level, match and targeting. A more effective alternative would be to use fiscal
resources to broaden the scope of beneficiaries who are eligible for social pensions as discussed in the
section below. Over the long-term, with income growth, it may be constructive to revisit the cost-
effectiveness of such matching contributions (Additional international experience with matching
contribution subsidies is provided in Box 2 below).

                 Box 2: Matching Contribution Programs to Extend Social Security Coverage

Korea. Korea gradually extended mandatory contributions to its National Pension Scheme (NPS) to all rural residents in 1995
and to the entire working population in 1999 (See Figure *). Although contributions are required, more than a third of workers
have not been contributing. A majority of these have been poor or low-income workers with insecure employment, such as
temporary workers, the self-employed, and small business owners. In 2005 contribution subsidies were offered by the
government to farmers and fishers for 50% of the total contribution amount up to a cap, and a fixed amount over that. An
evaluation found that the probability of contributing to the national pension system was more than 10 percentage points
higher among (subsidized) farmers and fishers than among nonsubsidized self-employed workers. A reform program in 2007
included measures aimed to extend coverage with the introduction of a non-contributory Basic Old-Age Pension which
provides a benefit equivalent to 5 percent of the average monthly income of NPS participants paid to those aged 65 or over
whose income level is lower than a specified threshold. Although coverage has increased substantially during the NPS history,
the matching contribution scheme has been one of many factors contributing to the increase.

Mexico. The Social Contribution scheme is one of Mexico’s matching-type schemes that targets low-wage workers as part of
the defined contribution scheme administered by the Mexican Social Security Institute. The value of the matching contribution
is progressive, decreasing by steps with multiples of the minimum wage. The Social Contribution significantly increases the
retirement savings of lower-income workers. In 2009, the federal government limited payment of the Social Contribution to
workers who earned less than 15 times the minimum wage. One finding of an assessment of schemes in Colombia, Peru and
Mexico was that the matching schemes do not seem attractive enough to people who are not contributing to existing pension
schemes or who are not even affiliated.

Chile. Chile in 2008 introduced at matching contribution of 15% of voluntary pension savings up to $470 per year for those
workers who do not take advantage of tax benefits. Two subsidies for pension contributions were also introduced for young
workers in 2008 and 2011, respectively, targeting the bottom 40% of the population. These contributions aimed to encourage
formal employment while also improving low pension balances. Matching contribution subsidies were available for 24 months.
All of these were in addition to the establishment of an ex post solidarity pension pillar targeted at the retirees in the bottom
60% of welfare distribution. An evaluation of the matching subsidies suggest that they may be positive for employment and
labor force participation in the short term but are unlikely to provide a meaningful alternative to the solidarity pillar in
addressing low pensions.

India. In 2010, the government of India established a matching contribution of Rs. 1,000 a year to be deposited into New
Pension Scheme accounts for individuals making contributions between Rs. 1,000 and 12,000 per year (NPS-lite). The fees for
basic retirement savings accounts were low. In addition, “aggregators? were provided incentives to motivate informal sector
enrollment. Although an evaluation was undertaken very soon after the program’s introduction, some of the initial findings
were that the experience with the scheme have been mixed. Participation has been limited. The so-called unorganized sector
was found to be very heterogeneous with a broad income distribution and individuals of all ages and education levels. The
limited analysis of a sample suggest that women are more likely to participate than men, higher income and more education
are positively associated with take-up, and having other potential sources of income for old age reduces take-up.

72.      Preliminary calculations suggest that worker contributions would be unaffordable for those in
the bottom 4 deciles even when the target benefit is only a poverty line income. We calculated
possible level of a matching grant by evaluating the cost and matching subsidy necessary to achieve an
individual income at retirement equal to the current individual poverty line. The calculations suggest
that a 1:1 matching contribution of about PHP 2,900 per year per individual could achieve a target of a
poverty line income at age 65.40 We also examined which individuals across the income spectrum would
likely be able to afford such a contribution. As Figure 21 illustrates, all of those in the bottom 4 deciles
are highly unlikely to be able to afford such a contribution. Even those in the 5th decile would have to
dedicate more than one-fifth of their savings (net income after expenditures) to contributions to such a
social security scheme, and those in the 4th decile would have to dedicate about one-third.

73.      Matching contribution subsidies are quite costly from a fiscal perspective, raising questions as
to their affordability and sustainability. An initial assessment suggests that the annual cost of achieving
a benefit that aims to achieve a pension benefit at the current individual poverty threshold and targeted
at the bottom 40% of the labor force could cost as much as 0.6 percent of GDP. Such a cost would need
to be sustained for an entire generation to build up the balances to achieve the desired benefits. When

40
  Key determinants of the cost are: (a) those eligible to receive the matching subsidy; (b) the amount of the
contribution; (c) the ratio between the individual contribution and the matching subsidy; and (d) the expected rate
of take-up. The following assumptions were used in this calculation: (i) the target benefit level was PHP 21,072 per
                                                                    st
year, which is the national annual poverty threshold per capita (1 semester, 2014); (ii) the matching grant was
assumed to be 100 percent of the worker contribution; (iii) the funds were assumed to yield a 3-percent real rate
of return; (iv) the annual contributions and matching grants were assumed to grow at a rate of 3 percent per year;
(v) the real discount rate was 3 percent; (vi) workers were assumed to contribute for 25 years, immediately prior
to retirement at age 65; and (vii) the future unisex life expectancy was assumed to be 14.5 years at age 65, the
same as in 2015 for the entire population.

                                                                                            - 38 -
measured against the total level of Government revenues, this represents an important expenditure
that would need to be assessed in terms of its cost effectiveness and weighed against the potential
outcomes from other public expenditures.

C. Beyond SSS – Inter-Institutional Delivery System, Savings Options, and Broadening
   Eligibility for Social Pensions

74.      Many of the processes outlined in the building blocks in Figure 20 above are common across
institutions. In this way, a de-duplicated foundational identification has applications that extend well
beyond Social Security and can be equally effective in strengthening Government transfer programs,
PhilHealth and can assist in broadening public access to financial intermediation such as through bank or
mobile-money accounts. Similarly, an efficient and effective payment system can reduce the cost of the
extensive money transfers in the Philippines as well as facilitate contributions from and payments to the
vast majority of Filipino population including those living in remote locations. A platform that can easily
and cheaply ensure secure contributions and disbursements can materially reduce the time and cost
necessary for routine transactions. Mobile-based communications can contribute towards achieve such
efficiency though needs to be effectively regulated to ensure secure transactions. Together these
processes can be referred to as a delivery system platform.

75.     SSS operations could build upon such an inter-institutional platform to provide efficient and
secure coverage for its members, including those in the informal sector. For example, if the current
deposits by AlkanSSSya members could be deposited by phone instead of through the savings boxes, it
may be possible to substantially scale-up the AlkanSSSya membership.

76.      Further work is also needed to establish mobile money platforms that can support (i) mobile-
phone-based remittances from different sources including bank accounts, ATMs, or shops offering
money transfer services; (ii) mobile-phone-based account payments or withdrawals; and (iii) phone- or
internet-based information inquiries on account balances and entitlements. Mobile money platforms
could reduce transaction costs for informal worker participation in social security schemes, improve
efficiency for payments and money transfers, and generally remove barriers to savings opportunities for
heretofore unbanked individuals and businesses. However, only about 4 percent had mobile money
accounts in 201441 and anecdotal information suggests that the use of mobile money platforms for
collections, funds transfers, and payments is very limited.

77.     Expanding access to savings can reinforce the agenda of increasing coverage. Savings
accounts can play an important role in helping workers save for multiple social risks such as loss of
employment, health risks, disability, and old age. Moreover, informal workers can be assured of
withdrawing their funds when needed. The Philippines has relatively low levels of financial inclusion and
very low levels of mobile-money access all of which can be useful for informal workers. About one-third
of the population over age 15 had bank accounts in 2014 (versus 69 percent for the EAP region), while
only about 15 percent had formal savings (versus 36 percent for the EAP region), and only about 4

percent had mobile money accounts.42 The authorities are aware of this and are taking steps aimed at
improving financial inclusion.

78.     Voluntary pension arrangements can play a role in the Philippines in supplementing SSS
benefits as well as in improving coverage. Supplementary contractual savings arrangements are a
means by which employers can create incentives for staff retention. A regulated program such as the
Private Employee Retirement Accounts (PERA) can provide a vehicle for retirement savings by self-
employed professionals if SSS contributions are insufficient.


79.       The DSWD Social Pension plays an important role in ensuring the basic livelihoods of the
poorest elderly and broadening its target population (if fiscally manageable) would prove more
effective in increasing coverage of the elderly when compared with matching grants. The Listahanan
national household targeting system could be used as a basis for broadening the eligibility for the Social
Pension from the current poor in the bottom two deciles to possibly the poor and near-poor by raising
the household eligibility threshold possibly to the bottom four deciles. This would mean that those
eligible households in the bottom 40 percent with elderly members over age 65 could qualify for a Social
Pension benefit, much in the same way that the same households can qualify for PhilHealth benefits.
This would have an immediate impact while the matching grant would take many years to mature.

80.        Although the design, benefit level, qualifying criteria, and targeting method appear to be
strong, measures which could be considered to further strengthen the Social Pension include: (i)
providing automatic annual increases in the benefit linked to the growth in consumer prices to ensure
that the benefit maintains its purchasing power; (ii) conducting periodic program assessments to review
targeting outcomes and identify any inclusion and exclusion errors (and devise a strategy to address
such errors as needed),43 as well as to measure the impact on elderly poverty; and (iii) conducting
periodic reviews of the benefit amount against the individual income gap and poverty threshold, as well
as relation to other social protection programs, to evaluate the design and adequacy of benefits.

81.      The Philippine proposal suggested in 2015 to reduce the eligibility age to 60 would have the
advantage of aligning the eligibility age with that of the eligibility age for the SSS and GSIS, but the
tradeoffs and impacts need to be considered carefully. The same fiscal resources needed in reducing
the eligibility age could instead be used to increase the scope of old age beneficiaries proposed or,
alternatively, could be earmarked to increase public transfers to other programs such as the Conditional
Cash Transfer program targeted at poor children. It should also be noted that those elderly ages 60-64
have substantially higher wage incomes and higher labor force participation rates than those age 65 and
above. As a result, reducing the eligibility age to 60 years may somewhat deter the incentives to work
for some beneficiaries, although it is important to note that eligible beneficiaries would be from poor
households.

VI.     Conclusion

82.     Going forward, additional diagnostic work will be needed to inform the design of specific
strategies for improving the coverage and sustainability of social security in the Philippines. For
example, a diagnostic evaluation is needed to identify weaknesses in the identification and SSS
operations and delivery system, particularly with regard to low-income, informal workers. Contributory
pension design options and parameters need to be considered which better align the incentives toward
coverage expansion. Beyond the SSS, barriers to savings need to be studied and addressed. Finally,
PROST simulations could be supplemented by simulations using additional parameters which may have
not yet been considered.

83.     This report has looked at some reform options to help the SSS improve sustainability, provide
greater incentives to participate, and improve inflation risk coverage. A gradual process of parametric
reforms is proposed which does not abruptly or adversely affect existing retirees or workers
approaching retirement age. Moreover, it is suggested to weigh the tradeoffs between the objectives of
coverage expansion and the potential adverse effect of increases in the contribution rate. Fortunately,
the analysis suggests that the SSS scheme can achieve long-term sustainability on a gradual basis with
modest changes in the qualifying conditions, benefits, and, possibly the contribution rate.

84.      This report has also suggested options to strengthen social security coverage, particularly of
informal workers. Several measures were proposed including further strengthening the mechanisms for
contributions, account access and payments, and introducing a new SSS savings instrument aligned to
the needs of informal sector workers. An assessment of matching contribution subsidies to expand
coverage suggested that a more effective alternative would be to broaden the scope of beneficiaries
eligible for social pensions.

85.      Beyond the scope of the SSS, additional measures were looked at to strengthen the coverage
of social protection for informal workers. Measures were suggested to improve the access and
efficiency of contributions and payments systems, including measures mobile-money platforms; further
measures to improve access to savings instruments, particularly for small savers; and some further
improvements to the strong Social Pension, including broadening eligibility and automatic price
indexation of benefits.

86.        Improvements in SSS sustainability and the instruments and delivery systems for social
security coverage comprise only one part of a broader strategy needed to better protect the vast
majority of workers in the Philippines with low, intermittent and variable sources of income. A more
systemic view of job creation, labor market and social insurance reforms can help to better protect
these workers. Ultimately, the only sustainable approach to combating low-skill, low-wage, and low-
security informal jobs is to strengthen the quality of growth and job creation. Measures are needed on
numerous fronts to combat the causes of informality, such as removing barriers to competition and
growth in real sectors and addressing barriers to formality including taxes and labor market provisions.

             Annex 1: Main Assumptions used in PROST Projections
Financial projections for the SSS of the Philippines were conducted with the World Bank’s Pension
Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) model. The simulation period runs from 2013 to 2080. The
main assumptions used in the projections are described below.

Demographic assumptions

UN population data and demographic projections for the Philippines were used as the basis for
assumptions about future changes in fertility and mortality rates as follows:

   Mortality at all ages was expected to decline over the projection period consistent with expectations
    in countries of similar levels of development, resulting in projected life expectancies as shown in
    Table 11;
   Life expectancy of the covered population mirrored the life expectancy of the general population;
    and
   Fertility was assumed to decline gradually from the current level of 2.94 births per adult female to
    the replacement level of 1.85 births by 2080.

                                Table 11:   Life Expectancy at Various Ages by Gender

Macroeconomic assumptions

The following macroeconomic assumptions, summarized in Table 12 below, were used:

   The assumptions for GDP growth and inflation rates for the period of 2015-2019 were based on the
    IMF macroeconomic projections for the Philippines (Article IV, August 2014);
   In the long run, GDP growth rates were calibrated to maintain a fairly constant ratio of labor income
    to GDP;
   The long run inflation rate was assumed to stabilize at 3.5 percent; and
   Real wages/earnings were assumed to grow at about 2 percent.

    Pension policy and member behaviour

   A conservative assumption was used with respect to contributor coverage rate: age-specific coverage
    rates (number of contributors as percentage of population in respective age and gender groups) were
    assumed to remain constant throughout the projection period;
   Contribution density was assumed to remain constant over the whole projection period;
   The ratio of the contribution ceiling to average earnings of contributors was assumed to remain
    constant over the projection period;
   Pattern of retirement by age was assumed to remain consistent with the current experience;
   The ratio of short-term benefits to total benefit payments was assumed to remain at current levels of
    about 10 percent;
   The ratio of administrative expenses to total contributions was assumed to continue to decrease in line
    with the current trend over the next five years (from 7.5 percent in 2013 to 5 percent by 2018) then
    stabilize and remain at 5 percent over the rest of the projection period;
   Indexation policy for post-retirement pensions in the base case (no-reform) scenario assumed 60
    percent of inflation starting from 2016 (in line with the average annual growth rate over the last 15
    years);
   The nominal value of the minimum pension was assumed to remain constant at PHP 1,200 and PHP
    2,400 (for less than 20 years of contributions and for 20 and more years of contributions, respectively);
    and
   The nominal values of the supplemental allowance of PHP 500 for disability pensioners and the flat
    amount of PHP 300 in the formula for calculating retirement benefits were assumed to remain the
    same, in line with the current policy to phase them out gradually.

                Annex 2: General Description of PROST Methodology
PROST is a computer-based pension model designed to simulate the behavior of pension systems and
assess their financial sustainability under different economic and demographic assumptions over a long
timeframe. The model can be adapted to a wide range of country circumstances and allows modelling of
various types of pension reform options.

The model consists of an input workbook and five output modules. On the input side, the user provides
country-specific data on demographic, economic, and pension-system-related parameters and
assumptions about their behavior in the future. This information is entered in the input file with six
embedded worksheets:

        General         Economic variables (GDP and wage growth, inflation, interest rate), non-age-
                        specific pension system parameters (pension fund balance and benefit
                        expenditure in the base year, retirement age, contribution rate, pension
                        indexation rules, etc.), and some demographic variables

        Population      Base-year population by age and gender along with age-specific fertility and
                        mortality rates and immigration information

        Labor           Age- and gender-specific labor force participation and unemployment rates as
                        well as distribution of wages and old age pensions across age and gender
                        cohorts

        Pension         Age- and gender-specific information about pension system contributors,
                        beneficiaries, coverage and retirement rates, average years of service at
                        retirement, and replacement rates for new beneficiaries

        Profiles        Information on representative individuals, such as gender, career path,
                        individual wage, life expectancy, etc.

        Reform          Parameters relevant to systemic reforms to be simulated (any combination of
                        conventional PAYG, fully funded DC, and NDC pillars), including switching
                        pattern, how the acquired rights will be paid, contribution rates, rules for
                        annuitization and pension pay-out under DC schemes, replacement
                        rates/benefit formula in a PAYG pillar, indexation, etc.

PROST follows single age/gender cohorts over time and generates population projections which,
combined with labor market assumptions, are used to forecast future numbers of contributors and
beneficiaries. These in turn generate flows of revenues and expenditure. The model then projects fiscal
balances and calculates the implicit pension debt. The required contribution rates and affordable
replacement rates for zero pension fund balance in each year of the simulation period are also
calculated. Finally, PROST produces outputs related to individuals—what an individual would contribute
to the system and what he/she would obtain under PAYG DB and multi-pillar schemes. This allows both
intra- and intergenerational analysis.

Depending on the characteristics of the pension system and data availability, the user can choose the
method for calculating some of the variables. In particular, the number of contributors and beneficiaries
can be computed in either “Stock? or “Flow? method. With the “Stock? method, the stocks of

                                                  - 46 -
contributors/beneficiaries for each year are calculated first, then inflows (new
contributors/beneficiaries) are derived as the changes of the stocks:

                        Inflow(a,t,g) = stock(a,t,g) – stock(a-1,t-1,g) + outflow(a,t,g),
With the “Flow? method, inflows are calculated first, then stocks are derived as previous year’s stocks in
each age/gender cohort adjusted for the net inflow (inflow-outflow):
                        Stock(a,t,g) = stock(a-1,t-1,g) - outflow(a,t,g) + inflow(a,t,g),
                                     Where a = age, t = year, g = gender.

As PROST keeps track of contribution years of service accrued by each cohort, the calculated number of
new retirees—whatever method is used—is then adjusted so that the total length of service accrued by
the cohort is equal to the total length of service claimed by the cohort at the time of retirement. After
the number of new retirees is adjusted, the stock is recalculated using the “Flow? method.

The user can also choose how the benefit of new beneficiaries is specified—via benefit formula or via
age- and gender-specific replacement rates.

In the most simplified way, the general calculation scheme is summarized in the figure below.

                      Annex 3: SSS PROST Analysis – Sensitivity Tests
Sensitivity analysis tests were undertaken to understand the impact of changes in demographic,
coverage, and return assumptions on the financing gap projected by the SSS PROST projections. In
addition, sensitivity tests were undertaken for the policy variable of the assumption of the cap on wages
used to determine contributions and benefits. A summary of the results is provided in Table 13.

Sensitivity Test 1: life expectancy at age 60 for covered assumed to be 2 years higher than for the general population

Sensitivity Test 1: This test assumed that life expectancy for the covered population at age 60 was 2
years higher than for the general population (19.5 years versus 17.5 years) in the base year and all
subsequent years. The following results were observed:

    Impact via pension system demographics: number of old age pensioners receiving pension in each
     year increases (shown on the dependency rate graph), the effect kicks in gradually.
    Average new (flow) pensions are not affected (hence there is no graph for flow replacement rates).
    Due to indexation, average stock pensions slightly decrease as people live longer.
    Increase in the number of pensioners outweighs the effect of slightly lower average pensions, so
     overall expenditures increase, and (with the same contributions) the annual current balance
     decreases.
    Overall, effect of 2-year difference is not substantial—break-even and depletion points move
     forward by one year, financing gap increases from 34 percent to 36 percent.

Sensitivity Test 2: Coverage was assumed to roughly double by 2080 due to economic growth and
changes in wage composition of the labor force. The following was observed:

   Both the number of contributors and the number of pensioners increases, but the former starts
    growing immediately whereas the latter follows that increase with a lag. As a result, the system
    dependency rate decreases compared with the baseline.
   Average pensions—both flow and stock—practically remain the same (only some minor fluctuations
    of flow pensions due to age/gender/sector composition changes as well as some increases of the
    average full wage of the employed due to changes in their age composition).
   The impact on finances is positive in the short term (while the number of contributors starts to
    grow, and the number of pensioners remains about the same). In the longer run, despite a lower

                                                                                  - 50 -
    system dependency rate, deficits become higher than in the base case: although revenues roughly
    double by 2080 whereas expenditures increase by only about 70 percent, in absolute (money)
    terms, the increase in spending is significantly higher than the increase in revenues.
   Accordingly, due to the short-term positive effect on finances, both break-even and depletion points
    move back by three years, but the financing gap substantially increases from 34 percent to 43
    percent because the long-term negative effect outweighs the short-term positive effect.

Sensitivity Test 3: This scenario illustrates the impact of not periodically raising the covered wage ceiling.
The contribution ceiling remains at the same level and is not indexed. The following are the results
observed:

   System demographics are not affected.

                                                                               - 51 -
   Pensions go down relative to average full wage as the level of the ceiling relative to full wages
    decreases. New (flow) pensions start decreasing immediately, whereas it takes more time for stock
    pensions. Stock pensions remain higher than flow pensions since most of the stock pensioners
    receive pensions calculated in the times of higher ceiling levels. Eventually, pension levels decrease
    to almost “nothing.?
   In the short run, finances deteriorate because contributions decrease faster than average stock
    pensions. In the long run, deficits shrink because the size of the pension system (both revenues and
    expenditures) shrinks relative to GDP.
   Both the break-even and depletion points move forward substantially (by 9 and 8 years,
    respectively) due to the above short-term negative effect on finances. However, the financing gap
    decreases from 34 percent to 15 percent because of the shrinking of the pension system relative to
    GDP in the long run.

Sensitivity Test 4: The contribution ceiling increases by PHP 200 per year (“smoothing? of PHP 1,000
every five years), with the following results:

   Initially, PHP 200 per year means growth at a rate well below wage growth and even inflation, at
    about one-third of the inflation rate. In the longer run, the growth rate eventually slows down to 20
    percent of the inflation rate.
   As a result, the relative level of the ceiling decreases, although more slowly than in Test 3.
   Therefore, the nature of the impact is similar to Test 3, but all effects kick in more slowly.
   The break-even and depletion points shift forward by 7 and 6 years, respectively, and the financing
    gap decreases from 34 percent to 17 percent.

Sensitivity Tests 5 (a & b): For Test 5a, the real interest rate on pension fund investments is 3% (lower by
1 p.p.). For Test 5b, the real interest rate on pension fund investments is 5 percent (higher by 1 p.p.).
The following effects were observed:

    Only revenues (via investment returns) are affected.
    The impact on cash flows is not dramatic: plus/minus 2 years for the break-even and depletion
     points.
    The discount rate used in the financing gap calculations changes the same way as the interest rate.
    The effect on the financing gap is therefore much more substantial than the effect on cash flows,
     with an increase from 34 percent to 57 percent in Test 5a and a decrease to 20 percent in Test 5b.

1. Introduction

Panel datasets that follow individuals and households over time are considered to be an excellent
source of information for measuring intra-generational economic mobility. However, panels are
often difficult to administer, costly, and not representative of the entire population of a country;
they usually cover short periods of time; and suffer from non-random attrition that may bias
mobility estimates. In addition, panels are only available in few countries, which restricts their use
in regional analysis. Given all these limitations, panel datasets can impose serious constraints to
the empirical analysis of the dynamics of poverty.
           There are many alternatives to overcome the main limitations of panel datasets. ‚ÄúSynthetic
Panels‚Äù, developed by Dang et al. (2014) and improved by Dang and Lanjouw (2013), is the most
recent. Dang et al. (2014) implement a non-parametric approach to estimate an upper and a lower
bound for mobility in and out of poverty at the household level as if we had actual panel datasets.
The method estimates an income1 model in the second round of cross-section data using a
specification that includes only time-invariant covariates and retrospective regressors when
available. Parameter estimates from this income model are also obtained in the first round of cross-
sectional data and then applied to the same covariates in the second round. By doing this, we can
predict the unobserved income in the first round of data for all households surveyed in the second
round. Depending on how error terms are treated, the method generates an upper and a lower bound
estimate of economic mobility. Cruces et al. (2015) perform a validation in three countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC) where actual panel data are available: Chile, Nicaragua, and
Peru. The authors show that the approach performs well in all three settings. Ferreira et al. (2012)
apply the lower bound technique to predict upward economic mobility out of poverty in 18
countries in LAC between circa 1990 and 2010.
           Dang and Lanjouw (2013) improve the methodology to obtain a point estimate‚Äîas
opposed to lower and upper bounds‚Äîof poverty dynamics. The authors assume normality of the
error terms and use the age-cohort correlation of residuals obtained from cross-sectional data in
the first and second rounds to produce a point estimate of inter-generational poverty mobility. The
authors validate the methodology using actual panel data from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lao People‚Äôs

Democratic Republic, Peru, United States, and Vietnam. Vakis, Rigolini, and Lucchetti (2016)
apply this method to measure chronic poverty in 17 countries in LAC between circa 2004-2012.
           The purpose of this paper is to introduce a non-parametric adaptation of the parametric
point estimate developed by Dang and Lanjouw (2013). The method builds on the upper and lower
bound mobility estimates developed by Dang et al. (2014). By taking a weighted average of the
residuals obtained from estimations of the income models in the first and second rounds of data,
we can predict a point estimate‚Äîas opposed to two bounds‚Äîof the unobserved income in the first
round of data for all households surveyed in the second round. The paper validates this method by
estimating intra-generational income mobility using cross-sectional data and by comparing it with
true mobility estimates using actual panels in Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru.2
           The proposal in this paper presents some strengths compared to mobility estimates
computed by other studies in the literature. First, the key assumption required for the parametric
approach developed by Dang et al. (2013, 2014) is the normality of the error terms in the
underlying regressions. However, normality tests reject this assumption in Vietnam and Indonesia
(Dang et al. 2014). By introducing a non-parametric approach, the method proposed in this paper
does not assume any distribution of the error terms in the underlying income regressions.
           Second, this non-parametric adaptation of the method predicts a point estimate of the
unobserved income in the first round of data for all households surveyed in the second round,
instead of just providing joint probabilities of mobility in and out of poverty as in the parametric
approach. In doing so, the method allows estimating the income growth of every household
between two rounds of surveys as if we had an actual household-level panel dataset.
           Third, the paper performs a sensitivity test to study the robustness of results to changes in
two underlying parameters‚Äîi.e., the number of repetitions that need to be run to obtain mobility
estimates and the weights used for averaging residuals.
           Fourth, validations in this paper are based on a panel that follows the same households for
a period of five years. This allows us to validate the mobility estimates for periods of different
lengths of time that include the same households. Validations are done for two periods; one that
covers one year and another one that covers five years.
           Finally, unlike previous studies, we use harmonized micro data that allow us to validate
poverty dynamics using the same underlying income models and variables as the ones frequently

2
    Like in Cruces et al. (2015), the term ‚Äútrue‚Äù mobility refers to mobility estimates using actual panel data.


                                                              3
used in regional studies in LAC (such as Cord et al. 2017; Ferrerira et al. 2012; Gasparini,
Cicowiez, and Escudero 2013; and Vakis et al. 2016). This allow us to estimate income mobility
for all LAC countries for which data are available using the exact same approach as the one
proposed in this paper.
        Results indicate that the methodology performs well in all the settings. In general, mobility
estimates fall within the 95 percent confidence intervals of the true panel mobility. More
importantly, the paper finds that a simple specification for the underlying income models that
includes few time-invariant regressors is sufficient to obtain accurate estimates of mobility.
Finally, the validation confirms that the method performs well at estimating household-level
income growth (and not just join probabilities) between two rounds of surveys.
        The next section summarizes the technique. Section 3 discusses the data and the empirical
approach. Section 4 introduces the main validation results. Section 5 presents mobility results for
17 Latin American countries. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. Methodology3

Let Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° be round t household log per capita income (where t =1, 2) of household i and z the poverty
line. The goal is to estimate the change in incomes between both periods (‚àÜÌ†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ1 ) as well
as all possible poverty dynamics: the proportion of poor households who escaped poverty
(Pr(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ1 < Ì†µÌ±ß Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2 > Ì†µÌ±ß)), who remained poor (Pr(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ1 < Ì†µÌ±ß Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2 < Ì†µÌ±ß)), who became poor
(Pr(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ1 > Ì†µÌ±ß Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2 < Ì†µÌ±ß)), and who remained non-poor (Pr(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ1 > Ì†µÌ±ß Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñ2 > Ì†µÌ±ß)).
        The linear projection of income on a vector xit of time-invariant characteristics (e.g.,
education of the household head under the assumption that the identity of the household head
remains constant between rounds of data) of household i in round t is determined by
                            Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ±° ‚Ä≤Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°   t = 1, 2                                  (1)

where ÔÅ•it is an error term. We can introduce superscripts to denote household observations
surveyed in a given moment in time. Then, we can predict first round ‚Äúunobserved‚Äù incomes of

method randomly draws from the empirical distribution of residuals, this procedure needs to be
repeated R times and take an average of mobility estimates over the R replications.
        Similarly, the lower bound estimate emerges from assuming perfect positive correlation
between error terms. Dang et al. (2014) suggest using the estimates of the scaled residuals from

procedure.
        The technique was improved by Dang and Lanjouw (2013). The authors assume that the
two error terms Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñ1 and Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñ2 have a bivariate normal distribution with a non-negative correlation
coefficient œÅ and standard deviations Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºÄ1 and Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºÄ2 , respectively. A point estimate of the probability

         The correlation œÅ is unknown. Therefore, the authors use the age-cohort correlation of
residuals obtained from cross-sectional data to produce an estimate of œÅ.
         In this paper, I propose an adaptation using the lower and upper bound estimates. Since the
correlation term is likely to be non-negative, residuals in equations 2 and 3 are likely to ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù
the actual error term. Therefore, this paper suggests taking a weighted average of residuals to get
point estimates of income mobility. First round predicted incomes under this method are

the empirical distribution of residuals from the first round, the procedure needs to be repeated R
times.
         This method requires an estimate of the unknown underlying weight Ì†µÌªæ. As noted, Œ≥ = 0 and
Œ≥ = 1 correspond to the upper and lower bound mobility estimates, respectively. Dang et al. (2014)
argue that the estimates would fall between these two extreme values. I can narrow down the gap
between the lower and upper bound estimates by selecting 0 < Ì†µÌªæ < 1. Therefore, I take
‚Äúunweighted‚Äù averages of residuals (i.e., Œ≥ = 0.5) to validate estimates. By doing so, the paper is
replacing the arbitrary assumption of normality and the need to estimate an unknown correlation
term œÅ by another arbitrary assumption of weighting lower and upper bound estimates equally
(instead of, for example, setting Ì†µÌªæ equal to 0.4 or to 0.6). We could further refine this method by
‚Äúweighting‚Äù residuals in equations 2 and 3 differently (i.e., Œ≥ ‚â† 0.5). As such, I also perform a
sensitivity test in Section 4 to analyze the robustness of results to changes in Ì†µÌªæ.
         It is important to note that, by introducing an arbitrary assumption of balanced weights, the
method also presents at least two advantages when compared to existing approaches. First, the
adaptation introduced in this paper does not assume any given distribution for the disturbances.
Second, unlike the parametric approach, this adaptation predicts the unobserved income in the first
round of data rather than estimating probabilities of mobility in and out of poverty. This is also

the aggregated poverty dynamics obtained by the parametric approach.

3. Data and empirical approach for validation

I use the SEDLAC database for Peru as the primarily source information to validate income
poverty dynamics. SEDLAC is a harmonized dataset of LAC‚Äôs household surveys compiled by
the World Bank and the Center for Distributive, Labor, and Social Studies (CEDLAS, for its
acronym in Spanish) at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina.4 The main objective
of the SEDLAC dataset is to allow for cross-country comparisons of household incomes and a
wide range of socioeconomic measures in LAC. The data cover more than 300 surveys in 18
countries in the region and represent more than 90 percent of the population in LAC.
        To validate the non-parametric approach, I select a panel subsample of the SEDLAC data
in Peru. This panel follows the same 1,075 households in a five-year period from 2007 to 2011,
which allows us to validate the technique in periods of different lengths of time that include the
same households. Validations are done for two periods. The first period covers one year from 2010
to 2011, while the second is a five-year period between 2007 and 2011. In this validation, the poor
are defined as individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than $4 per person per day
poverty line in 2005 $PPP/day.
        In all cases, mobility estimates are done by comparing the actual income in the second
round and the predicted one‚Äîthat arises from applying the method proposed in this paper using
time invariant characteristics‚Äîin the first round. To avoid life cycle events that may invalidate the
main time invariance assumption of the method, all estimates are based on data from households‚Äî
as opposed to individuals‚Äîwhose head is between 25 and 65 years of age (805 households). I
apply 50 repetitions to the procedure and test how sensitive these results are to changes in the
number of repetitions. I also choose Œ≥ = 0.5 and test the sensitivity of results to other values of Œ≥.
Following Cruces et al. (2015), I randomly divide all panel datasets into two subsamples and treat
each subsample as a cross-section. Therefore, I estimate the coefficients in one of these subsamples
in the first round (403 households) and apply those coefficients to the second subsample in the

  Bourguignon (2015) and Gasparini, Cicowiez, and Escudero (2013) present a detailed description of the SEDLAC
data.

second round (402 households). By treating each subsample as a cross-section, I avoid any bias
that might arise from the use of panel datasets to validate the methodology.
        I apply the following three specifications:
          ‚Ä¢   Specification 1: includes household head age, age squared, gender, and years of
              education.
          ‚Ä¢   Specification 2: adds regional fixed effects to the first specification.
          ‚Ä¢   Specification 3: adds the interaction between variables in specification 1 and 2.
        The paper also validates the methodology in other contexts by using the same panel
datasets as the one presented by Cruces et al. (2015). These are three panel datasets for Chile,
Nicaragua, and Peru: (i) the 1996 and 2006 National Socio-Economic Characterization Survey
(CASEN in Spanish) panel survey from Chile; (ii) the 1998 and 2005 National Household Survey
on Living Standards Measurement (EMNV in Spanish) panel survey from Nicaragua; and (iii) the
2008-2009 Peruvian National Household (ENAHO in Spanish) panel survey in Peru. These are
nationally representative surveys that have information on education; employment; income in
Chile and expenditure in Nicaragua and Peru; and housing, among others. The main objective of
these surveys is to measure poverty and living conditions. For a detailed description of these
datasets see Cruces et al. (2015). In these validations, the poor are defined as individuals with an
official per capita expenditure (in Nicaragua and Peru) and income (in Chile) lower than the
official poverty lines.
        Unlike Cruces et al. (2015); Dang et al. (2014); and Dang and Lanjouw (2013), the
harmonized SEDLAC data in Peru allow us to validate poverty dynamics using the same
underlying income models and variables as the one frequently used in regional studies in LAC (for
instance, Ferreira et al. 2012 and Vakis et al. 2016). As such, I end the paper by presenting mobility
results for LAC using the approach described above and the same underlying income models and
variables as in the validation analysis. This allows us to implement the approach in most LAC
countries for which data are available using the same underlying period and consistent concepts of
income measures, datasets, and mobility measures across countries, thus considerably enlarging
the universe of estimates and understanding of mobility trends in the region. I focus on intra-
generational mobility in 17 LAC countries for which data are available between 2004 and 2015.
In this analysis, the poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than $4 per
person and per day poverty line in 2005 $PPP/day.

4. Validation results

4.1. Directional income mobility estimates

I start by comparing point estimates for the actual and simulated poverty headcount in round 1.5
Results are shown in Table 1. Actual poverty estimates (and 95 percent confidence interval) in
column 1 arise from using the panel dataset, while the predicted ones in columns 2, 3, and 4 result
from applying the synthetic panel method. In general, the method performs well and actual point
estimates are close to synthetic panel results.6
         Models‚Äô predictive power increases substantially when moving from the first to the third
specification (the R2 doubles). However, unlike Cruces et al. (2015), point estimates are stable and
they do not change drastically when increasing the sophistication level of the underlying income
model.
         I proceed to calculate the joint distribution of poverty transitions. Tables 2 and 3 show the
point estimate and 95 percent confidence interval for the actual panel mobility together with the
point estimates from using synthetic panels in the two periods. Results are encouraging; with few
exceptions, most of the point estimates are close to the actual estimates of poverty mobility and lie
within the 95 percent confidence intervals. For instance, actual panel data in Table 2 shows that
about 17 to 25 percent remained in poverty in Peru between 2007 and 2011 (based on the 95
percent confidence interval), while according to the synthetic panel technique with interaction
terms (specification 3) about 23 percent of the population were poor in both years. The two tables
also suggest that the method performs well irrespective of the length of the panel.
         Again, even when predictive power increases with the level of sophistication, results are
stable to the selection of time invariant variables included in the underlying models. This is an
important result for empirical applications at the regional level, as it suggests that the methodology
can be implemented in a large set of countries simultaneously in contexts where there is a reduced
set of comparable regressors available for all countries.




5
  This is a useful excersice to perform in the absence of actual panel data since it allows us to check the validity of
estimates from synthetic panels by comparing them with the actual poverty headcount that results from using cross
sectional data in round 1.
6
  Underlying income model estimations for Specification 1 are shown in the appendix.


                                                          9
         Table 4 shows conditional probabilities: the proportions of the population that move out of
poverty or fall into poverty given their initial poverty status. The table presents results for the long
panel data from 2007 to 2011 in panel A of the table and the short panel data from 2010 to 2011
in panel B of the table. Since both numerator and denominators are estimated in this figure, results
are less accurate than those shown in Table 2 and 3 (Dang and Lanjouw 2013). Again, with few
exceptions, most of the point estimates fall within the 95 percent confidence intervals. For instance,
actual panel data in panel A shows that about four to 11 percent of the initial non-poor in 2007
were poor in 2011 (based on the 95 percent confidence interval), while according to the synthetic
panel technique with interaction terms (specification 3) about 5 percent of the initial non-poor fell
into poverty after five years.

4.2. Sensitivity checks

Given that we are randomly drawing from the empirical distribution of residuals from the first
round, all previous estimates are based on 50 replications. Figure 1 analyzes the robustness of
results to different number of repetitions for the 2007-2011 period.7 The graph shows results for
specifications 3 increasing gradually the number of repetitions from 1 to 300. In general, estimates
are robust to the number of repetitions; the figure suggests that estimations fall within 95 percent
confidence intervals independently of the number of replications used. This result is extremely
important because it simplifies the analysis by allowing us to obtain just only one predicted vector
of incomes for the first round instead of 50 vectors as in Tables 2 and 3. Given this result, all
remaining estimates are based on only one repetition.
         All results have been based on an unweighted average (i.e., Œ≥ = 0.5) of residuals from the
income models in the first and second round of data. Even when results have been encouraging
and Œ≥ = 0.5 is a reasonable assumption based on empirical findings in the literature,8 one could
think of different scenarios where this assumption does not hold. Dang and Lanjouw (2013) obtain
a point estimate of poverty dynamics by assuming normality of the error terms and using the age-
cohort correlation of residuals obtained from cross-sectional data in the first and second round to
produce a point estimate of inter-generational poverty mobility. We could infer the value of Œ≥ by


7
  Results are similar for the 2010-2011 period.
8
  Residual correlations from panel data estimates are on average about 0.65 in Dang and Lanjouw (2013), about 0.50
in Dang et al. (2014), and about 0.45 in Cruces et al. (2015). Tables 2 and 3 show that correlation is about 0.50 in Peru
between 2007 and 2011. These results provide support to the assumption of Œ≥ = 0.5.


                                                          10
following an approach similar to that suggested by Dang and Lanjouw (2013). However, this
would move us away from the household-level analysis of the non-parametric approach to the age-
cohort analysis performed under the parametric method. To avoid this, I test the sensitivity of the
joint probabilities to changes in the value of the Œ≥ weights in Figures 2 and 3. In general, the results
are fairly stable to the value of the weights; except for extreme values, most estimates fall within
the 95 percent confidence intervals.
        Figure 4 performs the same sensitivity analysis to the conditional probabilities shown in
Table 4. The method works well for Œ≥ = 0.5; most of the estimates fall within the 95 percent
confidence interval when taking an unweighted average of residuals. However, since both
numerator and denominators are estimated in this figure, results are less accurate than those shown
in Figures 2 and 3 (Dang and Lanjouw 2013) and extreme values fall outside the 95 percent
confidence interval. Thus, caution should be exercised when selecting the weights to estimate
conditional probabilities of moving in and out of poverty given the initial poverty status.

4.3. Subgroup and household-level poverty mobility

This section tests the performance of the methodology in measuring poverty dynamics for specific
subgroups of the population. To do so, we estimate the same poverty transitions for several
subgroups based on: region of residence, gender, age, and education of the household head.
Subgroup synthetic panel results are based on parameters estimated from the entire sample. All
estimations are based on specification 3 and one repetition is considered (R = 1).
        Figures 5 and 6 compare actual mobility from panel datasets with estimations based on the
synthetic panel using the third specification in Tables 2 and 3. All estimates are close to the 45-
degree line, suggesting that the technique works well for estimating poverty dynamics profiles
based on subgroups of the overall population independently of the panel length.
        Figure 7 validates the methodology for estimating non-anonymous growth incidence
curves (GIC). These curves show household-level welfare growth by deciles of the first-round
welfare distribution.9 All estimations are based on specification 3 and are compared with the actual
non-anonymous GIC from panel data. All estimated GICs from synthetic panels are close to the
actual income growth. These results are extremely relevant since, unlike the parametric approach


9
 As opposed to anonymous GICs which show decile-level (or any other percentile) welfare growth by deciles (or any
other percentile) of the first-round welfare distribution.

developed by Dang and Lanjouw (2013), results in these figures suggest that the method proposed
                                                                            ÃÇ

                                                                                              2NP
                                                                                           ÃÇÌ†µÌ±ñ1   ) apart
from predicting joint probabilities of moving in and out of poverty.
         Figures 5 through 7 show that the method works well for predicting income mobility for
several subgroups of the population. However, it is crucial to understand whether ‚Äúhousehold-
level‚Äù transitions predicted from the synthetic panel methodology are similar to transitions
observed in the actual panel data.10 Table 5 presents the proportion of households based on the
actual mobility from true panels and the proportion of households based on predicted mobility
based on synthetic panels. Results indicate that methodology works well for predicting household
level mobility; most of the estimates are in the main diagonal. However, caution should be taken
when predicting ‚Äúhousehold-level‚Äù mobility, since about 20 percent of the individuals are not
classified correctly.

4.4. Validation in a different context

This section validates in other contexts by using the same panel datasets for Chile, Nicaragua, and
Peru as the one introduced by Cruces et al. (2015). Figure 8 shows the conditional probability of
poverty transition for the three countries and for different values of Œ≥ when implementing the ir
third specification.11 The figure presents the point estimate and 95 percent confidence intervals for
the actual panel mobility together with the point estimates from using synthetic panels in the three
countries.
         With few exceptions, most of the point estimates using Œ≥ = 0.5 are close to the actual
estimates of poverty mobility and lie within the 95 percent confidence intervals. For instance,
actual panel data shows that between 5 and 12 percent of the initial non-poor in 2001 in Nicaragua
fell into poverty in 2005 (based on the 95 percent confidence interval), while according to the
synthetic panel technique about 9 percent of the original non-poor population fell into poverty
between both years. Chile performs the least well. The conditional upward mobility estimate lies
about 8 percentage points outside the 95 percent confidence interval of the actual upward mobility
in this country‚Äîthough, the estimation of the conditional probability of falling into poverty lies

10
   This validation has not been done by Cruces et al. (2015) and Dang et al. (2013, 2014).
11
   Specification 3 in Cruces et al. (2015) includes: (i) household head age, age squared, gender, years of education,
and ethnicity; (ii) geographical controls and regional fixed effects; and (iii) the interaction between variables in (i) and
(ii).


                                                            12
within the confidence interval. This might be explained by the relatively longer period between
rounds and smaller sample size. However, the difference is only 11 percent in relative terms for
the conditional upward mobility. Thus, I think that these results confirm that the methodology also
works well in other contexts.

5. An application for LAC

This section presents mobility results for the whole LAC region using the approach described in
Section 2. To this end, I use the SEDLAC database of LAC household surveys and I focus on intra-
generational mobility measures for the whole region, as well as for 17 LAC countries for which
data are available between 2004 and 2015. These years coincide with a period of sustained
economic growth and marked poverty reduction (Cord et al. 2017, Vakis et al. 2016).
       Figure 9 shows two conditional types of transitions: (i) the proportion of poor who escape
poverty (defined as those with income lower than $4 PPP per day); and (ii) the proportion of non-
poor who fall into poverty. As the figure suggests, LAC has experienced a dramatic mobility in
the last 11 years. There is considerably more upward than downward mobility: 43 percent of the
initial poor escaped poverty by 2015, while about 10 percent of those whose initial incomes were
higher than the poverty line fell into poverty during the last 11 years.
       These trends vary across countries. For instance, less than a quarter of the original poor
escaped poverty in Guatemala and Honduras during the last 11 years, which compares with a
significantly higher conditional upward mobility of more than 70 percent in Uruguay and Chile.
More important, despite the strong poverty reduction in the last decade in LAC, downward income
mobility is particularly worrying in some countries in the region. For instance, more than 10
percent of the initial non-poor fell into poverty in Nicaragua, Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala.
       The key point of this section is not to provide an extensive analysis of mobility in the region
but rather to showcase the type of new insights that a researcher can obtain by applying the
technique described in the paper. Indeed, cross sectional data using the same years and data sources
would not have allowed an understanding of the welfare dynamics that the technique allows
disentangling as above. Using cross sectional data alone would only reveal that between 2004 and
2015, poverty in the region went down from about 40 to 24 percent; but we would not know the
nature of those movements.




                                                 13
6. Conclusion

Due to an increasing interest in measuring intra-generational mobility, and since panel datasets are
rarely available or have many limitations, there has been a growing literature that studies mobility
using cross-sectional data that do not follow individuals over time. Synthetic panel is the most
recent technique and allows estimating the unobserved welfare level in the first round of cross
sectional data for all households interviewed in the second round. A non-parametric version of the
technique yields lower and upper bound mobility estimates depending on the assumptions made
about the correlation between the first and second round error terms in the underlying regressions.
On the other hand, a parametric version of the method produces a point estimate of poverty
mobility.
       By taking a weighted average of the estimated residuals in the underlying models, this
paper proposes a non-parametric adaptation of the parametric point estimate of mobility. Unlike
the parametric technique, this adaptation does not require any assumption regarding the
distribution of the error terms in the underlying welfare models. The method is validated by
producing welfare mobility estimates out of cross-sectional data and by comparing them with
actual mobility from panel datasets in three LAC countries: Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru. Results
suggest that the method performs well; most estimates are close to the actual panel mobility.
Moreover, these results confirm that the method yields reliable estimates of household welfare
growth, apart from the join probabilities of poverty dynamics. Finally, the paper also suggests that
the methodology can be easily applied to regional analysis, since it does not require a large number
of explanatory variables in the underlying welfare model estimations.

 is calculated for opposite halves of the total 2007 sample in Panel A and 2010 in Panel B. Results are
 constrained to the panel sample of households whose heads are between 25 and 65 years old. The gray area
 represents the 95-confidence interval for the actual estimations. Solid lines represent actual mobility from
 panel data. Results are based on the third specification. Poor are those individuals with a per capita income
 lower than $4. Poverty lines and incomes are expressed in 2005 $PPP/day. No repetitions are done (R = 1).

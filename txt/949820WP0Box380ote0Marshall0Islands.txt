           The Pacific has seen several recent cases that show
           the need for immediate liquidity post-disaster. In
           the Cook Islands, in the immediate aftermath of
           TC Pat in 2010, a delay in the receipt of travel
           funds meant that key government personnel could
           not immediately commence the initial damage
           assessment. Following TC Vania in 2010, Vanuatu
           had to reallocate a significant amount of the
           national budget. Similarly, Fiji and Samoa had to
           reallocate budgetary funds in the wake of TC Evan
           in 2012 and 2013; and the Santa Cruz earthquake
           in the Solomon Islands in February2013 drained
           the annual budget for the National Disaster
           Management Office and used the majority of the
           national contingency budget.

           Lacking contingency reserves and access to short-
           term loan funds, PICs have limited post-disaster
           budget flexibility and rely heavily on post-disaster

                                        MARSHALL ISLANDS

              This note on the Marshall Islands forms part of a series of country Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance
              (DRFI) notes that were developed to build understanding of the existing DRFI tools in use in each country
              and to identify gaps future engagements in DRFI that could further improve financial resilience. These
              notes were developed as part of the technical assistance provided to countries under the Pacific DRFI pro-
              gram jointly implemented by the World Bank and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community financed by
              the Government of Japan. The technical assistance builds on the underlying principles of the three-tiered
              disaster risk financing strategy and focuses on three core aspects: (i) the development of a public finan-
              cial management strategy for natural disasters, recognizing the need for ex-ante and ex-post financial
              tools; (ii) the post-disaster budget execution process, to ensure that funds can be accessed and disbursed
              easily post-disaster; and (iii) the insurance of key public assets, to resource the much larger funding
              requirements of recovery and reconstruction needs. The Pacific DRFI Program is one of the many appli-
              cations of PCRAFI. It is designed to increase the financial resilience of PICs by improving their capacity to
              meet post-disaster financing needs without compromising their fiscal balance.

1. Background and Objective

The eight states in India’s North-East region are connected to the rest of the country by a
narrow corridor and (until recently) were classified by the Indian government as “special
category? states. As such, they are a particular focus of the World Bank's Country
Partnership Strategy for India (2013-17) (Report No. 76176). This non-lending technical
assistance (NLTA) was requested by the governments of Nagaland and Meghalaya,
stemming from previous engagements with the World Bank Group – the state HIV/AIDS
program (supported by IDA financing) in the case of Nagaland, and IFC advisory services
for private sector involvement in government health insurance program and investment in
medical education in the case of Meghalaya. Both state governments show commitment
to improving health and nutrition services and outcomes and look to the World Bank to
provide support.

The majority of the populations of Nagaland and Meghalaya, totaling two and five million
respectively, are from tribal communities. The per capita gross domestic product of both
states is about US$ 1,100, lower than the national figure of US$ 1,350. Household survey
results for both states released a few months ago show that while there has been
progress in improving health services over the past decade, considerable challenges
remain. For example, in Nagaland in 2012-13, only 36% of one-year-old children had
received all recommended vaccinations; while this was an improvement from 21% in
2005-06, it is far below the 2009 national average of 61% (itself very low). In Meghalaya,
this indicator was 49% in 2012-13, better than the 33% measured in 2005-06 but also
significantly lower than the national average. In both states, the population depends on
government health services to a significantly greater extent than elsewhere in India.

In each state, 70-80% of the population live in rural areas, dispersed over a large number
of small villages. The topography of both states is hilly, with poor roads and connectivity.
This raises significant barriers to effective service delivery and access to services. At the
same time, there are problems with how health services are organized, managed and
delivered. Like in India as a whole, since 2005 the National Rural Health Mission (now
known as the National Health Mission) has provided channeled significant central

                                             3
government resources and technical input for improvements in government health
services in the two states. The state governments requested the Bank for technical
assistance in specific areas for which other sources of support, particularly the National
Health Mission, were not available, and improvements in which held the potential to
leverage the effectiveness of existing government financing.

The development objective of this activity is to support development of health system
strategies, policies and management systems in North East states.

2. Implementation

In May 2013, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Ministry of Finance
endorsed and transmitted to the Bank requests for technical assistance from the two state
governments. Implementation was planned over FY14 and FY15, with planned final
delivery in May 2015. A cross-sectoral team worked on this activity, including specialists
in health, community development, renewable energy and water and sanitation. The
Bank team ensured ongoing dialogue with each state government, defined requirements
in each technical area, managed consultants, ensured quality, and followed-up with
dissemination and policy dialogue. In each technical area, consultant firms/organizations
were competitively selected to complete the necessary assessments, recommendations,
plans, specifications and budgets. Ongoing in-person dialogue with state government
officials, along with a series of workshops in each state and in Delhi, as well as two
lunch-time BBLs at the World Bank in Delhi (attended by Bank staff, DEA, consultants
and other stakeholders), provided for dissemination of results and feedback from and
dialogue with stakeholders.

In December 2013, DEA endorsed a request for an investment project from the Nagaland
state government, so that the NLTA work focused on Nagaland contributed to technical
preparation of the project.

3. Outputs

The concept note included work in the following areas:
- Cross-sectoral strategies to improve health and nutrition;
- Health human resource analysis and planning;
- Design of procurement and supply chain management system;
- Information and communication technology (ICT) system design;
- Results-based financing (RBF) strategy design; and
- Just-in-time support.

Based on further understanding of state government requirements and demand, planned
work on cross-sectoral strategies came to encompass substantial technical work on
off-grid energy and water/sanitation for health facilities in Nagaland, as well as on
Nagaland’s system of community management of health services. Planned work on
human resources, supply chain management and ICT, was done in both states as
planned. Planned support to an RBF strategy for hospital services in Meghalaya did not

                                            4
move forward, although an RBF strategy was incorporated in a recommended plan to
support the community level in Nagaland. On-demand, just-in-time support, was provided
to the government of Nagaland on design and quality assurance of health facility and
household surveys.

a. Off-grid energy for health services

Nagaland requested technical support on power supply for health services, as this was
perceived as affecting the quality of services, patient demand and working conditions for
health workers. Indeed, an assessment of 24 facilities found that 18 experienced power
cuts of 12-18 hours per day, while 1 had power cuts of more than 18 hours. None of the
facilities had grid power supply for more than 18 hours. The assessment found that
unreliable power affected service delivery, both directly by cutting lighting and making
equipment inoperable, and indirectly by influencing equipment purchase and allocation
decisions (i.e. contributing to the fact that health facilities in the state are under-equipped
in relation to national standards.). Different categories of health facilities were developed
based on current and future anticipated power demand, informing recommendations for
investments. In larger facilities, (Primary Health Centers, Community Health Centers and
District Hospitals) it was recommended to use solar energy technology, combined with
diesel generators to meet needs in poor solar conditions. (A number of facilities already
have generators installed, but they are not often used due to lack of budget for fuel).
Smaller facilities, particularly Sub-Centers, can function with battery and inverter systems
that can be charged by the grid when it is available. Analysis of solar energy potential in
Nagaland concludes that it is a cost-effective option, with only 20% lower potential than
locations receiving high solar energy such as Gujarat or Rajasthan. At the same time,
considering the low cost to the user (i.e. the health facility) of grid power, solar energy
investments are cost-effective as back-up but not as a replacement to the power grid.

b. Water and sanitation for health services

Similarly, Nagaland requested technical support on water and sanitation in health
facilities. Poor availability of clean water and poorly-maintained toilets are perceived as
affecting service quality as well as the attractiveness of health services to the population,
particularly women and girls. A field assessment of 33 health facilities found that only 4
had adequate running water for washbasins and only 3 had water connections for toilets.
Most (27) facilities relied on water piped from streams, while 11 facilities experienced
seasonal water shortages. Only a few facilities had water supply arrangements needed
for good hygienic conditions for patients and staff (i.e. functional water connections to
washbasins and toilets). Despite the apparent abundance of water, particularly during the
monsoon season, the settlement pattern in the state, with villages perched on hilltops,
constrains accessibility of water sources, so that most households are dependent on
water piped varying distances from upland surface sources (i.e. streams and springs) fed
by constrained rainfall catchment areas. With regard to sanitation, the assessment found
that only a few facilities had toilets with running water connections; at the same time,
although many toilets were clean and functional, a good number were poorly maintained
or not in use. In all facilities, toilets are connected with buried septic tanks or pits, although

                                                5
these are not emptied and there are no evident arrangements for waste treatment or
filtering. Investment recommendations included repair and upgrading of piping and
storage facilities linked to existing water supplies, as well as installation of roof-water
harvesting systems (which may act as the main water source for small facilities such as
Sub-Centers, and as back-up for larger facilities). Improvements to sanitation facilities
would include upgrading septic tanks, including anaerobic filter installations, and putting
in place the necessary plumbing connections to discharge wastewater from sinks, toilets
and drains to the improved septic tanks.

c. Community management of health services

Nagaland’s population of about two million is mostly from tribal communities. Building on
tribal governance structures, the state’s 2002 “Communitisation of Public Institutions and
Services Act? transferred responsibility and resources for management of local services
to community-level committees. The extent of decentralization of responsibilities and
resources is somewhat unique in the Indian context. The state government requested the
World Bank to support a situation analysis and development of a strategy to strengthen
communitisation in the health sector. Fieldwork was conducted in four districts, and
involved visiting and interviewing 19 committees. The team also consulted widely with
stakeholders within and outside the state government. The assessment found that there
are functional Health Committees at most health facilities that were visited. Most
committee members were motivated. However, communitisation in health is far from
achieving its potential, as committees are not always constituted according to the
guidelines, especially with regard to involvement of women, and there is incomplete
understanding of their role, as they are often focused on monitoring rather than
managing. A strategy and plan were developed designed to empower Health Committees
to oversee, manage and improve health services as well as undertake health and
nutrition-related activities that are priorities for them. This included significant capacity
building, encompassing support to committees in identifying existing gaps and priorities,
determining the most suitable approaches to address these gaps, developing action
plans and operationalizing those plans. A results-based incentive strategy was
recommended whereby funding would be provided to communities on the basis of
progress on defined indicators of improved health and nutrition-related services and
practices. In turn, communities would use the incentives for activities and investments
that are important to them and which have potential impacts on health and nutrition.

d. Human resources for health

Both Nagaland and Meghalaya requested technical support on human resources in the
health sector, with a focus on retention and performance of government health staff in
rural areas. In each state, over 50 key informants were interviewed, including: medical
and nursing students; public-sector doctors, nurses and specialists practicing at district
health facilities; private-sector doctors, specialists and nurses; and key informants from
state and district health departments working on human resource matters or managing
public health programs. The assessment found considerable intrinsic motivation to work
in rural areas Meghalaya and Nagaland due to family and community ties. There were a

                                             6
number people interviewed who were first in their family, community or tribe to enter a
health profession. The assessment identified numerous challenges to working in rural
areas, including difficult living and working conditions (including with regard to power
supply, water and sanitation), poor service delivery conditions (including insufficient staff,
poor equipment and drug supply), low salaries and incentives, and inadequate human
resource management. Recommendations includes the areas of remuneration, human
resource allocation and management, training, and working and living conditions.
Meghalaya’s experience with mandatory rural service for health professionals was
examined. On the basis of this work, the state governments will develop a medium-term
health human resources development plan.

In addition, Nagaland requested World Bank technical support to planning for
establishment of the first medical college in the state. Detailed plans and technical
specifications in the areas of infrastructure, equipment, budgeting, human resource
requirements, and other issues, were completed.

e. Supply chain management

Both states similarly requested support on improving procurement and supply chain
management systems for government health services. Assessments included field visits
to health facilities and warehouses and interviews with officials and health staff. An
in-depth “mapping? of procurement and supply chain management processes wa s done
including forecasting and planning, quality controls, distribution networks, vendor
selection, and inventory management. The assessment found that systems are
characterized by manual processes, lack of trained staff, poor storage infrastructure,
insufficient procedures, and resultant irregular supply of medicines and consumables.
Detailed blueprints improving these systems were developed, including institutional
changes, development and adoption of standard operating procedures, training,
information system, and infrastructure investment. Although a longer-term objective could
be creation of autonomous centralized procurement entities (like the Tamil Nadu Medical
Services Corporation), it was recommended that the two state governments start with
rationalizing and clarifying responsibilities for procurement and supply chain
management within a single unit in their Departments of Health & Family Welfare.
Measures were recommended to improve planning and ordering, procurement, quality
assurance, storage, inventory management, distribution and monitoring.

f. Information and communication technology (ICT)

The two states also requested technical support to assess and provide recommendations
on the possible use of ICT to improve management and delivery of health services. This
work drew on example from across the world on effective use of ICT in the health sector in
low-resource settings. Lessons from India and elsewhere emphasize the importance of
establishing a single inter-operable platform on which priority applications can be
developed, avoiding discrete and uncoordinated investments. Needs and possible ICT
strategies were identified in each state, including in the areas of: (a) supply chain
management, including planning, ordering, monitoring and management of medicines,

                                              7
consumables and equipment; (b) financial management, enabling faster approvals and
improved budgetary processes and expenditure tracking; (c) human resource
management, including career progression, posting and training management, as well as
payroll and leave processing; (d) health management information system, including
reducing the reporting burden on front-line health staff through the use of mobile
applications for program data collection and beneficiary tracking; and (e) mobile
applications to enhance the reach of health behavior change communication initiatives. In
Meghalaya, this work focused on assessment and improvement of an ICT investment
plan that had already been done and proposed for financing by a national e-governance
program. In Nagaland, a comprehensive assessment and investment plan were
produced, as well as draft terms of reference for the recommended “managed service
provider,? to be contracted to manage and undertake the planned investments.

g. Health facility and household survey design and quality

Finally, the government of Nagaland requested support to design and quality assurance
of health facility and household surveys that it is currently implementing. These surveys
are designed to help address a large gap in knowledge about health services and
household behaviors related in Nagaland, in order to inform policy and investment
decisions. The Bank-supported technical assistance included: (i) design of the surveys,
including a survey of primary health facilities, a hospital assessment, and a household
survey; (ii) development and pre-testing of the various survey instruments; (iii) support to
the Department Health & Family Welfare in hiring the necessary personnel and
organizing data collection; (iv) training of survey personnel; (v) design and quality
assurance of data entry; and (vi) quality assurance of data collection.

4. Results

Like in the rest of India, the National Health Mission has since 2005 provided a technical
framework and significant resources for improving primary and first-referral health
services in Meghalaya and Nagaland. This has included standard-setting and technical
guidelines in many areas, such as population-based standards for infrastructure and
human resources and the technical content of service to be delivered at different levels of
the government health system. These states’ requests for technical support therefore
focused on areas that have not been covered by the National Health Mission (i.e. energy
and water and sanitation for health services, ICT, supply chain management) or where
additional attention and support is needed (i.e. human resources for health).

This Bank-supported technical work is intended to lead to changes in policy and
management, as well as inform future investments, thereby leveraging the effectiveness
of central and state government spending on health services. In Nagaland, the work has
had a clear impact, determining to a great extent the technical content of a proposed
IDA-financed investment project (P149340), as well as laying the basis for further work
and dialogue on medium-reform of difficult policy issues (particularly in the areas of health
human resources and overall organization of health services in the state). This technical
assistance has directly leveraged US$ 48 million in IDA financing and US$ 12 million in

                                             8
state government financing for the proposed project, as well as US$ 10 million in central
government funding to establish a medical college.

In Meghalaya, this work has provided a platform for dialogue on relevant policy and
investments in the relevant areas. Unfortunately, the state’s e -governance proposal will
not be funded by the central government, but the ICT investment plan is available to be
funded from other sources. A possible proposal for an investment project is under
discussion. This ongoing dialogue has also expanded to possibilities for strengthening
cross-sectoral coordination at the community level, particularly between health, nutrition
and early childhood education. As follow-up to this, as well as the community-level work in
Nagaland, the team has proposed support from the SAFANSI trust fund for a continuing
program of technical assistance, focusing on health-nutrition-early childhood education
linkages at the community level.

This technical work can also be useful for other states as well as perhaps other countries.
The World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recently published
reports on both energy and water/sanitation for health facilities.1 The assessments in
Nagaland provide among the first empirical cases of work in this area, including not just
broad program recommendations but also detailed technical specifications that should be
useful in other contexts. Just as Meghalaya and Nagaland requested support in these
and the other technical areas, other states should be able to learn from this technical work
since it has not been covered by the National Health Mission or other sources of support.
It is mainly for this reason that the team has produced knowledge briefs that can be
provided to other state governments as well as be made freely available on the internet.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Russia perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Russia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Russia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Russia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Russia;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Russia.
       Use data to help inform Russia country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In February—June 2014, 393 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Russia were invited to
provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector companies; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
139 stakeholders participated in the survey (35% response rate).
Some respondents received the questionnaire via email and returned it accordingly. Others
received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Russia; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank
Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Russia; Russia’s role as a global donor for
development; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing in Russia.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Russia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Russia is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Russia, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved
   in Russia.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Russia, WBG staff preparedness
   to help Russia solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Russia, with which stakeholder
   groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus
   most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what reasons respondents
   attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Russia, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Russia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty-three development areas, such as economic
   growth, governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG
   taking decisions quickly in Russia, imposing reasonable conditions on its lending/
   investments, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Russia’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Russia: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Russia, and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Russia’s Role as a Global Donor for Development: Respondents were asked about their
   views on Russia’s role as a donor providing assistance to developing/poor countries.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Russia, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from PMUs and consultants/
        contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs were combined with
        employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; respondents
        from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
        companies; respondents from NGOs, community based organizations, and private
        foundations were combined into the “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the
        office of the President/Prime Minister, bilateral agencies and multilateral agencies were
        included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the office of a
        minister, the office of a parliamentarian, independent government institutions, trade
        unions, and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Moscow. A small number
        of respondents from St. Petersburg were combined with those from Moscow, and a small
        number of respondents from rural areas were included in the “Other? category for all
        further analyses.

       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 97). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Employees of ministries/PMUs/consultants on WBG projects had the highest levels of
        familiarity with the World Bank (IBRD), whereas respondents from academia/research
        institutes/think tanks had significantly lower levels of familiarity.
       Respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks had the highest levels
        of familiarity with the IFC, whereas respondents from local governments had
        significantly lower levels of familiarity.
       Respondents who indicated that they work with the IFC in Russia (17% of the sample)
        had significantly higher levels of familiarity with the IFC than other respondents.
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly higher
        levels of familiarity with the World Bank (IBRD) and the IFC than respondents who
        indicated that they do not collaborate with the WBG.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the World Bank and the IFC were significantly,
        strongly correlated with their perceptions of the overall effectiveness of the World Bank
        and the IFC (respectively) in Russia, and significantly, moderately correlated with their
        perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to Russia’s development, and the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results in Russia.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Greatest Weakness
       Respondents from local governments were significantly more likely to indicate that the
        WBG’s greatest weakness in Russia was the lack of public disclosure of its work;
        respondents from the media were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG is
        not willing to honestly criticize policies and reform efforts in the country; and
        respondents from CSOs, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks tended to indicate that the WBG is not collaborating
        enough with non-state actors.

       Employees of ministries/PMUs/consultants on WBG projects, respondents from the
        private sector/financial sector/private banks, and academia/research institutes/think tanks
        were significantly more likely to attribute slow or failed reform efforts to the WBG being
        not sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground compared to respondents
        from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were statistically significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings
        of the WBG’s effectiveness across two of these thirty-three development areas in Russia:
        “Regulatory framework? and “Environmental sustainability?. Respondents from local
        governments gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “Regulatory
        framework?, whereas respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks
        gave significantly lower ratings. Employees of ministries/PMUs/consultants on WBG
        projects gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “Environmental
        sustainability?, whereas respondents from the media gave significantly lower ratings.
        Ratings across all areas by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 74).
       Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher effectiveness
        ratings for “Urban development?; “Trade and exports?, “Environmental sustainability?,
        and “Education? compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG. Ratings
        across all areas by collaboration can be found in Appendix D (see page 115).
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 56) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Russia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the fifteen specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the overall
        effectiveness of the World Bank (IBRD) and the IFC, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the World Bank’s and
        IFC’s overall effectiveness in Russia. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework; and
                      The World Bank’s effectiveness at macroeconomic management.
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at water and sanitation;
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at transport; and
                      The IFC’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.
       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Russia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
               The WBG’s effectiveness at innovation, science, research & development; and
               The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

        with the WBG: “The WBG treats clients and stakeholders in Russia with respect?, “The
        WBG provides effective implementation support?, “Working with the WBG increases
        Russia’s institutional capacity?, “Where country systems are adequate, the WBG makes
        appropriate use of them?, “The World Bank’s (IBRD) conditions on its lending are
        reasonable?, and “The IFC’s conditions on its investments are reasonable?.

        respondents from local governments gave the highest ratings, whereas respondents from
        the private sector/financial sector/private banks and CSOs gave significantly lower
        ratings. (See Appendix B for details).

XI. Russia’s Role as a Global Donor for Development
This section presents the data on a number of questions regarding Russia’s role as a global donor
for development. In 2010, the Russia country team explored opinions of the Russian general
population about Russia’s development assistance to developing/poor countries through a
nationwide public opinion survey as part of the Russia as a Donor Initiative (RDI). In 2013, a
follow-up study was conducted in order to track opinions of the Russian population about
Russia’s development aid efforts over time. For this section of the 2014 Russia Country Opinion
Survey, selected key questions were chosen from the 2010 and 2013 nationwide surveys in order
to compare the 2010/2013 data collected from the general public with the views of opinion
leaders in Russia.

Support for Russia’s Aid to Developing/Poor Countries
       The views of opinion leaders in Russia were statistically similar to the views of the
        general population in 2010 and 2013: the majority of respondents approved of Russia’s
        development assistance to developing/poor countries.

        Russia to provide aid to developing/poor countries would be through participating in
        international programs in cooperation with international organizations such as the World
        Bank and the UN compared to the 2013 respondents from the general population.

* Shared prosperity – The World Bank Group aims to promote income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in each
country. This involves achieving economic growth which is inclusive of all sections of the society. Inclusion demands equity so that it
becomes the focus point. The incomes of the bottom 40 percent of a nation’s population will be tracked through a new Shared Prosperity
Indicator; the GDP growth data alone is not sufficient.

 developing/poor countries?

       Active involvement in providing aid to developing/
 G4    poor countries is an important characteristic of a               1          2           3           4
       modern developed country
       By helping to improve living conditions in
 G5    neighboring developing/poor countries, Russia can                1          2           3           4
       reduce the flows of migrants to its territory
       Russian aid should go to its neighboring countries
       because we have common values and traditions in
 G6                                                                     1          2           3           4
       contrast to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
       America
       While helping developing/poor countries, Russia
       should collaborate with other developed countries
 G7                                                                     1          2           3           4
       and international organizations because it is more
       effective in terms of achieving results
       While making decisions about whether to provide
 G8    aid to developing/poor countries, Russia should be               1          2           3           4
       guided primarily by its own interests
       Russia should help primarily its neighboring poor
 G9    countries, such as Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, because               1          2           3           4
       instability in these countries poses a threat to Russia
       Russia should help developing/poor countries
       because it would promote Russian businesses in

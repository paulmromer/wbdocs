                                                            TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT
1.      This technical assessment has been carried out as part of the preparation of the Health
Program-for-Results (PforR) operation in Croatia. The primary focus of the assessment is on the
Government’s Program, and the National Health Care Strategy 2012–2020, and serves as the
policy framework for this operation.

2.      The Croatian health system produces reasonably good outcomes, but at high costs
that are difficult to sustain in an environment of fiscal constraints. Health sector reforms
implemented over the last 20 years have gone a long way to improve the Croatian health
system’s performance, which produces robust results both in terms of health outcomes and
public satisfaction. Through these reforms the current system is now more centralized with better
regional balances in terms of funding and human resources, complementary and private
insurances were introduced, a performance-based payment mechanism was implemented in
hospitals and new regulations rationalized the expenditure on pharmaceuticals. Between 1990
and 2010, life expectancy at birth increased by four years (from 72.5 years to 76.5 years), infant
mortality was reduced by more than half (from 10.7 to 4.4 infant deaths per 1,000 live births),
and the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by 25 percent (from 1,060 to 790 deaths per
100,000 inhabitants). Also, with regard to the correlation between GDP and life expectancy at
birth, Croatia’s life expectancy is one to two years longer than that of countries with similar
income levels, such as Hungary, Slovakia, and Estonia (Figure 1).

region (

4.      Table 1). On most indicators, Croatia is doing better than several East European countries
and ranks between the old member states (OMS) of the European Union and the new member
states (NMS). Croatia has completed the epidemiological transition in which the great burden of
infectious diseases has now been replaced by chronic non-communicable diseases. The leading
causes of death in Croatia are now heart and blood vessel diseases. In the last 10 years, the share
of total mortality from these diseases has slightly declined from 53 percent to 49 percent of all
deaths from all causes, while cancer, the second most frequent cause of mortality, slightly
increased from 24 percent to 26 percent. The third cause of death is injuries and poisoning,
diseases of the digestive system are fourth, and the fifth cause of death are diseases of the
respiratory system.

5.      Nevertheless, there are some areas that require special attention. Diabetes in Croatia is
54.7 percent higher than those in the NMS. Death rates due to cerebrovascular diseases, female
breast cancer, traffic accidents, and smoking-related diseases in Croatia are also higher than the
average for the NMS. These higher mortality rates are in many cases a result of high prevalence
of behavioral risk factors such as an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity,
smoking, and alcoholism. The results of the Croatian Health Survey (CHS) from the year 2003
showed that 15.9 percent of the adult population (20.2 percent men and 12.1 percent women)
have bad eating habits.1 Unsurprisingly, the CHS results showed that over 60 percent of men and
50 percent of women aged over 18 years old are overweight (with a BMI of more than 25
kilogram per square meter, which places Croatia among the countries with the highest numbers
of overweight people. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO),
smoking in Croatia is the leading cause of the disease burden. CHS results have also shown that
in Croatia 27.4 percent of people aged 18 and over are smokers (33.8 percent men and 21.7
percent women), which is more than the prevalence of smoking in either the old EU member
states (25.6 percent) or the new member states (25.4 percent). During the period from 2000 to
2009, registered alcohol consumption in Croatia gradually increased. According to the WHO
database, registered consumption of pure alcohol in Croatia in the year 2009 was 12.8 liters per
capita, while the EU average was estimated to be 12.5 liters. Furthermore, in Croatia, about
7,500 people annually were treated for drug abuse either in hospital outpatient departments or as
inpatients. The total number of people in treatment for drug abuse has generally been stable in
recent years, and the number of new people entering the system has been decreasing.

6.     Like most other European countries, Croatia is facing a profound change in its
population age-structure. Due to this demographic transition, the Croatian population is aging
considerably. Croatia’s demographic pyramid (Figure 2) shows that Croatia reached stage 4
(contracting) of its demographic transition, with a negative natural population growth (-2 percent
in 2010). Since 2001, the 65 and over age group has grown to be larger than the population aged
under 15 years old (Figure 3). As the elderly population continues to increase, so will the burden
of non-communicable (and chronic) diseases and the incidence and prevalence of co-morbidities.
Therefore, there will be a substantial increase in the need for additional health services and long-
term care services (LTC).

7.      However, good health outcomes come at a high cost. With overall health spending at
7.8 percent of GDP, Croatia is near the top of the list compared to new EU members, and spends
significantly more than countries with similar GDP per capita in the region. At 17.7 percent, the
health sector’s share of public expenditures (about EUR 3.1 B – figure 1) is higher than the 15.6
percent average for all EU countries (although some social security expenses beyond the strict
health system, such as sick and maternity leave, are also included in that figure). In this fiscally
constrained environment, the Croatian health system faces a mismatch among available public
resources, growing expenditures, and increasing needs.

                                                                      5
8.      Health financing is organized according to social health insurance principles . A
single fund, the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO), covers the entire population (about 4.4
million beneficiaries comprised by: 1.52 million active workers, 1.05 million pensioners, 1.15
million family members and 0.63 million individuals covered by special programs).

9.     The needs that Croatia’s health system must address have changed as a
consequence of the demographic and epidemiological transition in the country. The disease
burden in Croatia has shifted from being dominated by maternal and child health and
communicable diseases to being dominated by chronic and noncommunicable conditions. Heart
and blood vessel diseases, for example, are the leading cause of death and account for 49 percent
of deaths from all causes; cancer, the second-most-frequent cause, accounts for 26 percent. The
two combined are responsible for three of every four deaths.


                                                             6
10.     The institutional structure and capacity of the publicly funded health sector in
Croatia has not kept pace with this changing landscape. Many health care services in Croatia
continue to be delivered inefficiently. Hospitals continue to provide services that can be better
and more cost-effectively provided in an ambulatory setting. Similarly, LTSC for the elderly is
often provided in hospitals (at higher cost and in not adequate environment for the elderly) rather
than in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. At the same time, primary care is not acting as
an effective gatekeeper, and its role in preventive care needs strengthening.

11.     Increased quality in services and facilities is a core precondition for Croatia to
obtain the maximum from available resources. The Croatian Agency for Quality and
Accreditation in Health Care (AQAHS) is an independent and non for profit public institution
created in 2010 that acts as the national accreditation service in the Republic of Croatia. AQAHS
was established in order to support implementation of the technical regulations which has been
harmonized with the acquis communatauire of the European Union. Nevertheless, the existing
capacity gap in terms of using norms and protocols aligned with best international practice needs
to be overcome. Standard practices for more frequent health services are not in place, there is a
need to increase secondary prevention to reduce avoidable complications, the surveillance of
negative outcomes (sentinel events) is not implemented and quality control mechanisms are not
regular practices. A key illustration of this capacity gap is the failure to generate and use
disaggregated data, for instance by county, in monitoring and tracking county-level differences
in quality and outcomes.2

12.     Croatia has started to implement important health sector reforms to improve
efficiency and quality. Croatia recently introduced a number of long-range reform initiatives,
including a new performance-based payment mechanism in hospitals, centralized purchasing for
nonmedical equipment and consumables, new wide-ranging governance and management
arrangements in health care institutions, and new regulations rationalizing pharmaceutical
expenditures (which have been identified as regional best practice in a multi-country study
conducted by the World Bank3). Complementary and private insurance have also been
implemented. As a result of reforms, the Croatian health system now has better regional balance
in terms of funding and human resources.

13.    Pharmaceutical sector reforms in Croatia have expanded access, while the recently
launched centralized procurements have reduced costs. The number of prescriptions in
Croatia increased by 69.3 percent between 2005 and 2011, indicating an expansion in access.
The Ministry of Health has introduced new regulations promoting the procurement of generics
and centralizing procurement using competitive tendering and framework contracts for county
hospitals. These reforms have already begun to yield savings; as a direct result of the first round
of tenders in 2012, the estimated cost savings have been HRK 187 million (approximately
US$30 million). At the same time, the average expenditure per insured individual and the
average expenditure per issued prescription have decreased.

  Although these data are collected, they are not analyzed to support management or oversight, and in fact the
current World-Bank-supported project is building capacity for analysis. Reporting by county in Croatia should be
ready by December 2013.

14.    There is still ample scope to optimize hospital capacity in Croatia. The average length
of hospital stay across different types of hospitals in Croatia was 9 days in 2011, slightly over the
EU average of 8 days. However, the difference increases when new EU members are removed
and the comparison is made with the traditional “EU15? countries (around 4.5 days in Norway
and Sweden, around 5.5 in France and the Netherlands, around 6.5 in Spain and the United
Kingdom). True, this indicator does not present a clear picture of the situation in hospitals in
Croatia because it averages the length of stay across very different groups of inpatients —those
who should ideally be treated in an ambulatory setting, those who should be cared for in nursing
homes or assisted living facilities, and those who should, indeed, be treated as hospital inpatients.



Strategic relevance and technical soundness of the proposed Program

15.     The objective of the proposed Program—that is, improving health sector quality and
efficiency—is critical to the development and EU integration agenda in Croatia. Although the
Croatian health system produces fairly good outcomes, this has been achieved at costs that are
difficult to sustain in a fiscally constrained environment. The Croatian economy has been in
recession for the last few years and the prognosis remains one of limited growth. Overall health
spending is high at approximately 7.8 percent of GDP, and Croatia spends significantly more
than countries with similar GDP per capita in the region, while the health sector’s share of public
expenditures is higher than the average for all EU countries. At the same time, an aging
population, shifts in the disease burden toward a dominance of chronic and non-communicable
conditions, and the inevitable upward pressure on health care costs from technological advances
imply that health expenditures will continue to increase in the future.

16.     The Government of Croatia’s National Health Care Strategy sets out development
directions for the health sector and is the framework for making policy and operational
decisions, including the distribution of budgetary resources. The Croatian health care system
is primarily determined by the Health Care Act, which forms the fundamental framework of the
National Health Care Strategy 2012–2020. This Strategy is the umbrella document determining
the context, vision, priorities, and goals for health care in the Republic of Croatia over this
period. Croatia became an EU member in July 2013, so the Strategy is also oriented to planning
the development of health care in the context of the social, legal, and economic framework of the
EU. More specifically, the Strategy takes into account (a) Europe 2020, the EU strategy for
growth; (b) Health 2020, the new health policy of the World Health Organization European
Region; and (c) the Common Strategic Framework 2014–2020, which forms the basis for
financing from EU funds.

17.     The National Health Care Strategy 2012–2020 identifies the strategic problems and
reform priorities for the health care sector. The strategic problems identified are: (a) poor
connectivity and insufficient continuity of health care across levels in the health system; (b)
uneven or unknown quality of care; (c) inadequate efficiency and effectiveness of the health care
system; (d) poor or uneven availability of health care across regions; and (e) relatively poor
health indicators, particularly those related to risk factors and health behaviors.


                                                 8
The National Health Care Strategy identifies the following eight main Strategic Priorities:

(i) Developing a Health Information System and eHealth. With a focus on: a) establish an
    electronic health record for patients, b) increase the use of health care and statistical
    information to support decision making, and establishing the reporting and warning system,
    c) generate a functional improvement, modernization and maintenance of the existing
    information systems in health care, d) increase standardization and certification, e) change
    management and training, and f) introduce new legal regulations for the sector (estimated
    EUR 45M).

(ii) Strengthening and better using human resources in health care. Developing a strategic
     plan of human resources development, strengthening protection of health care workers,
     introducing vertical and horizontal mobility, improving specialization planning and
     approvals, adjusting regulations for work after mandatory retirement age (estimated EUR
     12M).

(iii)Strengthening management capacity in health care. The specific areas of focus include
     education and differentiation of management, data analysis, planning and researching the
     health care system, and strengthening the management authority of community health centers
     (estimated EUR 14M).

(iv) Reorganizing the structure and activities of health care institutions. Improving
     integration and cooperation in primary health care and public health, developing and
     implementing a hospital master plan to rationalize and modernize hospital services,
     increasing the continuity of care between hospital and out-of-hospital services, structural
     modifications to hospitals, and increasing centralized (joint) procurement for hospitals
     (estimated EUR 260M).

(v) Fostering quality in health care through (a) improving quality of monitoring, health worker
    education, and better public information for users; (b) developing, implementing, and
    monitoring clinical guidelines and accreditation; (c) introducing performance-based
    contracting and performance-based payments, with a specific emphasis on pay-for-quality
    initiatives; and (d) developing and implementing a formal Health Technology Assessment
    (HTA), including strengthening capacity to implement HTA (estimated EUR 40M).

(vi) Strengthening preventive activities by increasing the budgetary share of preventive
     activities in the health budget, improving management of preventive activities and programs
     including the introduction of performance-based contracting for prevention and strengthening
     preventive care at the primary care level; strengthening systems to monitor harmful
     environmental factors and early warning/response systems (estimated EUR 24M).

(vii)    Preserving financial stability of health care by focusing on strengthening the
    voluntary health insurance market, improving financial discipline in the health care system
    through greater accountability, improving the strategic allocation of health resources, and
    reducing corruption and informal payments (estimated EUR 10M).

                                               9
(viii) Improving cooperation with other sectors and society in general by Strengthening
    intersectoral cooperation (among ministries), with local and regional self-government and
    with civil society and media (estimated EUR 4M).

18.     The estimated total cost of implementing the 8 year strategy is about HRK 3.1B (EUR
409 M) (table 2) or HRK 390 M (EUR 51 M) per year, 1.6 percent of overall public health sector
spending. The cost is mainly related to investments needed for restructuring the configuration of
the health facility networks but also to the cost of introducing quality standards, quality control
mechanisms, improve management and critical tools to increase the sector governance among
other. Benefits from these investments will come directly as in the case of centralized
procurement that will reduce the costs of medical supplies and medical devices, of providing
more cost efficient health services (ambulatory procedures) or indirectly through increasing
quality and reducing readmissions or unfavorable evolution of health conditions and eventually

The Program

19.    The proposed Program to be supported by the Bank would cover 5 out of the 8 priorities
defined in the Government’s National Health Care Strategy (2012-20) (the Government
program), within the boundaries defined in terms of (a) Program duration; (b) Priorities
supported; (c) Institutions involved. .

       (a) Program duration. Program implementation period is from 2013 to 2017.

       (b) Priorities supported. To improve two critical areas of the health services (quality and
           efficiency) and considering the objectives and pillars of the CPS it was agreed with the
           Government that the Program would include 5 out of the 8 priorities of the National Health
           Care Strategy 2012–2020 that are oriented to addressing the main reform challenges facing

                                                          10
           the Croatian health sector, that is, rationalizing the health facility network, improving quality
           of health care services, and promoting financial sustainability of the health sector. These
           include:

           Priority iii (Strengthening management capacity in health care) and Priority iv
           (Reorganizing the structure and activities of health care institutions), including: Implementing
           hospital master plan, Implementing hospital reforms and governance and management
           changes, promoting group practices for general practitioners, expanding secondary-level
           ambulatory services, including high-resolution ambulatory centers, redefining long-term
           health care services and palliative care

           Priority v (Fostering quality in health care) and Priority vi (Strengthening preventive
           activities), including: implementing of a hospital accreditation, implementing of HTA to all
           new health technologies, building a body of clinical protocols and care pathways, detecting
           and proper recording of specific “sentinel events for quality?, implementing technical/clinical
           audits and payment mechanism to incentivize the use of clinical guidelines, using of the
           existing e-prescription system for quality control purposes.

           Priority vii (Preserving financial stability of health care), including: further development of
           central procurement, outsourcing of nonmedical services, strengthening the performance-
           linked component in payments to hospitals and ambulatory services, developing the MoH
           capacity to develop and present proposals to be financed by EU structural funds.

       (c) Institutions involved. Three main institutions will be involved in the implementation of the
           Program. The Ministry of Health will have the leading role in terms of defining policies and
           implementing the strategies but also because most of the Hospitals were re-centralized (under
           managerial authority of the Ministry of Health) as an initial step to implement the Hospital
           Master Plan. The Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO) will also have a significant role
           because several of the planned interventions will need its support and involvement. Finally
           the Agency for Quality and Accreditation in Health Care and Social Welfare would have
           a role in the accreditation process and in the implementation of the technical audits.

21.    The proposed Program has many of the critical building blocks required for
delivering results. These include:

       Strong political commitment to achieving reform, which is bolstered by the PforR
        instrument.
       The Program is harmonized with the larger policy framework for health sector reform in
        Croatia, since it contributes to the main challenges identified in the Government Program
        2012–2020
       The Program is technically sound and oriented to addressing the reform priorities facing
        the Croatian health sector, that is, rationalizing the health facility network, improving
        quality of health care services, and promoting financial sustainability of the health sector.
       Clearly defined interventions, which are technically appropriate to improving efficiency
        and quality in the Croatian context, and are supported by emerging international
        experience in the area
       An agreed set of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound)
        results indicators to assess Program performance.

22.     Political commitment to the proposed reforms is high, and the Government has already
initiated important reforms that seek to improve efficiency and quality, including those that will
contribute to the proposed Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs). As a result of reforms, the
Croatian health system now has better regional balance in terms of funding and human resources,
complementary and, to a limited extent, private insurance has been introduced, a new
performance-based payment mechanism has been implemented in hospitals, and new regulations
have rationalized pharmaceutical expenditures. The recent reforms in pharmaceuticals are, in
fact, identified as regional best practice in a multi-country study conducted by the World Bank.4
More recently, the MoH recentralized management of hospitals to implement hospital
management reforms that will facilitate future implementation of hospital rationalization.

23.     The PforR instrument will further strengthen the internal momentum to achieve results
by aligning incentives to support results within the government’s own program and by aligning
the incentives of the Ministries of Health and Finance to achieve defined program results. By
strengthening country systems, the PforR would also enable Croatia to leverage funding from the
EU, an important future source of health sector funding. Institutional arrangements between the
Mo Fans the MoH would enable the MOH to receive in its budget US$ 10 million to finance
Technical Assistance, which will be instrumental in leveraging future funding from the EU.

24. Reorienting service delivery in Croatia is critical to meet the changed landscape of needs
effectively and efficiently. The needs that Croatia’s health system must address have changed as
a consequence of the demographic and epidemiological transition in the country, in line with
what is occurring at world level; the top three underlying causes of disease in 1990 were low
body weight in children, indoor air pollution from cooking fuels, and smoking; in 2010 they
were high blood pressure, smoking and alcohol consumption (inactivity and poor diet, i.e. eating
too little fruit and too much salt, in particular, were responsible for 10% of DALYS). In 1990
NCDs caused 43% of DALYS whereas in 2010 they accounted for 54% of them; in 1990 deaths

related with the Millennium Development Goals accounted for 47% of total DALYS; by 2010,
only for 35% (deaths caused by diarrhoea, respiratory infections and measles all fell); DALYS
caused by injuries (road accidents, violence, etc) were up – from 10% to 11% 5. The situation at
the moment affects not only rich countries anymore as it can be seen in figure 5.

25. The disease burden in Croatia has also shifted from being dominated by maternal and child
health and communicable diseases to a majority of chronic and non-communicable conditions.
Heart and blood vessel diseases, for example, are the leading cause of death and account for 49
percent of deaths from all causes. Cancer, the second-most-frequent cause, accounts for 26
percent. Combined, the two are responsible for three out of every four deaths. 6 The underlying
causes of disease have also drastically changed.7 In 1990, the three leading risk factors were low
body weight in children, indoor air pollution from cooking fuels, and smoking, whereas by 2010
they were high blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and smoking; and inactivity and poor diet;
eating too little fruit and too much salt accounted for 10 percent of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYS).

26. Due to increased life expectancy the number of patients with more than one disease has
increased; people now live longer but they concentrate their diseases at the end of their lives
(“compression of morbidity?8) so there is less disability but more health problem, which “should
not? be treated in one place alone. The service modalities available to many people with long-
term conditions, however, are inadequate as they are characterized by their high dependency on
acute care, their singularly clinical focus, their reactive character, their fragmented and sporadic
nature, their lack of emphasis on personal experience and the residual character of community
services and secondary prevention9.

27. Meeting these needs effectively and efficiently requires a modern, integrated, patient-
centered health system. Chronic conditions pose a thorny challenge to health systems because
they depend critically on patient lifestyles and knowledge, require continuous monitoring and
management rather than episodic attention, and their management is complex and requires
multidisciplinary teams at a moment when many changes are occurring in the way services are
delivered: many specialized treatments (prostheses of the joints, dialysis) not exclusively hospital
treatments anymore, technologies are now transportable, which challenges their concentration in
one single place, better anesthesia and less invasive surgery allows earlier patient recovery; there

insulin pump, ), mental disease (major tranquilizers) and cancer (oral chemotherapy), etc.

28. Traditional hospitals and Primary Health Care are increasingly viewed as outdated and
unable to efficiently deliver the needed services tailored to these needs. Traditional hospitals
have been criticized because they are organized in silos based on clinical disciplines10 (…while
patients have each time a bigger number of simultaneous problems), they are oriented to
providing episodic treatments (while many patients suffer chronic conditions), and they operate
with batches and queues and with the difficult-to-understand full-time work schedules of less
than 40 hours per week. Traditional primary health care (PHC), originally designed to be
supported by basic technology, is also criticized for its limitations in providing access to more
modern solutions.11 Increasingly, individuals present with complex comorbidities that challenge
the traditional model of PHC service delivery and necessitate access to modern technologies.
There are also specific problems with service coordination12. Although there is a paucity of data
that provide a basis for estimating the size of the problem or clarifying the underlying reasons for
inadequate coordination, it is understood that possible reasons for problems with the
coordination of care include that hospitals and primary care have different administrative and
financial structures as well as cultures and other regulations; barriers to good communication;
and a lack of leadership to promote collaboration. Uncoordinated care can affect the quality and
efficiency of health care, access to care, participation in and satisfaction with care, and health
outcomes for chronically ill patients.

29. Access to first-line technologies could be improved by promoting GP group practices, while
access to more complex technologies are more appropriate at the secondary level of care.
Moreover, to meet changing health needs, traditional PHC needs to be reoriented from episodic
case management to a focus on risk factors and more integrated and comprehensive case
management. Therefore, to meet changing demands most efficiently and effectively, modern
health systems must be structurally reoriented and rationalized. Many European countries are
drastically reducing their bed stocks and the number of procedures applied under conditions of
daycare (e.g. cataract removal) are increasing exponentially in recent years (Figure 6 and 7).

technology, plus many outsourced services (IT, early discharge, home care, catering, medi-

31. In Germany, a number of newly establishes hospitals have proved able to combine a capital
investment threefold higher than in traditional German hospitals, returned through more
intensive production and higher profits. This has required a compact and flexible building
concept, with integration between the building and the primary process -“every metre a nurse
walks unnecessarily costs money?, so nursing departments do not follow medical disciplines but
are instead organized according to the level of nursing care -intensive, high, medium and low;
and a strong systematization of care processes through the use of care pathways: patients are
moved through the different departments, as their condition improves.14

33. More recently, US hospitals and clinics have been forming into large conglomerates, and
physicians have been flocking to join them. Doctors have decided to become employees, and
health systems have become chains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 25% of
doctors are self-employed—an extraordinary turnabout from a decade ago, when a majority were
independent16.

34. International overall response is occurring along several lines (not necessarily opposed with
one another)17 where the health service network is emerging as a possible solution

the disease burden in Croatia are:

     (i) Effective primary care services that play an important part in early detection, prevention,
          and health promotion managing the bulk of routine conditions and acting as an effective
          gatekeeper in patient access to referral care;
     (ii) Expanded secondary specialized services to introduce high-resolution ambulatory
          diagnostic and treatment schemes for higher-volume, lower-cost specialized services

           including ambulatory surgeries, day care, and specialized care for non-severe
           complications of chronic conditions;
     (iii) Rationalized inpatient services, which reduce the focus on an inpatient regime, increase
           the use of cost-effective interventions, and improve quality of care with the best mix of
           technology and human resources inputs, and which differentiate general hospital

     (iv) Palliative care for terminally ill patients and long-term health care for rehabilitation; and
     (v) Nonhospital facilities to provide long-term social care (LTSC) for the elderly and other
           groups in need of such care.

36. Rationalizing the health facility network is a key priority in Croatia. The institutional
structure and capacity of the publicly funded health sector in Croatia continues to be organized
around an outdated model of care, and services are delivered in an inefficient way. Hospitals
continue to provide services that can be better and more cost-effectively provided in an
ambulatory setting. Moreover, LTSC for the elderly is provided in hospitals, while LTC can be
better and more cost-effectively delivered in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. At the
same time, primary care is not acting as an effective gatekeeper, and its role in preventive care
needs strengthening. The structure of the health facility network is no longer appropriate for the
demographic profile of the population, and it is not organized to address co-morbidities, focus on
risk factors effectively, or reflect citizen preferences. Governance capacity to effectively manage
a modern health system is also scarce, a concern recognized by the MoH in the National Health
Care Strategy 2012–2020. A key illustration of this capacity gap is the failure to generate and use
disaggregated data, for instance, by county, in monitoring and tracking county-level differences
in quality and outcomes.18

37. The proposed Program appropriately recognizes that the hospital sector is vital to the
efficiency and cost control agenda in Croatia. Hospital expenditures continued to increase in
Croatia between 2005 and 2011. At 47 percent, hospitals account for the largest proportion of
public expenditures on health. This is so despite payment reforms to control increasing costs,
such as the introduction of Prospective Payment per Therapeutic Procedure in 2006, Diagnosis
Related Groups (DRGs) in 2009, and prospectively defined annual caps on payment. The DRG
system has increased efficiency by reducing the length of hospital stays for some evaluated
groups. Yet, as mandatory health insurance fund’s expenditures on hospital care were still
increasing, it is clear that further efforts are needed. Incentives in payment methods to hospitals
also need to be revised to increase efficiency. Currently, the Health Insurance Fund reimburses
hospital services that should be provided in an LTC setting, those that should be provided as
ambulatory services, and “true? inpatient services in the same way, which reinforces
inefficiencies and indicates the potential for future savings. To illustrate, a recent analysis
commissioned by the World Bank found that only 1.8 percent of surgeries that should ideally be
performed as specialized ambulatory services19 were delivered in this manner. The remaining

   Although these data are collected, they are not analyzed to support management or oversight and, in fact, the
current World-Bank supported project is building capacity for analysis. Reporting by county in Croatia should be
ready by December 2013.
19
   The surgeries assessed were cataract surgery, testicular surgery, and surgeries for varicose veins, inguinal/femoral
hernia, anus (hemorrhoids), removal of osteosynthetic material, and tonsillectomy.

98.2 percent were delivered in a traditional inpatient setting with concomitant higher costs (and
higher bills for the public payer).

38. Introducing performance-based payments in primary care and implementing clinical care
pathways is critical to reduce referral rates from primary care to higher levels of the health
system and improve both quality and efficiency of health services. High referral rates in primary
care in Croatia also contribute to low efficiency and higher health costs. Gatekeeping in Primary
Health Care (PHC) is intended to act as a filter and to control patient flows into secondary-level
care (with the exception of emergency care). When PHC plays this gatekeeping function and is
combined with capitation-based payments—such as in Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, and the UK—it can be a potentially effective approach to controlling costs.
There is a clear need to strengthen the gatekeeper function of primary care. Referral rates in
Croatia are 25 percent—whereas referral rates from robust primary care typically vary between 5
and 12 percent in different health systems, although there are no uniform standards. 20 The
incentives inherent in provider payment systems in Croatia contribute to this. Although some
payments to primary care providers are linked to services, the main payment mechanism is
capitation, which incentivizes providers to refer cases. Furthermore, there are no updated care
pathways defining the scope and role of primary care services in implementing clinical
guidelines. The Croatian National Health Care Strategy 2012–2020 states that group practices
are important because they provide opportunities for integrating primary health care services
with greater efficiency. Continuity of services and quality of work can be improved by sharing
space, equipment (diagnostic and treatment), nonmedical services, organization of standby duties
and replacements, planning and implementing additional preventive and curative programs
(vaccination, home visits, and so forth), and possibilities of sharing professional consultations
and clinical expertise among the partners. HZZO also has a direct interest in promoting
establishments of group practices since the monitoring costs are lower than for individual offices.
Consequently, the HZZO has recently started to provide financial incentives for primary health
care teams to establish group practices.

39. Quality improvement in Croatia is one of the most promising areas of improvement. Health
data are not analyzed or disaggregated at the local level. The only available data to probe for
local variations in quality are those from the civil registration system. In itself, this is an
indication that a focus on quality improvement is needed. The data available from civil
registration show regional disparities in infant mortality among counties in Croatia, indicating
regional inequities and underlying variations in quality that need to be further investigated.
Finally, strengthening the emphasis on preventive care and promoting healthy lifestyles can help
to reduce costs associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by preventing both disease
and complications thereto. The Program proposes to strengthen the quality improvement agenda
primarily by incentivizing the introduction of clinical care pathways based on evidence-based
guidelines and disease management protocols. Routine technical audits (that is, audits that seek
to assess adherence to protocols) with payments linked to protocols will incentivize
improvements in quality of care for both primary care and higher-level services.

40. Health Technology Assessment (HTA), in particular, can improve efficiency of resource use
and contain costs.21 Experience from countries with mature health systems in Europe and
elsewhere indicates that introducing HTA can be a good tool to increase quality and the
efficiency of resource use, and contain costs by basing decisions on public subsidies for new
technologies using a systematic and transparent appraisal and deliberation process that considers
efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and other criteria. In Croatia, the continuous implementation of
HTA is critical to capture quality and efficiency gains, and implementing HTA along with
centralized procurement through framework agreements will increase the efficiency of resource
use, contain costs, and improve quality of care through evidence-based decision making.


Program’s Results Framework and Monitoring Indicators

41. In order to monitor progress toward achieving the PDOs, the Program Results Framework
will use three PDO-level Results Indicators, and 14 Intermediate Results Indicators. some of the
PDO and intermediate indicators were selected as 10 Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLI)
42. Since the Program aims at improvements at the health system level by strengthening its
quality, efficiency, and sustainability aspects, the measurement and verification of the progress
toward achievement of the Program’s objectives will be based on the country’s existing
monitoring and evaluation systems. Specifically, the HZZO health information systems will be
relied upon to collect and provide aggregated reporting of monitoring data related to the HZZO’s
role in contracting services and monitoring/control of quality of service delivery, such as the
total number of contracted acute care beds, performed elective surgeries, and doctors’
prescription patterns. While monitoring data for most of the Intermediate Results Indicators
would be provided by the HZZO, the MOH, through its Department for the Implementation of
International Loans, will provide the necessary system-level data for the three remaining
Intermediate Results Indicators, such as public spending made through centralized
procurement/framework contracts, implementation of hospital reshaping activities, and data
related to establishment of group practices. Given its strategic oversight role, the MoH will
ultimately be responsible for monitoring the progress toward achievement of the Program’s
results and for ensuring timely collection and reporting of monitoring data and provision of
necessary verification documents to the World Bank and Ministry of Finance (MoF).

43. The Bank will conduct implementation support missions based on the detailed
Implementation Support Plan (Annex 9), whose focus would be on timely implementation of the
agreed Program Action Plan (Annex 8), provision of necessary technical support, conduct of
fiduciary reviews, and verification of results including physical field visits, where appropriate.


Institutional Arrangements and Capacity

44. The three most critical stakeholders involved in implementing the proposed Program are the
MoH, the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance (HZZO), and the Agency for Quality and
Accreditation in Health Care and Social Welfare (AQAHS). In the context of the proposed

                                                     22
Program, the MoH is the primary beneficiary that will be responsible for using the funds
available through the proposed Program to support the reform and restructuring of Croatian
health care system according to priorities and directions defined in the Government Program
2012–2020. The HZZO is the main stakeholder responsible for implementing reforms that will
achieve the results targeted by the proposed Program. As the single payer in the mandatory
health insurance system, the HZZO has a central role to play in achieving the proposed Program
results in terms of collecting data and using contracting (of health facilities/GPs) and
monitoring/control/quality supervision mechanisms to implement the desired changes in the
health care system (for example, contracting and payment based on Key Performance Indicators
and Quality Indicators, stimulating ambulatory surgeries, monitoring prescription patterns,
auditing hospitals, and incentivizing GP group practices). The MoH is, however, responsible for
supervising HZZO activities and for contributions to HZZO revenues, because mandatory
insurance constitutes a part of the State Budget revenue. The MoH is currently also responsible
for managing all but one hospital. In the long term, however, once the financial rationalization of
hospitals is completed, the MoH will once again decentralize management. Finally, the AQAHS
is responsible for supporting the HZZO in ensuring the quality of contracted providers from
which the HZZO purchases mandatory health insurance services.

45. The AQAHS is national accreditation body complying with all requirements of the
international and European standard for accreditation bodies adopted in the Republic of Croatia
as the Croatian Standard HRN EN ISO/IEC 17011: 2005. AQAHS’ main contribution in this
respect is to facilitate and implement accreditation of health care institutions and ensure
standards of quality in service provision. AQAHS activities include:


          Accreditation of calibration laboratories (HRN EN ISO/IEC 17025)
          Accreditation of testing laboratories (HRN EN ISO/IEC 17025)
          Accreditation of medical laboratories (HRN EN ISO 15189)
          Accreditation of certification bodies for products (HRN EN 45011)
          Accreditation of certification bodies for quality management system (HRN EN
           ISO/IEC 17021)
          Accreditation of certification bodies for environment management system (HRN EN
           ISO/IEC 17021)
          Accreditation of certification bodies for personnel (HRN EN ISO/IEC 17024)
          Accreditation of inspection bodies (HRN EN ISO/IEC 17020)
          Accreditation of PT providers (HRN EN ISO/IEC 17043)
          Accreditation of GHG verifiers (HRN EN ISO 14065)
          Supervision of the accredited bodies
          Maintenance of e-Register of accredited bodies
          Technical support to the state administration bodies for the implementation of
           accreditation policies in the conformity assessment areas
          Concluding agreements on recognition of accreditation (MLA and MRA)
          Promotion of accreditation and education about accreditation

46. Institutional capacity in Croatia is high and not a major risk to implementation. However, a
key gap in capacity relevant to achieving the proposed Program results is the capacity to develop
and apply quality improvement guidelines and protocols. The MoH anticipates using technical
assistance to remedy this concern. A second key institutional capacity gap in this context relates
to providers’ management capacity to respond to incentives and supply-side support provided to
improve quality and efficiency under the Government Program. Relatively weak management
capacity at the provider level is indicated by the large arrears accumulated by hospitals in
Croatia. The MoH is currently addressing this issue by centralizing management control of
hospitals in order to improve their financial management and building the necessary management
capacity. If long-term management capacity is not built successfully, this could compromise the
achievement of proposed Program results.


Program Expenditure Framework analysis.

47. Estimated costs appear adequate to achieve key Program objectives; nevertheless some
of the key investments would require the absorption of EU funds. While, as mentioned
before, the estimated total cost to implement the 8-year Government Program is about EUR 409
M or HRK EUR 51 M per year (or 1.6 percent of overall public health sector spending), some
critical interventions (civil works and medical equipment) will require additional funds in order
to be implemented. While depending on EU funds create a financing risk for the Government
Program (and the proposed Program), the Program itself constitutes an opportunity to help
Government fulfilling the ex-ante conditionalities to absorb EU funds.

48. The initial steps of the Government program have created the needed momentum. The
proposed Program will help finance implementation of the first phase of 5 out of 8 priorities of
the Government Program (2012–2020). It will also help the GoC to access resources from the
EU funds while supporting the efficient use of these resources. In the absence of an EU
operational program earmarked for the health sector, the Program will help promote a shift
towards the health sector of EU funds, such as the Regional Development Program. The Program
will create conditions to support the MoH in applying (stand alone or jointly with other entities)
for EU funds and in properly implementing investments that may be financed out of the EU

supported by the Program will reduce recurrent hospital arrears and allow the reallocation of
resources currently being used to cover these arrears to finance Program activities.

50. Based on the cost benefits analysis presented below, sustainability seems not to be an
issue in the short term; nevertheless in the long term the success of the Government Program will
result in better health outcomes (greater life expectancy) and a growing demand of health
services from an aging population.


Economic Evaluation

Economic rationale for the program

51.     Croatia produces relatively good outcomes, but at a cost that is increasingly difficult to
sustain in a constrained fiscal environment. The production costs associated with the current
service delivery model in Croatia are high, and a reorganization is needed to use limited
resources more efficiently. At the same time, technological advances exert an upward pressure
on health spending while offering opportunities for efficiency if harnessed appropriately.

52. The contribution rate on wages for mandatory health insurance is not sufficient to fund the
health system at the current level of benefits, and this is a part of the impetus for the proposed
Program. The contribution rate, which was initially set at 18 percent (in 1993), was reduced
steadily over the years and in 2012 reached 13 percent. This level of contribution rate may not be
sufficient to fund the health system at the current level of benefits, but higher rates could
undermine the competitiveness of the Croatian economy. The reliance on contributions versus
other sources of public revenues to fund the system will have to be revisited periodically, since
aging increases the pressure on expenditure and is likely to lead to a shrinking of the population
that can contribute from salaries.

53.    Elements of the current service delivery model that create inefficiencies include the
following:
      Referral rates from primary care are high (25 percent), indicating that it does not play the
       role of an effective gatekeeper via early detection, prevention, and health promotion.
      A lack of high-level ambulatory diagnostic and treatment centers. Services that can be
       provided as ambulatory services with advances in technology continue to be delivered as
       inpatient services in Croatia.
      Palliative care for terminally ill patients, long-term health care for rehabilitation, and
       long-term social care for the elderly and other groups are provided in acute care hospital
       beds at high cost when they can be delivered more effectively and cheaply in low-cost
       settings.
      There is fragmentation in service delivery. The increasing incidence of co-morbidities
       makes coordination of care more important than ever before. Lack of coordination in the
       Croatian health system creates barriers to timely referrals and also gaps in, and
       overlapping of, resources.




                                                25
       The lack of clinical guidelines/care pathways contributes to the current overuse of
        technology, lack of quality control (technical audits), and missing coordination of care
        across the health system.

54.     Incentives in the payment system exacerbate these inefficiencies.
       Capitation-based payments to primary care providers create incentives to underprovide
        services and to refer patients in the absence of measures that counteract these incentives.
       Hospital payments do not include incentives to deliver services on an ambulatory basis,
        or to improve quality of care.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis

55.   Given the wide range and complexity of reforms to be supported by the Program, its economic
rationale has been foremost assessed conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis that compares some specific
services in the current service delivery model with the new proposed service delivery approaches .

The current situation compared to the situation after achieving Disbursement-Linked Indicators
(DLIs) 1 and 4

56.     DLI 1. Reduction in the total number of “acute care beds? as a result of their conversion
to “social beds,? “long-term beds,? “day care posts,? or closure. The aim of DLI 1 is to reduce
the production costs associated with service delivery by converting acute care beds into social
beds, long-term care beds, or day care posts.

57.     DLI 4. Percentage of all surgeries included in the predefined lists of elective surgeries
performed as ambulatory surgeries in the last six months and financially stimulated by HZZO
through refined contracting/provider payment mechanism. DLI 4 supports DLI 1 by
incentivizing ambulatory surgeries where these are appropriate.

58.     Table 4 displays a list of procedures that are currently performed in Croatia as inpatient
surgeries that could be provided as ambulatory services with little delay. Table 5 compares the
general current situation in Croatia to the one after the proposed Program’s implementation and
provides some evidence on the cost savings from decreasing the number of hospital beds.

2012).
(EU average = fewer than 4 per 1,000
population.)
Evidence:
Studies have shown that decreasing the number of hospital beds seems to have increased the cost of hospital care
per person treated. However, this cost increase is a consequence of implementing different admission criteria,
which emphasize treating more severe cases that will require more complex treatment and for longer periods,
(increasing the average number of days of a hospital stay).

In addition to the medical and social outcomes, the costs of day care and ambulatory surgery over inpatient
surgery are between 25 and 68 percent lower than for the same procedures carried out on an inpatient basis.



                                                       27
For instance, a World Bank study in Romania. 22 estimated that shifting approximately 15,000 beds to long-term
and social care would save approximately US$47.8 million per year, and that closing approximately 30,000 beds
would produce savings of about US$240 million per year. This calculation was based on the following
assumptions: (a) there is no change in utilization patterns, only in the number of beds; (b) annual cost per bed
equals hospital costs divided by total number of beds; (c) long-term and social care costs per bed are 60 percent
cheaper than acute hospital care; and (d) the number of acute care beds is reduced from 130,000 to 100,000.

                                            The proposed Program would support implementation of two model
                                            reshaping schemes. It is anticipated that these models would be

                                            EU structural funds.
Evidence:
This is a new idea, so there are no evaluations of similar projects from which to learn lessons. However, examples
abound at the international level of innovative patterns of care adopted in response to unit cost increases, changes
in morbidity profiles, and citizens’ expectations.
Many Western European countries have been experimenting for a number of years on emphasizing patient-
focused care based on the principles of hospital reengineering (by introducing, for example, clinical protocols,
integrated patient records, patient grouping, multidisciplinary care teams,. cross training, and decentralized
decision making). There is now a clear trend in these countries toward reducing the number of hospital beds and
transferring services to day care units. This not only has not diminished the health system’s ability to cope with
the existing workload, but has actually increased output. This was the case in England. The trend continues to the
present day and is combined with efforts to provide “integrated care under one roof.?
For decades, the Netherlands has had a Bismarckian type of health care system. The number of general hospitals
in the Netherlands dropped from about 200 in 1950 to 95 in 2009, including eight academic hospitals and two
specialized hospitals. The decline was mainly the result of regional mergers of hospitals to improve the quality of
care and/or to ensure their financial survival. Due to consolidations, the average number of beds per general
hospital significantly increased from 349 in 1980 to 498 in 2008 (in 2008 the smallest hospital had 138 beds and
the largest had 1,368 beds).a This increase was paralleled by a drop in the total number of general hospital beds
from about 60,000 beds in 1980 to approximately 42,350 beds in 2008. Despite this reduction, because the length
of hospital stay was significantly shorter, the number of patient days dropped by 41 percent, and hospital
production increased (hospital admissions grew by 143 percent) In addition, in 1990, 21 percent of hospital
admissions were dealt with in outpatient clinics compared with 46 percent in 2006.
New insurance legislation explicitly authorized health insurers to reimburse the costs of health services provided
by “independent treatment centres? that specialized in ophthalmology, dermatology, maternity and child care,
orthopaedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, radiology, and cardiology. As a result, the number of these services grew
from 31 in 2000 to almost 160 by the end of 2006. b
The same approach is now the rule in most Western European countries, as attested to by the European
Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries.
Such changes often include the long-anticipated need to design or redesign the physical environment of hospital.
This need has been confirmed by research in the Netherlands. The Dutch competition “Future Hospitals:
Competitive and Healing,? asked researchers: “which functions absolutely need to be in the core hospital building
and which functions could be located elsewhere?? The conclusion was that only a little over 50 percent of the
traditional floor area is needed, mostly for the “hot? floor c functions. Other areas such as hotel, factory, and office
functions could be located elsewhere (Netherlands Board for Health Care Institutions 2006).

                              As a consequence of this measure, the quality of the hospitals in operation will
                              improve.

                              adverse effects, and incidences of preventable specific medical events. Such a

                              provided within hospitals.
Evidence:
Health economists assert that, to maximize the population’s health status, health services should prioritize the
most cost-effective interventions. Clinical guidelines and care pathways based on evidence can give providers
advice on which treatments to offer under which circumstances and are therefore ideal tools for promoting cost-
effective clinical practice.

Care pathways are a tool to promote the best possible treatment within an existing level of resources. Several
studies have proved that they help improve patient outcomes and the quality of health services, facilitate the
continuous training of the human resource in health and reduce inequities. a While the primary reason for
implementing care pathways is improving the quality and increasing the equity of health service delivery and
patient outcomes, several studies have shown that they can also reduce length of hospital stays, decrease
unnecessary resource use, and increase patient satisfaction.b How much can be saved by introducing new or
updated care pathways varies greatly depending on the health problem. In some cases, a new care pathway can
increase costs due to the introduction of a new technology or new drugs, whereas in others (as is the case of
Croatia), it will reduce costs by mandating outpatient treatment for health problems that were previously managed
on an inpatient basis. However, in all cases, using care pathways will make it possible to carry out technical audits
and will keep down the costs of expensive technologies and drugs for which there is little or no evidence
supporting their use.
In the countries where care guidelines are regularly used , if a new treatment both improves health outcomes and
reduces costs, then clinical guidelines are updated to recommend the new treatment. If the new treatment both
reduces health outcomes and increases costs, then no change is introduced and the guideline continues to endorse
the standard treatment. However, if the new treatment is both more effective at improving health outcomes but
more costly, then policy makers must judge whether the health gains are large enough to justify the additional
cost. This is usually done by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and comparing it with a
pre-speci?ed cost-effectiveness threshold. The ICER is the difference between the mean costs of each strategy
divided by the difference in mean health outcome (the slope of the line that connects the strategies).
The evaluation of the impact of implementing care pathways is done on a case-by-case basis and is often used to
recommend a single drug or a specific surgical procedure or to define a protocol for combining several therapeutic
alternatives. These evaluations yield evidence that can be used to continuously revise the guidelines.
Sentinel surveillance. In a sentinel surveillance system, a prearranged sample of reporting sources agrees to
report all cases of defined conditions, which might indicate trends in the entire target population. When properly
implemented, these systems offer an effective method of using limited resources and enable prompt and flexible
monitoring and investigation of suspected public health problems. Examples of sentinel surveillance are networks
of private practitioners reporting cases of influenza, laboratory-based sentinel systems reporting cases of certain
bacterial infections among children, or pregnant women in prenatal care who report HIV infection in cases of
generalized epidemics where HIV is over 1 percent in the general population.c Sentinel surveillance is excellent
for detecting large public health problems, but it may be insensitive to rare events, such as the early emergence of
a new disease, because these infections may emerge anywhere in the population.

Evidence:
Heath Technology Assessment (HTA). Almost all European Member States have experienced exponential
growth in the use of health technologies in recent years (new pharmaceuticals, diagnostic procedures, and medical
equipment). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom was the first
national attempt to provide faster access to cost-effective treatments through an evidence-based review process.b
Soon afterward, most Western European countries began using HTAs to assess the costs and benefits of
introducing each new drug, piece of equipment, or procedure. The cumulative savings from implementing HTAs
is difficult to estimate, but there is a huge potential for savings to be made in Croatia. Most HTAs focus their
analysis on implementing a specific new guideline. For example, an evaluation of the “Effective Health Care
Bulletin? in England that was dedicated to the treatment of the per sistent glue ear in children was estimated to
have resulted in savings of £27 million in the four years after the new guidelines were published. c

produce savings of 10 to 90 percent compared with the original patented product depending on the different
drugs. Most European countries introduced policies to encourage generic drugs many years ago, with significant
differences in the proportion of use from country to country. The use of generic medicines is currently generating
some €25 billion in savings each year for EU health care systems. d

Centralized procurement. In Croatia, the Ministry of Health has already introduced new regulations promoting
the procurement of generic drugs and centralizing procurement using competitive tendering and framework
contracts for county hospitals. These reforms have already begun to yield savings; as a direct result of the first
round of tenders in 2012, the Ministry of Health estimated that cost savings have been HRK 187 million
(approximately US$30 million). At the same time, the average expenditure per insured individual and average
expenditure per issued prescription have decreased.

Evidence:
The costs and benefits of primary and secondary prevention have been evaluated in many different ways and with
different outcomes depending on what interventions were involved and the prevalence of the health problem.
Abundant evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of reducing the prevalence of the four main risk factors
for NCD (alcohol abuse, overweight/obesity, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use). a Several of these
interventions are primary prevention through population interventions (such as regulations to reduce tobacco
consumption), and many others are secondary prevention that target individuals (such as drugs to reduce
cholesterol and triglyceride levels).
An increased use of clinical guidelines to treat complications associated with chronic conditions can be cost-
effective. In the Netherlands, for example, an update of the clinical guidelines to treat diabetic foot complications
resulted in longer life expectancy, gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and reduced incidence of foot
complications. The lifetime costs of managing diabetic foot complications by following guideline-based care
reduced diabetic foot complications, raised survival rates, and yielded a cost per QALY gained of almost
US$25,000 and even cost savings.b

 Cost-benefit analysis

33.     Costs of the Program. As costs of the Program are considered the investment costs related to
achieving the 5 priorities of the National Health Care Strategy 2012-2020 that the Program supports (180
EUR Million from 2012 to 2017, 75 EUR Million of which are from Bank funds, and 168 EUR Million
from 2018 to 2020 from government funds).

34.     Benefits of the Program. As stated in the Program description, the 5 priorities contain an
intercorrelated cluster of interventions. Focusing on the 7 key interventions25 listed in the Program
description, the derived monetary benefits are the following.

35.      The rationalization of hospital inpatient services is linked to one of the key results of the
Program, namely the reduction of the number of inpatient hospital beds from 15,930 to 12,800 by the end
of the first phase of the Program in 2017. The expected savings related to this reduction in hospital beds
constitute the first source of monetary benefits considered in this analysis.

36.     The beneficial effect of more effective primary health care services, secondary specialized
services, extended palliative as well as long-term social care services on the one hand, and extended
Health Technology Assessments and Quality Control mechanisms on the other hand will be estimated
using the impact on population health status measured in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years

(DALYs), which represent the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years
of productive life lost due to disability.

37.      Expected cost savings due to the extended use of centralized procurement are not being taken
into account on the benefit side. The government has previously introduced regulations that promote the
procurement of generic drugs as well as the use of centralized procurement mechanisms. These results
have yielded estimated savings of approximately HRK 187 Million in 2012 (approximately 25 EUR
Million), which indicates the huge potential for cost savings from procurement reforms in Croatia. The
Program includes interventions aimed at assuring that a higher percentage of public health spending
related to procurement is made through centralized procurement and framework contracts, but the benefits
from these additional reform interventions are hard to disentangle from previous initiatives. Hence, the
(likely considerable) cost savings attributable to further use of centralized procurement are not considered
in this cost-benefit analysis.

38.     Likewise, the monitoring of doctors’ prescription patterns which is part of the Program reforms
and the cost savings it generates is not taken into account as a source of benefits in this analysis. The
estimation of those benefits considered is based on conservative assumptions.

39.       The assumptions used in the cost-benefits analysis are listed below:

          Basic discount rate. Financial costs and financial savings are discounted at 3 percent (the
           average inflation estimated for the 2013-2017 period.26) to account for future inflation. A higher
           discount rate of 6 percent is also applied to verify the sensitivity of the results to this assumption.

          Period of time considered. The cost-benefits of the interventions are calculated over the 2012-
           2017 period (for which the Bank funds are used) as well as over the 2012-2020 period.

          Population covered. In general is assumed that all interventions will be implemented
           nationwide. Therefore, the interventions will affect health results for the entire population,
           (around 4.27 million people in 2012) or the efficiency level of all facilities. Population growth
           up to the year 2020 is based on the WB HNP Statistics.

          Expected disbursements of investments. When discounting the financial costs of the Program,
           it is assumed that the funds provided by the Bank are disbursed according to the estimated
           disbursement schedule (see Program Financing Data27). All own funds contributed by the
           government are assumed to have been disbursed upon Program start in 2012 for the sake of a
           more conservative estimate of the Program’s NPV and IRR. Likewise, the additional
           government funds (168 EUR Million) for the period 2018-2020 are assumed to be completely
           disbursed in 2018.

          Benefits of reforms beyond 2020. Although the benefits from the Program will likely persist
           beyond Program completion in 2020, benefits beyond the year 2020 are not accounted for in this
           analysis due to the increasing uncertainty about the counterfactual scenario without the Program
           and recurrent costs from the Program interventions. This approach assures that the estimated
           benefits are conservative.

         Due to the intercorrelation of the supported interventions and the P4R nature of the project
          (making disbursements for a given intervention less related to the actual cost of implementing
          this particular intervention), the NPV and IRR are only calculated once for the whole package of
          interventions.

 Expected Benefits from the Transformation of Hospital Inpatient to Outpatient Services

40.     Table A4.1 states some of the evidence for the empirically well-documented fact that performing
a wide array of procedures on an outpatient instead of an inpatient basis leads to considerable cost
savings. The Program tries to capitalize on this opportunity for costs savings. PDO indicator 1 is the
reduction of the number of hospital beds from 15,930 to 12,800 by 2017. Based on this PDO indicator,
the benefits from the transformation of hospital services is considered.

41.    The calculation of the benefits from the transformation of inpatient into outpatient services is
based on the following additional assumptions:

         There is no change in utilization patterns due to the reforms, only in the number of beds.
         The annual cost per bed equals hospital costs divided by total number of beds.
         Long-term and social care costs per bed are 40 percent cheaper than acute hospital care.28
         All beds are transformed into long-term and social care beds, no bed simply ceases to exist
          (making the obtained estimates of cost savings yet more conservative).
         The counterfactual in the absence of the Program is that the number of inpatient hospital beds
          does not change until 2020.

42.     The benefits deriving from the above-listed interventions are estimated using the impact on
population health status measured in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from NCDs. The
additional assumptions made in the economic analysis of these interventions are:

         Reduction in DALYs: DALYs, which represent the sum of years of potential life lost due to
          premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability, have a built-in age

                      weighting and discount rate of 3 percent. The reduction in DALYs upon Program completion in
                      2020 from the integrated interventions supported by the Program is conservatively set at 0.3
                      percent across all NCDs. The reductions in diseases from the interventions of the project
                      (Increased access to high-quality MCH and NCD services) took the conservative values for
                      interventions from the DCP-2.

                     Counterfactual Scenario for DALYs: The baseline DALYs were calculated for the various
                      conditions from WHO estimates for the Eastern and Central Asia region, adjusted for the
                      population size of the project (4.27 million people) and the age structure of Croatia (from the
                      WB HNP Statistics). These include the forward projections of DALYs averted (that is, healthy
                      life years gained) from 2013 to 2020.

                      Valuation of DALYs used a very simple rule. Each DALY saved is valued at yearly per capita
                      income (using a starting value of about EUR 10,000 for 2012). The Disease Control Priorities
                      Project and Copenhagen Consensus guidelines mention three times per capita income as a still
                      conservative estimate for the value of each DALY averted.29 Studies of valuation of life in the
                      United States even utilize much higher values for a year of life that would produce more extreme

                     Discount Rates for DALYs: The monetary value of future stream of health benefits (i.e. annual
                      DALYs saved) is discounted at 3 percent (a higher rate of 6 percent is used for the sensitivity
                      analysis), per guidelines from WHO and the Disease Control Priorities Project.30

                     GDP Growth: An annual growth rate of 1 percent in real per capita GDP is used, being more
                      conservative than the estimates provided by the IMF31.

 Expected overall benefits from the interventions

43. Finally, Table A4.9. presents the Net Present Value (NPV) and the estimated Internal Rate of Return
    (IRR) of the whole set of interventions. The sum of costs and benefits (i.e. the NPV of the
    interventions) is largely positive and the estimated IRR ranges between 4.85 and 9.83 percent
    considering only the first Program phase 2012-2017 and between 17.38 and 24.52 percent for the full
    Program duration 2012-2020, depending on the inflation used, which clearly shows the positive
    development impact of the proposed Program.

Program Technical Risks

44.    The wide scope of the Government’s intended health sector reforms as articulated in the
Government Program 2012–2020 was identified as a key technical risk to the success of the
proposed Program. To mitigate these risks, the proposed Program supports a delimited set of
reforms that are the focus of the Government’s Five-year Program. Hospital participation in the
Ministry of Health’s centralized procurement reforms is voluntary, and low participation may
have jeopardized the success of this critical element in the proposed Program. This has not
proven to be an important risk. So far, all but one county (Zagreb) has elected not to participate
in the Ministry of Health’s financial consolidation efforts, which gives the Ministry financial
control over hospitals in arrears. This, in turn, has resulted in a high rate of participation by
hospitals.

45.     A key potential risk to the proposed Program arises from the fact that full implementation
of the hospital rationalization master plan requires considerably more resources than those
available through the proposed Program. It is anticipated that EU Structural Funds could finance
this resource gap. The Development of Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning

                                                  38
Project supported technical assistance to develop a hospital rationalization master plan, and this
will enable the Ministry of Health to develop specific proposals for funding that can be
submitted to EU Structural Funds. The hospital rationalization plan will be completed only in
December 2013. In the interim, however, the Ministry of Finance has expressed its commitment
to support the Ministry of Health to meet interim funding needs.

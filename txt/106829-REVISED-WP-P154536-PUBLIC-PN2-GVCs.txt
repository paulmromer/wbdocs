Nepal’s National Trade Integration Strategy 2015 (NTIS 2015) recognizes the importance of value chains
for export development and includes as one of its goals to “identify key binding constraints to maximize
the benefits of participation in increasingly important regional and global value chains” (NTIS 2015). This
note identifies key obstacles faced by firms to better integrate into value chains based on data analysis
and interviews with firms in key export sectors in Nepal and builds on that analysis to provide policy
recommendations based on international experiences with trade reforms and good practices observed
elsewhere. Policy recommendations are linked to export sectors prioritized by the NTIS 2015 and,
although mainly cross-cutting in nature, also provide granular information like a list of products with high
potential for increased trade with the northern states of India.

This note analyzes five stylized facts that characterize Nepal’s integration into regional and global value
chains. First, Nepal could be better integrated into value chains. Even though its exports have high import
content, Nepal is not a good supplier to regional and international value chains and is largely missing on
the growing trade in intermediate products. Second, imported inputs are key for the vast majority of
exporters and greater use and variety of imported intermediary inputs is correlated with higher exports,
diversification of destination markets and higher quality of exports. Third, restrictive policies towards FDI
compound the challenges the country faces in attracting foreign investment that can be crucial for
increasing productivity, accessing new markets, and upgrading the quality of exports. Fourth, although
there are some exports of high quality products, the average quality of most agricultural products
prioritized by the NTIS 2015 is average. Finally, recurring import rejections in developed countries could
pose a reputational risk for Nepal’s exports and result in lower export prices and higher costs for
exporting.

Based on the analysis presented on the first part, the note identifies four policy areas that present
opportunities to spur export growth and increase participation in regional and global value chains. First,
Nepal should facilitate access to imported inputs by reducing tariffs on key raw materials and intermediate
products. Second, efforts should be made to develop linkages for Nepalese firms to integrate into value
chains in northern Indian states bordering Nepal. Third, strengthening national infrastructure and services
that support export compliance with international standards will boost competitiveness and facilitate
entry into international value chains. Fourth, a strategy to reposition selected export products on high
quality low volume segments will help Nepal increase exports.

The report is structured in four sections. The first section is an introduction. The second section presents
five stylized facts about Nepal’s exports that are related to value chain participation. The third section
proposes some policy recommendations to address the issues highlighted in the analysis. The last section
concludes.

    1. Introduction

The rise of global value chains (GVCs) is one of the most important transformation in global trade and
investment occurred in the last decades. Once concentrated among a few large economies, global flows
of goods, services, and capital now reach an ever larger number of economies worldwide. Falling transport
costs due to important innovations such as containerization, lower trade costs achieved both through a
general reduction in tariffs worldwide and by the proliferation of trade and investment agreements, the
ICT revolution, and trends in global business to outsource “non-core” business functions paired with a
drive towards cutting costs on goods produced for export, have led to “second unbundling” of
globalization in the 1990s and 2000s (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2015).

Nepal’s National Trade Integration Strategy 2015 (NTIS 2015) was developed with the objective of
enhancing the contribution of the trade sector to growth and to overcome the constraints and challenges
associated with trade development and export promotion. The NTIS 2015 prioritizes twelve export
potential sectors/products, nine related to goods (cardamom, ginger, tea, medicinal and aromatic plants,
fabrics and textiles, leather, footwear, pashmina, and carpets) and three to services (semi-skilled and
skilled professional services, IT & BPO and IT engineering, tourism).1 The NTIS 2015 recognizes the
importance of GVCs for export development and includes as one of its goals to “identify key binding
constraints to maximize the benefits of participation in increasingly important regional and global value
chains” (NTIS 2015).

This note explores some stylized facts about Nepal’s integration in GVCs and identifies policy
recommendations in cross-cutting areas that relate to most of the export sectors prioritized by the NTIS
2015. These recommendations are not meant to be specific to individual value chains or products and are
based on the challenges identified through data analysis and interviews with firms in key export sectors
and based on good practices observed elsewhere. The report is structured in three sections beside the
introduction. The second section presents five stylized facts about Nepal’s exports that are related to GVC
participation. The third section proposes some policy recommendations to address the issues highlighted
in the analysis. The last section concludes.

    2. Nepal’s Exports – Five Stylized Facts

Fact 1. Nepal could be better integrated into global value chains as a supplier of intermediate goods that
are used in other countries’ exports

A country’s level of participation in GVCs can in part be assessed based on both its forward and backward
integration. Forward integration, or indirect value added (IVA), refers to a country’s share of value added
embodied in other countries’ exports – i.e. producing intermediates that you export to other countries,
who will then add further value and export them as finished products or further stage intermediates.
Backward integration, or foreign value added (FVA), is the share of foreign value added embodied in a
country’s exports – i.e. intermediate inputs imported from other countries that you then add value to and
export as finished products or further stage intermediates. Backward integration provides access to
quality inputs, which contributes to downstream competitiveness; it also has significant potential to
deliver productivity spillovers through access to global frontier technologies. As such, backward

 The NTIS 2015 also highlights other sector with potential for the country including coffee, fruit juice, ready-made
garments, semi-precious gems and stones as well as mentions products that are a continuation of the NTIS 2010,
namely, honey, lentils, instant noodles, handmade paper, silver and jewelry, iron and steel, and wood products.

                                                                                                                  3
integration tends to be particularly important for developing countries as it links to a number of measures
of structural transformation. Similarly, forward integration is an indicator of integration into value chains
and also provides opportunities to benefit from technology spillovers.

An international comparison shows that Nepal has the lowest participation in GVCs through
downstream linkages compared with other countries in the region (Figure 2). Less than a fifth of
exported domestic value added from Nepal ends up in third countries’ exports which is related to Nepal’s
relative specialization in final good exports in both agricultural (tea, ginger, coffee, cardamom) and
manufacturing sectors (apparel and other textile goods like carpets and pashminas). On the other hand,
the share of foreign value added in Nepal’s exports is the highest in South Asia doubling that of Pakistan
and Bangladesh and even higher than India’s. The cross-border trade with India and high reliance on inputs
from this country due to the landlockness of Nepal could be behind this trend. Some of the most important
export products to India - like cement, steel products and industrial textiles - exhibit low domestic value
addition as these industries set up in Nepal to import intermediate products and re-export them after
minimal transformation basically taking advantage of large differences in tariffs for final products between
India and Nepal (Table 2). However, other export industries like instant noodles, biscuits and agro-
processing seem to incorporate more local value added into their exports to India.

Nepal’s overall participation in GVCs is low although more balanced than its comparators. The GVC
participation index combines the measures of forward and backward integration, indicating the extent to
which a country participates in vertically integrated production (Koopman et al. 2010). The higher the
foreign value added in gross exports and the higher the value of inputs exported to third countries and
used in their exports, the higher the participation value. Nepal shows the lowest GVC participation among
comparators. The decomposition of the GVC participation index into its upstream and downstream
component is consistent with Nepal having a low participation in GVCs as a supplier final goods but with
a high use of imported inputs for its exports. Countries that are more integrated into GVCs like Malaysia,
Thailand show higher levels of participation and higher levels of participation through upstream linkages
– which reflect a high use of imports in their exports.

Fact 2. Imported raw materials and intermediate inputs are key for the performance, quality and
diversification of exporting firms

Imported inputs are key for the vast majority of exporters and especially for some products highlighted
by the NTIS 2015. More than ninety percent of Nepalese exporters directly import some of the products
necessary for production of exports. Several industries prioritized by the NTIS 2015 rely on significant
imports of a variety of raw materials and intermediate inputs for growth. For example, footwear exporters
import more than twenty raw materials (leather, glue, soles, accessories, etc.) mainly from India, China,
and Thailand, pashmina exporters import wool and silk from China and India, and hand-woven carpet
manufacturers source most of their wool, silk and dyes from New Zealand, China and Switzerland,
respectively.

The ability to source inputs at competitive prices irrespective of origin could help firms become more
competitive in international markets. In most developing countries, imported intermediate inputs are of
higher quality than domestic varieties and embody technology and knowledge that leads to higher firm
productivity and improved quality of final products. Since imported inputs enhance firm productivity, they
also play a role for firm export performance. Furthermore, in manufacturing industries linked to GVCs like
apparel and footwear, in which the quality of the final product depends largely on the quality of the inputs,
lead buying firms often directly source the material form a small group of preferred suppliers which
highlights the importance of facilitating exporters access to inputs from anywhere in the world.

In Nepal, greater use and variety of imported intermediary inputs is correlated with higher exports,
diversification of destination markets and higher quality of exports. We analyzed the impact of firms’
use of greater number and varieties of imported inputs on export performance measures using firm level
data for 2011-2014 (Annex 1). The results reveal significantly higher export values, larger number of
destinations, and relatively higher product quality than average for exporters that import more products,
more varieties, and a larger share of imports from outside the region. For example, firms that import more
than 30% of intermediates from outside members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) have 16.8% larger export values, export to 40% more destinations, and have unit values that are
10% higher on average than other firms. These estimates provide some evidence that the foreign

technology embodied in imported intermediate inputs and their higher sophistication have a beneficial
effect for the exporter performance in Nepal.

Fact 3. Nepal faces challenges to attract FDI due to restrictive policies and risks inherent to the country

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is crucial to improve competitiveness of manufacturing and services
sectors in Nepal. FDI is crucial for accessing new markets, upgrading the quality of the export basket, and
create more and better jobs, and ultimately to create and sustain prosperity. FDI has been considered a
catalyst for growth and development due to possible spillovers to the local economy, especially in
countries with low capital accumulation. Such spillovers can range from innovation (through faster
transfer of know-how and state-of-the-art technologies), increases in productivity, sophistication and
competitiveness, and a broader product choice for consumers, among others.

Restrictive policies towards FDI compound the challenges that small landlocked countries like Nepal
face to attract FDI. At less than 1% of GDP, Nepal’s FDI inflows are the lowest among comparator countries
in relative terms (Figure 5). Although this result could be partially explained by perceived risks that firms
face operating in the country, it is clear that the investment regime in Nepal is more restrictive than other
countries with similar income per capita as measured by the Investment Freedom Index2 (Figure 6).
Among the most salient restrictions affecting foreign investment in the country are the cumbersome
processes on the repatriation of funds and the lengthy processes needed to hire foreign workers.
Regarding the former, while the law does provide foreign investors the right to repatriate funds related
to foreign investment, in practice repatriation is difficult and obtaining approvals is a lengthy process.
(World Bank 2015b).

Entry barriers to foreign investment include foreign ownership limitations, sector caps, a long negative
list and restrictions in non-equity modes of investment. Although Nepal has allowed fully foreign

  The Investment Freedom Index evaluates a variety of restrictions that are typically imposed on investments like
different rules for foreign and domestic investment; access to foreign exchange; restrictions on payments, repatriation,
transfers, and capital transactions; in some, certain industries are closed to foreign investment.

                                                                                                                      6
ownership in most sectors, it retained a foreign ownership limit of 51% in some selected sectors, such as
legal, accounting and engineering services and imposed an even lower foreign participation limit in
banking and finance. Additionally, despite eliminating the minimum investment requirement of US$
200,000, the new Foreign Investment Policy (FIP) significantly expanded the negative list to include
poultry, fishery, print and electronic media which in practice limits the amount of foreign investment
entering Nepal and constrains the ability of important sectors of the economy, including manufacturing,
to attract FDI. Restrictions in non-equity modes of investment, such as franchising, in which there is
significant technology, training and skills transfer, face additional delays and costs during entry and
operations in Nepal. In particular, slow and arbitrary approval processes, dual registration procedures,
delays in trade mark registration, greater difficulties in remitting royalties and technical fees, are among
several obstacles faced by these type of investments. (World Bank 2015b).

Fact 4. Quality upgrading is needed especially in agricultural products highlighted in the NTIS

The quality of most agricultural products prioritized by the NTIS 2015 is average or low. Figure 7 show
the relative quality of Nepal’s exports of tea and coffee compared to all other countries that exported
those products to Germany in 2013. The x-axis plots the position of each country’s exports from the lowest
to the highest in quality (unit value) with the highest to the right and the y-axis indicates the average unit
value (US$ per kg) obtained by exports from each country. For both coffee and tea, Nepal’s exports are
positioned halfway through the quality distribution with an average unit price that is approximately 40%
of that of the top exporting country. As a major producer of agricultural exports, Nepal has the
opportunity to expand its agricultural exports by rising the value of the products it currently exports –
especially since the quality of some important agricultural export products is lagging in the most important
export markets.

                       A dual quality distribution is another important characteristic of some agricultural exports in Nepal.
                       Figure 8 shows the relative unit values of Nepali exports of tea and coffee to different destinations ordered
                       from the lowest in the left to the highest in the right. Even though the relative unit values of these products
                       are only average in international markets, there seems to be a dual price structure in which some firms
                       export high-volume low-price products (mainly to India) while other firms manage to export low-volume
                       high-price exports to other destinations (EU, US, Japan). However, the presence of exporters that rely on
                       high quality niche segments for growth is not exclusive to the agricultural sector as anecdotal evidence
                       suggests that some ready-made garments and pashmina producers in the country specialize in fulfilling
                       high quality small orders.

Import rejections at the border are a rough indicator of compliance capacity and can highlight areas in the
quality infrastructure that need to be improved. If a country has high rejection rates in all markets for all
or most of the commodities they export, these suggests systemic deficiencies and the need to strengthen
their overall compliance capacities or quality infrastructure. Similarly, if a country faces substantial import
rejections in particular markets, this possibly indicates challenges to comply with specific technical
regulations in specific export markets.

Nepal has a relatively few cases of import rejections in the main developed countries for which reliable
data exist. It is worth highlighting, however, that the number of import rejection per US$1 million of
agrifood imports is low on average in these countries (0.019 rejections per US$1 million of imports) and
that Nepali exports to these destinations are already low. The products that face the highest rejections
are processed food and medicinal herbs and supplements, two sectors highlighted in the NTIS and as a
result it could be harder to consolidate these products in international markets. Import rejections are due
to several reasons possibly related to poor handling of products before shipping (e.g. aflatoxin and
decomposing/unfit foods) or to lack of standard compliance (e.g. labelling/misbranding, absence of
approved drug application). These patterns suggest that the compliance problems faced by Nepal are not
commodity-specific but are across the board.

Recurring import rejections could pose a serious reputational risk for Nepal’s exports and result in lower
export prices and higher costs for exporters. Joujean and Le Vernoy (2012) found a negative relationship
between unit prices and refusals on export markets – a clear indication that a country’s reputation in
international markets suffer if it fails to comply with import regulations. Systematic violation of import
standards and subsequent rejection could also increase the cost of exporting for domestic exporters. For
example, whenever a country of firm is found repeatedly violating US regulations, the FDA issues alerts
and implements procedures that result in 100% sampling process of products from that particular country
for as long as the alert is active even if corrective actions have been put in place. Because the burden of
proof that a product is safe for human consumption changes to the exporter, this creates new costs in the
form of new testing or certifications that had to be procured by the exporter (Buzby at. al. 2008).

                       Policy Option 1. Facilitate access to imported inputs by reducing tariffs on key raw materials and
                       intermediate products after carefully considering the impact on fiscal revenues

                       Non-trivial tariff duties are levied on key inputs imported by export sectors highlighted by the NTIS
                       2015. Figure 9 shows in the y-axis the most-favored nation (MFN) duties charged for the key imported
                       inputs used by exporters in some of the priority sectors in the NTIS 2015. For example, some of the main
                       inputs for the production of pashminas, animal fine hair (HS 510211) and woolen yarn (HS 510610), pay a
                       tariff of 5%, while plastic packing materials (HS 392390) and fruit concentrate (HS 200899) – two key
                       inputs for the production of fruit juices - pay tariffs of 25 and 15%, respectively. While direct exporters
                       may be entitled to a duty drawback (that still entails filing costs), many firms that ‘apparently’ sell to the
                       domestic market may effectively be exporting since they are selling to tourists in Nepal. Pierola et. al
                       (2015) show that that firms exposed to higher tariff and non-tariff measures import fewer inputs and
                       exhibit lower import variety.

The government should reduce or eliminate custom duties on products that are key for the prioritized
sectors after carefully analyzing its fiscal implications. Because tariffs represent an important share of
fiscal revenues (21.7% in 2013), a selective reduction of tariff duties for the most important inputs used
by exporters would need to be accompanied by a detailed analysis of its effect on fiscal revenues and aim
to be as revenue neutral as possible. In order to facilitate this prioritization, Table 2 provides the list of
the twenty most important products imported by exporters. Additionally, the government should review
its policy of levying of tariff on import of industrial raw materials on basis of domestic sales or export
whenever the distinction between export and domestic sales is arbitrary, as argued above. For example,
pashmina producers pay 5% tariff on yarn is they sell the product in domestic market and only 1% if they
export but distinction between selling locally and exporting is artificial as 60% of domestic sales of
pashminas goes to tourists – effectively being exported.

Although tariff reduction for key inputs would boost the competitiveness of exporting firms, it could
also change the incentives to export in some sectors. A reduction of tariffs in intermediate inputs without
a corresponding reduction of tariffs for final goods would increase the effective rate of protection afforded
to final goods that use those intermediate inputs. Hence, the tariff rationalization exercise should also
take into consideration the effect on this increased effective protection granted to domestic value
addition and how it might impact firms’ decisions to sell domestically or enter export markets.

 Box 1. Tariff Policy Reform in Pakistan

                                                                                                                     11
    Even within a highly restrictive region, Pakistan stands out with one of the highest simple average tariffs
    in South Asia at 14.3% in FY 12/13 which is more than twice the level found in other regions of the
    world. High import tariffs shield Pakistan’s domestic producers from international competition and
    prevent access to cheap imported inputs. Pakistan’s tariff structure increased in complexity after 2004
    with the introduction of new statutory duty rates, the use of additional and regulatory duties, and the
    multiplication of statutory regulatory orders (SROs). Furthermore, because SROs apply to some firms
    in selected industries, this results in an anti-competitive and highly discriminatory business
    environment. The seven major customs-related SROs affected 25% of imports and generated revenue
    losses of about Rs. 100 billion (42% of collected customs duties) in FY 2012-13.

    The World Bank provided support to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to analyze the tariff structure,
    quantify the revenue implications of several reform scenarios and come up with plans to rationalize the
    tariff structure and phase out some of the most important SROs. In particular, two sets of actions were
    applied in parallel: (i) a 3-year Tariff Rationalization Plan that will reduce the number of statutory tariff
    rates from eight to four by FY 16/17, with priority given to reducing tariffs on capital and intermediate
    goods. (ii) a 3-year complementary plan phasing out SROs that aims at removing distortions and
    levelling the playing field for all domestic producers.

    After an iterative process that discussed the several scenarios for tariff duty reduction, FBR agreed to
    reduce the number of statutory tariff rates and their dispersion. Changes to the tariff schedule
    introduced in the last two budgets brought the number of standard tariff slabs to five (2, 5, 10, 15, 20
    percent) by reducing the customs duty for 341 tariff lines from 30% to 25% in FY14/15 and then
    reducing custom duties for 1,454 tariff lines from 25% to 20% in FY 15/16. As a result, 95% of tariff lines
    now lie between 2% and 20% and both the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (standard
    deviation over mean) declined from 11.9 to 10.7 and from 0.82 to 0.80, respectively. Additionally, the
    simple average tariff declined from 14.5% to 13.4% between FY 13/14 and FY 15/16.



Policy Option 2. Exploit the potential of regional value chains by developing linkages with manufacturing
firms in bordering states in Northern India

Manufacturing exports to India are concentrated in a handful of final goods with little value addition. A
few products within a handful of sectors dominate Nepal exports to India. Figure 10 shows that about half
of exports to India are accounted by steel products3 (25%) and synthetic yarn and fabrics4 (23.1%). In fact,
twenty five products belonging to the ten sectors shown in Figure 10 represent about 80% of exports to
India in 2011-2014. Little domestic value addition is one of the characteristics of these products. For
example, since Nepal does not produce iron or steel, exporters import steel and roll it into final steel
products (TMT bars) that are subsequently exported to India. Similarly, since there is no domestic
production of the main raw materials for synthetic yarn (oil), textile exporter import plastic pellets or yarn
and transform them into fabrics that are re-exported to India.

A few large firms dominate most important exporting sectors to India. Figure 11 shows the share of
exports to India accounted by the top three biggest exporters in each of the ten export sector described
above. Remarkably, in only three sectors (Synthetic yarn – HS 54, Chemicals – HS 38, and Plastic products
– HS 39) the market share of the thee biggest firms is under 80 percent while in some sectors (Synthetic
fabrics – HS 55, Fruit juices – HS 20, Footwear – HS 64, and Metals (copper) – HS 74) the market share of
those firms is equal or close to 100 per cent.

The manufacturing sector in northern Indian states could represent an opportunity to start exporting
intermediate goods for Nepal. Although high costs of transport and energy, inadequate provision of
public goods and low levels of investment reduce Nepal’s ability to participate in global value chains, firms
in neighboring Indian states could provide an opportunity for Nepali exporters to enter into regional value
chains by providing them with intermediate inputs. Table 3 shows the top 25 non-hydrocarbon5 imported
inputs by manufacturing firms in North Indian states bordering Nepal (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim,
Uttarakhand and West Bengal). Two issues are worth highlighting. First, Nepal exports to India as a whole
seem to be a mismatch for the manufacturing imports structure in Northern India: only 3 of the top 50
exported products to India belong in Table 3 (refined cooper, flat rolled steel, and ferrous waste and
scrap). Second, despite this mismatched export and import structures, there are some opportunities for
Nepali firms to supply some of these inputs as the country already exports significant amounts of
chemicals, articles of vulcanized rubber, soybean oil, natural rubber, and oxometallic salts that are among
the most imported intermediate inputs in neighboring states.

More evidence is needed to understand the elements that constraint firms in Nepal to fulfill the demand
for industrial products in Northern India. Given the unfulfilled potential for Nepali firms to supply some
products to Northern India, there is the need to understand the reasons that explain the absence of Nepali
exporter in those regional value chains in order to propose policy measures to address these issues.

  Hydrocarbon products – mainly oil and coal – represent about a quarter of imported inputs by manufacturing firms
in North Indian states.

stakeholders like the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry could provide more insights into
the potential issues that prevent exporters from supplying these regional value chains (e.g. inability to
supply required quality, large size orders, lack of information, etc).

Policy Option 3. Improve the National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) to boost competitiveness and facilitate
entry into GVCs

Increased compliance with quality and safety standards might allow Nepal to take full advantage of
favorable market access in developed countries. Access to large scale international markets for
agricultural products can contribute to creating jobs in rural areas and reduce poverty. Nepal has
favorable access to developed markets like the US, EU and Japan for agricultural products (in which more
than ninety percent of tariff lines do not pay customs duties). However, the inability of exporters to
comply with stringent sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) could be preventing it from taking
advantage of its preferential access.



                                                                                                          14
Nepal’s quality infrastructure capacity is low compared to similar countries. The Trade Standards
Compliance Capacity Indices (TSCCI) focus on the ability of countries to perform the key functions needed
for compliance with technical regulations and standards with a specific focus on its relevance for the
country’s participation in international trade (UNIDO 2015)6. Table 4 shows the rankings for Nepal and
benchmark countries across the ten compliance functions covered by the indices. The results suggest that
Nepal has weak capacity across the board and the lowest capacity compared with countries in the region
(Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and landlocked countries with substantial agricultural exports
(Rwanda and Uganda). Nepal is placed in the lowest quintile for food safety capacity and in the second
lowest quintile for six of the ten indices including standardization, technical regulations, metrology, and
certification, among others.

Inadequate national quality infrastructure exacerbates some of the disadvantages that Nepal faces as
a landlocked country. Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures contribute significantly to trade time
and costs along the Kathmandu-Kolkata corridor. Anecdotal evidence suggest that import authorities in
India will occasionally send samples to laboratories in Kolkata for testing because SPS certificates granted
in Nepal are not recognized internationally. Nepal’s current SPS system has major capacity gaps and
weaknesses in WTO compliance, namely: (i) the SPS system is not risk-based; (ii) the food control system
is mainly focused on quality requirements, not on food safety requirements; (iii) SPS agencies and
laboratories suffer from frequent rotation of staff; (iv) insufficient capacity in plant pest surveillance and

  The TSCCI assess the relative performance of 49 countries across 10 capacity areas related to the overarching policy
and regulatory framework, ability to promulgate standards and technical regulations, and the status of metrology,
testing, inspection, certification, and accreditation services. Relative scores are grouped into quintiles with the first
quintile corresponds to the weakest capacity and the fifth quintile to the strongest capacity.

                                                                                                                      15
diagnostics; (v) no capacity to control pesticides; (vi) SPS import inspection is hardly in place and
ineffective; and (vii) there is at present no testing capacity and accreditation for food safety parameters
in microbiology, pesticide residues, veterinary drug residues, heavy metals, other pollutants and
mycotoxins (World Bank 2015c).

Nepal should invest in strengthening services that support export compliance with international
standards. Building capacity in institutions charged with inspection and sanitary standards and
strengthening the capability and reliability of infrastructure for the control of SPS - especially laboratory
infrastructure, analytical testing capabilities and investment on inspection facilities - is critical to enhance
the ability of exporters to comply with SPS regulations and reduce rejection rates at the border. For most
countries, improving the national quality infrastructure (NQI) entails a broad policy effort that might
require investment in national standards institutes, microbiology and chemical testing laboratories,
national metrology institute, and national accreditation certification capacity to certify enterprises for
international certificates (e.g. ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 22000), among others (ITC 2011). However,
information gathered during interviews and additional research indicate that two targeted interventions
could have a great impact in compliance with international standards: standards harmonization and
international accreditation.

Nepal should harmonize domestic standards to international ones for products with export potential
or at least for those highlighted by the NTIS 2015. There are several instances in which product standards
developed by Nepali authorities do not fulfill international standards either because their limits do not
comply with international ones or because domestic standards do not include some parameters required
in international markets. The misalignment of domestic and international standards for export products
limits their growth potential and, in some cases, exclude exports from specific markets. For example,
mandatory standards have been adopted for lentils but there is a need to harmonize them with
international standards (Codex) by incorporating maximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticide residues,
heavy metals, mycotoxins and other contaminants (NTIS 2015). Likewise, in the case of honey, standards
set by the NBSM in terms of moisture content, sugar content, water insoluble solids, among others, are
below European and international (Codex) standards which severely limits the number of destinations
into which honey can be exported (GIZ 2015). Because the costs of compliance with more stringent
international standards might be high for firms focused on the domestic market, the harmonization of
domestic standards should target only products that are mainly exported or have export potential.

Support the upgrade in technical competence of testing laboratories for international recognition
(accreditation). The capacity of laboratories to test and certify goods for developed markets is uneven.
The lack of internationally accredited laboratories that can issue internationally recognized sanitary
certificates and test reports makes exporting more costly. Most key agricultural products sold by Nepal
are sent to other countries for testing and certification due to weak capacity to test, certify or accredit in
the country, and hence increasing the cost of each product and making it less competitive in the global
market. The capacity of public laboratories to get accredited should also be improved. For instance, some
regional labs of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC) conduct test for
pesticides MRLs needed for key export products but are not internationally accredited which sometimes
result in shipments held at the border with India until further test are done in Kolkata.

A comprehensive approach to capacity building in several institutions dealing with quality
infrastructure are needed. As previously mentioned, Nepal’s lack of capacity to issue credible

                                                                                                             16
phytosanitary certificates is having a detrimental effect on the country’s exports. By international
standards, plant pest screening and issuance of phytosanitary certificates always needs backup from crop
pest surveillance, a reference laboratory, and inspection at production and/or packing locations. Nepal
does not have a national reference laboratory for diagnostics of plant pests and diseases and its pest
surveillance methodology and coverage are deficient. Hence, without a comprehensive plan to address
these deficiencies, investment in screening capacity at the border is of limited use (World Bank 2015c).

 Box 2. Country Responses to NQI Challenges: The Case of Uganda



 In 1999, the European Union banned all fish imports from Uganda due to a series of incidents in which
 export shipments were contaminated with microbiological agents and to the inability of the national
 authorities to guarantee the safety of fish exports. Uganda turned this threat into an opportunity and
 successfully improved the quality management of its fish sector by changing processing practices and
 adopting certification processes that helped ensure safety and quality for the final consumers of Nile
 perch.



 The pressure brought upon by the potential loss of the lucrative EU market provided major incentives
 for stakeholders through the whole value chain to face the problems affecting the sector. The members
 of the Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters Association (UFPEA), European fish importers, the
 government of Uganda and the EU worked together and took action to deal with the microbiological
 contamination issues. The government set up several working group meetings with the participation of
 UFPEA to design an action plan which resulted in major initiatives to restructure the government
 agencies responsible for managing Uganda’s certification process, match its certification process to the
 EurepGAP (due to the importance of the EU market for fish exports), streamline regulations and
 concentrate authority in one department (Department of Fisheries) for certification, restructuring its
 guidelines and monitoring and inspection systems, and training of inspectors.



 At the time of EureGAP certification adoption, no laboratory in Uganda could performs the biochemical
 tests to check for pesticide residue and samples were send to Belgium for testing. A Belgium private
 laboratory recognized that there was sustained business for them in Uganda, and opened a laboratory
 in Kampala which helped streamline the certification process and reduce costs for exporters. Because
 many exporters wanted to add another layer of quality standards and demonstrate that they were
 serious about quality, UFPEA adopted a voluntary code of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and
 seeks HACCP and ISO 9001 certification for its members with support from USAID and the EU. The result
 is a more competitive industry than its neighbors and one that has gained a reputation for good quality
 in Europe.

Policy Option 4. Reposition selected products on high quality segments

Improving the quality of Nepali exports should be one of the pillars of a strategy aimed at reigniting
export growth in Nepal. The previous section showed that quality upgrading is needed for products
prioritized in the NTIS 2015 and that a small number of exporters is already able to export high-quality
products to developed countries. Nepal can grow its exports by shipping a greater quantities of products
fetching low unit values like is the case with the majority of exports of NTIS 2015 agricultural products to
India. Another way the country can increase the absolute amount of exports is by improving the quality
of exports and thus the value of exports per unit. The ability to guarantee consistent quality will also build
competitive advantage and loyalty from importers because it reduces the risk of trade disruptions due to
erratic and irregular quality. By reducing risks, it also allows for investment in value chain development,
upgrading and value addition.

Specialization in low-volume high-value segments in specific value chains should also be considered.
Some exporters of agricultural products in Nepal (e.g. tea and coffee) have found success by supplying
niche markets that pay higher prices for smaller and more consistent orders for their products. Anecdotal
evidence suggest that some manufacturing firms have also found similar niches in which direct
competition from large-volume producers like China, Vietnam or Bangladesh is not an issue. For example,
Himalaya Knitwear sells hand knit woolen hats and sweaters in almost 500 stores in the US, Canada and
Japan - including specialized outdoor equipment REI and Bob Ward's – through a partnership with a US
company (Everest Designs). Himalayan Knitwear specializes in high-quality hand-knitted products
exporting about 600,000 pieces a year that are placed in relatively small orders that large manufacturers
in China and India would not handle.

 Box 3. Quality Repositioning in International Markets: The Experience of Rwandan Coffee

 In response to the steady decline in export revenues from the coffee sector in the 1990s, the
 government or Rwanda decided to improve coffee positioning in world markets. Rwanda’s coffee was
 considered commodity grade and in order to move to a specialty coffee grade, improvements were
 needed in three key areas:

 - Increase production levels: Because Rwandan coffee production was insufficient to attract global
 demand, the government decided to substantially increase production by distributing improved inputs,
 supporting growing associations, replanting coffee trees, and constructing wet-mill stations in main
 producing regions.

 - Improve quality: Repositioning Rwandan coffee on high quality segments started with educating
 producers on quality and cupping, establishing quality-control mechanisms, investing and technical
 assistance in wet-mill techniques and operational and financial management.

 - Promote the Rwandan band: In order to increase the recognition of the improved Rwandan coffee in
 international markets, the government decided to establish and improve market linkages through
 trade-show visits, sharing information about the local and global coffee markets with the private sector
 and instituting other innovative promotional activities.




                                                                                                           18
 Before 2001, Rwanda was unknown in the specialty/high-value coffee sector but today it is a renowned
 supplier of specialty coffees to the EU and the United States. In 2005, Starbucks selected two privately
 owned wet-milling facilities for an exclusive distribution program that provided coffee to 5,000
 Starbucks retail outlets. Without Rwanda’s ability to improve the quality of its coffee beans from
 ordinary to standard and specialty grades it would have been impossible to reverse the decline in
 revenues from its exports.

    4. Conclusions

Policymakers in Nepal are aware of the potential of GVCs to increase exports and their critical role in
economic growth and inclusiveness. The NTIS 2015 highlights as one of its priorities “to identify key
binding constraints to maximize the benefits of participation in increasingly important regional and global
value chains” (NTIS 2015). This report presented some stylized facts about Nepal’s integration in GVCs
and identified policy recommendations in cross-cutting areas that relate to the majority of export sectors
prioritized by the NTIS 2015.

A careful analysis of Nepal’s export and import data produced five stylized facts that characterize its
integration into GVCs. First, Nepal could be better integrated into GVCs. Even though its exports have high
import content, Nepal is not a good supplier to regional and international value chains and is largely
missing on the growing trade in intermediate products. Second, imported inputs are key for the vast
majority of exporters and greater use and variety of imported intermediary inputs is correlated with
higher exports, diversification of destination markets and higher quality of exports. Third, restrictive
policies towards FDI compound the challenges the country faces in attracting foreign investment that can
be crucial for increasing productivity, accessing new markets, and upgrading the quality of exports. Fourth,
although there are some exports of high quality products, the average quality of most agricultural
products prioritized by the NTIS 2015 is average. Finally, recurring import rejections in developed
countries could pose a reputational risk for Nepal’s exports and result in lower export prices and higher
costs for exporting.

Four policy areas present opportunities to spur export growth and increase participation in GVCs. First,
Nepal should facilitate access to imported inputs by reducing tariffs on key raw materials and intermediate
products. Second, efforts should be made to develop linkages for Nepalese firms to integrate into value
chains in northern Indian states bordering Nepal. Third, strengthening national infrastructure and services
that support export compliance with international standards will boost competitiveness and facilitate
entry into GVCs. Fourth, a strategy to reposition selected export products on high quality segments that
demand in small orders will help Nepal increase exports.

Annex 1. Export Performance Premium for Exporters in Nepal

We follow the approach used by Pierola et. al (2015) and pioneered by Bernard and Jensen (1999) to
estimate the export performance premium with the following basic regression:

                                           =   +  +  + 
where i stand for a firm, t stands for a year,  is an export performance measure,  are fixed year effects,
 are firm fixed effects, and  is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) error.

Because more than ninety percent of exporters – which account for more than ninety eight percent of
exports - import some inputs we are not interested in estimating the effect of importing in exporters
(exporter-importer premium) but instead we focus on several dimensions of intermediate inputs that
capture the degree to which they represent increased variety and quality. Thus,  is a dummy variable
that represents the number of imported HS 6-digit products (in logarithms), the number of import
varieties defined as an HS 6-digit-origin country cell (in logarithms), and a dummy variable for exporters
that import more than 30% of their inputs from outside India.

Table 5 shows the results from these specifications which reveal significantly higher export values, larger
number of destinations, and relatively higher product quality than average for exporter that import more
products, more varieties, and a larger share of imports from outside the region.

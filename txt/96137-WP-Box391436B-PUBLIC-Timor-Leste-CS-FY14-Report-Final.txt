I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Timor-Leste perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Timor-Leste regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Timor-Leste;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Timor-Leste;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Timor-Leste;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Timor-Leste.
    Use data to help inform Timor-Leste country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In July 2014, 220 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Timor-Leste were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs overseeing implementation of a project; local
government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private
foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the
media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 163 stakeholders
participated in the survey (74% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to face.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Timor-Leste; their overall attitudes toward
the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Timor-Leste; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’06. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in two
years, which allows for between-year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present
in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the
“other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14 data and
the total number of respondents in two years are slightly different from those of the original data
reported in appendices A, B, C, D, F, G. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown, please see
appendix E (page 131).
A. General Issues Facing Timor-Leste: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Timor-
   Leste is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Timor-Leste, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Timor-Leste, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Timor-Leste solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity
   building in Timor-Leste, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were
   asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments
   in helping reduce poverty in Timor-Leste, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus
   most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and whether they have seen more
   collaboration between the WBG and UN.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Timor-Leste, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Timor-Leste’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the importance for the WBG to be involved in twenty five development areas,
   and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across these areas, such as education, health, rural and
   agricultural development, transport, public sector governance/reform, and job
   creation/employment.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to rate
   the effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is adequately staffed locally.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Timor-Leste: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Timor-Leste, which
   services the Bank Group should offer more of in the country, and what the WBG should do
   to improve collaboration with the UN in the field. They were asked what areas the country
   would benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would benefit
   most from other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Timor-Leste, which WBG agencies they work with, whether they think that IFC and
   WB work well together, and their geographic locations.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Respondents across stakeholder groups and geographic locations had statistically similar
        levels of familiarity with the WBG.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Timor-Leste and its ability
        to help achieve development results in Timor-Leste, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to Timor-Leste’s development.

        likely to indicate that Timor-Leste is headed in the right direction, whereas respondents
        from the CSOs were significantly less likely to think so (a quarter of them indicate that

        capacity in Government? and “political pressure and obstacles? compared to other

       Respondents from district capitals are significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG-

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Timor-Leste,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Timor-Leste.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at rural and agricultural development; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at food security and nutrition.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Timor-Leste, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

Appendix E: Responses to All Questions by Year1
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices.

    FY ’06 Number of comparable respondents = 180  FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 146
By weighting, FY06 and FY14 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

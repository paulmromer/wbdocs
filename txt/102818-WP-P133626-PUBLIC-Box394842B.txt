    Out of school and out of work: A conceptual framework for
    investigating ‚Äúninis‚Äù in Latin America and the Caribbean

     1. Introduction

The proportion of youth that is not in work nor in school or ninis1 in Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC) remains high. The latest estimates show that about 19 per cent of 15-24 years
olds in the region, were in this status in 2010 (de Hoyos, Rogers and Popova (2013)).2 This status
entails a series of negative implications for the life-cycle development of the youth involved with
a break in the human capital accumulation process that translates into a reduction in future
productivity and labor market outcomes. A large share of ninis might also entail risks for society
at large through potential short-term effects such as crime rates, and through the long-term
sequels from not fully capitalizing on the ‚Äúdemographic window of opportunity‚Äù of historically
low economic dependency ratios, among others. The objective of this paper is to develop a
conceptual framework for laying out the main elements involved in the dynamics of choices and
restrictions faced by youth in the 15-24 age range. The paper also discusses different approaches
that could be used to test the empirical validity of the theoretical implications presented here.

Earlier work on out-of-school youth have identified student‚Äôs schooling expectations (Jacob and
Wilder (2010)), motivation (Papay, Murnane and Willet (2011)) and perceptions on future
market value of skills acquired in school (Jensen (2010)) as important determinants of secondary
completion rates. Other studies such as Harding et al (2010) and Bobonis and Finan (2009)
explore the effects of neighborhood context on schooling completion rates and find that factors
such as peers‚Äô decisions to enroll in school, proximity to jobs, violence, neighborhood resources,
cultural isolation, or social organization help explain how young people make their schooling
decisions. A third strand in the literature has identified the importance of early investment in
child development as a policy to increase secondary and postsecondary completion rates
(Heckman (2006), Cunha and Heckman (2007), Heckman and Masterov (2007) and Dynarski et
al (2011)). A fourth contribution of the literature has underlined the need to improve quality

America and Spain.

education as a policy to prevent dropouts. For instance, Lyche (2010), Faubert (2012) and OECD
(2012) state that dropouts are the outcome of a cumulative process of disengagement that occurs
over time and manifests through low learning outcomes.

The literature on youth unemployment sheds light on the school-to-labor market transition
followed by Latin American youth and the effectiveness of temporary training programs to
improve labor market outcomes. According to Cunningham and Bustos Salvagno (2011) youth
in Latin America typically leave school to spend a short time in the informal sector then, they
move on to a formal position for a longer period and, finally, they become self-employed. In the
authors‚Äô setting, the informal sector of the economy provides a type of job training, or rather
informal job training, that lets young individuals acquire job-relevant skills. However, the
productive options for those youth that are ninis and do not have the relevant skills are scarce
(Edwards (2005)), therefore providing them with training may help them to enter the labor
market. Using a randomized controlled trial Card et al (2007) find a negligible impact on
employment, but positive effects on the average monthly wage among participants of the
program Juventud y Empleo, a training program in the Dominican Republic. According to
Attanasio, Kugler and Meghir (2008) the Colombian training program J√≥venes en Acci√≥n raises
employment and wages of women by 14 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

In general, the literature on the out of school and out of work phenomenon has focus on (i)
reducing secondary-school dropouts, (ii) the effectiveness of vocational schooling, training or
temporary employment programs to reduce youth unemployment, or (iii) the mismatch between
skills acquired in schools and those demanded by the labor market. However, these literatures
tend not to acknowledge each other, nor recognize that they are intimately interconnected, which
makes their analysis partial. The contribution of the framework, therefore, consists in
incorporating these approaches in a unified framework to provide a more comprehensive view.

The paper includes 4 sections. Section 2 starts with a simple characterization of the life-cycle
transition of time uses for youth in LAC. Section 3 introduces a more formal presentation of
what underlies these processes and what impact they may have. Section 4 addresses the
considerations for empirical analyses and policy discussion. The last section includes some final
remarks.

   2. Simple Characterization of Time Use Transition among Youth

Figure 1 gives a simple characterization of the transition processes of time uses for youth ages 15
to 24 in Mexico. Youth can be in school, working, doing both or neither. At the age of 15, almost
all youth in Mexico are in school, with almost 20% also working; however, as we move further
along the x-axis into older cohorts, the proportion of the population in school declines, coupled
with an increase in the shares of youth working or being nini. As the regional data in de Hoyos,
Rogers, and Popova (2013) shows, the transitions out of school into work or nini in Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC) intensify when youth are ages 16 to 18, though a significant
minority is still in school even at age 24.

Following C√°rdenas, de Hoyos and Sz√©kely (2011), it is helpful to consider separately the 15-18
and 19-24 age groups because generally in LAC primary and the first cycle of secondary
schooling span the 9 years between ages 6 to 14. The official age for attending upper secondary
is around ages 15-18, and after, those continuing in the schooling system are eligible to enter
higher education, which generally is 4 to 5 additional years.3 Furthermore, those ninis between
15 and 18 years of age are particularly worrisome. At this stage of the life cycle, as compared
with those 19 to 24, there is no ambiguity that being in the formal education system is the most
desirable and socially productive activity. In many countries, those under the age of 18 have not
reached the minimum mandatory education level and their physical, mental and emotional
development process is still underway. In this sense, being in school in a protected and
constructive environment is a critical determinant for developing individual personality and a
capacity for decision-making, constructing behavioral patterns, accumulating human capital,
acquiring capabilities for social interaction, conforming one‚Äôs personal identity and relationships
toward peers, and developing civic values, among others. These are also critical years for
integration into the community, for acquiring social values, and for building trust in institutions
and the rule of law. Without adequate protection and support and integration mechanisms, 15 to
18 year old youth out of school and not working are often exposed to situations that may affect
their future development prospects negatively and threaten others in their societies.

The set of full choices faced by youth at, say, age a is defined as study, work, do both or being
out of school and out of work. Youth can transition into any of the four alternative time-use
states at age a +1 or remain in the same state. This is not to say that all states are equally
possible at age a +1 no matter what the state at age a. To the contrary, there probably is inertia
or persistence or state dependence, so that youth in a particular state at age a are more likely than
those in the other three states at age a to be in that same state at age a + 1. Moreover if there is
a transition between one state at age a to one of the other three states at age a +1, the
probabilities of transitioning do not have to be equal or independent of age a. For example,
youth who transition out of schooling at age 15 probably are more likely to enter into the ninis
category than youth who transition out of schooling at age 23.



3
  This is a general pattern, although there are some countries with different definitions, which can be accounted for
in establishing the relevant age groups.

                                                         5
Figure 1 suggests that the probabilities of re-entering school after entering the work or ninis
states are fairly low in Mexico, as they are in on most Latin American countries. Therefore the
‚Äúfull choice‚Äù assumption might only empirically be relevant for younger ages. No school re-entry
after dropping out, of course, limits the options and the transition paths. That does not mean,
however, that there might not be high rates of return to ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù programs that include
re-entry to school.

Limitation to the four states of school, work, both or none, as in Figure 1, is a simplification that
captures the major concern of the research agenda put forward here. There may be compound
states of work and training or of being out of school and out of work and training, both of which
may importantly affect future transition probabilities. Further, the ninis state may be combined
with considerable non labor market work and responsibilities such as parenting, which can be
considered a productive activity contributing to early child development and therefore the
wellbeing of the society at large.

Like any other conceptual framework the one developed here is a simplification of a much more
complex process. Adolescence is a time of life in which there are major developments and
transitions, not limited to those major time uses discussed above (e.g., see Lloyd et al 2005 and
National Research Council and Institute of Medicine Panel on Transitions to Adulthood in
Developing Countries 2005). Many of these transitions, however, are inter-related with the time
uses already mentioned. Important examples include leaving parental homes, initiating sexual
interactions, exploring new options some of which may be risky (e.g., consumption of alcohol or
other drugs), entering into marital or cohabitation relations (and perhaps exiting such relations),
initiating parenting, and entering into new formal or informal social networks, including gangs.
Although out of the scope of the present study, analysis of these other transitions together with
analysis of the major time uses of youth in general is likely to lead to a richer understanding of
how the major time uses fit into the overall development of youth and what might be policy
handles for affecting the major time uses. Bearing this limitation in mind, the rest of this paper
develops a simple framework to identify the underlying objectives and constraints characterizing
youth‚Äôs major time uses and their transitions over time.

    3. Framework for Thinking about Youth Transitions

The standard economic framework for analyzing decisions regarding investment in schooling is
that such investments are made by the relevant decision maker until the expected marginal
benefits of schooling equal their expected marginal costs.4 The prototype for this type of
framework probably is Becker‚Äôs (1967) well-known Woytinsky Lecture. The expected private
marginal benefits decrease as schooling increases in the relevant range due to diminishing
marginal returns to fixed abilities and to human capital stocks accumulated in previous age
periods. The expected private marginal costs are increasing due to increasing private opportunity
costs of more schooling in terms of other time use options (e.g. working, caring for other family
members, performing household chores) and possibly increasing marginal costs of financing
current schooling investments given imperfect or missing capital markets for such investments.
The equilibrium private investment of time in school is given by the intersection of the expected
private marginal benefits and expected private marginal costs.

What might make the expected private marginal benefit higher? Expected private marginal
benefits may be higher because of factors that can be categorized for convenience into three
hierarchical groups:


    (1) Family and individual factors at age a such as greater ability, greater motivation for
         outcomes for which schooling might be helpful, greater human capital stocks (e.g.,
         cognitive skills, executive function, self-efficacy, health and nutritional status) due to
         investments prior to this age, greater family support for learning that is complementary
         with time in schooling, lesser diversions from dysfunctional family environments, higher
         expectations of the expected longer-run rate of return to time spent in school because of
         family connections or demographic characteristics (race, ethnicity, language group,
         gender), and higher expectations of the expected longer-run return to time spent in
         school because of more-informed (perhaps due to higher schooling) parents and other
         family members.

 The comparison is between expected private marginal benefits and expected primate marginal costs because many
of the benefits and costs will be revealed only in the uncertain future.

                                                      7
   (2) Community factors at age a including economic factors such as the access to existing
       schooling services, the quality of schools, matching of skills supplied by schools and
       those demanded by the labor market, the quality of other institutions that provide services
       complementary to time in school in the production of different dimensions of human
       capital (e.g., youth centers, libraries, athletic facilities), and expected rates of return to
       time spent in school depending in part on expectations regarding the availability of jobs
       and the level of wages in local labor markets, and in other labor markets that can be
       accessed. Cultural patterns, religion, demographic characteristics, and community
       traditions can also play important roles through returns to human capital.


   (3) Macro factors at age a including the expected rates of return to time spent in school in
       the country overall derived from the relative abundance and scarcity of different types of
       human capital, the level of stability in the economic environment ‚Äìwith more uncertain
       contexts inhibiting longer term investments- interest rate levels signaling the returns to
       alternative investments, perceptions about access to capital markets, expectations about
       the evolution of real exchange rates, along with other important indirect macro factors
       that work through families or communities (e.g., if the quality of local schools depends
       on salaries paid by or transfers from the central government, or the access to schooling
       services that are financed through public spending). Additionally, rules in the schooling
       system regarding the definition of official ages for attending school, along with country
       wide cultural norms and traditions can affect returns to human capital.


Note that there may be important interactions among these three levels. For example, families
and individuals may choose their communities and even their countries through migration,
though the apparent costs of such movements may be considerable. And, as already noted, the
nature of the community factors may depend on the macro economy if part of the resources for
important community services come from the central government and if the state of the local
economy reflects considerably the state of the macro economy, both of which seem likely.


What might make the expected private marginal cost lower? This curve may be lower because
of factors that can be categorized for convenience into the same three hierarchical groups:

                                                 8
   (1) Family and individual factors at age a such as greater own income or greater access to
        kin or other networks to finance time in school if capital markets are not perfect for
        financing such investments, lower information costs regarding schooling options if other
        family members are more educated, lower opportunity costs of time spent in school if
        demographic factors such as those mentioned above limit options in the labor force or of
        other sorts (including, for example, care for siblings, own children or other family
        members in which there may be gender specialization).


   (2) Community factors at age a such as lower school fees, lower transportation costs to
       schools, lower opportunity costs of time for attending school if current non-school
       options are poor (e.g., local employment options), lower interest rates for investments
       because local capital markets are better developed.


   (3) Macro factors at age a such as greater transfers conditional on school attendance as for
       the Conditional Cash Transfer programs that are widespread in LAC, as well as possible
       indirect dimensions working through community factors such as school fees (that might
       be affected by central government mandates or subsidies), transportation and
       communication systems, and also country-wide policies promoting the labor market
       participation of certain groups (i.e. affirmative action, employment subsidies, or legal
       incentives for female labor market participation).



In addition to time use and human capital stocks at age a there are other important factors
including what we call here ‚Äúdemographic‚Äù life-cycle decisions, that are likely to be determined
simultaneously and have feedback on time use, including the state of being ninis at age a.
Importantly among these are decisions pertaining to partnering (perhaps marrying), subsequent
dissolution of partnering, co-residence with parents or with other partners, and parenting.

While we initiated this discussion with the particular example of time use in school because that
is the most common example in the economics (and most other) literature, parallel discussions
hold for time use in work or being nini or any of the other more disaggregated time uses noted


                                                 9
above. Moreover there are obvious cross-effects on time-use decisions because of the constraint
for overall time available so that if more time is spent working then that time must come from
some other activity such as schooling or being idle. Furthermore, all time uses are likely to
affect some or maybe all dimensions of human capital through affecting the maintenance of
previously-acquired human capital and current investment in human capital along the lines
sketched out above. Further there are likely to be adjustment costs in transitioning from one time
use at age a -1 to another time use at age a, so there is likely to be path dependence in addition to
dependence on the human capital stocks on previous decisions on time use.



       3.1. A Simple Characterization of a Dynamic Model of Time Allocation5

Let us define the per-period utility function of individual ‚Äúj‚Äù at age a as determined by a vector
of consumption items including the consumption of leisure, C (for simplicity we suppress the
individual-level subscripts):


                                   Ì†µÌ±àÌ†µÌ±é = Ì†µÌ±à(Ì†µÌ±™Ì†µÌ±é )                                  (i)


Income at age a, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é , is the sum of an individual‚Äôs labor income ‚Äìwhich is determined by human
capital endowments (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é ) and their market prices (Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é ) - plus exogenous income such as parental
                                                                     0
or family intra-household allocations, or governmental transfers (Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é ):


                                                           0
                             Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é = (Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é ‚àó Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é )‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±é + Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é                               (ii)


where ha is an indicator variable equal to 1 when the individual participates in the labor market,
zero otherwise. Individuals allocate their time among four mutually exhaustive choices: attend
school, sa = {0,1}, work in the labor market, ha = {0,1}, do both, ba = {0,1}, or do neither of
these, na = {0,1} following a utility-maximization process:


             Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±•{Ì†µÌ±†,‚Ñé,Ì†µÌ±è,Ì†µÌ±õ} ‚àëÌ†µÌ∞¥
                                 Ì†µÌ±é=Ì†µÌ±é‚àó Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±à(Ì†µÌ±™Ì†µÌ±é ))   Ì†µÌ±†. Ì†µÌ±°.           ÃÖÌ†µÌ±é
                                                                      Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±å                         (iii)

    The setting in this section follows, loosely, the framework developed in Merlo and Wolpin (2009).

                                                                     10
where Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é is a parameter capturing the individual‚Äôs value of present versus future consumption or
                                                      ÃÖÌ†µÌ±é is a budget constraint. Below a given age
his or her marginal propensity to consume, and Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±å
threshold, say a*, youth are either culturally bound or legally required to observe ha=0 and hence
intra-household or governmental transfers are youth‚Äôs only source of income. Above that critical
age threshold a*, individuals decide, given the set of constraints imposed by their micro,
community and macro context, if they attend school, work in the labor market, do both, or do
neither of these. The decision will determine the type of transition as shown in Figure 1.

At the critical age threshold, a = a*, a youth possesses a set of given immutable endowments,
Ha*, reflecting parental contributions during the youth‚Äôs initial years a < a*, family and
individual factors including socioeconomic aspects (Ì†µÌºî), demographic characteristics (x), as well
as community and macro factors that shape the environment such as cultural norms, availability
of public educational services, community characteristics, among other. The immutable
                                                     Ì†µÌ±†
endowments include the formal grades of schooling (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é ‚àó ) attained at age a*, cognitive abilities,


and socio-emotional abilities such as self-efficacy and executive functions (Ì†µÌºÇÌ†µÌ±é‚àó ) all of which
have market values.

     Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó = Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é ‚àó + Ì†µÌºÇÌ†µÌ±é‚àó (Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•)    ‚áî Ì†µÌ±é = Ì†µÌ±é‚àó                                           (iv)

Labor market experience (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é ) and further schooling (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é  ) add to the immutable endowments to

assumption of the model ‚Äìand partly the motivation of this paper, is that when youth ‚Äúdecide‚Äù,
given their constraints, to be out of school and out of work na =1 the human capital accumulation
process stops. In other words, although na =1 adds to youth‚Äôs consumption of leisure, it does not
add to (or it can even subtract from) their current level of human capital:

Figure 2 shows a simple graphic representation of the dynamic process of human capital
accumulation before and after the ‚Äúcritical age thresholds‚Äù. Below a*, the human capital
accumulation process is determined by formal schooling financed by parental contributions,
household characteristics including socioeconomic aspects, preferences, cultural norms, as well
                                                                                           ÃÖ
as micro, community and macro context variables that shape the environment. Between a* and Ì†µÌ±é
each youth takes his or her own decision regarding attending school, working, doing both or
                                                                              ÃÖ the human capital
doing neither, perhaps in coordination with their parents. And finally, above Ì†µÌ±é
accumulation process is related to years of experience in the labor market and it is a decision
taken independently by the individuals.

  Youth‚Äôs decisions regarding time use will affect current and future consumption via human
  capital accumulation and its impact on future labor market outcomes. Therefore, labor markets
  are a link between the decision regarding time use and the net present value of utility. Wages at
  age a are determined by the market value of human capital endowments and other contextual
  variables affecting labor productivity such as labor market regulations, availability of
  technology, sectors of specialization, external trade intensity, and general macroeconomic
  conditions, Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é :


            Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é = Ì†µÌ±§(Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó ), Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é )                         (viii)


  The expression for human capital endowments Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é includes the full history of past decisions and
  the immutable endowments to show, explicitly, the permanent effects of these two elements on
  labor market outcomes. In turn, the market value of human capital (Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª ) will be determined,
  among other things, by the quality of the schooling received (Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† ) and aggregate macroeconomic
  conditions:




                                                                 13
                                             Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é
                                                    = Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª (Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† , Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ‚Ä¶ )
                                             Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é


where the market return of human capital is a function of the quality of schooling services, Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† ,
the production function of the economic sectors, the relative scarcity of the endowments offered
in the labor market, as well as sectoral shocks, labor market rigidities, macroeconomic conditions
(Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ), and patterns of trade, among others.

Notice that the distribution of youth among the four mutually exclusive categories of time
allocation {s, h, b, n} is not necessary the outcome of a frictionless utility maximization process
but mostly the result of constraints or circumstances faced by individuals. For instance, under
certain circumstances a youth would observe na = 1 (nini) simply because the labor market is not
creating enough employment opportunities for him or her to participate (ha = 1) or because the
schooling system is not providing schooling opportunities for human capital accumulation.
Additionally, due to cultural patterns, community norms, etc. an individual may select state na =
1, for instance for performing household-related activities, or parenting.

Bearing these issues in mind, it would be expected that for Ì†µÌ±é > Ì†µÌ±é‚àó , the closer a is to a*, the
more individuals will be subject to:


    1. High marginal propensity to consume derived from low inter temporal marginal rate of
        substitution that characterizes younger ages;
    2. Liquidity constraints that restrict them from borrowing in capital markets, for instance,
        for investing in schooling;
    3. Imperfect information on future returns to schooling; where information sets (Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é ), are
        determined by socio-economic context Ì†µÌºî and demographic characteristics x:


        Ì†µÌ∞∏[Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é+1, Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±é+2, ‚Ä¶ ] = Ì†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•) ‚Ä¶ )                          (ix)

Therefore, as described by expression (iii), at each point in time, between ages a* and Ì†µÌ±é

(Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† ), the returns to schooling (Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª ), the perceived returns to education under imperfect
information Ì†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•) ‚Ä¶ ), as well as context variables including socio-economic (Ì†µÌºî),
demographic (x) and aggregate macroeconomic conditions (Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ).


The horizon of attention is restricted to Ì†µÌ±é‚àó ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±é ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±é
                                                     ÃÖ , and in the utility maximization process the
tradeoff for the youth comes in the form of more leisure consumption today versus a higher
consumption of other goods (perhaps including leisure) in the future. Following Merlo and
Wolpin (2009), the above model can be solved by backwards recursion. Assuming Ì†µÌ±é ‚àí (Ì†µÌ±é ‚àí 1)
represents a one year period and Ì†µÌ±é‚àó = 15; Ì†µÌ±é
                                           ÃÖ = 24, the solution of this process ‚Äìwhich is not
undertaken by the authors, would yield decision rules Ì†µÌ∞∫(‚ãÖ) for each of the four possible choices j

where Ì†µÌ±ó = 0 ‚àÄ Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô) < 0. The decision functions Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô) take only negative values and are
therefore maximized when they reach zero. The decision functions have enough structure to
allow the researcher, given that the data exists, to identify all of the parameters defining the
decision-making process. However, as will be discussed in the next section, estimating Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô)
under the more realistic setting of imperfect and incomplete information can be challenging.


    3.2. Policy Relevant Features of the Model

First, all of these relations are dynamic both because the outcomes at age a depend on outcomes
in previous ages (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ) and because some of the costs and particularly the
returns depend on expectations about future returns to investment in human capital
Ì†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•) ‚Ä¶ ). Note that the dependence on past outcomes includes the possible positive
accumulative effects of capital investments, or what Cunha and Heckman (2007) call ‚Äúdynamic
complementarities,‚Äù as well as the possible negative effects of being scarred by past negative

                                                                       15
experiences including the depletion of human capital (or non-maintenance in the terms used
above) through non-use if idle. This implies that the decisions regarding time allocation today
can have a long lasting, permanent, effect which can be manifested in the form of poorer future
labor market outcomes. Linking human capital decisions at age a to the entire history of past
decisions also implies that there is hysteresis or path dependency in the model. Being a nini at
one age may affect developments at future ages not only through the lagged time-use terms
(Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ), but also through the human capital stocks.

Second, the dynamic effects of time use may persist across many years, including into and
throughout adulthood, because of possible transmissions through human capital stocks and
demographic and related outcomes. Therefore, a feature of the model is the intergenerational
transmission of well-being (or poverty) through the immutable endowments Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó .

Third, relations Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô) are general functional forms that will allow, for example, interactions
among socio-economic context (Ì†µÌºî), demographics (x) and aggregate macroeconomic conditions
(Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ) as well as past time use, human capital stocks and other outcomes.          Some possible
interactions have been noted above. But it is important to note explicitly that these interactions
can include age and gender dependence. As is noted in Section 1, C√°rdenas, de Hoyos and
Sz√©kely (2011), for example, document important differences in the prevalence of being nini
between ages 15-18 years and 19-24 years old. They also document important differences by
gender, with higher prevalence, but in recent years more-rapidly-falling prevalence, for females
than for males.     In general such differences by ages and gender are likely to reflect both
differences in the right-side variables and differences in the impacts of the right-side variables,
though almost for sure some of the important differences reflect the latter. For example, because
of gender-differentiated roles in household production and in having and raising children, the
impacts of cohabitating and parenting components almost surely differ between females and
males.

Fourth, the relations described by the framework are consistent with the possibility that the
transition from school to nini (or any other choice) may tend to occur at younger ages and earlier
schooling levels in some countries than in others as noted above because of differences in socio-
economic context (Ì†µÌºî), demographics (x) and aggregate macroeconomic conditions (Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ), or
differences among countries in the impact of those factors, and also due to differences in the age
                                                    16
                ÃÖ are reached. As a result, the probability of entering into the state of being a
at which a* and Ì†µÌ±é
nini when younger or at lower secondary school may be much higher in, say El Salvador,
Nicaragua or Paraguay than in Chile or Argentina, with other countries such as Peru and
Colombia in between.

Fifth, more binding liquidity constraints in the presence of imperfect capital markets, greater
preference for present consumption (Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é ) and more imperfect information regarding future
returns to human capital, Ì†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•) ‚Ä¶ ), would result in less investment in human capital.
Given that poor households suffer more from liquidity constraints, attach a higher value to
present consumption and have access to a more distorted information set, the model predicts an
intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality through restricted human capital
accumulation among poor households and the subsequent unequal labor market outcomes.

Sixth, the setting of the model implies different social welfare outcomes depending on the
allocation of youth into the four options of time use. For instance, a general equilibrium with a
large proportion of youth in the ninis category would yield lower social welfare vis-√†-vis a
situation with a large proportion of youth in school or working. For the reasons described above,
for youth aged 15 to 18, the socially desirable outcome is for all of them to be in school. This is
not necessarily true for youth aged 19 to 24, where a share of them might decide, without a loss
in social welfare, to sell their time endowment in the labor market. For this older age group, it is
not at all clear which allocation of youth into the different categories of time use would
maximize social welfare.

A final word of caution is needed before discussing the possible empirical approaches. Arguably,
the decision related to human capital accumulation does not necessarily shift in a discrete way
from parents to youth as it is suggested by equation (vii) and Figure 2. Most likely the shift of
weight from parents to youth in the decision-making process is a gradual process with parents
playing a larger role at initial ages (for a closer to a* and Ì†µÌ±é > Ì†µÌ±é‚àó ) and declining faster as a
        ÃÖ. Modeling this process would require developing a model with two additional features:
reaches Ì†µÌ±é
1) an explicit utility function of parents which, if relevant, may differ from that of youth; and 2) a
definition of the intra-household bargaining process solving the difference in preferences
between youth and their parents. Additionally, the human capital accumulation process described
by equation (vii) implies that parental contributions Ha* are taken as given as opposed to

                                                 17
                                                                                                ÃÖ
explicitly modeling behavior under specific constraints. Furthermore, the definitions of a* and Ì†µÌ±é
also depend on cultural patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, the definition of legal schooling
and working ages, etc. Although identifying the forces behind the gradual shift from parents to
youth in the decision-making process, the parental contribution to human capital accumulation
                                                                ÃÖ are three important elements in
during earlier years and country-specific definitions of a* and Ì†µÌ±é
the determinants of ninis, a formal discussion of them falls beyond the scope of the present
study.


         3.3 Potential Empirical Approaches

As presented in the previous section, at any youth age Ì†µÌ±é > Ì†µÌ±é‚àó , decisions about time use are made
based on the previous history and on expectations regarding future developments. Whatever the
critical age threshold when the adolescent‚Äôs preferences become relevant in the decision-making
process ‚Äìfor instance, youth in LAC seem to be reaching a* at younger ages in the late 20th and
early 21st century- choices among major time uses can be viewed as the allocation of available
resources between the marginal returns to current consumption and to future investment benefits.

Empirically, estimation of the model developed in Section 2.1 can follow a structural approach
by defining the function forms of the theoretical relationships underpinning the model.
Alternatively, a linearized (first-order Taylor series expansion) of the decision functions Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô)
yield reduced-form equations for the probability of choosing any of the four time use alternatives
at age a:


      Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é = Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é [ Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó , (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ), Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† , Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª , Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é | Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•, Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ] + Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é   (xi)


where Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é are random components capturing the joint distribution of all shocks. The random
components, Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é , can follow many distributions, for example, normal, Poisson, extreme value or
a combination of various distributions (logit kernel or mixed logit). An alternative would be to
assume that Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) shocks with extreme value
distribution. Under these assumptions, the probability that individual i will allocate time to
alternative j at age a is defined as follows:

where the individual subscript i is included in the decision functions of equation (xii) to denote
that the estimation of this functional form should be undertaken at the individual level. Under
this specification, the probability of observing any of the four choices {s,h,b,n} at a given age is
determined by a multinomial model with the following covariates:


    (a) Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é = income of youth, which could be approximated by household per capita income or
            personal labor income when available
    (b) Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é = subjective value of youth for present over future consumption, which can be proxied
            by the self-declared willingness to give up a sum of income today in exchange for a
            larger sum in the future
    (c) Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó = immutable endowments while youth, which could be captured by grades of
            schooling at age 15 or measures of socio emotional skills at age 15
    (d) (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ) = history of past decisions regarding time use available from
            panel data
    (e) Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† = quality of education received proxied by, for instance, private versus public
            schooling or the age-for-grade distortion
    (f) Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª = returns to schooling estimated from a Mincer wage specification for current labor
            force participants
    (g) Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é = perceived returns to schooling, when available
    (h) Ì†µÌºî = socio-economic context captured by parents‚Äô education
    (i) Ì†µÌ±• = demographics such as gender, marital status, co-residing in parental household,
            among others
    (j) Ì†µÌºã = macroeconomic conditions such as GDP‚Äôs volatility, inflation rates or trade openness


A second alternative could be to concentrate on estimating the probability of observing a
transition between one choice of time use, for example, sa=1 to na+1=1. In this case, the

                                                                       19
parameters of the decision function would be identified by comparing the covariates of
individuals that change their choice for time use with those who did not change:


(xiii)


                               exp{Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é [ Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó , (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ), Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† , Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª , Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é | Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•, Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ]}

where Ì†µÌ±ó ‚â† Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ä≤. Under both functional forms (xii) and (xiii) there are policy-relevant hypotheses
that can be identified. For instance, the effect of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é on the probability of transitioning out of
school:


                                                           Ì†µÌºïPr(Ì†µÌ±ñ ‚â† Ì†µÌ±†|Ì†µÌ±é, Ì†µÌ±†)
                                                                 Ì†µÌºïÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±é


If the above expression is negative, then it would suggest that individuals are transitioning out of
school due to budget constraints and hence a scholarship program financed by the government
would be desirable. The functional forms can also quantify the importance of early child
development and parental contributions to determine the probability of being out of school and
out of work at age a > a*:


                                                             Ì†µÌºïPr(Ì†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±õ|Ì†µÌ±é)
                                                                 Ì†µÌºïÌ†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±é‚àó


Other important relationships such as the impact of perceptions of the returns to schooling (Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é )
on the probability of dropping out of school might be difficult to estimate given the lack of
availability of a reliable measure of perceptions in existing data.6


A third alternative empirical approach exploits the relationship between the prevalence of ninis
and aggregate conditions. Under this approach, the decision functions Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é (‚àô) are approximated

6
 For an estimation of the impact of the perceived returns to education on the demand for schooling see Jensen
(2010).

                                                                     20
by the proportion of the population at age a observed in each of the four choices of time use
{s,h,b,n}, like in Figure 1. The macro or aggregate version of expression (xi) can be defined as
follows:


     Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é = Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é [ Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌ±é , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó , (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àí2 ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó+1 ), Ì†µÌ±Ñ Ì†µÌ±† , Ì†µÌªΩÌ†µÌ∞ª , Ì†µÌºôÌ†µÌ±é | Ì†µÌºî, Ì†µÌ±•, Ì†µÌºãÌ†µÌ±é ] + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é   (xiv)


                                                                                                 2
where Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±é is a random component normally distributed with zero mean and variance equal to Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±é
and the independent variables are also aggregated versions of the micro determinants. Notice that
functional form (xiv) allows for age-specific effects a feature that can be easily incorporated
under a cohort approach like the one described in Browning, Deaton, and Irish (1985) and
Deaton (1985) and Attanasio (1998).



    4. Implications for Empirical Estimates with Available Data

Estimation of relations such as (xii) and (xiii) is likely to be challenging because some important
variables are not likely to be observed ‚Äì to cite a few examples, the generally absent or very
limited information on future expectations, and some of the right-side endogenous variables such
as self-efficacy and executive function at age a* (Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ±é‚àó ). In principle, individual fixed-effects
estimates and instrumental variable (IV) procedures might be used with individual panel data and
sufficient lagged information, including on prices and policies, to deal with some of these
estimation problems.

To our knowledge Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico are the only countries in the region
with a panel following individuals over time with fairly high frequency data for youth.7 The
short-term rotating quarterly panel of Mexico‚Äôs ‚ÄúEncuesta Nacional de Ocupaci√≥n y Empleo‚Äù
(and similar databases for Argentina and Colombia) can be used to estimate equations (xii) and
(xiii). Estimation of these equations with Mexico‚Äôs ENOE would shed light on the short-term
dynamics of time use among youth and the potential influence of the variables identified by our
theoretical model.


7
 Other datasets such as MXFLS in Mexico, Young Lives in Peru, INCAP in Guatemala and panels for Ecuador and
Nicaragua to not collect data on youth with enough frequency to estimate the dynamic model presented here.

                                                                         21
But even these data sets fall far short of the ideal panel to estimate the dynamics depicted by
Figure 1. These existing panels are too short and available for too few LAC countries to have
sufficient macro and community variation to permit estimation of the community and macro
effects. We lack true panel data sets with the requisite information for a sufficient number of
countries and years, which limits the relevance of the empirical approach to analyze the
evolution of ninis in different macroeconomic and other contexts.

However, estimation of equation (xiv) is possible using the rich panel of cross-sections
assembled by C√°rdenas, de Hoyos and Sz√©kely (2011) to adopt the average cohort approach
initiated by Browning, Deaton, and Irish (1985) and Deaton (1985), which consists of grouping
the households in subsequent surveys according to fixed criteria (in this case, years of birth) and
following the average variables of interest for these groups rather than for individuals. By
following a representative sample of each year-of-birth cohort, differences in the proportion of
ninis across cohorts can be controlled with context variables, while aggregate conditions across
countries can be captured through standard macro variables. Some other important features of
this approach include:

   1. While not able to integrate much explicit community information as such, for most
       countries it is possible to distinguish at least between rural and urban areas, between
       which generally the relevant infrastructure and markets differ markedly. Also as noted in
       Section 2, many of the community policy-related and market variables are likely to
       reflect macro conditions, which can be represented explicitly even though it might not be
       possible to identify well the particular community variables through which they work.


   2. The lagged age period a-1 is not necessarily a year because the cross-sections are not
       available for every year; instead an assumption of linear effects between cross-sections
       proportional to the elapsed time between each pair of contiguous cross sections is needed.


   3. Following the cohort analysis, it is possible to investigate a fairly wide range of birth
       cohorts, which increases the range of ages for which the ongoing impact of being a nini
       can be analyzed, though, of course, the interesting age ranges must include those in
       which individuals tend to be ninis (say, 15-24 years of age); but that there are nine


                                                22
       countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico,
       Paraguay, and Venezuela) for which the lapsed time between the first and last available
       cross section is at least a quarter of a century makes possible some analyses over fairly
       long segments of the life cycle.


   4. Definition of time uses include school, school and work, work, nini with own children
       and nini without own children to attempt to capture both the major types of being a nini
       and the major alternatives; the data do not permit including some time uses that might be
       of interest such as training, but other analysis confirms that the prevalence of such
       training is fairly low in the region in any case.


   5. The analysis should be undertaken separately for females and males because of the
       different historical patterns in the key variables, including being ninis, and because of the
       probable different impacts of some variables such as being married or becoming a parent.


   6. While there are not direct observations on expectations of future rates of returns to human
       capital investments, under assumptions about stability of such relations across
       generations within a country we can represent such expectations for current youth by the
       estimated rate of return in a log earnings function for adults in their 30s in the same
       cross-sectional survey.


   7. The possibility of following cohorts beyond the 15-24 age range permits verifying
       whether cohorts with large proportions of ninis at those ages tend to also be cohorts with
       higher unemployment rates, informal labor, or wages, with which scaring effects can be
       identified.



This type of analysis sheds light on why the proportions of ninis vary across countries or have
changed over time within countries--whether because of demographic shifts that increase the
school-age population, changes in the characteristics of households (including income,
schooling, and family size), or other changes in behaviors associated with the expected private
marginal benefits of schooling (such as the expected private returns to schooling). Additionally,

                                                 23
understanding the pattern of ninis and the variations in this condition across different and well-
defined population subgroups is useful for predicting future demands for schooling and
employment and therefore, the provision of public goods in the future.

The analysis outlined in this paper allows testing of the following hypotheses, among others:

   (a) There are more ninis when access to schooling services is lower due to household budget
       constraints or more limited supplies of services;
   (b) Being a nini has a long lasting effect on labor market trajectories (scarring), perhaps well
       into adulthood;
   (c) The proportion of ninis is lower when labor market opportunities are greater ‚Äìand thus,
       unemployment rates are lower;
   (d) There are more ninis when the macroeconomic environment is more adverse;
   (e) There are fewer ninis when the relative returns to upper secondary schooling are higher;
   (f) The determinants and impacts of being ninis vary between females and males, for
       instance, due to cultural norms or traditions;
   (g) The influence of family characteristics on the probability of being a nini is greater ‚Äì and
       hence the intergenerational transmission of poverty is larger ‚Äì when the macroeconomic
       environment is weaker and the provision of public services is inadequate.




   5. Final Remarks

The proportion of LAC youth that is ninis remains high, almost a fifth. This status is alleged to
entail a number of negative implications for the life-cycle development of the youth involved
with a break in the human capital accumulation process that translates into a reduction in future
productivity and labor market outcomes. A large share of ninis might also entail risks for society
at large through potential short-term effects such as crime rates, and through the long-term
sequels from not fully capitalizing on the ‚Äúdemographic window of opportunity‚Äù of historically
low economic dependency ratios, among others. But many of the questions about ninis in LAC -
- related to the determinants of this status, the implications of this status and possible policies
directed towards this status ‚Äì are empirical questions. This paper develops a conceptual
framework for laying out the main elements involved in the dynamics of choices and restrictions
                                                24
faced by youth in the 15-24 age range that provide a framework for different approaches that
could be used to investigate systematically empirical dimensions of the important ninis
phenomenon in LAC in light of the considerable limitations in the information that is available.
Despite these limitations, the study illustrates that some important insights may be obtained what
micro, community and macro factors determine ninis, what the short- and longer-run
implications are, and what policy changes may be effectives ‚Äì and how all these factors may
differ among various contexts in the region.

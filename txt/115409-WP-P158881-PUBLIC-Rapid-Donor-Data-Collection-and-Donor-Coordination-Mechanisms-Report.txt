Executive Summary and Findings
1.      This report presents the findings of an internal World Bank rapid assessment of
donor assistance and coordination mechanisms in Mozambique. Along with a parallel review
of Mozambique’s aid data information system, ODAmoz, this report aims to inform development
partner (DP) dialogue on aid coordination and information systems. The report presents data
collected from existing donor coordination mechanism in key aid sectors, along with findings
from interviews with sector specialists at the World Bank and other DPs about sector
coordination and policy dialogue. The report documents the type of information gathered by each
sector coordination group and identifies data gaps and coordination challenges created by the
current system.

2.      The main findings from this assessment are as follows:

        (a) Mozambique has no central data collection tool that is adequately collecting aid
            data. ODAmoz—the Government of Mozambique’s (GoM) aid information
            management system (AIMS), whose objective is exactly this—is neither well
            utilized nor seen as a functional platform for collecting and accessing information on
            sector projects and investments. In sector groups that have tried to adopt ODAmoz
            as a platform, such as the Health Working Group, DPs resisted adoption due to low
            awareness about ODAmoz’s purpose and fears that a parallel data collection system
            would interfere or overlap with other mechanisms, such as data entry into the GoM’s
            integrated financial and information management system (IFMIS), the State
            Electronic System of Financial Administration (e-Sistema de Administração
            Financeira do Estado, e-SISTAFE).1

        (b) The quality and quantity of data collected by sector coordination groups on
            projects and financing are highly variable. Not all sector coordination groups are
            active in tracking project or funding data. In sectors that do keep records, most
            collect data only on annual commitments; some simply note the total budget and
            expected time frame. Fewer sectors—that is, agriculture, health, and education—
            also collect data on actual disbursements, geographic location, specific subsector
            support, or expected outputs of projects. In addition, most sectors collect data in
            U.S. dollars, while others collect data in Mozambican meticais. These large
            variations between data collection methods limit the accuracy of cross-sector
            comparisons, as well as the compatibility of the data collected within ODAmoz.
            Table 13 demonstrates the wide variety of fields captured as well as the non-
            comprehensive nature of countrywide collection efforts, respectively.

        (c) Sectorwide approaches (SWAps), which provide a formal framework for DP
            coordination and DP-GoM policy dialogue, have been very successful in
            collecting aid data, particularly for the education and health sectors. In some
            cases, these coordination mechanisms have high transaction costs for DPs; however,
            where the GoM takes strong leadership and direction for the sector, they can

  These findings were corroborated by the parallel functional and technical assessment of ODAmoz conducted by
the task team. See the World Bank’s non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) on Aid Data Management (2017).

               facilitate the adoption of common strategies, national systems, and reporting
               frameworks that can limit transaction costs across all stakeholders. Unsurprisingly,
               SWAps appear to be most successful when the line ministries take a strong,
               proactive role in promoting DP alignment to sector priorities and encouraging DPs
               to use common funding mechanisms. The establishment of new SWAps and the
               strengthening of existing ones appear to be the surest ways of improving donor
               coordination and aid data management.

3.      Based on these findings, this report suggests the following three broad recommendations:

        (a) Improved guidance for sector working groups on best practices for data
            collection and use in sector coordination groups should be provided. If
            ODAmoz continues to operate as the central repository for on-budget and off-budget
            DP projects and funding, DP representatives should receive regular training and
            support on its use and functions. This should include clear explanations about the
            relationship between ODAmoz and other reporting requirements, such as e-
            SISTAFE.

        (b) Expectations of donor coordination working groups should be clarified as part
            of the Program Aid Partner (PAP) process, by ODAmoz or by the Ministry of
            Economy and Finances (Ministério da Economia e Finanças, MEF). Without a
            centralized body to monitor and standardize data collection across sectors,
            information is likely to continue to be ad hoc, incomplete, and of little use for
            monitoring overall progress on aid effectiveness.

        (c) Standard templates for further data collection should be developed to include a
            core set of basic fields and standard guidelines that sector coordination groups
            could then customize based on the additional, sector-specific information they
            needed. Such templates could pull basic aid information from ODAmoz, limiting
            double reporting from DPs while also ensuring buy-in for a centralized database of
            core data.

4.      This report also documented a number of sector-specific recommendations based on
consultations with sector stakeholders. In general, recommendations focused on the need for
stronger ministerial ownership of sector strategies, a broadening of working group mandates to
leverage existing institutions for heightened impact, and systematization and standardization of
data collection mechanisms.

    Sector                                             Recommendations
Agriculture          Establish a multistakeholder coordination mechanism led by the GoM and MASA to
                      mobilize funding, monitor progress, and lead policy dialogue.
                     Strengthen coordination between AgRED and other sector coordination groups to
                      coordinate on cross-cutting policy areas, including agri-business, seeds, or food security.
Conservation         Expand the mandate of the Conservation Working Group to discuss policy issues, such as
                      the creation of an independent institution, and joint objectives, such as raising the profile
                      of conservation issues.
Education            Ensure greater ministerial coordination with FASE at the technical levels.
                     MINEDH seeks to leverage DPs’ experience more upstream of the policy formulatio n
                      process.

    Sector                                              Recommendations
Environment         Expand the mandate of the ECCWG to allow for policy dialogue, particularly around
and Climate          forest management and climate change, that would help direct policy discussions and
Change               expand engagement with Government partners.
                    MICOA takes a more proactive role in guiding the agenda of the working group to
                     address sector priorities and discuss a pooled funding mechanism.
Fisheries           Hold more regular, structured meetings of the Fisheries Donor Coordination Group to
                     improve sector organization and engage partners on policy issues.
                    The Fisheries Donor Coordination Group establishes stronger connections to other groups,
                     including agriculture and conservation.
Health              Adjust or expand IFE categories to use more than just PESS fields, to better allow for
                     reporting of provincial and district activities.
                    Link IFE data to government accounting systems to facilitate its use by MISAU during
                     annual planning and budgeting processes.
                    Strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity in the sector.
Infrastructure      ANE encourages nontraditional donors to coordinate with the SWAp.
(Roads)             ANE and DPs collaborate to channel more funding into the common fund.
PFM                 PFM Coordination Group to establish expectations of more timely and disaggregated
                     financial data on ongoing and pipeline projects.
Social              The GoM exerts stronger leadership to ensure that differences among DPs no longer
Protection           stymie the potential for the SAWG to play an effective role in sector policy dialogue.
                    The SAWG encourages INAS and DPs to collaborate in collecting and managing key
                     missing data needed to establish social protection systems.
Water and           DNA provides clearer guidance and leadership to ensure that DPs do not pursue their own

MZ: Rapid Donor Data Collection and Donor Coordination Mechanisms Report


Introduction
1.     This report is the output of a rapid assessment of donor assistance and coordination
mechanisms in Mozambique. The objectives of the assessment were to review and compile the
donor coordination mechanisms and sources of information on ongoing and planned projects and
financing collected by donor coordination working groups in key sectors. The findings also
helped inform—and were informed by—the World Bank’s parallel review of the s ystemic issues
hampering effective aid data management and the functioning of ODAmoz, Mozambique’s aid
information management system (AIMS), as part of the World Bank’s broader non-lending
technical assistance to the sector.

2.     Aid coordination mechanisms in Mozambique have historically been robust;
however, recent years have seen declining donor participation rates. Previously, donor
coordination was conducted through the framework of the Program Aid Partners (PAPs), which
was established in early 2000. Participation in the PAP mechanism has declined since 2007,
however, and information on development partner (DP) activities has become more limited. The
Government of Mozambique (GoM) previously used ODAmoz to coordinate and manage aid
information; however, ODAmoz has faced technical challenges since 2015 and is not currently
used by DPs. Instead, aid data information is now coordinated through sector working groups
using varied data collection methods and procedures. 2 This fragmented system, along with
limited administrative capacity within some working groups, has resulted in significant data
gaps.

3.      The assessment was conducted by a research team within the Governance Global
Practice from August to November 2016. An initial desk review of policy documents and
existing reports was done to confirm the current role and function of aid effectiveness systems
and sector coordination structures in Mozambique. The team then interviewed technical
specialists at the World Bank Office in Maputo and consulted with representatives from other DP
participants in the working groups (see Annex I for a list of interviewees).

4.      This report is structured to present the results of this desk review and interview
process by sector. The first chapter provides a brief overview of the aid effectiveness
framework in Mozambique. The remaining chapters present sector overview summaries on
Agriculture, Conservation, Education, Environment and Climate Change, Fisheries, Health,
Infrastructure (Roads), Public Financial Management, Social Protection, and Water and
Sanitation, with seven sections: background, objective, structure, financing coordination,
additional coordination mechanisms, conclusions, and recommendations for improved donor
coordination and aid data collection. Recommendations are based on the direct feedback from
sector stakeholders.

5.     Each section includes a snapshot of projects over US$1 million.3 Data was collected
from sector spreadsheets, which are developed by each working group and circulated among DPs

 An overview of the different data fields collected within each sector is provided in Annex III, Table 13.

 Throughout this report, data on project commitments is presented in US$, millions. Calculations between
Mozambican meticais (MZN) and US$ use moving annual exchange rates from the World Bank. As Environment
and Climate Change did not have any projects over US$1 million, projects over US$100,000 were included. While

for inputs. Spreadsheet formats are non-standard, with varying fields and data formats—an
overview of these fields is presented in Annex II as a way of identifying which data fields are
universally applicable and which are sector specific. Data was collected for eight sectors, which
covers US$4.7 billion of donor funding (active and pipeline, for 2014 and 2015), summarized in
Table 1; to put this in perspective, gross total official development assistance (ODA) for 2014
and 2015 was US$4.2 billion.4 Data collected in the project spreadsheets includes off-budget
projects that are not captured by other aid data platforms, including ODAmoz or the State
Electronic System of Financial Administration (e-Sistema de Administração Financeira do
Estado, e-SISTAFE) (see Annex III for a comparison of platforms). Data was then compared to
ODAmoz data and the World Bank’s BOOST data for validation. The resulting project
information is presented in tables for each sector in the report.

over US$1 million (with the exception of Environment and Climate Change, explained later).
b. Aggregate donor contributions per sector can be found in Annex IV, Table 14.
c. Pipeline project data is based on limited data available (as of December 19, 2016); as such, these numbers are
expected to fluctuate. Pipeline projects are defined as projects that are in development and have pledged funding but
have not yet begun disbursements or activities.

Aid Effectiveness and General Budget Support
6.    The PAPs group is the main mechanism for donor coordination in Mozambique.5
The PAP is a group of 16 DPs6 that promote better donor coordination and serve as a platform



data was collected for all projects in each sector, only projects over US$1 million are presented in the tables, as they
capture the most significant DP investments in each sector and streamline the report for readability.
4
  This includes neither pipeline project funds nor nontraditional donor funds, which are not counted in ODA figures.
5
  Most donors participate in the Development Partners Group (DPG), which includes donors who are not formal
members of the PAP.


                                                           5

for negotiations with the Government. The PAP group also coordinated General Budget Support
(GBS) 7 for the Government’s five-year development plan (plano quinquenal do governo, PQG)
with a specific focus on poverty reduction. In 2015, the GoM and DPs defined the terms for GBS
in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU specifies the structure for policy dialogue
through two annual meetings, the Annual Review and the Planning Meeting, as well as through a
common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF).8

Mozambique was often cited as a leader in donor coordination, having started the PAP
PAP process in early 2000. The GoM and DPs established the PAP in line with the Paris Aid
Effectiveness Principles and DP commitments to strengthen harmonization and the use of
country systems. The PAP grew quickly from a group of 4 participating DPs to 19 by 2009.9
Despite strong early progress and DP support, however, GBS reached a peak of 34 percent of
total aid in 2007, then declined 24 percent by 2012, due to low levels of control over aid funding,
governance issues, and slow progress on poverty reduction goals.10 Total donor contributions to
GBS have also stagnated in the last few years (see




6
  Donors include African Development Bank (AfDB), Austria, Canada, the European Union (EU), Finland, France,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. See

Table 2 for details.
7
  General Budget Support (GBS) is a type of aid modality which is defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) as “unearmarked contributions to the government budget [… that] are managed
in accordance with the recipient’s budgetary procedures.? GBS, which provides external financing that is both on -
budget and on-treasury, is considered a key tool in promoting country ownership of development, in line with the
aid effectiveness principles established in the Paris Declaration and the Busan Partnership. See the OECD’s
classifications of types of aid: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/44479737.pdf.
8
  The PAP includes several key non-sector working groups such as the Poverty Analysis/Monitoring Systems
(PAMS) and the Budget Analysis Group (BAG) that support the monitoring of PAP progress.

7.      Table 2 for an overview of donor participation and commitments from 2013 to 2015).
Reports on the performance of the GoM and DPs through the PAF document indicate declining
participation rates in the GBS mechanism. 11 The rising importance of nontraditional DPs—
particularly China and Brazil, which have yet to join the PAP process—add to this trend.

8.      The PAP has been supported by 29 thematic and sector-specific working groups
since 2009, including working groups on cross-cutting themes, which include active
engagement from partners outside of the PAP process. Sector working groups were
established as the central coordination mechanism for policy dialogue to guide the PAP process.
The most recent review of the PAP process concluded, however, that this policy dialogue is
fragmented; overly complicated; and does not adequately link research, debate, and policy
development. 12 Starting in 2016, under the new GBS MoU, donor contributions will be
coordinated through 16 subgroups within four working groups: National Systems, Inclusive
Growth, Governance and Accountability, and Effective Service Delivery.

9.      In addition to the PAP process, many donors have collaborated to strengthen
specific sectors through sector budget support or common funds. Common funds provide
donors with an opportunity to channel on-budget support that makes use of country systems and
allows for additional control in ensuring that aid funding is spent effectively.13 Common funds
have been established in education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, roads, social
protection, fisheries, public financial management (PFM), and statistics. Use of common fund
systems has also been in decline, however, as has on-budget project support.14 In the last review
of PAPs’ targets for 2014, for example, only 34 percent of aid provided to Mozambique was
channeled through the national budget, capturing only a small subset of overall donor
engagement.

10.     Sector working groups play an important role leading policy dialogue and technical
collaboration between the Government and DPs, both for PAP donors and other aid
modalities. DPs that provide aid external to the GBS, either through common funds or project
interventions, also engage sector working groups to coordinate activities, ensuring alignment
with government plans and priorities and avoiding duplication with other sector donors. These
working groups, however, often lack the administrative capacity to maintain records of sector-
specific projects and funding, and they vary greatly in their level of institutionalization,
cooperation, and engagement in policy dialogue.

11.     In 2016, support for GBS, common funding, and on-budget funding modalities has
fallen sharply, a direct result of concerns about budget transparency associated with the
discovery in April of previously undisclosed loans and the lack of an agreement with the

11
   European Commission 2014.
12
   European Commission 2014.
13
   Common funds, or basket funds, are accounts for sector-specific or program-specific purposes, which are jointly
managed by DPs and the Government. Common funds are often associated with sectorwide approaches (SWAps),
which have shared project documents, funding contracts, and reporting procedures. Common funds use country
budget systems but may be channeled externally to the treasury using separate accounts. See the OECD’s definitions
of aid modalities in footnote 8.
14
   Project interventions are donor interventions that are channeled outside of government systems, and they may be
reported on- or off-budget, depending on the donor.

International Monetary Fund (IMF). While the GoM has taken steps toward restoring
confidence among DPs, there is little expectation that this will change in the near future. As
such, going forward, GBS funding and common funding mechanisms may see a decline in use
unless the GoM takes measures of paramount importance in addressing fiduciary risks.

I: Agriculture
12.     Background. The main coordination mechanism for agriculture investments is the
donor-led Development Partners Group for Agriculture and Rural Development (AgRED)
Group. AgRED was created in 2011 to replace the donor harmonization arrangements supporting
the prior SWAp, post-Agricultural Sector Strategy and Expenditure Program (Programa de
Desenvolvimento Agrícola, PROAGRI). PROAGRI I and II had been the primary coordination
mechanisms since 1998 and included a common fund to pool resources in support of
Government programs. PROAGRI I, which was completed in 2005, was seen as having
strengthened agricultural institutions, but it was criticized for having had limited efforts on direct
service delivery. PROAGRI II, which was developed in 2006, addressed these concerns;
however, only 8 of the original 15 DPs signed on. The PROAGRI approach was officially
disbanded in May 2011. It was then that the Government developed a new strategic plan for
agriculture in alignment with the regional Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Program (CAADP) approach.15 The Strategy and Plan for Agro-Development (Plano Estratégico
de Desenvolvimento Agrário, PEDSA) and National Agriculture Investment Plan (Plano
Nacional de Investimentos no Sector Agrário, PNISA) were developed as multi-institutional
frameworks to mobilize investments for agriculture and agriculture-supporting activities such as
roads, nutrition, and agricultural education.

13.     Objective. The objective of AgRED is to strengthen the overall development
effectiveness of support provided to the agriculture sector by harmonizing DPs’ interventions
and by promoting coordinated and efficient policy dialogue with the GoM. AgRED’s priorities
include joint dialogue with the Government on operationalizing the CAADP agenda, specifically
implementing the PEDSA and PNISA, exploring co-funding modalities, and improving the PFM
systems in the sector.

14.     Structure. The AgRED group includes approximately 30 agencies and is chaired on a
rotational basis between the World Bank (the current chair), EU, and United States Agency for
International Development (USAID). The group meets monthly and communicates joint
messages to the GoM on a regular basis through heads of mission and the official G-14 dialogue.
The main government counterpart for the group is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security
(Ministério da Agricultura e Segurança Alimentar, MASA), which attends some meetings when
invited to discuss particular topics. AgRED is a single body without any subgroups; however,
such an organizational disaggregation has been proposed by the World Bank as a potential way
to increase technical engagement on issues such as seeds, food security, and agri-business.

15.     Financing coordination. Sector investments are tracked through an MS Excel
spreadsheet, external to ODAmoz, that are categorized by PNISA programs. MASA also has the
mandate to track PNISA implementation, including contributions from DPs and the private
sector, through a multistakeholder coordination mechanism; however, such a group is yet to be
established.

15
   The CAADP is coordinated and driven by the African Union and supported by donors, and it provides a
continent-wide harmonized agriculture development approach. PNISA is the agriculture sector investment plan that
is based on the CAADP program and the policy/strategy PEDSA. Both PEDSA and PNISA are up for review in
2017.

16.    Additional coordination mechanisms. Within the agriculture sector, additional
coordination mechanisms have been established for donor coordination, separate from AgRED,
for the seed subsector, food security, nutrition, land tenure, and growth corridors. 16 These
groups, while operating independently, share many common members with AgRED and have a
stronger focus on technical policy issues rather than donor coordination.

              Research of Mozambique (Instituto de Investigação Agrária de Moçambique, IIAM)
              within MASA and serves as a platform to meet with DPs and solicit support for their
              government programs for seed research and development.

             Food security and nutrition. Coordination on food security and nutrition is done
              through the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (Secretariado
              Técnico de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional, SETSAN), a coordinating body
              within MASA. Food fortification, a key component of the nutrition agenda, is also
              coordinated by the GoM through the National Committee for Food Fortification in
              Mozambique (Comité Nacional para a Fortificação de Alimentos Moçambique,
              CONFAM), which is co-chaired by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
              (Ministério da Indústria e Comércio, MIC) and the Ministry of Health (Ministério
              da Saúde, MISAU).

             Land tenure. The Land Tenure Working Group is a DP-led working group, currently
              chaired by the Netherlands, which convenes ad hoc meetings to share information on
              programs. The working group also coordinates with the National Directorate of
              Land (Direcção Nacional de Terras, DNAT) of the Ministry of Land, Environment,
              and Rural Development (Ministério da Terra, Ambiente e Desenvolvimento Rural,
              MITADER) to discuss options and recommendations on certifying community land
              and transferable land rights (right of use and tenure [Direito do Uso e
              Aproveitamento da Terra, DUATs]).

             Growth corridors. The GoM strongly supports a growth corridor model to facilitate
              private sector agriculture investments. Growth corridors vary in their coordination
              strategy, with some, such as the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BACG) and
              the Zambezi Valley, operating as public-private partnerships (PPPs), and others,
              such as the Triangular Co-operation Program for Agricultural Development of the
              Tropical Savannah in Mozambique (Programa de Cooperação Tripartida para o
              Desenvolvimento Agrícola da Savana Tropical em Moçambique, ProSAVANA), as
              joint Government and DP initiatives. These groups are active in coordinating and
              monitoring regional investments from both DPs and private sector partners.

17.    Conclusions. The agriculture sector faces significant coordination challenges because of
the wide range of coordinating stakeholders, often spanning multiple sectors, which need to
collaborate to support development efforts in agriculture. Stakeholders interviewed deemed the
AgRED group as being effective at coordinating projects among DPs; however, the current

 A coordination body on agri-business had previously been coordinated by SNV Mozambique, a local affiliate of a
Dutch nongovernmental organization (NGO); however, it stopped being active in 2015.

working group structure does not allow for the cross-sectoral collaboration that is needed to
pursue reforms.

18.      Recommendations

         (a) Operationalize the multistakeholder coordination mechanism, which was defined by
             PNISA within MASA but has yet to be operationalized, which will mobilize
             funding, monitor progress, and lead policy dialogue.17

         (b) The GoM and MASA should lead this process and coordination mechanism, as
             AgRED is not a substitute for government leadership on multistakeholder
             coordination with DPs and the private sector on PNISA implementation.

         (c) Strengthen cross-sectoral coordination between agriculture and key partner sectors,
             such as transportation, trade and commerce, and the financial sector, especially on
             specific policy areas, such as agri-business, seeds, or food security, to identify the
             reforms needed to develop the sector.

II: Conservation
19.    Background. The donor coordination group on conservation issues was formed in
response to the GoM’s drafting of the Conservation Areas Law, which was approved in 2014.
DPs formed a platform first to discuss policy issues related to the law and then to present a
united platform to the GoM for discussion, instead of more fragmented forums. Following
passage of the law, this group of DPs has continued to meet informally as a forum to discuss
planned and ongoing projects.

20.    Objective. The original objective of the Conservation Working Group was to allow for a
DP-Government policy dialogue around conservation. However, the group has since taken on a
coordination role for DPs to share research and discuss new and ongoing activities and, instead
of using the working group forum, policy dialogue is often conducted bilaterally between DPs
and the Government.

21.      Structure. The Conservation Working Group is an informal, albeit highly active,
working group. It plays a key role in coordinating sector programs and policy dialogue with the
Government. The EU has taken the coordination lead for the group, although there is no formal
chair appointed, and USAID is also active in supporting coordination efforts. The working group
was not formally established as part of the GBS process, but it coordinates with relevant GoM
institutions, including MITADER’s National Administration for Conservation Areas
(Administração Nacional das ?reas de Conservação, ANAC), the lead institution for
conservation, as well as the National Institute for Tourism (Instituto Nacional do Turismo,
INATUR), which collects data on tourism in protected areas. As many members of the working
group have expressed support for the creation of an independent institution for conservation
issues, there may be the potential for policy dialogue on specific issues through the working
group forum.

22.    Financing coordination. The main financing mechanism for conservation is the
Foundation for the Conservation of Biodiversity trust fund (BioFund), an endowment funding
mechanism established in 2014 and launched in 2015 as part of MozBio, the World Bank’s
Conservation Areas for Biodiversity and Development project. BioFund was established through
the broad support of stakeholders, including bilateral DPs such as Germany, France, and the
United States, as well as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, Conservation International, and the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF).

23.    Additional coordination mechanisms

           Biodiversity and parks. A related donor coordination working group on biodiversity
            and parks coordinates with MITADER. It has not been active of late.

24.    Conclusions. Current informal arrangements for the Conservation Working Group
appear to meet donor coordination objectives as a useful forum for exchanging information.
Nevertheless, the group could potentially be more active on policy dialogue issues.

25.     Recommendations

        (a) Expand the mandate of the Conservation Working Group to discuss policy issues,
            such as the creation of an independent institution, and joint objectives, such as
            raising the profile of conservation issues within the country.

        (b) Secure additional resources and administrative support to ensure success of the
            expanded working group.

III: Education
26.     Background. Donor coordination in the education sector is done through a formalized,
structured working group and SWAp that receives strong leadership and direction from the
Ministry of Education and Human Development (Ministério da Educação e Desenvolvimento
Humano, MINEDH). DP coordination in education has a strong history, starting with an informal
SWAp in 1998. In 2012, DPs signed the first MoU for FASE to support the GoM’s Education
Strategic Plan. A formalized integrated SWAp was established in 2006, along with the second
phase of FASE. In 2012, the Government also established the Terms of Reference (ToR) for
dialogue between the MINEDH and DPs, along with the third phase of FASE, which is now
ongoing. With each iteration of FASE, the MINEDH has emphasized streamlining funding
through FASE, expanding technical dialogue and capacity building, and strengthening financial
monitoring.

27.     Objective. The primary objective of FASE is to provide funding support to the Education
Sector Strategic Plan, which has been extended until 2019. This plan supports primary education,
secondary education, technical and vocational training, and literacy and adult education. Another
objective of FASE is to advance the aid effectiveness agenda: solidifying the MINEDH’s
leadership; ensuring donor alignment with Government priorities; and harmonizing procedures,
information sharing, and common reporting arrangements.

28.    Structure. FASE has a clear and organized structure of working groups and high-level
meetings to facilitate policy and technical dialogue. Partners agree to the responsibility of an
annual rotating chair position, to facilitate coordination within FASE. 18 FASE’s dialogue and
coordination system is extensive and inclusive, and it involves FASE partners, 19 non-FASE
DPs,20 MINEDH and Provincial Education Directorates, and civil society. Working groups are
the main forum for discussion between the Government and DPs, meeting monthly and chaired
by the MINEDH National Directors, with separate groups established based on subsectors 21 and
thematic issues.22 Inputs from these groups are raised at Joint Coordination Committee meetings,
which are also held monthly. They focus on policy dialogue; are chaired by MINEDH’s
Permanent Secretary; and include the DP Chair, National and Provincial Directors, and
representatives from other ministries. 23 Annual Review Meetings, chaired by the Minister of
Education and including all relevant DPs and GoM officials, jointly assess progress from the
previous year and make plans for the following year. FASE also includes a system for parallel
coordination meetings between DPs, separate from the Government, including weekly
coordination meetings to monitor implementation, monthly thematic meetings, and cooperating
18
   For example, in 2015, Finland was the chair, sharing responsibilities with the outgoing chair, United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the incoming chair for the following year, Germany.
19
   FASE partners include Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, UNICEF, and the World Bank.
20
   Non-FASE partners are DFID; USAID; JICA; International Labor Organization (ILO); United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and
Deutscher Volkshochschul-Verband (DVV) International.
21
   Sector Working Groups include Primary Education, Secondary Education, Higher Education, Technical and
Vocational Education, Literacy and Adult Education, and Administrative and Institutional Development.
22
   Thematic Working Groups include Planning and Financial Management, Human Resources Development,
Teacher Training, School Construction, and Cross-cutting Issues.
23
   Twice a year, an Extended Joint Coordination Committee meeting is held to include all DPs, which is also chaired
by the Permanent Secretary.

partners’ meetings to strengthen donor harmonization. FASE’s system of working groups and
coordination meetings, along with on-budget support and common reporting mechanisms, has
met all of its established objectives to date.

29.     Financing coordination. FASE provides the core framework for DP financing in the
education sector, with 86 percent of DP funding channeled through this on-budget SWAp
financing mechanism in 2016. Internal Government funding accounts for 87 percent of total
spending, along with 2 percent that is financed through off-budget bilateral projects. Total FASE
investment levels had been increasing over the last decade, reaching almost US$140 million in
2014; however, this dropped in 2015 to only US$45 million. The World Bank has been the
largest financing partner for FASE, contributing 47 percent of all external financing since 2013.
In addition to the on-budget contributions of FASE partners, FASE is also beginning to pilot
results-based financing mechanisms, with targets linked to disbursements.24

30.     Additional coordination mechanisms. FASE requires close coordination with other line
ministries, and the FASE coordination structure was developed to include partner ministries as
part of the dialogue process. In practice, however, some ministries have been less active in
coordinating on technical levels, which raises challenges for DPs trying to implement programs
and policies in these areas.

31.    Conclusions. Overall, FASE appears to be a well-defined, effective, and inclusive
mechanism for donor coordination, policy dialogue, and pooled financing. FASE does face
challenges, many of which have been identified as part of its own monitoring and evaluation
process.

32.      Recommendations

         (a) Ensure greater ministerial coordination with FASE at the technical levels.

         (b) The MINEDH seeks to leverage DPs’ experience more upstream of the policy
             formulation process. Despite the robust system for policy coordination, in some
             cases, DPs have only limited consultation with the MINEDH during the policy
             development process. Policies are often presented to DPs only when they are
             approved, which is often too late to provide substantive feedback.

IV: Environment and Climate Change
33.      Background. The Environment and Climate Change Working Group (ECCWG) is the
donor coordination group established as part of the GBS process to coordinate support to
Mozambique’s efforts to address climate change and environmental policy. Mozambique’s key
strategy document guiding policy is the National Strategy for Gender, Environment, and Climate
Change, approved in 2010.25 Environmental and climate change issues are cross-cutting, with
important policy and implementation roles for other sector line ministries, such as agriculture,
energy, infrastructure/roads, and the management of coastal areas. Donor coordination in these
areas originally began as part of GBS, when an Environmental Working Group (EWG) was
established in 2007 to be chaired by the Ministry of Coordination of Environmental Affairs
(Ministério para a Coordenação da Acção Ambiental, MICOA) and include cross-sector
representation, including DPs, civil society, and the private sector. While the EWG was slow to
institutionalize, a parallel DP working group was established to harmonize policy dialogue
between DPs and the GoM, which by 2010 had become more active than the original EWG.26
The World Bank coordinates prior actions for its ongoing Development Policy Operation (DPO)
with the working group members. Members also coordinate on the development of local
adaption plans that have been developed in 35–40 districts.

34.     Objective. The objective of the ECCWG is to facilitate discussion among DPs on
ongoing and planned programs. The ECCWG plays a limited role for sector policy dialogue,
however, and coordination takes place predominantly between DPs, with only limited
coordination with the Government. Much of the sector coordination on policy issues and strategy
takes place informally, outside of the ECCWG meetings.

35.    Structure. The ECCWG is a formalized working group of approximately 20 DPs. The
working group was previously supported by the Netherlands and then the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA), and it is currently chaired by UNDP, which also provides
administrative support. Meetings are held every 2–3 months. The main Government counterpart
is MICOA. However, representatives from MITADER; MASA; Ministry of Public Works and
Housing (Ministério da Obras Públicas e Habitação, MOPH); Ministry of Mineral Resources
and Energy (Ministério dos Recursos Minerais e Energia, MIREME); Ministry of Fisheries; and
the National Institute of Disaster Management (Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades,
INGC) also attend.

36.    Financing coordination. Budget support dialogue was the main coordination mechanism
for DPs; however, in recent years, as budget support has declined, this is now changing. UNDP
requests that DPs submit data on their budget support and off-budget projects and maintains this
database for the working group. On-budget support is managed through the Ministry of Economy
and Finances (Ministério da Economia e Finanças, MEF); however, it is not clear whether the
MEF is also collecting data on off-budget project investments. The World Bank is currently
supporting a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review of Climate Change with MITADER,

25
   Climate change is also a key component of Component V in the Government’s PQG, which focuses on disaster
risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

which will draw on ODAmoz and, when completed, will be circulated with the ECCWG. There
have yet to be any discussions among DPs on the possibility of pooled funding mechanisms.

37.     Additional coordination mechanisms

            Forestry. A donor coordination group on forestry used to meet regularly, but it has
             not been active in recent years. USAID and Sweden have previously been active in
             sector coordination, and the World Bank is currently exploring options to provide
             technical support to the WWF for strengthening sector coordination. A Forest
             Investment Program (FIP) is being developed by the World Bank and other DPs,
             including DFID; a coordination mechanism would be essential in starting policy
             dialogue with the Government on this initiative. The main institutional partner for
             the forestry sector is MITADER, which was previously part of MASA; some areas
             of responsibility, such as forestry plantations, have yet to be clearly delegated.

            Public sector inter-ministerial coordination. Concerns have been raised about the
             effectiveness of public sector inter-ministerial coordination on climate change. The
             National Council for Sustainable Development (Conselho Nacional de
             Desenvolvimento Sustentável, CONDES) is the institution within the GoM that
             should be coordinating cross-sector dialogue on environmental policy, including
             climate change, conservation, and reforestation. Previous assessments, however,
             have concluded that it has yet to fulfil this mandate.27

38.    Conclusions. The current structure and functions of the ECCWG appear to be fulfilling
its core mandate for donor coordination. There may be untapped potential, however, in
expanding the role of the working group to include policy dialogue with the GoM.

39.     Recommendations

        (a) Expand the mandate of the ECCWG to allow for policy dialogue, particularly
            around forest management and climate change, that would help direct policy
            discussions and expand engagement with Government partners.

        (b) MICOA should take a more proactive role in guiding the agenda of the working
            group to address sector priorities, as well as discuss the possibility of pooled funding
            mechanisms. Strengthened leadership from the Government could help ensure that
            donor investments are aligned with the GoM’s planning and priorities.

V: Fisheries
40.      Background. Mozambique has a long history of donor support in the fisheries sector,
with cooperation with Norway starting after independence in 1975. The fisheries sector had a
predominant role after independence until the end of the civil war, as a major contributor to
public revenues and source of subsistence for scattered coastal populations. The sector’s relative
socioeconomic importance decreased as the economy took off following the formal end of
hostilities; however, it remains important for coastal populations, while the industry’s
contribution to economic growth remains somewhat untapped. That being said, the small number
of DPs operating in the sector simplifies coordination between DPs and the GoM.

41.     Objective. The objective of the Fisheries Donor Coordination Meetings is to share
information on DP projects and activities. DPs have also explored questions on how to improve
the results of programs during such meetings.

42.     Structure. The Ministry of Fisheries, 28 which manages departments and institutes on
policy, fisheries management, and the promotion and development of fisheries, was responsible
for coordinating alignment of DP projects with Government priorities. Activities within the
fisheries sector are made in alignment with the Fisheries Master Plan II 2010–2019. Donor
coordination in the fisheries sector was until recently done through two main groups: National
Fishery Coordination, a donor-government coordination body, and the Fishery Donor
Coordination Meetings, which are organized by DPs. Norway chairs the donor coordination
efforts within the sector, which has 16 participating DPs. Other key DPs include Iceland, JICA,
the European Commission (EC), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
Belgium, and AfDB. The ToR for the coordination group was developed, providing guidance for
three working group meetings per year with the Ministry of Fisheries’ Permanent Secretary;
annual meetings to review the Economic and Social Plan (Plano Económico e Social, PES); joint
missions; and ad hoc task forces. In practice, meetings have not been regular and are called
usually on an ad hoc basis during DP missions.

43.     Financing coordination. In 2013, DPs had 16 projects with a total of US$105 million in
support of the sector.29 Norway is a lead DP in the fisheries sector, leading the Support to the
Fisheries Sector of Mozambique project (2013–2017), with joint funding from Iceland and the
GoM. Norway and Iceland had previously managed a common fund; however, there are no
overall SWAp coordinating efforts in the sector. Individual DP projects are tracked through the
donor coordination group with a spreadsheet that is circulated in the group. The Fisheries
Development Fund, a financial institution to provide credit to fisheries, had previously collected
information on external partner investments, but it has not been active in this role in recent years.

44.    Additional coordination mechanisms. As part of decentralization, the responsibility for
implementing fisheries activities has devolved to district administrations and the District
Services of Economic Affairs (Serviços Distritais das Atividades Económicas, SDAE). The
28
   The Ministry of Sea, Internal Waters, and Fisheries (Ministério do Mar, Aguas Interiores e Pescas, MIMAIP)
replaced the Ministry of Fisheries; however, these arrangements have yet to be confirmed.

Ministry of Fisheries had been active in trying to strengthen SDAE capacity on fisheries, and
recent years have seen increasing coordination taking place between partners and the
Government at the district level.

45.      Conclusions. Public sector leadership in the fisheries sector, which is linked to
institutional capacity, is limited. DPs agree that this needs to be strengthened; however, it is
unclear what they can do without a more general commitment from the GoM.

46.     Recommendations

        (a) Hold more regular, structured meetings of the Fisheries Donor Coordination Group
            to improve organization of the sector and better engage partners on policy issues,
            addressing the limited engagement of DPs on policy issues.

        (b) The Fisheries Donor Coordination Group should establish stronger connections to
            other groups, including agriculture and conservation, given the important role of
            fisheries in the strategies of other sectors (such as PNISA for agriculture).

VI: Health
47.     Background. DP coordination in Mozambique’s health sector is mainly focused around
the Health SWAp. The health sector receives high levels of external assistance, as well as a large
variety of DP and NGO implementers of health programs. Despite this coordination challenge,
the Health SWAp is a well-defined, organized system to coordinate among DPs and between
DPs and the Government. The SWAp includes 26 DPs, 14 of which also originally joined in the
common funding mechanism, ProSAUDE. Annual partner contributions to the Health SWAp are
tracked in the External Funds Survey (Inquérito dos Fundos Externo, IFE), an annual data
collection effort by MISAU to capture DP financial commitments and disbursements in the
health sector; the IFE has been ongoing since 2007. Commitments, investments, and projects are
tracked annually and reported as part of an Annual Joint Evaluation.

48.    Objective. The objective of the Health SWAp is to support coordination across
Government, DPs, and NGOs to implement the Health Sector Strategic Plan (Plano Estratégico
do Sector da Saúde, PESS) 2014–2019, which aims to gradually transition to universal health
coverage. The SWAp also aims to reduce donor fragmentation and off-budget spending,
although recent worries about the integrity of the Government’s PFM system and procurement
processes have led several DPs to pull out of the common fund mechanism.30

49.     Structure. The key partner institution for health sector coordination is MISAU. The
Health Partners Coordination Framework provides the basic framework for formal DP
coordination in the health sector. Meetings are held at three levels: (a) working groups and ad
hoc task groups, which are chaired by MISAU Directors and Department Heads; 31 (b) Joint
Coordination Committee meetings that meet every 1–2 months, chaired by MISAU’s Permanent
Secretary;32 and (c) a Sector Coordination Committee, which meets biannually, is chaired by the
Minister of Health, and co-chaired by a representative from the DPs’ working group. The sector
also has a Health Partners Group, specifically for intra-donor coordination, which is currently
chaired by USAID and co-chaired by the UNFPA. The Health Partners Group chair position
rotates every two years.

50.    Financing coordination. Health sector funding is either channeled through PROSAUDE
or into vertical projects (on-budget and off-budget). Harmonizing procedures has been a
challenge within the sector; despite donor commitments, the common fund has declined from
US$100 million, at the start of the program, to US$35 million currently, with more funding now
channeled through vertical projects. In 2013, 33 percent of external health financing was off-


30
   Of the original 14 members of PROSAUDE, the SWAp’s common funding mechanism, only 5 are currently
contributing to the common fund.
31
   Working group meetings provide forums to discuss thematic and policy issues within the health sector. Current
working groups include (a) Human Resources for Health (co-chaired by DFID); (b) Medicines; (c) Administration
and Financing Framework (co-chaired by Canada); and (d) Planning, Infrastructure, and Monitoring and Evaluation
(co-chaired by the World Health Organization [WHO] with support from Canada). Co-chairing roles at the working
group level have no set time limit or schedule for rotation.
32
   This group includes the Heads of Directorates and Departments, as well as representatives from the DP working
groups. Issues discussed include human resources, administration, planning, monitoring and evaluation, and
endemic diseases.

budget.33 Despite the challenges of the common funding mechanism, however, the SWAp has
provided a strong policy coordination mechanism for DPs. PROSAUDE partners are currently
working on a manual to provide guidance on sector investments for partners. IFE is the central
data collection mechanism for all health partners, both those contributing to PROSAUDE and
external projects, although some challenges to the data coverage and quality remain. The system
allows for the alignment of expenditures to specific health categories (defined in PESS),
provision of information on current and future investments, and management of data quality,
such as the potential for project duplicates. An effort was made among PROSAUDE partners to
encourage the use of ODAmoz to collect and share data on DP commitments and investments;
however, many DPs resisted this effort. Concerns were raised about the purpose of the database,
technical details about entering information, and potential overlap with existing reporting
requirements for including projects in the Government’s e-SISTAFE.

51.     Additional coordination mechanisms

            HIV/AIDS. As an important subsector for health, HIV/AIDS has a separate
             coordination mechanism that links to the Health SWAp. The Pre-Partners Forum is a
             partners group for bilateral and multilateral DPs, civil society, and the private sector.
             The Forum has three levels of coordination, with similar engagement on policy and
             technical discussions as the overall health sector. The National Council for
             Sustainable Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Sustentável,
             CNCS) leads coordination in this area, which is included in the overall framework of
             the Health SWAp.

            Nutrition. A separate working group on nutrition issues coordinates closely with
             health sector partners, along with the agriculture and other sectors. This working
             group is also mentioned under the Agriculture section of this report.

            NAIMA+. Many international NGOs and local NGOs coordinate activities in the
             health sector through the network of NGOs working on health and HIV. This
             network is a coordination and lobbying body and does not implement programs.

52.     Conclusions. While the Health SWAp is highly developed, harmonizing donor
procedures and activities remains a challenge. Additionally, the current system for tracking
health investments, IFE, functions effectively, but there are limitations to the data collected.

53.     Recommendations

        (a) Adjust or expand IFE categories to use more than just PESS fields, to better allow
            for reporting of provincial and district activities. As is, IFE data cannot distinguish
            funding channeled through NGOs to subnational levels or direct funding provided to
            subnational spending units.

        (b) Link IFE data to government accounting systems to facilitate its use by MISAU
            during annual planning and budgeting processes.

                percent of all spending is implemented directly by DPs.

VII: Infrastructure (Roads)
54.     Background. Donor coordination on transportation issues is conducted through two main
coordination mechanisms: a donor coordination group and the coordination for the road sector
SWAp. While there is no overall transportation strategy for the country, coordination on roads is
more structured and institutionalized. The Integrated Road Sector Program (Programa Integrado
do Sector de Estradas, PRISE) was established in 2006 as a SWAp to develop the road network,
including capital investments and maintenance operations. 34 PRISE’s first three-year rolling
investment program (2007–2009) had more than US$1 billion in commitments from the 19
DPs.35 PRISE functions as a critical coordination mechanism for DPs to discuss sector activities,
as well as a forum to discuss plans with Government representatives at the provincial level. A
review of the Road Sector Strategy (RSS) in 2014 showed the program meeting targets for
capital investments on the primary road network. In addition to PRISE coordination, DPs also
have a separate coordination group, the Road Sector Working Group (RSWG), which was
established as part of the GBS process.36

55.  Objective. The objective of PRISE is to support the implementation of priorities in the
RSS.

56.     Structure. PRISE’s main coordination mechanism is biannual meetings of DPs and
Government representatives to review plans, progress, and sector challenges. PRISE is
implemented by the National Roads Administration (Administração Nacional de Estradas,
ANE), a semiautonomous institution within the MOPH. ANE takes an active leadership role in
ensuring DPs are aligned with sector priorities. As part of Mozambique’s overall decentralization
strategy, ANE has established provincial offices that have development provincial road
strategies, which can also be the basis for DP support. 37 Reporting on PRISE investments is
coordinated by an independent state-owned enterprise, Maputo Sud. In addition to PRISE
coordination, the RSWG also holds 1–2 additional annual meetings, with comments from DPs
consolidated by the Chair and presented during PRISE coordination meetings. The EU currently
chairs the donor group, which has also been previously chaired by the World Bank and AfDB.38
Nontraditional donors have also made significant investments in the sector, such as the US$1.2
billion invested in the sector by China; however, these investments are less coordinated with
PRISE or the donor coordination group.

57.    Financing coordination. The Road Fund within the MOPH is responsible for PRISE
resource allocation and financial management. It tracks all commitments and investments
34
   PRISE had commitments from DPs on a common sector policy, strategy, and investment plan; common financing
arrangements for overhead and maintenance, common financial management, and procurement procedures; and a
common reporting and monitoring system with joint supervision missions.

Nations (UN), USAID, and bilateral agencies such as Sweden and Portugal.

through e-SISTAFE. For DPs, the PRISE SWAp is the main financial coordination mechanism.
Since establishment, however, actual investments have been below commitments, and many
programs are implemented through tradition project arrangements: as of 2010, only 5 percent of
funding for PRISE is through the common fund.39 The PRISE financial mechanisms faced some
challenges in 2012, especially in procurement, that caused implementation delays. These
arrangements were restructured, and the scope narrowed, which allowed the PRISE process to
continue. Some DPs have also failed to meet their financing commitments to PRISE, forcing the
Government to turn to alternatives and private sector funding to fill gaps.

58.    Additional coordination mechanisms. PRISE has strong coordination with the MOPH
and the MEF, both of which sit on the board of the Road Fund. Connections to other line
ministry sectors are more limited, however, even in sectors that have important links to
transportation development, such as rural development, agriculture, and conservation.

59.      Conclusions. Challenges exist related to the coordination of investments with
nontraditional donors, as well as increasing PPPs and whether PRISE is capturing contingent
liabilities related to these investments.

60.     Recommendations

        (a) ANE should encourage nontraditional donors to coordinate with the SWAp.

        (b) ANE and DPs should collaborate to channel more sector funding through the
            common fund. The World Bank transportation team is working with the BOOST
            team on conducting a Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping of PRISE
            financial data, allowing real-time reporting of PRISE investments, which may
            strengthen DP awareness and coordination across the sector.

when established, DP contributions were to be around US$709 million of the total US$1 billion, of which US$114
million would be channeled through a pooled fund and the remaining funding implemented through traditionally
dedicated projects.

VIII: Public Financial Management
61.    Background. Following the approval of the PFM Reform Law (SISTAFE) in 2002,
much of the technical assistance to the sector has been coordinated by DPs to support effective
implementation of the law, including the IFMIS, e-SISTAFE. In 2012, the Government adopted
the PFM Vision 2025, which provides strategic orientation for PFM reform processes. PFM
reforms are also closely linked to the PAP process and the push for increased use of GBS, as
many DPs require strong PFM systems as a prerequisite for engaging in GBS.

62.   Objective. The objective of the PFM Coordination Group is to coordinate support for
PFM systems and harmonize donors’ engagement with the GoM.

63.     Structure. The PFM Coordination Group is chaired by the GoM’s Treasury and one DP,
currently the SWE. The IMF also currently serves as co-chair. The group meets regularly to
share information, prevent duplication in projects, and coordinate long-term technical assistance.
Eighteen DPs currently participate in the forum. The PFM Coordination Group also has
subgroups on budget analysis, e-SISTAFE, procurement, audits, and decentralization and service
delivery.

64.    Financing coordination. Information on ongoing and pipeline projects is collected in an
Excel spreadsheet that is circulated among DPs. The most recent mapping, conducted in 2015,
estimates over US$100 million in funding for 2014–2017.40

65.     Additional coordination mechanisms. PFM reforms are linked to line ministries and
service delivery issues. Other sectors, such as health, also have subgroups on sector-specific
PFM issues. Many DPs engaging with PFM issues are also members of relevant sector working
groups to reinforce the links between upstream PFM reforms and downstream service delivery
issues.

66.    Conclusions. The PFM Coordination Group appears to fulfil its core function of
coordinating DP activities; however, the financial tracking of projects could be improved.

67.     Recommendations

        (a) The PFM Coordination Group should establish expectations of more timely and
            disaggregated financial data on ongoing and pipeline projects.

IX: Social Protection
68.     Background. Coordination in the social protection sector is conducted through the Social
Action Working Group (SAWG), convened as part of the GBS process. Previously, DPs had
engaged in discussions about a potential common fund for the sector. As they came to an
agreement on the appropriate sector approach, however, no common fund was ever established.
The main government strategy on social protection is the National Strategy for Basic Social
Security (ENSSB), which was developed in 2009. The key government institutions responsible
for social protection are the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Welfare (MGCAS),
specifically the National Institute for Social Action (INAS). DPs also have an informal donor
coordination group, chaired by DFID.

69.     Objective. The objective of the SAWG is to provide an information-sharing platform for
DP activities. Policy dialogue has also been a strong aspect of previous meetings; however, key
differences emerged between DPs on their policy approaches.

70.     Structure. The SAWG meets every 1–2 months, on an ad hoc basis. Main meetings are
held jointly between the Government and DPs, with additional meetings held for coordination
among DPs. Meetings are currently chaired by MGCAS and co-chaired by UNICEF, with plans
for DFID to take on the co-chair role in 2018; the group has a system for rotating the chair
position between organizations every two years. Key DPs include the WFP, DFID, Netherlands,
Sweden, USAID, ILO, EU, Irish Aid, and civil society representatives.

71.    Financing coordination. Information on sector projects are coordinated on an annual
basis by the working group chairs. Information is collected on committed, disbursed, and
undisbursed funding. While it is not yet collected, some DPs also see the need to collect
information on the share of operational costs associated with the different DP program models.
Financing coordination also takes place between partners who are part of the UN Joint Program.
MGCAS also plays a role in coordination projects as part of the annual planning process.

72.    Additional coordination mechanisms

           UN Joint Program Coordination. Several DPs that participate in the UN Joint
            Program also have a separate coordination mechanism specific to that program.

73.    Conclusions. Without strong leadership from the Government, many DPs are pursing
separate approaches to social protection programs, for example social assistance subsidies,
employment generation, targeting systems, or transfer systems.

74.    Recommendations

       (a) The GoM should exert stronger leadership to ensure that differences among DPs no
           longer stymie the potential for the SAWG to play an effective role in sector policy
           dialogue. Most DPs are increasingly aligning the design of new interventions to the
           national priorities set under the ENSSB, as a result of the improved sector
           coordination led by MGCAS. However, alignment to Government priorities can

              have limited benefits if a harmonization in approaches from DPs does not happen.
              This has created significant fragmentation and limited sustainability of interventions.

        (b) The SAWG should encourage INAS and DPs to collaborate in the collection and
            management of key missing data needed to establish social protection systems, such
            as consumption measures and other poverty measures, while also considering the
            climate vulnerability dimension.

X: Water and Sanitation
75.     Background. Donor coordination in the sector is conducted through multiple
coordination forums. GAS was established as part of the GBS and PAP process, which includes
bilateral donors, multilateral organizations, and large NGOs.41 The sector is divided into two key
subsectors supported by DPs: water supply and sanitation and integrated water resources
management. In 2010, DPs formed a SWAp to address rural water supply and sanitation, the
National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program (Programa Nacional de Abastecimento de
?gua e Saneamento, PRONASAR). PRONASAR includes a common fund to pool donor
funding, which initially had commitments from the Netherlands, DFID, UNICEF, Canada, and
SDC. 42 PRONASAR also includes Joint Annual Reviews to assess sector performance. In
addition, a sector donor coordination group, chaired by DFID, meets twice a year to discuss
sector policies and budget allocations. Information on the overall functioning of the water and
sanitation system is collected in the Information System for Water and Sanitation (SINAS);
however, this tool is not updated regularly by provincial and district authorities.

76.     Objective. The objective of GAS is to align DP support with the Government’s PQG and
the 1995 National Water Policy and the National Water Development Program (NWDP), as well
as to discuss and evaluate sector progress and review key sector issues.

77.     Structure. GAS is chaired by the National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation
(DNAAS) in the Ministry of Public Works (Ministério das obras Públicas, MOPHRH) and is
currently co-chaired by DFID. The forum meets at least once a month and is a forum for
Government-sector DPs’ discussions around development progress in the sector. GAS has two
subgroups: water supply and sanitation is coordinated by UNICEF and the subgroup for
integrated water management is coordinated by the Netherlands and the South Korea
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) since 2016.

78.    Financing coordination. DP commitments and disbursements are not tracked within
GAS or any other donor coordination mechanism nor are DPs using ODAmoz. The PRONASAR
common fund does provide a coordination mechanism for participating DPs; however, overall
contributions to the common fund have been decreasing. In 2015, only US$3.5 million was
contributed by DPs, a 53 percent decrease from the 2014 levels.43

79.    Additional coordination mechanisms. As part of NWDPII, a donor coordination group
was established to conduct a joint analysis of water objectives in Mozambique’s Action Plan for
the Production of Absolute Poverty (Plano de Acção para a Redução da Pobreza Absoluta,
PARPA). A few coordination meetings on this project have been held with the participation of
the World Bank, AfDB, the Netherlands, DFID, and France. An additional group on Hydraulic

   Key partners include the SDC, Canada, JICA, the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank, and
UNICEF. International NGOs include CARE, Helvetas, and WaterAid; the private sector company Cowater is also
involved.
42
   AfDB and other partners also provided additional funding outside of the common funding mechanism. See

Resources (GRH) was established in 2016, which includes bilateral donors (JICA, World Bank,
KOICA, DFID, and GIZ).

80.   Conclusions. Current coordination mechanisms do not appear to be sufficient to support
harmonization of DP activities in the water sector.

81.     Recommendations

        (a) DPs and the DNAAS should coordinate on the potential creation of a SWAp, as
            current coordination mechanisms do not appear to be sufficient to support the
            harmonization of DP activities.

        (b) In the absence of other viable financial coordination mechanisms, DPs should be
            encouraged to engage and support the PRONASAR common fund mechanism,
            given its success in improving coordination.

        (c) The DNA should provide clearer guidance and leadership to ensure that DPs do not
            pursue their own agendas instead of aligning with Government priorities.

        (d) GAS should encourage better data reporting by DPs, as well as by provincial and
            district offices, on water supply, coverage, and completed works, as the sector’s
            monitoring and evaluation systems are weak.

        (e) Relatedly, GAS should seek out additional support to strengthen the Government’s
            information collection and use, to improve the effectiveness of donor engagements.

Annex III: Comparison of Aid Data Collection Tools
Estimates of total DP commitments vary by the aid data collection tool. Figure 1 presents a
comparison of the four key data collection tools for donor commitments used in Mozambique:
sector spreadsheets, e-SISTAFE, 44 PAP donor commitments to sector common funds, and
ODAmoz.45 This comparison is limited to three sectors (agriculture, health, and PFM), as most
sector spreadsheets do not include annual estimates of donor commitments.

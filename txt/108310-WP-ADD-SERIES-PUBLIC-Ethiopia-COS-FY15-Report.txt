I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Ethiopia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Ethiopia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Ethiopia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April to May 2015, 290 stakeholders of the WBG in Ethiopia were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments or implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 146 stakeholders participated in
the survey (50% response rate).

Some respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in
person, and others received and returned the questionnaires via post or email. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Ethiopia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Ethiopia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate was 53%, N=326). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 101).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the Office of the President/
       Prime Minister were combined with those from the Office of Minister; respondents from
       ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants
       working on WBG supported projects were combined; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations. Few
       respondents from local governments, independent government institutions, office of
       parliamentarian, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the media were included in the
       “Other? category. Note that there were no respondents from private foundations, trade
       unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower
        ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean familiarity = 6.2) compared to respondents
        from the FY ’12 country survey (mean familiarity = 6.8)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Ethiopia, the extent to which the
        WBG achieves development results in Ethiopia, and the extent to which the WBG plays a
        relevant role in development in Ethiopia.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Ethiopia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Ethiopia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Ethiopia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

The World Bank Group’s Work in Ethiopia: Year Comparison9
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and in the FY’12 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of agreement with these three statements about the
        WBG’s work in Ethiopia.
       Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from the Office of the
        President/Prime Minister/Minister had the highest levels of agreement with these three
        statements, whereas respondents from NGOs/Community-Based Organizations had

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 315  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 131

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

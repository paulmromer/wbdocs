Abstract

       Linkages between the real and financial sectors in an economy can lead to a buildup of
balance sheet mismatches of key entities‚Äîcorporates, financial institutions, households, and the
public sector. Once such imbalances have built up, they can make the economy vulnerable to
macroeconomic shocks, whether external or domestic in origin. This paper discusses the key
mismatches that can make entities vulnerable to shocks and how such vulnerability can build up
during the business cycle. Against this backdrop, the paper then discusses a framework and
potential indicators that may be useful to monitor such developments. These indicators are being
developed as part of the MFM macro-financial monitoring effort.

I. Introduction
        This paper discusses how linkages between the real and financial sectors can lead to a
buildup of balance sheet mismatches of key entities‚Äîcorporates, financial institutions,
households, and the public sector and how, once such imbalances have built up, they can make the
economy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, whether external or domestic in origin 1. Against
this backdrop it discusses potential indicators that may be useful to monitor such developments.
These indicators are being developed as part of the MFM macro-financial monitoring effort2.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief discussion of the risks
associated with these different balance sheet mismatches. Section III discusses how positive
shocks in the real sector‚Äîsuch as an upturn in domestic business cycles (which in turn are often
instigated or accompanied by external developments such as capital inflows)‚Äîcan interact with
the financial sector and lead to a build-up of balance sheet mismatches. Section IV then describes
how, once such vulnerability has been built up, a negative shock can lead to a downward spiral of
credit contraction and economic downturns. Finally, section V discusses a possible set of
indicators for measuring the buildup of vulnerability.

II. Vulnerability to different risks arising from balance sheet mismatches
        Although there are several types of risks that financial and non-financial entities are
typically exposed to (and many different ways of categorizing such risks), for the purposes of
analyzing the potential impact of macroeconomic shocks on balance sheets there are four key risks
that are relevant. These are: systematic or market risk (risks associated with changes in systematic
factors such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity or other asset prices), liquidity risks (or funding
risks), capital structure risks and solvency risks3. The three former risks are closely related and
may all lead to the risk of insolvency when the net worth of the entity becomes negative. (Note
that debtors‚Äô insolvency risk is credit risk from the perspective of creditors).

        These risks tend to arise because of balance sheet mismatches. Thus maturity mismatches
in the balance sheets (where typically assets are long-term and liabilities are short-term) create
interest risks for the debtor (the risk that the level and/or structure of interest rates that the debtor
has to pay on its outstanding stock changes), as well as liquidity risks. Currency mismatches are
caused by a disparity in the currencies in which the assets and liabilities are denominated and give
rise to exchange rate risks. Capital structure mismatches result from relying excessively on debt
financing rather than equity. Excessive reliance on debt financing‚Äîincluding on short-term debt‚Äî
can give rise not only to maturity mismatch (hence interest rate risks) but also funding/liquidity
risks. The absence of an equity buffer can lead to financial distress when a sector encounters a
shock. While payments from equity are state contingent, with profits and dividends falling in bad
times, debt service payments generally remain unchanged in bad times. Table 1 summarizes these
risks and balance sheet mismatches.

1 Vulnerability can be defined as a susceptibility to loss resulting from a system‚Äôs exposure to negative shocks, internal cond itions
and risk management‚Äîthe latter being the process that involves confronting risk either ex ante (preparing for shocks) or ex post
(coping with their effects).

3 Other risks include operational risk associated with problems of processing, settling or taking or making delivery on trades in

exchange for cash; Counterparty risks from non-performance of trading partner; Legal risk endemic in financial contracting and
are separate from the legal ramifications of credit, counterparty and operational risks.

III. How Macro Financial Linkages can lead to a buildup of balance sheet mismatches during
an economic upturn
      While there may be many channels through which entities‚Äô balance sheets can become
vulnerable, a common mechanism is through the interaction of real business cycles and the
financial sector. In fact, the financial sector is inherently pro-cyclical, and amplifies cycles in the
real sector (business cycles). Thus, during an economic upturn, domestic credit to the private
sector increases rapidly, while during an economic downturn, credit increases less rapidly or even
decreases. Some of the variation in the size of banking assets can be accounted for by fluctuations
in the size of the pool of positive Net Present Value (NPV) projects that banks can finance. But
some of the fluctuations in credit extension are caused by shifts in banks‚Äô willingness to take on
risky positions over the cycle‚Äîi.e. due to changes in banks‚Äô risk appetites. When the bank manages
the size of its loan book so that its risk weighted assets are maintained to be equal to its capital,
and the bank assesses that the risks of lending have declined, it can expand its lending without
breaching its minimum capital requirements. Conversely, when the bank assesses that the risks of
lending have risen, it will reduce its lending in order to maintain the level of risk weighted assets
equal to its minimum capital requirements.

      Consider what happens during a domestic economic boom4. Such a boom could arise for
instance with a surge of capital inflows and/or low global interest rates, or other external positive
developments or due to positive domestic factors. If asset prices rise with the boom, as is generally
the case, the bank‚Äôs capital is bolstered by increased profitability of the bank, or the capital gains
implied by the increase in asset prices. This constitutes a positive shock to the bank‚Äôs equity. If the
bank were to target a fixed leverage ratio, the positive shock to equity would cause the bank to
expand the size of its balance sheet5. Generally though, banks actively manage their balance sheets,
through for instance, the use of value-at-risk (VaR) models. In this case, banks will actually
increase their leverage‚Äîand expand the size of their balance sheets even more‚Äîduring a boom
because measured risks decline during a boom. In addition there is the possibility of feedback‚Äî
the higher demand for assets by banks and other financial intermediaries puts further upward
pressure on asset prices, which in turn strengthen banks‚Äô balance sheets once again and leads to
even greater demand for assets. Conversely, during a downturn, banks‚Äô desired leverage declines6,
and they contract their balance sheets, pushing asset prices down further. Thus, unlike other
investors, banks (and other financial intermediaries) have perverse portfolio choice behavior‚Äî
because their asset holdings depend on their ‚Äúbalance sheet capacity‚Äù and balance sheet capacity
increases during booms, banks‚Äô demand for an asset tends to rise when the price of the asset rises
(and falls when the price of the asset falls).

       The asset price increases also raise collateral values of households and corporates and
increased the demand for credit. With the improved economic outlook, there is also likely to be
increased consumption and investment (although much of this investment could be directed
towards real estate and other less productive investments which would further contribute to asset
4 Note that this boom can arise either due to domestic business cycle conditions or due to external conditions (including capital
inflows that are driven by global liquidity conditions and interest rate differentials).
5 For example, assume that initial balance sheet is $100 of assets in marketable securities financed by $90 of debt and $10 of equity,

so leverage (Assets/Equity) is 100/10=10. If price of securities rises by 1% to $101, leverage falls to 9.18 (101/11). If bank targets
a fixed leverage of 10, it must increase its debt by $9 so as to increase leverage back up to 10 ((101+D)/11)=10 which implies
additional D of $9).
6 That is to say, banks‚Äô leverage itself is pro-cyclical. See H. Shin (2013). ‚ÄúAdapting Macro Prudential Approaches to Emerging

and Developing Economies‚Äù in ‚ÄúDealing with the Challenges of Macro Financial Linkages in Emerging Markets‚Äù O. Canuto and
S. Ghosh eds.

                                                                  3
price increases). Output increases and expectations of future asset price increases can provide a
further impetus to banks‚Äô desire to increase the size of their balance sheet and extend credit. This
cycle is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

        During the boom, the balance sheet of financial institutions, corporates and households can
become vulnerable to different types of risks. First, as banks seek to expand their lending, they are
likely to finance projects of increasingly lower net present value, i.e. of increasingly lower quality
and higher degree of risk. This can heighten credit risks. Second, as banks‚Äô balance sheets expand,
the liabilities side can also become more vulnerable. When banks seek to extend credit rapidly,
core funding‚Äîfunding that banks draw on in normal times‚Äîis likely to be insufficient (retail
deposits, for instance, tend to grow slowly and in line with income growth). So other sources of
funds need to be tapped. These sources are generally other domestic or foreign financial
intermediaries and the funds obtained are by nature ‚Äúless sticky‚Äù or more volatile in the face of
shocks. Defining banks‚Äô core liabilities as those that are less volatile in the face of shocks or
uncertainty (such as retail deposits) one finds that banks‚Äô non-core to core liabilities ratio increases
during economic booms. Often the non-core funding, especially from foreign creditors, is short-
term (in part this is because, other things being equal, during an economic upturn, domestic interest
rates tend to rise and short term capital flows are more sensitive to interest rate differentials). Thus
banks and other financial institutions can become more susceptible to both market risks (risks
associated with changes in systematic factors such as interest rates, exchange rates equity and other
asset prices) and liquidity risks (which can be best described as funding risks) during the process.
The fact that during cyclical upturns, lending among financial institutions also tends to rise, means
that systemic cyclical risks (risks that arise when financial institutions behave similarly during
cyclical upturns and downturns without talking into account the spillover effects of their decisions
on the system as a whole) and systemic cross-sectional risks (systemic risks that arise due to
interconnectedness across financial institutions) tend to increase in tandem.

       The other side of the coin is an increased indebtedness of corporates and households. For
corporates, there can be an increase in leverage, and short-term borrowing, including short-term
foreign borrowing. For households, there can also be a rapid increase in indebtedness, sometimes
in FX as well.

IV. How negative shocks can be amplified through macro financial linkages in the presence
of balance sheet weaknesses
       Once the different sectors/entities have become vulnerable through balance sheet
mismatches, a negative macroeconomic shock, or even a slight domestic economic downturn, can
ultimately result in an economic ‚Äúbust‚Äù (severe output decline) and even a financial crisis. This is
because the interactions between the financial sector and real sectors described above, and that
work in reverse in the face of a negative shock, are exacerbated in the presence of balance sheet
vulnerabilities.

         Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how shocks such as capital flow reversals, global interest rate
increases etc. can get transmitted and impact the domestic economy. For instance, a reversal of
short-term capital flows that were funding banks could lead to funding and liquidity problems if
financial institutions have significant funding mismatches, necessitating them to reduce their asset
positions7. Negative externalities related to firesales can then come into play because a generalized
sell-off of financial assets causes a decline in asset prices which in turn further impairs the balance
sheets of the financial intermediaries. In addition to selling assets to regain liquidity and thus
sustaining losses on existing positions in the face of declining prices, financial intermediaries may
also face higher margins/haircuts8, which further adds to their funding problems. The financial
intermediaries may then reduce new credit extension, or raise interest rates or other costs to
borrowers (externalities related to credit crunches), contributing to an economic slowdown that
can raise the probability of default more widely (credit losses for the financial institutions) and
setting off a cycle of adverse effects further amplifying the initial losses sustained by financial
institutions.

         Significant losses sustained by financial institutions could ultimately represent a risk to
public sector balance sheets. Conversely, though, high sovereign indebtedness could also
negatively affect banks. In principle, if banks are highly exposed‚Äîwith sizable holdings of
sovereign bonds on their asset side‚Äîa shock or negative impact that results in heightened
sovereign risk will reduce the value of banks‚Äô assets and ultimately affect their solvency (if the
latter are already in distress). Higher sovereign risk will also reduce the value of any implicit or
explicit ‚Äúgovernment guarantee‚Äù which in turn would reduce banks‚Äô debt disproportionately
relative to its equity 9 . And banks‚Äô distress would have further feedback implications for the
sovereign (Figure 4).




7 A funding shortage occurs when it is prohibitively expensive to a) borrow more funds (low funding liquidity) and b) sell of its
assets (low market liquidity). In short, problems only arise if both funding liquidity (high margins/haircuts, restrained lending) and
market liquidity evaporates (fire sale discounts).
8 When cash lent on repo trades is lower than the market value of the collateral security, the applicable discount is referred to as a

haircut. There is no haircut when government bonds are used as collateral security. In securities lending, the market value of the
collateral that is posted has to be higher than the value of the securities, and this overcollateralization is referred to as the margin.

V. Indicators of vulnerability
         The preceding sections have illustrated the role that macro financial linkages can play in
leading to balance sheet mismatches and a build-up of vulnerability. Ideally, the appropriate
indicators would be ones that measure balance sheet mismatches (asset and liabilities) that expose
entities to the different types of risks and ones that capture changes in domestic and external macro
and financial conditions.

        However the data needed to construct entities‚Äô balance sheets and exposures are generally
not available, even at the aggregate level. A further constraint is that we would like to use
indicators that are more readily available for most emerging and developing economies. Thus a
more pragmatic approach is adopted by looking at indicators that mainly capture the liabilities side
(which in some cases can be broken down to look at exposure to interest or FX exposure). For
each of key entities, a few indicators of ‚Äúbuffers‚Äù that attempt to proxy for the asset side, are also
included10.

        Specifically, the approach taken here is that of Cervantes, Jeasakul, Maloney and Ong
(2014), which we modify to provide more granularity in some instances and to allow for greater
country customization. The individual indicators are standardized with respect to its historical
mean and standard deviation and are weighted and aggregated to create sub-indicators. These sub-
indicators are further aggregated into elements and into composite indicators. It is thus possible
for each aggregated risk indicator/condition to be decomposed further into its different underlying
components.

        The modified approach is illustrated in Figure 5. As can be seen, the composite/aggregate
indicators are categorized into seven buckets that capture the risks and into two buckets that
capture macro-financial conditions.

        The first bucket of spillover risks from external environment can be thought of as
capturing a country‚Äôs net exposure to the external environment or international developments,
where we take key global indicators such as commodity prices, partner country GDP growth, the
VIX, and weight these by the importance of the relevant channels of transmission‚Äîcommodity
exports, partner country share of exports, and portfolio and bank flows to GDP‚Äîfor the country.
We also take account of the net impact of external developments by accounting for the buffers
(reserves) and the impact as measured by the Exchange and Monetary pressure (EMP) index which
is the sum of exchange rate depreciation, the change in gross international reserves and money
market interest rates, each weighted by the inverse of its own volatility.

        The second bucket of macro risks captures risks in the domestic macro environment. The
indicators are made up of three subgroupings‚Äîmacro stability indicators, macro outlook
indicators, and macro risk perception indicators. As noted in the preceding section,
macroeconomic activity can influence financial sector developments, and the outlook and
expectations for macroeconomic activity can influence the outlook for financial stability.

        The third bucket is risks to banks. Here we attempt to capture credit risks, FX risks (FX
loans/total loans), maturity risks (short-term liabilities/GDP), and leverage (capital/total assets).

10   The public sector bucket does not include any buffers yet. In the future, the tool could include a measure of fiscal space.

                                                                    9
For the credit risks we weight the public sector risks, corporate sector risks and household sector
risks by the importance of each of these entities in banks‚Äô portfolios. We also look at the growth
of credit to the private sector‚Äîrapid credit growth seems to precede many episodes of banking
crises in both advanced and emerging market economies‚Äîalthough not all episodes of high credit
growth are followed by crises. We also look at asset quality (NPL ratio). As buffers, we use
profitability indicators (ROA and ROE) and the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

        The fourth bucket captures risks emanating from the public sector‚Äôs balance sheets.
Ideally we would capture the mismatches and the risks from interest rate, FX, liquidity and
solvency risks. In reality we are only able to use two indicators on the liability side‚Äînamely fiscal
position to GDP and public debt to GDP. Note that the fiscal position to GDP is also included in
the macro conditions bucket as a variable that can influence macroeconomic stability.

        The fifth bucket comprises of the risks emanating from the corporate sector. The indicators
(which capture the liabilities side only) are corporate debt/GDP, short-term debt/total debt and
total debt/total assets. As buffers we include the rate of return to assets and rate of return to equity,
and stock market returns.

        The sixth bucket captures household risks‚Äîwhere we use the indicators of household
debt/GDP and the unemployment rate. For buffers we take property prices and stock market
returns.

         The seventh bucket focuses on funding and liquidity risks (possibility of loss through
funding/liquidity mismatches). Market and liquidity risks for financial institutions would manifest
themselves in stresses in the secondary capital markets. And developments in these markets can
be mutually reinforcing. Thus the two sets of indicators considered represent i) bank funding and
liquidity which measures institutions‚Äô vulnerability to a sudden pull bank in their funding and their
ability to realize assets quickly and sufficiently to meet their short term obligations and comprises
the following indicators: deposit to loan ratio; credit to private sector /resident deposits; liquid
assets/short term liabilities and gross foreign liabilities/GDP; and ii) secondary market funding
and liquidity where the following indicators are used: currency bid-ask spread; LIBOR-OIS spread
(diff between LIBOR and overnight indexed swap); TED spread (diff between 3 month
interbank/LIBOR and 3 month T bills) and stock market turnover.

        Finally, there are two groups of indicators that capture monetary and financial conditions
(eighth bucket) and investor risk appetite (ninth bucket) respectively. Under monetary and
financial conditions, we take the indicators of domestic bank credit growth, short-term real interest
rates, and real broad money growth. Investor risk appetite is characterized by their pricing of risk
associated with the country‚Äôs assets as well as their investment decisions and the actual volatility
of market prices. Thus this bucket includes the equity risk premium, USD sovereign bond spreads,
domestic currency sovereign bond yields, sovereign CDS spreads, as well as portfolio flows/GDP
and FDI/GDP. For the volatilities, domestic currency government bond yields, stock market
returns and exchange rate movements are included.

Calculation of indicators

Variable.

1. Normalize the variable. Compute a standardized score for each variable‚Äîi.e. normalize. Each
   variable k at time t can be assessed against its historical mean or a pre-defined norm and
   standard deviation
                                                     Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ò Ì†µÌ±° ‚àí Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±£ Ì†µÌ±ò
                                                                         Ì†µÌ±ô,Ì†µÌ±°
                                        Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±° =
                                                             Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ô,Ì†µÌ±°
where Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±° is the mean or norm and Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±° is the standard deviation, both for a 5 year period. When
comparing two specified time periods , t and t + s, the mean/norm and the standard deviation
applied in the calculation of the z score at time t=s are the same for those for time t to ensure
comparability of outcomes.

Note that a variable may be one way, inverted or two way depending on the variable being
considered. So a z score could also be one way, inverted or two ways. Fiscal balance is a one way
variable‚Äîthe more positive the balance (relative to GDP) vis a vis the medium term average, the
more desirable it is for macro financial stability. On the other hand, government debt is an inverted
one way variable‚Äîthe smaller the balance (relative to GDP) the more desirable it is for macro
financial stability. Other examples include government, household and corporate debt. In contrast
inflation is a two way variable‚Äîthe greater the change in prices from the mean or predetermined
norm in either direction, (inflationary or deflationary pressures) the less desirable it is. Finally
some variables could be both a one way and two way variable depending on the context. For
instance this is the case with bank credit. Bank credit is a two way variable, under Macro risks as
overly strong growth could lead to overheating while a sharp slowdown or contraction could
significantly affect economic activity, On the other hand, it is a one way variable under credit risks
to Banks as the stronger the growth in credit (a more positive z score) the greater the risks to banks.
Conversely it is a one way inverted variable under Monetary and Financial conditions as stronger
growth in credit and hence better credit availability is desirable.

2. Rank the normalized variable.

For risks: zero captures the lowest first percentile of risks, rank 10 is the 99th percentile and rank
5 broadly corresponds to the long term average, calculated over the 5 year period t.

For conditions: i) zero captures the most risk seeking behavior, rank 10 represents the greatest risk
aversion and 5 corresponds to the long term average risk appetite all relative to the 5 year period
to time t; ii) zero represents the loosest monetary and financial conditions, rank 10 represents the
tightest and 5 corresponds to the long term average conditions all relative to the 5 year period at
time t.

Sub-indicator:
1. Compute the numerical ranking for each sub indicator: The score assigned to each sub indicator
   is calculated as an equally weighted average of the rankings assigned to the related l variables.
   Weights vary with the number of selected variables such that:
                                                Ì†µÌ±ö

Element:
1. Compute the numerical ranking for each element (Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ ). Next the score assigned to each element
   is calculated as an equally weighted average of the rankings assigned to the related sub
   indicators. Weights vary with the number of sub indicators, such that:

                                                            Ì†µÌ±ò
                                                         1      Ì†µÌ±ó
                                                Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ      ‚àë Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ò
                                                         Ì†µÌ±ò
                                                           Ì†µÌ±õ=1



Aggregate indicator:
1. Compute the numerical rankings for each aggregated indicator (Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ ). The score assigned to each
   aggregated indicator representing a particular risk or condition is then calculated as an equally
   weighted average j associated elements, Weights vary with the number of elements such that:

                                                            Ì†µÌ±ó
                                                     1
                                                 Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚àë Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ

Data frequency: Use latest available data. And use quarterly data wherever possible and where
necessary and possible merge quarterly and annual data.

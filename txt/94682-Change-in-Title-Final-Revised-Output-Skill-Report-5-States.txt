Executive Summary
Committed to increase human capital investments to foster growth, and aware that youth come out of
the education system lacking critical technical and soft skills, the Government of India (GOI) has set an
ambitious target of skilling 500 million workers in India by 2022. A little over half of this target (285
million) is to be met by five large national skills development (SD) programs which provide short-term
training, most of it lasting from 6 days to 6 months, in a wide range of trades. Since 2011, around 6
million youth have already been trained through these programs and a huge program expansion is
required to reach the set target. Before embarking on this expansion, GOI requested than an evaluation
of the labor market impacts and effectiveness of these schemes be made.

This study attempts to respond to this request, evaluating those 5 schemes with data from a set of
surveys of trainees, non-trainees (comparison group), employers and training providers. The
quantitative analysis is complemented by a qualitative study based on interviews and focus groups
discussions. In agreement with the GOI, five states have been taken into consideration for this
evaluation: Assam, Andhra Pradesh (AP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Odisha and Rajasthan.

The five SD programs under study (NSDC, SDIS, STEP-UP, ASDP and RSETI)1, although run by different
ministries and with different administrative structures, share a common goal, that of skilling youth.
However, they target somewhat different population groups: two of them focus on rural youth, one on
urban youth, and the remaining ones cover both. They can all prepare for wage or self-employment but
emphasize one or the other. Three schemes target the poor while the others do not discriminate
according to socio-economic status.

As shown by the analysis of survey data, the main characteristics of SD programs and of their
beneficiaries are as follows:

       Most program beneficiaries are young (mean age is 21-23) and 90 percent of them are first time
        labor market entrants. Their education level of trainees is fairly high as only 10-20 percent of
        them have not completed secondary education. Women represent close to half of trainees in 4
        out of the 5 schemes
       Programs which target the poor only partly achieve this goal. However, in all programs, the
        representation of disadvantaged social groups seems in line with their representation at the
        national level.
       In all programs, the financing of training is well separated from the provision of training which
        can be done by public or private providers (TPs), with a large majority being private.
       Although programs offer a wide range of trades, over 50 percent of trainees concentrate over a
        limited set of trades which appears similar across all programs.
       In the case of wage employment following training, hiring firms are mostly private and of very
        small size.

  Full names of these programs are: NSDC (National Skills Development Corporation), SDIS (Skills Development
Initiative Scheme, STEP UP (Skill Training for Employment Promotion amongst Urban Poor). ASDP (Aajeevika Skills
Development Program) and RSETI(Rural Self-Employment Training Institute)

                                                       4
Regarding the labor market impacts of SD programs, the main findings of the analysis are:

       The placement rate of trainees (shortly after the end of the training period) is modest: 27
        percent overall, ranging from 23 to 36 percent across programs, but with substantial state-wide
        variations. One or two years after training, the employment rate of trainees is not much
        different: 28 percent. However, significant labor market churning has occurred over the period
        of one or two years after training: trainees initially placed have left their jobs, looking for other
        opportunities (or simply quit); others have entered the labor market later. This strongly suggests
        that, although initial placement facilitates insertion in the labor market, it does not ensure a
        good job match and sustainability of employment.
       Although all programs aim at providing gainful employment, a large proportion of trainees (28
        percent) indicate that they do not intend to work after training, but rather to pursue further
        studies. This lack of motivation raises questions about the adequacy of the selection process of
        participants.
       Although the employment rates of trainees are found to be fairly low, the analysis of survey
        data, including employment and earnings data of non-trainees (comparison group), shows that
        SD programs make a difference. They contribute to increase the employability of trainees by 7
        percentage points overall, with a stronger effect on women. They give access to better quality
        jobs (as measured by proxies, such as a job contract, shorter work hours, and access to pension
        plan) and provide a positive wage premium, of the order of 21 percent.
       Not all programs perform equally well. When a distinction is made between programs, the
        positive impact on employment and wages disappears for 2 of the 5 programs (ASDP and RSETI).
       Employment and wage impacts vary, depending on personal characteristics, such as age,
        education level, marital status, prior work experience, as well as on training characteristics.
        Worth noting are the stronger positive impact of training when it combines classroom teaching
        with practical training in industry (or apprenticeship) as well as the much higher probability of
        employment for those with prior work experience. Another finding worth underlying is that
        training has no employment effect for very young trainees aged 15-20, and only starts to be
        effective for those aged 21 or more.
       Location matters. Differences across states appear strongly with higher probability of
        employment in AP and Assam than in MP, and lower probability in Odisha and Rajasthan than in
        MP.

The second part of the study – qualitative – based on focus group discussions and interviews, points out
that several aspects in the process of selection of training providers and courses, such as insufficient
attention to the quality of the offerings and to labor market demand are not conducive to ensuring high
quality and relevance of programs. It also detects weaknesses in the quality assurance mechanisms,
monitoring and evaluation, and placement/post-placement support.



The main policy recommendations derived from these findings are:


                                                     5
Program outcomes could be improved by taking more into account the factors that increase the chances
of success.

1.    The most obvious factor is the quality and relevance of the training. A more extensive use of labor
     market information and closer links with employers for the identification of trades and skills in
     demand, as well as a more careful selection of training providers would improve the quality and
     responsiveness of programs to the needs of the labor market. An increasing use of apprenticeships,
     or programs combining classroom with practical training in enterprises (which were shown to have a
     clear positive impact on employment probability) would also bring closer links with employers and
     help ensuring that training offerings respond quickly to changes in production processes.

2. A more careful targeting of programs to the population groups for whom those programs are
   particularly effective could lead to a more efficient use of public resources and a higher employment
   rate:
    Selecting a greater proportion of applicants aged 21 or more would increase program
       effectiveness. For those aged 15-20, for whom the programs were found to have no impact,
       efforts should be made to identify the causes of failure and on this basis, to reconsider the type
       of programs that could be beneficial for them
    A more careful screening of applicants to reduce the large number of seats attributed to youth
       who do not intend to look for a job after training and thus, the selection of a larger pool of
       motivated candidates would also improve program effectiveness.

3. Promoting independent assessments and standardization of certificates would enhance the
   certificate?value?and the marketability of beneficiaries.

         The absence of independent evaluation gives scope for masking quality compromise.
Furthermore, the lack of standardization of certificates reduces the value of the information that
certificates are supposed to give to potential employers regarding the acquired skills of job seekers.
Practices followed by some TPs such as adopting a course-specific standard approach to assessments or
initiating joint-certification with industry partners are examples of ways to address this issue and worth
considering. Ensuring the availability of a pool of qualified assessors would also facilitate the recourse
to independent evaluation.

4. Strengthening post-placement support would make SD programs more effective.

         Given the significant labor churning which occurs after training, an effective post-placement
support during at least a period of 6 months to a year would help achieve a more stable employment as
it would facilitate information about job availability, lower the costs of search and thus, reduce the
length of unemployment spans between jobs. This again supposes an active engagement with the local
industry and service sector. Enlarging the scope of SD programs to cover not only unemployed youth but
also people already in the labor force (whether or not former trainees), would provide them with
opportunities to reskilling between jobs, change occupations and become more productive. It would
generate productivity increases by facilitating the adjustment of the labor force to the changing needs of

                                                    6
a modernizing economy. It would open the way to life-long learning and address a weakness highlighted
by enterprise surveys, namely, the very low level of in-service training provided by enterprises to their
workers in India compared to competitors internationally.

5. Linking funding to desired outcomes improves efficiency, provided incentives are well designed. This
   is already been used (to various degrees) by SD programs with the use of placement targets as
   conditions for funding.

         This practice should be maintained as it obliges TPs and program managers to shift focus from
inputs towards outcomes. It incites TPs to establish links with potential employers and to offer courses
that match labor market demand and brings some competition into the sector. Placement also gives
opportunities to youth to gain some useful work experience, even if of short duration. However, given
the difficulty to achieve a high target, this practice should be accompanied by a more stringent selection
of applicants to ensure that beneficiaries are those most motivated. False reporting might be
encouraged otherwise. As placement does not ensure sustainability of employment, this practice should
also include incentives to strengthen monitoring and post-placement support.

6. Pursuing efforts to strengthen M&E is critically needed across all programs. Despite progress, the
   stage of development of the M&E system still varies across programs and states. The results of this
   study also suggest that a more in-depth evaluation of ASDP and RSETI programs for which no labor
   market impact could be detected is needed. This evaluation should be conducted before envisaging
   any large expansion of those schemes.

         An additional recommendation would be to include, as part of these evaluation efforts, a study
to assess the long-term effects of SD programs to measure the full return on the investments made in
skill development and bring additional useful insight for policy makers as one limitation of this study
(common to most evaluation studies world-wide) is the limited time period during which the impact of
training is being observed.

7. Learning from the experience of States that have been more successful could generate greater
   efficiency. The study identifies differences in practices, and organizational features across states
   which have contributed to better coordination and better outcomes of SD programs in AP. Other
   states could gain by learning from the AP experience and examining whether those practices could
   be adapted to their own environment. Some good practices may also exist in specific areas in States
   other than AP. Sharing lessons from experience would benefit all of them.

8. One final recommendation is not to consider the SD programs analyzed in this study in isolation but
   rather as part of a diversified package of human capital investments which includes education and
   longer-term training programs. Even if most SD programs are found to have positive labor market
   effects, expectations of their overall impact on the Indian economy need to remain modest.
   Courses are of short duration and cost is low. The amount of human capital that can be provided
   through those programs is likely to remain modest. While these programs can be a useful policy
   instrument to facilitate insertion in the labor market, they cannot be expected to yield huge

                                                    7
productivity increases and need to be complemented by other types of human capital investments.
Their targets should be adjusted accordingly.

    1. Introduction.

Over the past few years, the Government of India (GOI) has been implementing five large national skills
development (SD) programs2 to improve the employment and earnings prospects of urban and rural
youth. The training is of short duration, most of it lasting from 6 days up to 6 months, and covers a wide
range of trades. Since 2011, around 6 million youth have been trained and more than US$500 million
have been spent under these programs.

Committed to increase investments in human capital to foster growth, and aware that youth come out
of the education system lacking critical technical and soft skills, the GOI has set in the Twelfth and
Thirteenth five-year Plans (2012-17 & 2017-2022) an ambitious target of skilling 500 million workers in
India by 2022 and gave a combined target of 285 million to the five SD programs considered for this
study. This would mean increasing the current annual intake of trainees about ten-fold during each of
the next seven years.

Before embarking on the huge increase in public spending that reaching such a target would require, the
GOI has requested that an evaluation of these schemes be made. The critical questions to be addressed
are: What have been the employment outcomes of those programs? What earnings premium do they
give to trainees? Do program benefits justify the significant public investments made into them? What
organizational aspects affect delivery and reach? and finally, based on these findings, what should be
the course of action?

This paper tries to address those questions, using data from a set of surveys of trainees (past and
current), non-trainees (comparison group), employers and training providers (see Box 1). The
quantitative analysis has been complemented by a qualitative study based on interviews and focus
group discussions, with focus on business processes, program management and M&E. Five states have
been taken into consideration for this analysis: Assam, Andhra Pradesh (AP), Madhya Pradesh (MP),
Odisha and Rajasthan.

This paper comprises several sections. The first section will provide a brief description of the five
programs and of their operating modes. An analysis of their employment outcomes and wage and
earnings effects, as well as the measurement of their cost effectiveness will be given in the following
three sections. This will be accompanied by a review of, and comparison with results from evaluations of
similar programs conducted in other parts of the world. Following will be a summary of findings from
the qualitative survey. A concluding section will present policy recommendations derived from the
analysis of both the quantitative and qualitative data sources.

Box 1. Survey Instruments.

To evaluate the performance of five national skills development (SD) programs, surveys of training
providers, trainees and employers were conducted in five states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Madhya

2
 Those 5 SD programs are: NSDC (National Skills Development Corporation), SDIS (Skills Development Initiative
Scheme), STEP UP (Skills Training for Employment Promotion amongst Urban Poor), ASDP (Aajeevika Skills
Development Program) and RSETI (Rural Self-Employment Training Institute)

                                                       9
Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan.
    1) Survey of Training Providers (TPs). A random sample of 110 training institutions in 3-4 districts
       in each of the five states was surveyed. The sampling frame data of TPs was made available
       by the program managers or Ministries overseeing each program. The questionnaires sought
       information about the infrastructure, training program, trainee and trainer characteristics and
       services provided under the program.
    2) Survey of Past Trainees, Current Trainees and Non-Trainees (comparison group). A
       representative sample of trainees having completed the training (6 per TP), trainees currently
       enrolled (5 per TP) and non-trainees (5 per TP) was selected from the files of participating
       training providers. Past trainees and non-trainees (comparison group) are from early 2012
       batches to allow them to be in the labor market 1 or 2 years after training and/or before
       being interviewed under the study. Current trainees were undergoing the training at the time
       of the survey. The questionnaire provides information about personal and socio-economic
       background, employment or self-employment status and corresponding earnings, training
       and placement services received from the TPs.
    3) Survey of Employers. Local employers who recruit trainees from the participating training
       institutes (5 per TP) or who offer jobs requiring similar skills were interviewed. Data was
       collected on sector of employment, size and employer type, recruitment of trainees and wage
       offers.
Due to difficulties in finding training providers and past trainees in some states, and to the reluctance
of some respondents to provide information, the data sample finally analyzed is a bit smaller than
originally intended. The final dataset comprised of 400 TPs, 2620 past trainees, 1995 current trainees,
2017 non-trainees (comparison group), and 669 employers.


    2. The Skills Development Programs

Providing skills to the labor force and facilitating employment has been one key mandate within India’s
national development agenda for several decades. While its original focus was on poverty alleviation, it
became part of an agenda of “building a competitive labor force? after the establishment of the National
Skill Development Policy in 2009. The five programs under study were established or realigned to the
National Skill Development Policy after its formulation, and an autonomous body called the National
Skill Development Agency (NSDA) was setup in 2013 with the task of coordinating and harmonizing the
skill development efforts of the government and the private sector.

    What are the objectives of these programs and how do they operate?

Characteristics of the programs are diverse and outcomes could as well be different (see Table 1). These
five programs are run by different ministries and with different administrative structures. One program
(NSDC) is fee-based while others are subsidy-based. Two programs (ASDP and RSETI) are focused on
rural youth, another (STEP-UP) on urban youth and the remaining ones have a wider focus. They can all
prepare for wage employment or self-employment but emphasize one or the other. Three schemes
(STEP-UP, ASDP and RSETI) target the poor while the others do not discriminate according to socio-
economic status.

While sponsored by the Central Government through specific ministries, these programs, apart from
NSDC, are implemented with a decentralized implementation structure. It can be through a partnership
between central and state governments (ASDP), or through some state level committee/organization
(SDIS, RSETI), or directly through a municipality or district administration (STEP-UP). Due to this
decentralized administration system, there can be significant variation in implementation from state to
state.

Although modalities for selection of training providers differ across programs, one particular feature,
common to all, is the separation of the financing from the provision of training which can be done by

                                                       11
public or private institutions. NSDC calls for proposals from training providers and adopts a multi-stage
process with the help of professional organizations to select proposals for funding. The two most
important criteria for selection are sustainability of the business model and linkages with employers.
Under STEP-UP, most States adopt a L1 based (lowest cost based) bidding for selection of training
providers while a few states adopt a quality-cum-cost based bidding. Project implementation agencies
under ASDP are selected through an open tender and competition is based on a scorecard that
measures their financial robustness, experience, operational preparedness, trainees placement and
certification arrangement. For RSETI, state-level committees delegate to the Lead Commercial bank the
responsibility to set up a rural self-employment training institute (RSETI) in each district. SDIS relies on
training providers registered by the respective States/UTs and which are eligible to apply after fulfilling
certain conditions, such as being affiliated to universities, or approved by relevant councils (for example,
All India Council of Technical Education, Indian Nursing Council, etc.)

        Who are the beneficiaries?

The youth population is a priority for all the programs, and data confirm they are the main beneficiaries.
Most trainees are young (mean age is 21-23), still unmarried and live in households headed by their
father. Their education level is fairly high. Around 80-90 percent have at least 10 years of schooling (29
percent have attended higher education). Thus, the proportion of beneficiaries who have not
completed secondary education is small, ranging from 5 to 9 percent depending on programs, except in
RSETI where it reaches 20 percent. Having worked in the 24 months preceding the training seldom
happens: about 90 percent of trainees are first time labor market entrants. The participation of women
is high: they represent close to half or more than half of trainees in all programs, except NSDC (where
they are only 1/3 of trainees) (see Annex 1 for more detailed statistics).

“Poor? rural or urban youth are the target of three of the programs: ASDP, RSETI and STEP-UP (NSDC
and SDIS do not discriminate according to socio-economic status). Data indicate that this goal is only
partly achieved and that only around one third of beneficiaries in those three programs belong to very
poor families (with BPL card or family income less than 6,000 Rs. per month) {see Table 2). A slightly
higher percentage of poor is only observed for ASDP in recent batches, perhaps due to a more extensive
use of the Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) process. Nevertheless, disadvantaged and low
income social groups are well represented across all programs, in line with their representation at the
national level: 20/30 percent of trainees are SC/STs, and 40-50 percent, OBC; and the family income of
at least 51 percent of trainees is less than 9,000 Rs. per month (see Annex 1).

        Who delivers the training and what type of training?

Training is delivered by training providers (TPs), which can be public or private. In the case of NSDC,
ASDP and STEP-UP, 90 percent of TPs within the sample are private. For SDIS, 75 percent of TPs are
private, and RSETI relies on a particular delivery mechanism which involves either banks or private TPs.
At least two-thirds of TPs are located in urban areas and the remaining in rural areas. TPs can run
training for one or several schemes. They usually select trainees through a mobilization process which
mostly rests on pamphlets, newspapers announcements, and is followed by an admission process
comprising interviews and/or tests. Basically, participation is based on self-selection.

To various degrees, depending on programs and states, TPs interact with the government to have
instructors trained, or to receive equipment/toolkits. They also establish links with the industry but
here also, there seems to be wide variation across states and programs, in the manner in which the
industries are engaged. Around half of TPs claim to get feedback from industry on curriculum and about
40 percent of them to get instructors from the industry or arrange for apprenticeships with the local
industry.

Although the survey of 1,995 current trainees reports participation in a wide range of trades, ranging
from 18 different offerings in RSETI to 51 in SDIS, there seems to be a dominant set of trades which
attracts over 50 percent of trainees and appears to be quite similar across programs (see Table 3).

Note: within each program, course names are given according to the number of participants, starting with the
course that attracts the largest number of participants. The number of trainees enrolled in those 5 top courses
exceeds 50 percent in the sample of current trainees.

        Who hires the trainees?

Although some programs (RSETI and STEP-UP) are more directly designed to help beneficiaries become
self-employed, all programs can prepare for wage employment. Hiring firms are mostly private and
their size is small: 60 to 80 percent of them (depending on programs) have less than 10 employees (see
Table 4). Most employers of RSETI and ASDP trainees operate in the service sector. For the other
schemes, more then 2/3 are in the service sector and 1/3 in manufacturing. Most hiring firms being


                                                        13
small, employers are not subject to labor regulations mandating paid leave, pension rights and other
non-wage benefits.

    3.   Employment Outcomes of SD Programs.

    Job placement at the end of the training

All programs put emphasis on the need for TPs to provide support for job placement at the end of the
training period and in some cases, provide financial incentives to do so. This support is provided through
placement cells and/or job fairs, faculty connections and/or direct contact with local employers.
Trainees confirm having received support and having benefited from counseling, information about
vacancies, help in filling applications and help for interviews. Data indicate that the placement rate of
trainees is 27 percent overall, ranging from 23 to 36 percent across programs, and slightly higher for
males than females, except in SDIS and STEP-UP (see Tables 5 and 6). However, this average hides
substantial state-wide variations: Andhra Pradesh (AP) stands out with the highest placement rate (50
percent) while Rajasthan and Odisha show the lowest rates (20 and 12 percent respectively) (see Table
8).

The placement rate is fairly low, suggesting that TP support has not been very effective in the past,
except in Andhra Pradesh3 where the funding of TPs has been linked to performance on placement for
already some time and where performance targets were set quite high. This assessment of overall low
placement performance, however, needs to be qualified by the fact that, although all programs aim at
providing gainful employment, not all participants have this motivation. In the survey of trainees
interviewed while still participating in the training program, a question was asked about their plans after

3
 The relative performance of AP derived from the analysis of data from the survey of trainees is
corroborated by the information provided by TPs. Those even claim reaching a 100 percent placement
rate in AP.



                                                    14
completing the training: 28 percent of trainees indicated that they did not intend to look a job but
rather to pursue further studies (technical education such as ITIs, polytechnics or formal education) (see
Table 5). Interestingly, the proportion of trainees who intend to go for further studies is significantly
lower for all programs in AP which, as discussed above, is the state achieving the highest placement
rate.

The lack of intention to work after training of a significant proportion of trainees obviously makes
placement more difficult and raises a question about the adequacy of the selection process of
participants. Unless those programs provide long-term benefits which can be captured by beneficiaries
several years later, the admission of these students could represent a waste of public resources and a
more stringent screening of applicants could increase the performance of programs.

        Job Status 1-2 years after training

The employment rate 1-2 years after training is 28 percent overall. This indicator may be more relevant
than initial placement to measure the impact of training as it is observed after a period of job search and
adjustment has taken place. More trainees may have had the time to look for a suitable job and a good
match. Evidence, however, shows that, after a period of one or two years, the employment rate is not
markedly different from the initial placement rate for all programs, except for RSETI trainees whose
employment rate drops significantly (see Table 6). Trainees who have successfully entered the labor
market have either opted for wage employment or self-employment, in proportions that reflect the
focus of the program they participated in.

                                                    15
Significant labor churning has occurred over this period of one or two years after training. Although
placement and employment rates are fairly similar, many changes have occurred. Trainees initially
placed have left their jobs, looking for other opportunities (or simply quit for family or other reasons);
others have needed more time to find a job and have entered the labor market later.

Labor market churning affects both males and females (see Table 7) and also occurs within and across
States. One program, NSDC, shows a clear increase in the employment rate of male trainees and an
opposite trend for females. The reverse is observed for STEP-UP and ASDP. The employment rate of
both male and female SDIS trainees increases while it falls in the case of RSETI trainees. Similarly, for a
given program, while the employment rate may increase in one state, it may decrease in another.
Again, overall, AP stands out in achieving the highest employment rate of trainees, followed by Assam.
In MP and Rajasthan, the level of the initial placement rate is not even sustained (see Table 8).

1-2 years later


While placement may play an important role in providing some work experience and in facilitating
insertion in the labor market, it does not ensure a good job match and sustainability of employment. In
fact, a large proportion of those placed earlier, right at the outset of training (ranging from about 40
percent for NSDC to 70 percent for RSETI) are found not working one or two years later, and looking for
other opportunities. A small percentage (ranging from 2 to 7 percent) has even withdrawn from the
labor market and is no longer looking for a job (Table 9). More than half of those indicate they are
studying.

Evidence of short job tenure is also provided by employers who report that many newly hired leave their
jobs after 2/3 months of employment. Around one-third does so because of other job opportunities but
others, according to employers, leave because of low pay, distance from home or for family reasons.

        Have the training programs made a difference in terms of employability? Is there a positive
        treatment effect?

The purpose of SD programs is to provide skills or some form of social capital that increases the
employability of youth and facilitates their insertion in the labor market. Even if the probability of
employment of trainees is not found to be high, policy makers need to know what would have been the
employment rate in the absence of training and be able to compare both rates. This amounts to
estimating a treatment effect, defined as the difference between the employment status, depending on
whether the individual was trained or not.

Given that an experimental design (with trainees and non-trainees randomly selected) was not possible,
data from a survey of youth of similar age, socio-economic background4, who did not participate in the
training, were used to estimate the counterfactual for each program. As in other non-experimental
evaluations, estimates are obtained controlling for individual characteristics of both treatment and
comparison groups, such as age, gender, marital status, education, family income, and state of
residence.

Estimates indicate a modest but positive treatment effect (see table 10). The participation in SD
programs is found to increase the employment rate by 7 percentage points overall, with a stronger
effect for women than for men (12 vs. 4.5 percentage points). Given the different population groups
targeted by each program and their different operating modes, estimates were also obtained for each
program, separately5. In this case, results indicate that participation in NSDC training increases the
employment rate by 11 percentage points, SDIS training by 7 percentage points, and STEP-UP by 5



4
  The comparison group comprised youth who had been admitted to any of the reference schemes but did not
complete the training and youth of same age and socio-economic background, such as friends or neighbors of
trainees, who could have been eligible to undertake the training.
5
  In this case, separate regressions are run, with a matched control group for each program

                                                      17
percentage points. No impact of training on employment rate could be found for the other two
programs (RSETI and ASDP)

While these estimates have been obtained by comparing the employment outcomes of trainees with
those of a group of non-trainees that have the same observable characteristics ( in terms of age, marital
status, education level, and state of residence), it has been impossible to control for other
unobservable characteristics such as, for example, motivation and willingness to work. If such
differences do exist and explain why some have been trained and others not, the estimates of the
employment effect may be biased upward. In such case, the estimates of the treatment effect would be
an upper estimate.

        Participation in SD programs also seems to give access to better quality jobs, as measured by
proxies such as length of the work day (not more than 8 hours worked per day), and whether individuals
were given a job contract, were provided with a pension plan and paid-leave by employer. Although the
proportion of workers in the sample with “quality “jobs is small6, the analysis suggests that those who
participated in SD programs were 7.6 percentage points more likely to have job contracts, 14.7
percentage points more likely to have access to a pension plan and 9.5 percentage points less likely to
work more than 8 hours a day than controls. No difference between trainees and non-trainees
(comparison group) could be detected with respect to paid-leave.

         Differentiating by types of programs suggests that the higher probability to get access to better
quality jobs is associated with participation in STEP-UP, SDIS or NSDC. Among the three programs, STEP-
UP seems to have the highest impact. In the case of the other two programs (ASDP and RSETI),
differences between trainees and non-trainees (comparison group) in the probability to access better
quality jobs were not found statistically significant.

        The absence of impact on employment and quality of jobs of the two schemes (ASDP and RSETI)
which target rural youth and are more pro-poor than others may reflect program design and
implementation issues as well the greater difficulty faced in rural areas to find work opportunities. A
smaller sample size7 may have also contributed to it.

  Only 15% of workers (trainees and non-trainees) have a contract, 37% have paid leave, 24% are given access to a
pension plan and 21% work more than 8 hours a day.

  The small number of training providers under RSETI has led to a sample of only 268 observations (trainees and
controls). The sample size for ASDP is larger (682 observations) but most data come only from 2 states, MP and
Rajasthan. In other states, interviewers found that most of the selected TPs were closed or no longer running the
scheme.

Note: In the case of all trainees, regressions were run with a pooled sample of all trainees and controls, with no
distinction by program. In all other cases, separate regressions were run for each population group (male/female)
and program with a matched control group.

        Do personal characteristics and location matter for employment outcomes? Does the impact of
training vary depending on characteristics of trainees?

Personal characteristics such as age, education, marital status and location do matter for employment
outcomes (see Table 11).

In India, as in other parts of the world, men who are married have a higher probability of being
employed than men who are single, widowed or separated. This most likely, reflects the effect of having
family responsibilities and a more pressing need for earnings, and translates in a more active job search.
The positive impact of being married on employment probability is also observed for women.

           Education levels also matter for employment outcomes. Individuals with less than 10 years of
            schooling are more likely to be employed than those with higher education, perhaps because of
            more pressing needs for income. One somewhat surprising finding, however, is that individuals
            with higher secondary education (12 years of schooling) are less likely to work than those with
            both lower and higher education levels, possibly because a large proportion of them still intend
            to pursue further studies.

           The employment impact of training increases with the age of trainees. Both the effect of
            education and that of marital status on employment are observed for both trainees and non-
            trainees and training makes no difference. This is not the case when considering the effect of
            age on employment. As can be expected from what is the usual life-cycle profile of labor force
            participation of the population, the probability of employment increases with age for men and
            women, trainees and non-trainees. Being at least 20 years of age (and even more being more
            than 25 years old) raises significantly chances of employment relative to being much younger.
            However, distinguishing trainees and non-trainees shows that training reinforces the age effect
            on the probability of employment. While the participation in SD programs was found to
            increase the employment rate by 7 percentage points overall (table 10), it is found to have no
            employment impact on trainees aged 15-20, and only to start being effective for those aged 21
            or more (increasing by 6 percentage points the employment rate of trainees aged 21-25, and by
            14 percentage points the employment rate of older trainees) (Table 11).

    Information on prior work experience, knowledge of English, and type of training is only available for trainees.

                                                           21
        Location matters for employment. Differences across states already mentioned earlier, appear
         clearly and strongly, even after controlling for other trainee and control characteristics. The
         probability of employment is much higher in AP than in all other states. Being in AP increases
         the employment rate by 20 percentage points relative to Assam, by nearly 40 percentage points
         relative to MP, and about 45 percentage points relative to both Odisha and Rajasthan. From
         the point of view of employment, AP and Assam appear to be “better? states and Odisha and
         Rajasthan “worse?states with MP standing in the middle.

    An interesting question is how much of those differences between states can be imputed to the
    programs (and how effective their implementation is) or to other factors that equally affect trainees
    and non-trainees, such as growth or a more formal or more fluid labor market. The econometric
    analysis was not able to disentangle9 between the two hypotheses but the fact that AP, among the
    5 states, has a significantly higher per capita GDP, a larger proportion of the population living in
    urban areas and the smallest share of self-employed (see Table 12) gives weight to the hypothesis
    that external economic and social conditions contribute to the explanation of higher impact in AP.
    However, evidence from Assam would lead to an opposite conclusion as none of the indicators for
    this state could explain why Assam performs better than others. Its GDP per capita is the lowest; it
    has the smallest share of the population living in urban areas and the highest proportion of self-
    employed. Differences in youth unemployment rates across states (with Assam having the highest,
    and MP the lowest) do not either support the hypothesis that a more formal or fluid labor market is
    a strong explanatory factor. This suggests that, although a better economic and social environment
    may facilitate labor market insertions of trainees, at least some of the differences observed across
    states are due to factors related to the way programs are designed and implemented.

 Interaction variables were introduced in the regressions to test the hypothesis of positive links between program
performance and state but coefficients were not found statistically significant.

        Survey data also indicate that some other characteristics10 make employment of trainees more
         likely. The most significant is the existence of some work experience prior to the training period.
         It increases the probability of employment by 60 percentage points. Other factors with positive
         impact are the knowledge of English and the combination of classroom training with
         apprenticeship (or some training in enterprise). Both increase the probability of employment by
         7 and 8.8 percentage points, respectively.


     4. Wage and Earnings Effects of SD Programs

The analysis of wage and earnings effects can only be done with a smaller sample. Information about
wage/earnings and work history can only be available for those (trainees and non-trainees) who are (or)
have been working. This reduces the original sample size to about one-third. In addition, a number of
respondents have refused to give full information about their wages and work history, and/or could not
be reached a second time after information gaps were detected.

Despite the smaller sample11, a number of findings can be drawn:

        Participation in a SD program appears to provide a positive wage premium. The premium is of
         the order of 21 percent and is statistically significant.
        There is an additional wage gain when the content of the training program is directly relevant
         for the job being held.
        Female wages/earnings are systematically about 20 percent lower than those of males, after
         controlling for the education level, participation (or no-participation) in a particular SD program,
         and the state of residence.
        As could be expected, earnings increase with the level of education for both trainees and non-
         trainees.
        As already observed in the case of employment, wage differences across states are significant.
         Wages/earnings are highest in Rajasthan and AP and lowest in Odisha and MP, with Assam in
         middle ground. Those differences appear after controlling for age, marital status, gender,
         education, and participation in an SD scheme.
        However not all programs seem to be equally effective. When a distinction is made by program
         type12, the positive wage premium persists for NSDC, SDIS and STEP-UP trainees but disappears
         for those who participated in RSETI or ASDP.

Estimates seem robust to different specifications. Alternative methods considered were: (i) cross-

   Information about past work experience, knowledge of English, and type of training is only available in the
sample of past trainees. There is no such information in the sample of individuals in the comparison group.
11
   The sample with wage/earnings information has 302 observations.
12
   In the case of wage regressions, only a pooled sample was used because of the limited number of observations.
However, results are very consistent with those found previously with regressions run separately for each
program.

                                                       23
regression controlling for observable characteristics; (ii) the second method relied on a different
comparison group, drawn from data from the labor force module of national sampling survey (NSS).
The first method (propensity score matching) led to an estimate of an average treatment effect of about
30 percent, i.e. not very different from what was previously found. With the use of a different
comparison group (drawn from the national labor force survey), estimates of the wage effect also
remained of similar magnitude (21-26 percent) and coefficients of all other variables (age, gender,
education, state of residence) led to similar conclusions.

     5. Cost-Effectiveness of SD programs.

A precise measure of the cost-effectiveness of the different schemes would require estimates of costs
and benefits, differentiating by types of programs, course duration, location and other factors. Such a
precise estimate cannot be obtained. However, a rough calculation can be done, using the average
estimates of the employment and wage effects of training indicated earlier, that is, assuming that
participation in SD programs increases the employment rate by 7 percentage points, and the wage of
those employed after training by 21 percent. The cost of training per participant will obviously vary
depending on content and duration of training. Taking into consideration an average cost of 18,000 Rs.
per participant 13 and previous estimates of the employment and wage effects, the investment cost will
be recouped if those working after training remain employed at the higher wage rate for at least 21
months. On the basis of those rough estimates, programs run by NSDC, SDIS and STEP-UP would
generally be cost–effective. The absence of employment and wage effects found for ASDP and RSETI
trainees does not allow a similar conclusion for those two programs.

     6. India vs. International Experience

There are a number of similarities between findings in India and in other parts of the world (see Box 2).
The heterogeneity in impacts depending on the characteristics of participants, the benefit from training
greater for women than for men, and the positive effect of part of the training conducted in industry are
findings common to many programs world-wide. Indian results also seem consistent with the
conclusion reached by earlier reviews that training impacts are more positive in developing countries
than in the US or Europe (Betcherman et al. 2004).

A comparison with Latin American programs seems particularly relevant as programs implemented in
Latin America have a number of features common with those implemented in India. Programs are of
similar short duration. For most of them, there is a separation between financing and the provision of
training and on average, the investment cost is fairly low. The cost per participant in Latin American
programs is in the range of US$400-US$750 (see Gonzalez-Velosa, et al., 2012); the average cost of
Indian programs as communicated by NSDA is around 18,000 INR, i.e. around US$300.




13
  This figure is provided in NSDA Dovetailing/Rationalization Report as being the average cost of training across
GOI funded schemes. The average duration is approximately 600 hours and the average hourly cost, Rs 30 per
hour.

                                                        24
In both Latin America and India, the employment effect of training is modest but positive, and roughly in
the same range. The wage effect seems somewhat higher in India but there, estimates may be
overestimated due to the small sample size and some selectivity bias.

Box 2. Impact of Short-Term Training Programs: International Evidence.

Short-term training programs have been widely used in many parts of the world as a policy instrument
to increase the employability of particular population groups. Focus groups have mostly been
unemployed and/or youth, with particular attention to low skilled or disadvantaged youth.

These programs have been evaluated, albeit with various degrees of rigor, in the United States and
Europe, as well as in some developing countries. The majority of the existing empirical evidence related
to the US case suggests that there is substantial heterogeneity in impacts depending on the
characteristics of the participants and the type of training. Many studies conclude that women benefit
more from training than men and that on-the-job training is more effective than classroom training.
With respect to youth, evaluations have not yielded robust results.

Firm conclusions have been difficult to draw from the European evidence (Heckman et al, 1999), in part
because of the lack of experimental studies and the wide variation in evaluation methods. One key
finding, however, to be drawn from the European experience, is that programs targeted to youth are
less likely to show positive effects than programs for adults.

In developing countries, evidence of the impact of training is limited but in recent years, a number of
evaluations were conducted, notably in Latin America, following the wide promotion of short training
programs across the region since the early 90s. Programs that have been evaluated are implemented in
7 countries: Dominican Republic, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Panama, Peru and Mexico. Program
modalities differ across countries but common features are: (i) the separation of financing from the
provision of training and a competitive selection of training providers and courses: (ii) the nature of the
training is labor market demand-driven, not set by the government; (iii) classroom training is often
followed by an internship in the firm.

Some of these evaluations have been carried out with an experimental design relying on randomization,
others with a non-experimental design. Results suggest that the employment effect range from null (or
non- statistically significant) in Argentina and Dominican Republic to positive and significant (around 5
percentage points) in the other countries, and with impact of 6 to 12 percentage points for some groups
such as women in Colombia and Panama. As in the US, results show substantial heterogeneity: the
effect of job training on employment rates varies by age, gender and region. Higher rates are obtained,
in general, among women and younger people. In terms of earnings, the analysis suggests a small
positive impact. In addition, in most cases, there is significant impact on job quality, measured by getting
a formal job, having a contract and/or receiving health insurance. Given the low cost of these programs
(ranging from $300 to $750), they are generally found cost-effective.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where informal, purely practical, apprenticeships remain a key mechanism to help
youth find employment, a number of programs are now run along lines similar to those of Latin America.
Programs implemented in Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya, are of short duration, usually combine some
training in basic skills and a specific trade with some on-the –job experience. Some attempt to link
training with access to credit. Compared to Indian programs, Sub-Saharan programs tend to include a


                                                    25
larger proportion of applicants who have dropped out of school before completing secondary education.
Most evaluation reports indicate some positive impact on motivation/self-perception and qualifications
but so far, do not include sufficient data to determine whether programs were successful in improving
employment. In the Uganda “Youth Opportunities Program?, however, an evaluation conducted through
a randomized trial, showed that groups which received grants to enroll in training and practice the trade
after graduation, were twice as likely to engage in a skilled work and improved their profits by 50
percent compared to the control group.

     7. Findings from the Qualitative Study.

The first objective of the qualitative study (see Box 3) was to examine in detail the operating modalities
of the five skill development programs. All five programs were found to have comprehensive guidelines,
outlining their mandates. Most are financed through grants, except for NSDC which usually provides
concessional loans to training providers (see Table 13) and occasionally, offers grant or equity options.
This part of the study also confirms the earlier finding that providers can be public, private or a civil
society organization, and that, in all cases (except for RSETI) some form of competition is used to select
training providers. Competition, however, is based on criteria which can vary across programs and can
be more or less stringent.

Focus Group Discussions and interviews further confirm that the mobilization of beneficiaries is done
through various means (publicity vans, newspaper ads, pamphlets, awareness camp, road shows as well
as word of mouth). For programs targeted towards the poor, mobilization efforts are carried out
through the BPL lists available at the Village/ Block level and/ or through participatory process with the
support of the community and block level structures. The RSETI program is reported to make special
efforts in ensuring that at least 70 percent of candidates enrolled are from the BPL category as training
fees are only recouped for BPL candidates. However, this finding is in contradiction with what data from
the quantitative surveys showed (see Table 2): i.e. only 25 percent of RSETI beneficiaries being BPL Card
holders14.

Box 3. The Qualitative Study.

       The objective of the qualitative study was to review the organization, system and processes of the
five National Skill Development programs and help understand how these affect the reach, delivery, and
impact of those programs. The study covered the same five states as the quantitative study, i.e. Andhra
Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan (and two districts in each state in addition to
the state capital).

14
  The true percentage of poor beneficiaries may be somewhat higher as RSETI accepts alternate modes of
identification (such as a certificate issued by the Gram Panchayat certifying the BPL status) when BPL cards are not
available.

       Each SD program was evaluated over five thematic areas through one to one discussions with key
stakeholders and through focus group discussions. The thematic areas that were explored are: Program
guidelines & Management, Functions and inter-relationships, Fund Flow mechanism, Program delivery,
Monitoring & Evaluation, Program efficiency and effectiveness.

        For each program, discussions took place at the national, state and district levels. At the national
level, respondents were officials of the relevant ministry, and at the state level, officials entrusted with
the management of the program. At the district level, interviews were held with project implementation
agencies, training providers, trainers and trainees.

                    etc.)



Some of the key findings that emerge from this part of the study refer to critical steps in program
implementation and are the following:

                      (i) Quality and Relevance of Programs

While a competitive process (or the assurance of meeting certain criteria) is widely used to select
training providers, selection criteria vary, which most likely affect the relevance and quality of program
delivery (see Table 13). In several instances, the lack of a well- laid process to validate the training
proposals on qualitative grounds was noted. Competition mostly based on cost, or mainly considering
the infrastructure set-up or the availability of trainers as eligibility criteria is less likely to ensure quality
than competition that takes into account several dimensions, including quality of the offerings and labor
market demand. NSDC seems to be the only program which, through its multi-phase selection process,
contrasts proposals with results from skills gap analysis, an important factor likely to ensure better
program relevance. However, even in the case of NSDC evaluation, there is no mechanism to cross-
check whether the identified skills needs are already covered by other projects or programs.

The insufficient use of labor market analysis and attention to market demand lead to the selection of
providers and course offerings based mostly on availability of trainers and existing infrastructure, rather
than on job availability. This also explains why there is a concentration of offerings over a limited
number of trades across all programs15 (see also Table 3). Furthermore, even within this dominant set of
trades, there could be high variance in quality. Across states, recruitment process and qualifications of
trainers may vary. In Assam, faculty members are recruited through word of mouth; in other states,
through advertisements. In AP, trainers are expected to have a qualification equivalent to a B. Ed. In
other states, this is not required. In addition, compliance with the National Occupational Standards
developed by the Sector Skills Councils is only verified for courses administered under NSDC and select
courses under ASDP.

Another factor that may affect quality is ‘franchising’. It seems widely used by all programs, except
STEP-UP and RSETI, in the hard to reach areas, to help reaching training targets. However, while there is
a competitive process in place (even if imperfect) to select providers, there is no such mechanism for
franchised institutions. The review process does not look at the capacity and quality of their offerings
and monitoring systems do not capture their performance or lack thereof.




15
  Interviewed trainees confirm that the choice of courses offered by training providers is limited and that there is
often little demand for those skills in the local market.

                                                         28
                (ii) Assessment and Certification

Assessment and certification are important quality assurance mechanisms. They are found to differ
across, and even within programs, and to be deficient in many cases. While ASDP and SDIS guidelines
mandate third-party assessments and certification, there is no such mandate for STEP-UP. In the latter
program, assessments are done by the training providers and followed by certification with no
standardization across providers. In RSETI, certificates are issued by RSETI director but, while considered
as a necessary requirement, those are not sufficient conditions to obtain a loan. In NSDC, assessment is
also carried out by TPs with no external independent evaluation. While enabling TPs to carry out
assessments has the advantage of a lower cost and a more rapid process, the absence of independent
evaluation gives scope for masking quality deficiencies and the lack of standardization gives uncertain
value to the information that certificates are supposed to give to potential employers about the skills of
trainees.

                (iii) Monitoring, Reporting & Evaluation.

All programs have a monitoring system in place, some even mandate a fairly sophisticated one but
weaknesses are significant. The development of web-based systems which would allow quick capturing
and analysis of information, is mandated by several schemes (ASDP, STEP-UP) but implementation varies
as this requires significant investment and capacity building. Many states are still unable to capture data
online and TPs often lack the capacity (servers, internet connectivity) to meet reporting requirements.

Monitoring reports are often mainly aimed at claiming reimbursement and cases of duplication in
accounting of beneficiaries by providers which operate across schemes have been reported. When used
to evaluate TPs, monitoring reports mostly inform about placement metrics, geographical spread,
revenue and targets. How much verification is done is uncertain. For example, the placement rate of
RSETI graduates is reported to be higher than 60 percent while the quantitative surveys indicates a
much lower rate. There are, however, cases of more in-depth evaluation being done, such as tracer
studies or mid-term evaluation, as for example done by the DGET for SDIS, but it is not clear whether
there is any follow up.

Another limiting factor is the absence of a labor market information system (LMIS) operational at a state
level which prevents customizing training courses to local needs. Only NSDC is reported to have
developed a State Skill Gap Assessment with demand mapped at the district level, but there is no
indication that program implementers are using this information to rationalize course offerings.

                (iv) Post-Training and Post-Placement Support

Sustainability of employment is the objective of all SD programs and a critical element in program
guidelines. Investing in hand-holding, post-placement skill upgrading is encouraged as well as follow-up
for several months. However, implementation in most cases has just been initiated although some cases
of good practices have already been observed (Box 4).




                                                    29
Box 4. Some Examples of Good Practices to enable Placement and Retention

Through the various interviews of training providers (TPs), some good practices have been identified
and are worth highlighting:

         One TP in Rajasthan reported to have voluntarily initiated the post-placement tracking and
          support to the beneficiaries for a period of 3-6 months after initial placements
         TPs in Andhra Pradesh reported having appointed state-level nodal persons to be responsible
          for providing placement and post-placement support and guidance
         In Odisha, a TP indicated to have established a team of professionals which actively connect to
          the local industries, enable demand-based placements, and extend post-placement support to
          employers as well as beneficiaries.
         One of the TPs in Madhya Pradesh reported to have implemented on-the-job internship for the
          beneficiaries, for a period of 15 days within the local labor market to enable the beneficiaries
          get hands-on experience with the technical equipment, working environment and learn about
          the dynamics of teamwork.
         One of the major TPs in Madhya Pradesh indicated to have forged linkages with over 1,400
          industry partners across 6 states to facilitate placements of trainees.




 Post-placement support, when it exists, remains limited to a short period (3, 6 months, 1 year
 maximum). Since most trainees are young, in their early 20s, this implies support focused on labor
 market entry.

 By targeting youth and focusing on the beginning of working life, SD programs leave unattended the
 needs for upgrading skills/reskilling over the several decades of professional life and therefore, forego a
 large potential for productivity increases.

 Some additional findings specific to particular states and programs are worth noting:

          At different stages of the review, Andhra Pradesh (AP) stood out as better performer, a finding
 which is consistent with results discussed in the previous sections. Evidence of clear demarcation of
 roles and responsibilities and better harmonization and coordination among stakeholders with, in
 particular, the creation of umbrella organizations16 overseeing SD programs was reported in AP.
 Similarly, the adoption early on, for several programs, of a mechanism linking the reimbursement of 75
 percent of the training cost to successful placement and post-placement support to beneficiaries was
 found to differentiate AP from the other states and to affect quality. AP was also reported to have an
 effective e-governance system that greatly facilitates monitoring, reporting and evaluation, to hire more
 qualified trainers and (as said before) to have state-level program-specific nodal persons responsible for
 providing placement and post-placement support and guidance. While the quantitative analysis had



 16
   Such as EGMM (Employment Generation and Marketing Mission) which aims at better coordination across
 programs and at avoiding duplication in terms of targeting beneficiaries and accounting.

                                                      30
systematically found higher employment outcomes of SD programs in AP, it could not detect the causing
factors. Those described above could well be some of them.

         Several weaknesses of the RSETI program were pointed out, such as the absence of clear-cut
guidelines for the selection of trainers leading to different methods and qualification criteria across
states, a curriculum that has not been updated since 2010, and the limited acceptability of RSETI
certificates for loan provision (despite the program focus on self-employment and implementation
through the Banking network). Those weaknesses, jointly with the lack of positive impact on
employment found by the quantitative analysis, suggest the need for a thorough review and detailed
evaluation of this particular program.

    8. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations.

The analysis of survey data on employment and earnings of participants and non-participants in five
Indian SD programs has shown that these programs have, on average, contributed to increase the
employability and earnings of participants. They have also contributed to give them access to better
quality jobs, even if those are still predominantly in the informal sector.

While positive, the employment effect remains modest and significant labor market churning occurs
during the period of one to two years following the training. The wage effect seems substantial,
considering international evidence but may have been somewhat overestimated. The comparison of
outcomes of trainees and non-trainees (comparison group) was done without controlling for non-
observable characteristics such as willingness to work or motivation and may have led to upward biased
estimates of the employment and wage effects.

The second part of the study, based on interviews and focus groups discussions, pointed out that several
aspects in the process of selection of training providers and courses were not conducive to ensuring high
quality and relevance of programs. It also detected weaknesses in the quality assurance mechanisms,
monitoring and evaluation, and placement/post-placement support.

Both parts of the study suggest that all five SD programs may not be equally effective. When a
distinction is made between them, no positive impact on employment and wages could be identified for
two of the programs, ASDP and RSETI which target rural youth. Some weaknesses in the operating
processes of the RSETI scheme were also identified through the qualitative study.

All five states under study do not either seem equally effective. AP stands out followed by Assam in
achieving the highest employment rate. It also stands out as having more efficient operating modalities
and causes of greater success may have to be found both in differences in program implementation
capacity and processes and in differences in the economic and social environment specific to each state.

The following policy recommendations emerge from those findings:

         Program design and implementation could be improved by taking more into account the factors
that increase the chances of success:


                                                   31
         The most obvious factor is the quality and relevance of the training. It is well established that
close links with employers and a good knowledge of labor market conditions are effective to improve
the quality and responsiveness of programs to the needs of the labor market and the employability of
trainees. This could be achieved by: (i) developing and using more extensively labor market information
systems, sectoral skills gap analyses, tracer studies and feedback from sector skill councils/industry
associations, for the identification of trades and skills in demand; (ii) improving the selection process of
training providers (and franchisees) with consideration of quality (in particular, compliance with the
National Occupational Standards and integration of soft skills into the course content) and market
relevance of course offerings as selection criteria; (iii) making increasing use of apprenticeships, or
programs combining classroom with practical training (which were shown to have a clear positive
impact on employment probability). All these factors would help ensuring that training offerings match
the demand and respond quickly to changes in production processes.

        A more careful targeting of programs to the population groups for whom those programs are
particularly effective could lead to a more efficient use of public resources and a higher employment
rate:

          Selecting a greater proportion of applicants aged 21 or more would increase program
           effectiveness. The impact of training was found to be heterogeneous with respect to age and no
           employment impact was found for the very young applicants, aged 15-20. For those, efforts
           should be made to identify the causes of failure and on this basis, to reconsider the type of
           programs that could be beneficial for them17
          Screening applicants to attribute a larger proportion of seats to youth motivated to seek
           employment after training. One factor that affects the probability of employment is the
           motivation of applicants, and their interest in following the training as an entry point into the
           labor market. In programs focusing on self-employment, one important factor of success is the
           entrepreneurial trait of the applicant. As indicated earlier, around 28 percent of applicants
           enroll in SD programs with no intention to work after completion. Unless programs yield long-
           term benefits that can be captured several years later, enrolling those applicants represent a
           waste of public resources.

         Promoting independent assessments and standardization of certificates would enhance the
certificate?value?and the marketability of beneficiaries. As noted before, while enabling TPs to carry
out assessments has the advantage of lower cost and greater timeliness, the absence of independent
evaluation gives scope for masking quality compromise. Furthermore, the lack of standardization of
certificates reduces the value of the information that certificates are supposed to give to potential
employers regarding the acquired skills of job seekers. Practices followed by some TPs such as adopting
a course-specific standard approach to assessments to enable standardization or initiating joint-
certification with industry partners are examples of ways to address this issue and worth considering.
Training qualified assessors and ensuring the availability of a pool of qualified assessors would also


17
     Perhaps longer-term courses offering different levels of specialization and a wider range of skills.

                                                            32
facilitate the recourse to independent evaluation (several TPs in SDIS indicated that the lack of expert
assessors had constrained timely assessments).

         Strengthening post-placement support would make SD programs more effective. The
quantitative analysis highlighted that initial placement does not ensure sustained employment and that
significant labor churning occurs during the early years of working life. An effective post-placement
support during at least a period of 6 months to a year would help achieve a more stable employment as
it would facilitate information about job availability, lower the costs of search and thus, reduce the
length of unemployment spans between jobs. This again supposes an active engagement with the local
industry and service sector. In states in which local job opportunities are limited, the placement support
should include information about job openings outside the state and help in handling migration related
challenges.

        Enlarging the scope of SD programs and promoting life-long learning would generate large
productivity increases by facilitating the adjustment of the Indian labor force to the changing needs of a
modernizing economy As the need to acquire new skills, both cognitive and non-cognitive, is clearly not
limited to the early stages of working like, enlarging the scope of SD programs to cover not only
unemployed youth but also people already in the labor force (whether or not former trainees), would
provide them with opportunities to reskilling between jobs, change occupations and become more
productive. It would open the way to life-long learning and address a weakness highlighted by
enterprise surveys, namely, the very low level of in-service training provided by enterprises to their
workers in India compared to competitors internationally18.

         Linking funding to desired outcomes improves efficiency, provided incentives are well designed.
It is indeed well established that incentives can be powerful tools, but international evidence has also
shown that incentives need to be carefully designed to achieve the desired effect. Given the objective
of ensuring employment for trainees, placement rate has been the main indicator of success and
placement targets have been used (to various degrees) as conditions for funding in SD programs. Recent
modifications of guidelines have even tended to make these conditions more stringent.

         Encouraging placement through appropriate incentives should be maintained as it obliges TPs
and program managers to shift focus from inputs towards outcomes. It incites TPs to establish links with
potential employers and to offer courses that match labor market demand and brings some competition
into the sector. Placement also gives opportunities to youth to gain some useful work experience, even
if of short duration. However, a high placement rate may be very difficult to achieve if programs enroll
trainees who do not have a firm intention to enter the labor market. In the overall population, the labor
force participation of youth in the 15-24 age group is much lower than the mandated 70 or 75 percent
placement rate of some programs. Achieving a high placement rate thus requires a more stringent
screening of applicants to ensure that programs are targeted towards those most motivated. False
reporting might be encouraged otherwise.

18
  Investment Climate surveys showed that about 17 percent of manufacturing firms in India provide in-service
training to their employees, compared to an average of 30 percent in Europe and Central Asia, and to about 55
percent in East Asia (World Bank 2007).

                                                       33
An additional important observation is that focusing on placement is not sufficient to ensure a positive
employment effect. As shown earlier, placement does not ensure sustainability of employment.
Measuring the performance of SD programs requires a longer monitoring period, capacity for follow up
during at least a couple of years. Therefore, performance-based payment mechanisms should include
incentives to strengthen monitoring and tracking mechanisms and post-placement support in each
program.

          Pursuing efforts to strengthen M&E is critically needed across all programs. This means, first of
all, improving data collection and analysis, increasing the use of independent evaluations and tracer
studies, and what is most critical, making use of the information generated for corrective action. There
has already been progress in this direction but the stage of development of the M&E system still varies
across programs and states. The results of this study also suggest that a more in-depth evaluation of
ASDP and RSETI programs for which no employment or wage effect could be detected is needed The
difficulties encountered in finding training providers running the scheme in some states for ASDP and
the small sample size for RSETI prevent reaching definite conclusions but results do suggest that a more
extensive evaluation should be conducted before envisaging any expansion of those schemes and that
significant changes in design and implementation could be required.

        An additional recommendation would be to include, as part of these evaluation efforts, a study
to assess the long-term effects of SD programs. Such assessment does not need to be done on a routine
basis, but should at least, be conducted once. This would bring additional useful insight for policy
makers as one important limitation of this study (common to most evaluation studies world-wide) is the
time period during which the impact of training is being observed. The analysis covers a period of one or
two years after training and cannot assess the long-term effects of training. Knowing the long-term
effects would be needed to measure the full return on the investments made in skill development. It
would also help ascertain whether training youth who enroll with no intention to enter the labor market
after completing training brings lasting benefits or represents a waste of public resources.

         Learning from the experience of States that have been more successful could also generate
greater efficiency. The study has identified a number of practices, organizational features such as the
use of umbrella organizations, which have contributed to better coordination and much better
outcomes of SD programs in AP. Other states might gain by learning from the AP experience and
examining whether those practices could be adapted to their own environment. Some good practices
may also exist in specific areas in States other than AP. Sharing lessons from experience would benefit
all of them.

         One final recommendation is not to consider the SD programs analyzed in this study in isolation
but rather as part of a diversified package of human capital investments which includes education and
longer-term training programs. Even if most SD programs are found to have positive labor market
effects, expectations of their overall impact on the Indian economy need to remain modest. Courses are
of short duration and cost is low. The amount of human capital that can be provided through those
programs is likely to remain modest. While these programs can be a useful policy instrument to
facilitate insertion in the labor market, they cannot be expected to yield huge productivity increases and

                                                    34
need to be complemented by other types of human capital investments. Their targets should be
adjusted accordingly.

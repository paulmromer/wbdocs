Mozambique has recorded modest and geographically uneven poverty reduction in spite of
strong economic growth

1.      Over the past two decades Mozambique enjoyed robust and accelerating economic
growth, yet strong economic progress only translated into modest poverty reduction. The
economy grew by an average of 7.9 percent per year from 1993 to 2014, an impressive rate by
regional and global standards. However, Mozambique has struggled to translate this stellar growth
into poverty reduction. The national headcount poverty rate dropped by 12 percentage points
between 1997 and 2003, from 68 to 56 percent. However, poverty declined at a much slower pace
since 2003, falling by only 4 percentage points to reach 52 percent in 2009. 1 Between 1997 and
2009, for each percent increase in Sub Saharan Africa’s per capita GDP, poverty fell by 0.5 percent
in the region. Over the same period, for each percent of growth in Mozambique, poverty fell by
only 0.26 percent in the country, nearly half as fast. Consequently, Mozambique still ranks among
the countries with the highest levels of poverty (69 percent at the $1.9 2011PPP line), alongside
countries such as Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and
Madagascar.

      2. Performance in poverty reduction is uneven across regions, with some parts of the
country –especially the center and the north– accounting for a disproportionate share of the
poor. The distribution of poverty in Mozambique varies significantly by region. Overall, urban
provinces tend to have lower poverty rates than rural provinces, particularly those in the central
and northern parts of the country. At 10 percent, Maputo City has the country’s lowest poverty
rate. At the other end of the distribution, Zambezia has a poverty rate of 73 percent. Rather than
falling as in the rest of the country, poverty increased between 2003 and 2009 in the provinces of
Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, and Gaza. As a result, these five provinces together accounted for

1 The poverty figures discussed in this note are based on Mozambique’s national poverty line, which in 2009 was approximately
16 meticais per capita per day, or approximately US$0.90 per day in 2005 PPP terms. This is 28% lower than the international
extreme poverty line of US$1.25 per day used by the World Bank. The terms “poverty” and “extreme poverty” are used in this
report interchangeably, since all of the poor in Mozambique live below the international extreme poverty line.

                                                                          8
approximately 70 percent of the poor in 2009, up from 59 percent in 2003. Zambezia and Nampula
alone accounted for almost half of the poor in the country in 2009 (48 percent), increasing from
42 percent in 2003.

Growth has benefited mostly the non-poor, signaling low inclusiveness.

     3. Mozambique’s poor performance in translating mean per capita consumption growth
into poverty reduction is largely attributable to increased inequality in the country. Inequality
indicators in Mozambique worsened considerably between 1997 and 2003 and remained elevated
through 2009. The Gini index rose from 0.44 in 1997 to 0.50 in 2003, then slid to 0.48 in 2009,
remaining well above the level recorded in the late 1990s. In general, high levels of inequality tend
to lessen the impact of economic growth on income growth for those in the bottom of the
distribution. Growth could have had a much larger impact on poverty reduction in Mozambique if
its effects had not been offset by the observed increase in inequality. Poverty declined by 16.3
percentage points between 1997 and 2009; if inequality had not increased, the observed growth
would have led to a decline in poverty of about 26.8 percentage points. In turn, the poverty rate
would have dropped to 41.6 percent instead of the observed 52 percent (table 1.1).

                                                          1997                     2009             1997-2009

4.      Consequently, the lack of inclusive growth has undermined the enhancement of
shared prosperity. The enhancement of shared prosperity requires a growing economy that
benefits the bottom of the distribution relatively more than the rest of the population.2 The
Mozambican economy has been growing continuously since the middle of the 1990’s. Yet, the
bottom 40 percent of the population in Mozambique grew at a slower pace than the overall
Mozambican population. This means that the poor did not benefit as much from growth as the
more affluent. Between 2002/3 and 2008/9, the annual growth rate of per capita expenditure of the
whole Mozambican population was greater than that of the bottom 40% of the population. While
it grew by 2.3 percent per annum for the whole population, per capita consumption expenditure
grew by 2 per annum among the bottom 40% of the population.

Underlying the limited equity outcomes in Mozambique is a significant gap in the endowments
and economic opportunities of the poor relative to the non-poor




2In 2014 the World Bank Group introduced the so called twin goals. The first pledges to end extreme poverty. The percentage of
people living with less than US$ 1.9 a day should fall to 3 percent by 2030. The second goal is related to the promotion of shared
prosperity. It pledges to foster real income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country. This section
discusses how Mozambique fared with respect to the latter goal between 2002/3 and 2008/9

                                                                 9
5.      Poor households are characterized by having lower human capital, jobs of lower
quality and higher dependency ratios. Illiteracy rates, for instance, have fallen moderately
except for the poor. The national illiteracy rate was 62.3 percent in 1997 and declined to 57.7
percent by 2009. The trend is similar for the non-poor. Among the poor, however, the illiteracy
rate increased from 67.6 percent to 69.2 percent over the same period. Related to this, the poverty
status of an individual is related to the educational background of the household head. The more
educated the head is the lower are the chances of poverty and poverty reduces faster in households
with more educated heads (figure 1.2). And while Mozambique’s labor market is typical of a low
income country (in other words, high employment and underemployment rates), most of the jobs
where the poor work are of low quality. Demographics has a negative impact on the dependency
ratios of the poor since the size of poor families is close to one person bigger compared to that of
non-poor families (5.16 and 4.23, respectively).

Some of the regions, particularly those in the northern and center parts of the country, are
lagging behind the rest of the country

6.      The low responsive of poverty to economic growth in Mozambique is partly driven
by the fact that the provinces of Nampula and Zambezia have been lagging behind the rest
of the country, particularly between 2003 and 2009. In Nampula and Zambezia, the poverty
rate increased by more than 5 percent over the period, while it dropped by 17.3 percent in the rest
of the country. In 2003, Nampula and Zambezia jointly represented 38 percent of the population
and 42 percent of the country’s poor. In 2009, their share of total population had remained the
same, while their share of the poor had increased to 48 percent. The growth elasticity of poverty
reduction (GEPR), a measured to gauge the ability of the country to convert economic expansion
into poverty reduction, would be much higher if it were to be computed without the Nampula and
Zambezia provinces. Indeeed, Mozambique’s GEPR could have more than doubled from 2003 to
2009, improving from -0.54 to -1.18, higher than the regional average (Table 1.2).

7.       Differences in the changes in returns to assets, rather than changes in asset
endowments, which contributed to the widening of poverty differences between Nampula
and Zambezia and the rest of the country. While individuals in these two provinces tend to live
in households with lower asset endowments than the rest of the country, there is no evidence that
the population in the rest of the country has been accumulating assets at a faster pace. Results of
Oaxaca-Binder decompositions show that differences in endowments (demographics, human
capital and sector composition of the labor force, among others) explained about half of the
differences in poverty rates in 2003. In 2009, they explained only 28 percent. Instead, if mean
returns to asset endowments had increased in Nampula and Zambezia at the same pace as in the
rest of the country, poverty would have fallen by almost a half in these two provinces. One of the
possible factors contributing to these differences could reside in the fact that households in the
provinces of Nampula and Zambezia are on average more isolated than households in the rest of
the country. Returns to assets, especially education and land, appear to be lower in these provinces,
especially for rural households. Remotely located rural households are likely to receive lower
prices for their crops, pay higher prices for inputs and have fewer non-farm income generating
opportunities.

Low productivity and limited market-based growth in agriculture are major contributors to
sluggish poverty reduction

8.       Agriculture is a key sector to accelerate poverty reduction as it makes up over a
quarter of Mozambique’s economy and employs the vast majority of the population. The
agricultural sector accounts for 25 percent of Mozambique’s GDP, and employs about 75 percent
of the population. Yet, Mozambique has a vast agro-geological potential, which is still largely
untapped. In rural areas, more than 90 percent of household heads are engaged in agricultural
activities. Despite its key role as a fundamental source of livelihoods, the agricultural sector has
not been growing at a steady pace in recent years. Annual growth of the sector fell from 7 to 2
percent between 2008 and 2012. Over the past three years, the growth of commercialized
agriculture has picked up again, counterbalancing reduced growth in the resources sector, but
medium-scale and small-scale agriculture have lagged behind, only growing at an average of 4
percent.

9.     The influence of the agricultural sector in the economy is constrained by low levels of
productivity. In Mozambique, maize yields averaged 1.0 ton per hectare in 2013, while they
averaged 2.2 tons per hectare in Malawi, 3.8 in South Africa, and 2.5 in Zambia. Large productivity
gaps with respect to neighboring countries were also observed in terms of rice, millet, sorghum,
and wheat yields, as illustrated in Table 13 (World Bank 2015) (table 1.3). In 2009, labor
productivity was almost seven times higher in the tertiary sector and ten times higher in the
secondary sector than in the primary sector (Jones and Tarp 2013).

10.     The rural economy is characterized by a large number of gaps in productive
endowments, production support services and market orientation. A large urban-rural gap
emerges when comparing the endowment levels of rural and urban households across a wide range
of assets and access to services. Rural are largely in disadvantage in terms of human capital,
nutrition, access to basic services, housing quality, ownership of durable goods, sector and type of
employment, connectivity, and migration patterns. On the production side, the overwhelming
majority of rural households cultivate small plots for subsistence farming and exhibit low rates of
adoption of productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies, and limited access to production
support services (extension, credit, etc.), which together result in low levels of productivity.
Market orientation in agriculture is small, constrained by lack of connectivity and limited access
to input and output market information.

11.      Improved access and use of inputs as well as a deeper commercialization focus are
strongly associated with significantly higher crop yields. Econometric analysis, which control
for the influence of several factors, indicate that farmers who adopt technologies such as improved
seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticides, are more productive than those who do not. For instance,
keeping everything else constant, the adoption of at least one these agricultural technologies is
correlated with a 14.8 percent increase in average cereal equivalent yields (coefficient 0.138 in
column 5 of table 1.4). Similarly, farmers who sell a portion of their production are on average
more productive than those who do not. The former, for instance, produced 1,007 kilograms per
hectare of cereal equivalent crops whereas the latter only obtained an average of 795 kilograms
per hectare (figure 1.3).

              factors such as household characteristics, access to services and climatic shocks

12.     Similarly, access to credit, extension services, and participation in farmers’
cooperatives are positively correlated with uptake of enhanced agricultural inputs and
technologies, whereas high incidence of natural shocks reduces agricultural output. Low
accessibility and demand for agricultural production support services, including little participation
in agricultural associations, may be undermining technology adoption and economic opportunities.
Indeed, multivariate econometric analysis indicates that farmers are significantly more likely to
have adopted any agricultural technology (among improved seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, and
pesticides) if they had either accessed credit, joined an agricultural association, or received
extension services. Natural shocks also affect a large share of farmers, exerting both direct and
indirect effects on agricultural output and rural livelihoods. In 2012, about 73.6 percent of farmers
lost part of their crops, animals, or implements due to weather shocks. In trying to self-insure
against these shocks, Mozambican farmers prefer to adopt low-risk, low-return crops, forgoing
sizable economic returns.

13.    Isolation and limited access to information hinder market-based agriculture.
Transport networks are critical for agricultural development, yet the road system of Mozambique
appears to lag behind that of neighboring countries in terms of both coverage and quality. The

                                                               13
shortage is more pronounced in rural areas, especially in the poorest parts of the country. Around
81 percent of rural residents are still disconnected from reliable all-weather road networks. Road
quality is also a concern, particularly in rural areas, where most roads connecting villages to district
centers remain unpaved and in poor condition. Transport connectivity is particularly weak in the
northern and inland provinces (such as Niassa, Sofala, Nampula, Zambezia, and Tete) where
poverty is also the highest. Consequently, transport costs are also highest in these provinces. In
turn, low agricultural productivity and high transportation costs appear to be associated with the
low connectivity of farmers. Farmers in more isolated provinces tend to have, on average, lower
levels of cereal equivalent yields (figure 1.4). Moreover, a strong negative correlation between
productivity and transport costs also exists. Average maize productivity, for instance, is estimated
at about 1.2 tons per hectare in the districts that have close access to markets, namely where
transport costs are lower than US$2 per ton. Conversely, where transport costs exceed US$20 per
ton, maize productivity appears to be nearly 20 percent lower (Iimi and Rao, 2015). Another factor
constraining market accessibility is that farmers face significant obstacles in gathering input and
output market information. Farmers that received price information were more likely to sell some
of their production.

Mozambique is highly exposed to frequent and strong weather shocks

14.     Mozambique is among the countries in the region with the largest exposure to various
types of natural hazards. Mozambique is ranked higher than other neighboring countries in terms
of exposure to floods, cyclones, droughts, and all natural hazards combined (which also include
earthquakes and tsunamis). Long and severe droughts constitute a recurring threat, which are
experienced in 7 out of 10 years in the Southern regions, and in 4 out of 10 years in the Central
regions (GFDRR, 2012). Lower-intensity droughts occur even more frequently. Mozambique is
also particularly exposed to cyclones and floods. The coastline, home to over 60 percent of the
population, borders one of the most active basins of tropical cyclones, the Southwest Indian Ocean.
Each year, on average, Mozambique is hit by one tropical storm or cyclone, and by three or four
additional tropical disturbances (UN-Habitat, 2015). Tropical cyclones have produced devastating
effects in the country, with five tropical cyclones (of category 1 to 4) making landfall between

                                                                                                    14
2000 and 2008. Frequent floods tend to result from the high winds and heavy rain associated with
cyclones, but also from a combination of excess rainfall, upstream discharges from major river
basins, and poor drainage infrastructure. Floods generally occur every two or three years. While
relatively low, some degree of exposure to geological hazards is also present.

15.     The costs of weather-related disasters are remarkably high given the country’s heavy
reliance on the agricultural sector for providing livelihoods to the vast majority of its
population. The potential for disaster losses in the agricultural sector is extremely high in
Mozambique. In fact, the almost totality of production (97 percent) comes from rain-fed
agriculture, which is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events. A 2009 estimate of drought
and flood costs places average annual losses of maize and sorghum at 9 percent and 7 percent of
each crop, respectively. Further losses of around 20 percent of crops are also estimated to occur
once every ten years (GFDRR, 2012). Climate shocks do not impose costs solely on the
agricultural sector, but also on buildings and physical infrastructure. It has been estimated that an
average of 100km of roads and 33,000 households are impacted by flooding every year in
Mozambique. The high concentration of population and economic activities in coastal areas
predisposes the country to large losses in case of extreme weather events. For example, in 2000,
cyclone Eline, which resulted in record-high levels of rainfall (figure 1.5), imposed an estimated
cost equal to 20 percent of GDP (GFDRR, 2012).

                      standard deviation away from the district-level historical mean


Extreme weather variability reduces human welfare in the short- and long-term

16.    Individuals that were heavily affected by floods early in life have weaker labor market
and consumption outcomes in adulthood, raising their vulnerability to poverty. Econometric
analysis that combines household surveys, censuses and highly disaggregated satellite weather
data shows that individuals that were affected by extreme rainfall (droughts or floods) while in
utero or during their first year of life are less likely to participate in the labor market as adults.
Affected individuals exhibit on average a participation rate that is 6 percent lower compared to
unaffected individuals. Similarly, floods are associated with a lower level of expenditures per

                                                        15
capita –approximately 14 percent less– and higher likelihood of households to be poor –nearly 18
percent more. This evidence suggests that effects of uninsured weather shocks that occurred
decades ago show strong persistence over time and are still felt by affected individuals and their
families to this day (table 1.5).

17.    Partly driving the vulnerability of household welfare to weather shocks is the negative
burden placed by these phenomena on agricultural output and the affordability of
investments in the human capital of children. Severe droughts or floods can exert a negative
impact on agricultural yields and, in turn, on household income, consumption and food security.
In the case of droughts, for example, a measure that examines the relationship between water
conditions and agricultural output (the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index, also known as
WRSI3) reveals the high sensitivity of agricultural yields in Mozambique to extreme weather.
While data on yields at the province level is patchy, looking at the unconditional correlation
between the WRSI for maize and their corresponding yields reveals evidence of a positive relation
between water supply during the growing season and crop performance (figure 1.6). A ten-unit
reduction in the cumulative crop water requirement index is shown to reduce maize yields by 0.1
tons per hectare.

18.     Consequently, lower crop yields can reduce household incomes and consumption, and
significantly affect parents’ ability to afford nutritional inputs for their young children.
When confronted with floods or droughts, households may be forced to cut basic investments in
the nutrition and human capital of their children. As a result, the underlying mechanism which
causes the effects of rainfall shocks to persist over time is arguably their influence on critical
endowments of affected individuals, such as their health during a crucial period of physical
development (i.e. the nutritional environment in the womb and in the first year of life).
Econometric analysis that tests this hypothesis investigate the short-term impacts of floods and
droughts on the anthropometrics of children (0-4 years old), more specifically on the height-for-
age z-score, a strong predictor of height in adulthood. The results show that after a strong drought,

3The Water Requirement Satisfaction Index is defined as the ratio of seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration to the seasonal crop
water requirement, and captures the expected impact of water deficits on harvest at different points in time over the growing season.

                                                                         16
for instance, affected children are about 0.6 standard deviations smaller than unaffected children,
whose mean before the shock is -1.89 standard deviations below the World Health Organization
international reference group. Further analysis provides suggestive evidence that children affected
by shocks are found to perform more poorly in terms of schooling indicators (such as school
participation and attainment) and exhibit lags in physical development, with adult women
(anthropometrics data for men are not available) being 0.5-0.7 centimeters shorter than unaffected
adult women. And physical development matters in agriculture settings. Results for Mozambique
show a positive relationship between women’s height and human capital and wealth accumulation.

Tackling the lack of inclusiveness requires broad-based policies that address structural factors
in three major areas

19.     Sustaining growth and sharing their benefits more evenly requires addressing
structural factors that are worsening regional inequalities, constraining productivity and
market-based growth in agriculture and keeping people highly vulnerable to weather shocks.
The returns to growth have to be distributed more widely to invest in the most isolated parts of the
country in for these regions to be able to seize the economic opportunities brought about by
economic expansion and close the gap with the rest of the country. Efforts to promote economic
diversification and accelerate private sector growth – necessary for an economy that is highly
dependent on its natural resource wealth– should contribute to support more equitable progress.
Considering the importance of agriculture for poverty reduction, higher productivity in this sector
needs to happen alongside with higher connectivity to markets. Policies efforts to achieve those
goals also need to recognize the factors that constrain farmers with potential to develop
commercially-oriented production that feeds into value chains from those that constrain farmers
focused on subsistence-oriented production with limited potential to commercialize. Underlying
these objectives is the need to deepen the investments in the human, physical and institutional
capital of the country. Finally, given the high exposure of Mozambique to natural disasters, it is
necessary to strengthen formal and informal risk management systems to avoid that the living
standards of the population are highly influenced by major shocks out of their control.

                        2. Mozambique’s Progress in Poverty Reduction

2.1 The Evolution and Regional Distribution of Poverty

20.     The poverty rate fell sharply in Mozambique in the years following the end of the civil
war but the pace of poverty reduction slowed in the early 2000s. The Mozambican economy
grew by an average of 7.9 percent per year from 1993 to 2014, an impressive rate compared to
nonoil economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (4.4 percent), low-income countries (4.7 percent), upper-
middle-income countries (5.4 percent) and the world economy (2.8 percent). Despite stellar
growth performance over the past decades, Mozambique has not been successful in translating this
high growth into poverty reduction. The national headcount poverty rate dropped by 12 percentage
points between 1997 and 2003, from 68 to 56 percent. Poverty declined at a much slower pace
since 2003, falling by only 4 percentage points to reach 52 percent in 2009.4 Looking across
regions, poverty rates in rural and urban areas followed a similar pattern, showing a sharp reduction
in the period 1997-2003 but followed by a more modest reduction afterwards (figure 2.1). Between
1997 and 2009 population growth outpaced poverty reduction, increasing the number of
Mozambicans living in extreme poverty by 400,000 to a total of 11.2 million. To reach the goal of
ending extreme poverty by 2030, the pace of poverty reduction in Mozambique will have to
increase substantially.

21.    Despite achieving progress in reducing poverty in the last two decades, poverty in
Mozambique remains high both at global and regional levels. The $1.9 per day per capita
poverty line, evaluated at 2011 purchasing power parity, allows making meaningful international
comparisons of poverty levels across countries. After the end of the civil war in 1993, Mozambique
was the third poorest country in the world. By 2013 it was the 13th poorest, signaling progress in
poverty reduction. Yet, at 69 percent, Mozambique ranks among the countries with the highest



4 The poverty figures discussed in this note are based on Mozambique’s national poverty line, which in 2009 was approximately
16 meticais per capita per day, or approximately US$0.90 per day in 2005 PPP terms. This is 28% lower than the international
extreme poverty line of US$1.25 per day used by the World Bank. The terms “poverty” and “extreme poverty” are used in this
report interchangeably, since all of the poor in Mozambique live below the international extreme poverty line.

      22.       Performance in poverty reduction is uneven across regions, with some parts of
the country –especially the center and the north– accounting for a disproportionate share of
the poor. The distribution of poverty in Mozambique varies significantly by region. Overall, urban
provinces tend to have lower poverty rates than rural provinces, particularly those in the central
and northern parts of the country. At 10 percent, Maputo City has the country’s lowest poverty
rate. At the other end of the distribution, Zambezia has a poverty rate in the order of 73 percent.
Rather than falling as in the rest of the country, poverty increased between 2003 and 2009 in the
provinces of Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, and Gaza. The number of poor people in these four
provinces and in Nampula – another province experiencing a slow rate of poverty reduction –
increased by 1.6 million (2.4 percent per annum) between 2003 and 2009 (as shown in figure 2.3).
As a result, in 2009 these five provinces together accounted for approximately 70 percent of the
poor, a considerable increase from 59 percent in 2003. Zambezia and Nampula alone accounted
for almost half of the poor in the country in 2009 (48 percent), up from 42 percent in 2003 (figure
2.4).

23.     From 1997 to 2009, the poverty gap, which measures the depth of poverty, remained
practically unchanged, roaming between 57 and 59 percent of the poverty line . Headcount
poverty rates capture the proportion of people living below the poverty line, but do not provide
information on the depth of poverty. The poverty gap indicates how far the average poor person is
from escaping poverty. In Mozambique, the daily consumption of the average person living in
poverty was slightly over half of the national poverty line, hovering around 58 percent in 1997,
2003 and in 2009 (57.2, 59 and 58.5 percent, respectively). The largest contribution to the drop in
the depth of poverty, particularly between 2003 and 2009, came from the Maputo province, where
the average consumption of a poor individual increased from 62 percent to 66 percent of the
poverty line between 1997 and 2009. In the rest of the country, instead, individuals living in
poverty today appear to be as poor as those living in poverty 20 years ago. In Zambezia, for
instance, the average consumption of a poor individual decreased from 65 percent of the poverty
line in 1997 to 60 percent of the poverty line in 2009.

24.   Given the persistent depth of poverty in Mozambique, the amount of resources
needed to lift every individual our poverty has increased in absolute terms but has fallen as
proportion of the GDP. The Poverty Deficit, or Aggregate Poverty Gap, is the aggregate annual

                                                     21
income needed to move every individual right above the poverty line.5 For Mozambique, the Poverty
Deficit initially decreased between 1997 and 2003, dropping from $1,072 million to $910 million. From
2003 to 2009, however, the Poverty Deficit of Mozambique grew again, reaching $987 million in
2009. 6 As a share of Mozambique’s GDP, however, the Poverty Deficit has been falling steadily
since 1997, going from 18 percent of GDP in 1997, to 15 percent in 2003, and to 9 percent in 2009.
Despite having decreased significantly, Mozambique’s Poverty Deficit as a share of GDP is still
about 18 times higher than the average for all developing countries (0.5 percent). However, it is
comparable to the average for low income countries, estimated to be approximately 8 percent of
GDP (Olinto et al., 2013)7.

2.2 Inequality and Shared Prosperity

25.     Inequality is not only high but also shows an increasing trend in the long term.
Inequality indicators in Mozambique worsened considerably between 1997 and 2003 and remained
elevated through 2009. The Gini index rose from 0.44 in 1997 to 0.50 in 2003, then slid to 0.48 in
2009, remaining well above the level recorded in the late 1990s (figure 2.5). In general, high levels
of inequality tend to lessen the impact of economic growth on income growth for those in the
bottom of the distribution. In fact, as it will be discussed in the next section, high and rising levels
of inequality between 1997 and 2009 partially explain the relatively modest decline in poverty
despite the rapid growth of GDP and mean per capita consumption observed during the period.
Inequality in also high at a global level. Mozambique belongs to a group of countries where both
poverty and inequality are high (figure 2.6).


                                    Figure 2.5. Inequality is high and rising in Mozambique

5 Poverty deficit = (1-P1) x poverty line x the number of poor. P 1 is part of the FGT poverty measures and stands for poverty gap
ratio. It measures the depth of poverty.
6 In other words, if we had a magic wand and could perfectly target every poor individual, and magically raise their incomes to the

poverty line, in 2009 Mozambique would have needed approximately $987 million dollars per year (in 2009 dollars) to end poverty.
The value of the Poverty deficit, however, is not the same as the cost of ending extreme poverty. It is the size of the problem, which
is different from the size (cost) of the solution.
7 The 2009 poverty line for Mozambique is approximately 16 Meticais per capita per day, i.e.: approximately 0.90 PPP dollars per

day. The ratio of the Poverty Deficit to GDP for the developing world and low income countries was instead computed with the
$1.25 PPP poverty line. Therefore, it is likely that the Poverty Deficit of Mozambique with the international $1.25 PPP line will be
larger than the presently estimated 9 percent of GDP.

                                                                 22

26.    Impressive growth has not translated into enhancement of shared prosperity but
rather benefited more the better off. The enhancement of shared prosperity requires a growing
economy that benefits the bottom of the distribution relatively more than the rest of the population.8
In other words, it requires expanding the size of the pie continuously and sharing it to reduce
inequality. The Mozambican economy has been growing continuously since the middle of the
1990’s. Yet, the growth incidence curve suggests that the bottom 40 percent of the population in
Mozambique grew at a slower pace than the overall Mozambican population. This means that the
poor did not benefit as much from growth as the more affluent. Between 2002/3 and 2008/9, the
annual growth rate of per capita expenditure of the whole Mozambican population was greater
than that of the bottom 40% of the population. While it grew by 2.3 percent per annum for the
whole population, per capita consumption expenditure grew by 2 per annum among the bottom
40% of the population (figure 2.7).

8In 2014 the World Bank Group introduced the so called twin goals. The first pledges to end extreme poverty. The percentage of
people living with less than US$ 1.9 a day should fall to 3 percent by 2030. The second goal is related to the promotion of shared
prosperity. It pledges to foster real income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country. This section
discusses how Mozambique fared with respect to the latter goal between 2002/3 and 2008/9

                                                               23
2.3 Who are the Poor?


         Demographic characteristics

27.     The demographic structure of Mozambican households has remained largely
unchanged in the last two decade and, on average, larger households are poorer. Household
demographic characteristics such as family size and structure have an important role in the
determination of the socio-economic status and level of poverty of the households. In the case of
Mozambique, large families with children prevail. The average household size was 4.8 persons
per household in both 1997 and 2003, and by 2009 stayed almost constant at 4.7 (table 2.1). The
size of non-poor families is close to one person smaller compared to that of poor families (4.23
and 5.16, respectively), and this pattern is consistent over time. This difference is chiefly explained
by the higher number of children in ages 0 to 7 and 7 to 14 among poor families. On the contrary,
the number of adults is smaller in poor households. This demographic structure has adverse
implications on the dependency ratios of low-income families. In 2009, single member households
contributed to less than 1 percent of total poverty, while households with 7 or more members
contributed to up to almost 40 percent of poverty (figure 2.8). The average age of household heads
is around 42 years, relatively similar between non-poor and poor households.

28.   Other factors of the household structure such as the gender and marital status of the
head are also associated with the level of poverty. People living in female-headed households

                                                            24
were initially poorer than those in male-headed households. However, the gap has narrowed over
time. In 1997, 64.1 percent of people living in male-headed households were poor. The figure for
the female-headed counterpart was 65 percent. By 2009 people living in female-headed households
were less poor (51.8 percent) than those living in male-headed households (52.2 percent) (though
the difference was not statistically significant). Female-headed households whose head was single
or divorced experienced higher levels of poverty. In 2009, people living in single female-headed
households experienced higher levels of poverty (22.7 percent) than those living in in single male-
headed households (18.4). The gender gap in poverty was alarming for divorced or separated
household heads: the headcount poverty rate for male-headed households was 26.7 percent, while
it was 59.4 percent for female-headed households (figure 2.9).

       Human capital

29.     Illiteracy rates in Mozambique have fallen moderately except for the poor. The
national illiteracy rate was 62.3 percent in 1997 and declined to 57.7 percent by 2009. The trend
is similar for the non-poor. Among the poor, however, the illiteracy rate increased from 67.6
percent to 69.2 percent over the same period. Access to education increased substantially during
the last decade, but its quality among the poor has worsened. In 1997, poverty was 72.5 percent
among the illiterate and 57.5 percent among the literate. By 2009, poverty declined for both groups,
but the decline was faster among the literate people (figure 2.10). Illiteracy rates also vary across
other socioeconomic groups being lowest among the youth (aged 15 to 24 years old), the educated,
and the urban population. There is also remarkable spatial variation across regions. Illiteracy rates
are highest in rural areas. In 2009, over 65 percent of rural people were illiterate, while the urban
figure was 36 percent.

30.     The poverty status of an individual in Mozambique is related to the educational
background of the household head. The more educated the head is the lower are the chances of
poverty and poverty reduces faster in households with more educated heads. Poverty was highest
for individuals whose heads had no school education and lowest among people whose heads had
tertiary education. In 2009, for instance, the poverty headcount rate among people living with
uneducated heads was 58.2 percent, 29.6 percent for those living with heads who completed
primary education, and 8.7 percent if the head completed secondary school (figure 2.11). There
was no poverty among those living with heads who completed tertiary education. In addition,
between 1997 and 2009, poverty declined by 14.7 percent among people living with uneducated
heads, but by 49 percent among those whose heads completed secondary education. While access
to education has been increasing fast in the last decade, most people (80 percent) still live in
families headed by individuals with no formal education. Over 80 percent of the Mozambican
population lives with uneducated household heads. This situation is a core socio-economic
problem in Mozambique and is most likely associated with low labor productivity and low
earnings.

       Labor markets

31.    Mozambique’s labor market is typical of a low income country. Wage employment is
rare. Most people are self-employed in subsistence agriculture or in household enterprises. Unpaid

                                                    26
family workers make up a large share of the labor force. Judging by the ILO unemployment
definition, Mozambique has very low unemployment levels. But underemployment is widespread
and the quality of jobs is low. When one considers unpaid family workers as unemployed (the
national definition), the unemployment rates in 2009 jump to 38.6 percent. Further, as mentioned,
large part of those who are deemed employed are in low productivity self-employment and
informal jobs in agriculture and household enterprises (table 2.2).

32.     About 81 percent of the working-age population was employed in 1997. The figure
remained roughly the same in 2003, at 81.5 percent, but increased to 86.4 percent in 2009. The
working-age population as a proportion of total population seems to have declined over time, from
54.1 percent in 1997 to 51.5 percent in 2009. The weight of the youth in total and working-age
populations remained fairly stable between 1997 and 2003, but declined slightly in 2009. As for
the child labor rate, it has declined between 1997 and 2003, but increased subsequently during the
next period.

33.    Poverty rates vary across types of jobs and occupations. When one looks at poverty by
type and sector of employment, the heterogeneity observed is clearer. Overall, those working as
unpaid family workers, those self-employed (without employees), those working as domestic
workers, and those working in agriculture present the highest head-count poverty rates (above 50
percent). Those in the formal public and private sectors, and those self-employed with employees
present the lowest poverty incidence (figure 2.12). Individuals working as farmers experienced
high poverty levels, reaching a head-count poverty rate of 58.5 percent. Those well positioned in
occupations such as senior managers, professionals, technicians, and clerks experienced low
poverty levels (under 12 percent).

3. Growth, Inequality and Poverty Reduction: The Role of Lagging Provinces

3.1 The Growth Elasticity of Poverty Reduction

34.    Mozambique is one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa but it has
struggled to translate its strong GDP growth into poverty reduction. Over the past two
decades, the annual growth rate averaged 7.4 percent in real terms. Since the end of the Civil War
in 1992, the country’s GDP per capita has more than doubled in real terms (figure 3.1). Yet,
compared to the rest of SSA, poverty reduction in Mozambique has been considerably less
responsive to growth. Between 1997 and 2009, for each percent increase in SSA’s per capita GDP,
poverty fell by 0.5 percent in the region. Over the same period, for each percent of growth in
Mozambique, poverty fell by only 0.26 percent in the country, nearly half as fast as the pace of
poverty reduction in the region (figure 3.2). This low Growth Elasticity of Poverty Reduction
(GEPR) represents a major challenge that Mozambique will have to address in order to accelerate
poverty reduction in the future.

            Figure 3.1. Mozambique is one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa

                                   Note: Constant 2011 international PPP $


35.     Two separate phenomena underlie the low per capita GEPR of Mozambique: firstly,
a low per capita GDP growth elasticity of mean per capita consumption growth; and
secondly, a low mean per capita consumption growth elasticity of poverty reduction. Between
1997 and 2009, for each percentage increase in the per capita GDP of Mozambique, mean per
capita consumption increased only by 0.73 percent (figure 3.3) In particular, between 2003 and
2009, for each percent growth in per capita GDP, mean per capita consumption grew by 0.47
percent (as opposed to 0.81 percent between 1997 and 2003).

      Figure 3.3. The per capita GDP growth elasticity of mean per capita consumption growth is low and
                                               declining




                                             Source: World Bank


36.    In addition to not fully translating its per capita GDP growth into mean per capita
consumption growth, Mozambique has also struggled to translate the latter into poverty
reduction. Between 1997 and 2009, for each one percent increase in mean per capita consumption,
poverty dropped only by -0.44 percent, considerably less than the average for the SSA region
estimated at -0.7 percent. This elasticity was lower (-0.50) during the period of highest growth
(between 1997 and 2003), and highest (-0.54) during the period of slower growth (between 2003
and 2009).

37.    The low GEPR of Mozambique is driven by a large extent by the fact that the
provinces of Nampula and Zambezia have been lagging behind the rest of the country,
particularly between 2003 and 2009. In Nampula and Zambezia, the poverty rate increased by
more than 5 percent over the period, while it dropped by 17.3 percent in the rest of the country. In
2003, Nampula and Zambezia jointly represented 38 percent of the population and 42 percent of
the country’s poor. In 2009, their share of total population had remained the same, while their
share of the poor had increased to 48 percent.
38.     Mozambique’s GEPR would be significantly higher than the SSA average of -0.7 if it
were to be computed without the Nampula and Zambezia provinces. Nampula and Zambezia
have been holding back poverty reduction and negatively affecting the GEPR of Mozambique
between 2003 and 2009. To estimate the extent to which these two provinces have lagged behind,
“counterfactual” indicators can be calculated to estimate the performance the country would have
exhibited if it had not been for the negative impact of the Nampula and Zambezia provinces. Table
4.1 presents the “counterfactual” change in poverty rate, per capita expenditure and GEPR that
would have been observed for Mozambique if the Nampula and Zambezia provinces were dropped
from the calculations of these indicators. As shown, Nampula and Zambezia are the two provinces
for which the counterfactual GEPR is the highest. If these provinces were excluded from the
calculation of national indicators, Mozambique’s GEPR could have more than doubled from 2003
to 2009, improving from -0.54 to -1.18, higher than the SSA average (table 3.1).

3.2 Inequality as a constraint to poverty reduction

39.     Mozambique’s poor performance in translating mean per capita consumption growth
into poverty reduction is largely attributable to increased inequality in the country. Inequality
increased significantly between 1997 and 2003, and declined only slightly between 2003 and 2009.
The Gini index rose from 0.44 to 0.50 between 1997 and 2003, and then fell to 0.48 in 2009 (figure
3.5 in previous section). The Growth Incidence Curves (GICs) provide further evidence that the
benefits of economic growth have not been equally distributed across Mozambique’s population
(as shown in Figure 3.4). Between 1997 and 2003, while the population as a whole experienced
growth in consumption expenditure, those in the top 20 percent of the distribution benefited to a
much larger extent than the remaining 80 percent. Between 2003 and 2009, overall growth in
consumption expenditure decreased, and the poorest of the poor benefited the least from growth
(followed by the better off). The middle income groups experienced the largest growth in
consumption expenditure.

40.      Growth could have had a much larger impact on poverty reduction in Mozambique
if its effects had not been offset by the observed increase in inequality. Poverty declined by
16.3 percentage points between 1997 and 2009; if inequality had not increased, the observed
growth would have led to a decline in poverty of about 26.8 percentage points (table 3.2). In turn,
the poverty rate would have dropped to 41.6 percent instead of the observed 52 percent. Had the
economy not grown at all between 1997 and 2009, poverty would have increased by 3.2 percentage
points exclusively as a result of the increase in inequality.

41.  Increasing disparities across provinces –particularly between the provinces of
Nampula and Zambezia and the rest of the country– and not within provinces contributed
to the increase in inequality in Mozambique. The country’s inequality can be decomposed into
two components: inequality within provinces and inequality across provinces (table 3.3). Between
1997 and 2009, the contribution to total inequality of the cross-province component appears to
have increased relative to the within-province component. In particular, the contribution of
Nampula and Zambezia to the increase in disparities with respect to the rest of the country
increased. For these two provinces, the cross-province contribution rose from 3.9 to 6.8 percent of
total inequality from 1997 to 2009.

3.3 Understanding the Lagging Behind of Nampula and Zambezia: Isolation and Returns to
Asset Endowments

42.     Why did Nampula and Zambezia increasingly hold back poverty reduction in
Mozambique between 2003 and 2009? Did households living in these provinces accumulated
less assets than the households in the rest of the country? Or have the returns to these assets
increased at a slower pace? To understand the relative role of changes in asset endowment levels
and changes in returns to assets, an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the differences in poverty
rates and mean per capita consumption between Nampula and Zambezia and the rest of
Mozambique is carried out.11 The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique allows us to
decompose these differences in mean household per capita consumption and poverty rates to
isolate the role of changes in household asset endowments from the role of changes in the returns
to these endowments. Two components can be identified: the “explained” component of the
difference in the per capita consumption or in the difference in poverty rates are attributed to
changes in household assets, while the “unexplained” component is attributed to changes in the
returns to these assets.12 We start by comparing levels and the changes in the level of the
endowments that are more likely to impact household per capita consumption and poverty.
11The data used for this decomposition comes from two different surveys, the 2002/2003 Inquérito aos Agregados Familiares (IAF)
and the 2008/2009 Inquérito aos Agregados Familiares (IOF). Conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Estatística, IAF and IOF are
Mozambique’s national household consumption surveys and are designed to produce estimates of household expenditure, income
and characteristics.

12 The method used is the Recentered Influence Functions (RIF, Firpo et al. 2009) in which traditional Oaxaca-Blinder
decompositions are applied to different percentiles of the consumption distribution. This allows an assessment of the amount of
poverty reduction that can be accounted for by changes in the characteristics of households and individuals (‘endowments’)
43.      There is no clear indication that households living in Nampula and Zambezia
accumulated assets at a slower pace than the rest of the country between 2003 and 2009.
While individuals in Nampula and Zambezia tend to live in households with less advantageous
asset endowments than the rest of the country, there is no evidence that the population in the rest
of the country has been accumulating assets at a faster pace. As shown in Table 4.4, households in
Nampula and Zambezia are more likely to be located, on average, in rural areas than households
in the rest of the country; they also tend to have a lower number of adults with primary or secondary
education, a higher number of adults employed in the primary sector, and a lower number of adults
working in the secondary, tertiary, health, education, and public administration sectors. However,
in terms of changes between 2003 and 2009, it is hard to make any definitive claims on the overall
pace of asset accumulation in these two provinces relative to the rest of the country. Households
in Zambezia and Nampula have accumulated a number of valuable asset endowments at a faster
pace (e.g.: in terms of the number of adults with complete primary education). However, they also
performed worse than the rest of the country in terms of other assets (e.g.: in terms of the number
of adults with complete secondary education), as shown in table 3.4.

44.     Differences in asset endowments became significantly less important than differences
in returns to endowments in determining the differences in mean per capita consumption
and poverty rates between Nampula and Zambezia and the rest of the country. The results of
the Oaxaca-Binder decomposition show that differences in endowments (demographics, human
capital and sector composition of the labor force, among others) explained about 36 percent of the
differences in per capita consumption in 2003. In 2009, they explained only 28 percent (table 3.5).

compared to the changing nature of the Mozambican economy and poverty. In the RIF analysis, the focus is on a counterfactual of
a constant relationship between endowments and poverty in Mozambique over the period 2003-2009. This counterfactual is used
to determine which changes in endowments could have contributed to poverty reduction, and how much poverty reduction could
have changed because of a changing relationship between poverty and endowments. The latter is sometimes referred to as changes
in the returns to endowments, but really it represents how the conditional correlation between a given endowment and consumption
has changed.
In the case of poverty, the changes are even more startling. In 2003, differences in asset
endowments explained approximately half of the differences in poverty rates between Nampula
and Zambezia and the rest of the country. By 2009, only 28 percent of the differences were
explained by differences in endowments (table 3.6).

45.     If the mean level of asset endowments of households living in Nampula and Zambezia
had increased at exactly the same rate as households living in the rest of the country, poverty
would still have increased in the two provinces. A counterfactual analysis can shed further light
on the results obtained with the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. If households in Nampula and
Zambezia had experienced the same percentage change in their level of assets as the observed in
the rest of the country, poverty would have actually increased from 62.5 % in 2003 to 66.8 % to
2009.

46.    On the other hand, if mean returns to asset endowments had increased in Nampula
and Zambezia at the same pace as in the rest of the country, poverty would have fallen by
almost a half in these two provinces. Poverty would have fallen in these two provinces from
62.5% in 2003 to 33.9% in 2009, as opposed to the observed increase from 62.5% in 2003 to 65.8%
in 2009. The counterfactual analysis therefore provides further support for the hypothesis that it is
the differences in the changes in returns to assets, rather than changes in asset endowments, which
contributed to the widening of poverty differences between Nampula and Zambezia and the rest
of the country. Results of the counterfactual analysis show that Nampula and Zambezia could have
accrued significant gains in terms of poverty reduction if they had experienced the same change in
returns to assets that the rest of the country experienced between 2003 and 2009. In fact, poverty
in Mozambique as a whole would have dropped to 40 percent in 2009, instead of the observed 52
percent. On the other hand if Nampula and Zambezia had the same asset accumulation rate as the
rest of the country, poverty in the country would had been slightly higher at 52.4 percent, instead
of 52 percent.

47.     Why did households living in Nampula and Zambezia experience lower increases in
returns to assets than the rest of the country between 2003 and 2009? One of the possible
factors contributing to these differences could reside in the fact that households in the provinces
of Nampula and Zambezia are on average more isolated than households in the rest of the country.
In that case, returns to assets, especially education and land, are likely to be lower, especially for
rural households. Remotely located rural households are likely to receive lower prices for their
crops, pay higher prices for inputs and have fewer non-farm income generating opportunities.

48.     In fact, households in these two provinces are on average more isolated than
households in the rest of the country. Average walking distances to markets, bus stops, primary
schools, police stations and health facilities are all significantly higher in Nampula and Zambezia
than in the rest of the country. The proportion of households located more than one hour in terms
of walking distance from the nearest food market, bus stop, primary school, police station, and
health facility is shown in table 3.7. In 2009, a greater proportion of households were located at a
walking distance of 60 minutes or more away from the nearest food market in Nampula and
Zambezia (21%) than in the rest of the country (10.7%). The same pattern was observed for the
distance to a bus stop (18.3% in Nampula and Zambezia, 14% in the rest of the country), to a
primary school (18.8% and 13.7%, respectively), to a police station (75.7% and 59.6%,
respectively), and to a health facility (68.0% and 51.5%, respectively).

49.     Most crop prices received by farmers in Nampula and Zambezia are lower than those
received by farmers in the rest of the country, signaling issues with the functioning of
markets. Farm gate prices in 2012 in Nampula and Zambezia were lower than those paid to
farmers in the rest of the country for most of the main cash crops. This was not the case for all of
these crops in 2008. Moreover, between 2008 and 2012, sale prices for several crops rose at a
slower pace for Nampula and Zambezia than for the rest of the country (table 3.8). The price of
cassava, for example, increased by 2.45 percent in the rest of the country but only by 0.39 percent
in Nampula and Zambezia. In the rest of the country, the price went from 3.06 MZN/kg to 3.45
MZN/kg, while it went from 0.77 MZN/kg to 1.29 MZN/kg in Nampula and Zambezia. The same
pattern was observed for maize, rice, sorghum, large groundnuts, kidney beans, cow peas, pigeon
peas, and mung beans.

50.     Low levels of connectivity have likely contributed to keep returns to labor and land
low in Nampula & Zambezia. However, in order for limited connectivity to be the explanation
for the changes in returns over time, it should be that accessibility to markets and key public
infrastructure increased more rapidly for less poor households over time. To test for this, additional
Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions that include a connectivity variable (distance to a bus stop13) were
run. When included into the models the connectivity variable is found to be statistically significant
only in 2009.14 In 2009, returns to this variable explain 23 percent of the difference in log of per

13 Although the travel distance to a bus stop is not the only determinant of connectivity, it is the only reliable variable available
over time.
14 The dependent variables for these models are Log of per capita expenditure and poverty dummy as dependent variables
capita expenditure and 32 percent of the poverty rate difference between Nampula & Zambezia
and the rest of the country. This provides an indication that returns to being more connected
increased more rapidly for less poor households (i.e., for the rest of the country). Other possible
factors driving the differences in returns (not explored in depth in this study) may include poor
access to market information (prices, demand and supply), weak logistics to support rural
economic activities or relatively lower quality of basic services (education, water, electricity,
health, etc.).

51.     Along the same lines, farm households in Nampula and Zambezia earn remarkably
lower average incomes from farm and non-farm activities. As shown in table 3.9, the average
yearly income from farm activities for a household in Nampula and Zambezia was around USD
51 in 2008 and USD 82.4 in 2012. In the rest of the country, it was equal to USD 201.9 in 2008
and 255.6 in 2012. They also report a significantly lower yearly income from non-farm activities
than households in the rest of the country. The average yearly income from non-farm activities for
a household in Nampula and Zambezia was around USD 110.4 in 2008 and USD 266 in 2012,
compared to USD 467.89 in 2008 and 785.35 in 2012 in the rest of the country.

52.     Finally, disparities in budget allocations across provinces can contribute to widen the
gap between Nampula and Zambézia with respect to the rest of the country. In fact,
accounting for population size, the budget share allocated to Nampula and Zambézia between 2009
and 2014 is the lowest. On average, Nampula received 7 percent of the per capita provincial budget
and Zambézia received 5 percent, while the remainder of the provinces received larger shares.
While these figures cover more recent years, they provide an indication of the gap in the regional
allocation of funds from the central government to the provinces.
          4. Why is Agriculture not More Effective in Reducing Poverty? Low
                    Productivity and Limited Market-Based Growth

4.1 Overview of the Agricultural Sector

53.     The agricultural sector makes up over a quarter of Mozambique’s economy and
employs the vast majority of the population. The agricultural sector accounts for 25 percent of
Mozambique’s GDP, and employs about 75 percent of the population. In rural areas, more than 90
percent of household heads are engaged in agricultural activities. Despite its key role as a
fundamental source of livelihoods, the agricultural sector has not been growing at a steady pace in
recent years. Annual growth of the sector fell from 7 to 2 percent between 2008 and 2012 (figure
4.1) (World Bank 2015). Over the past three years, the growth of commercialized agriculture has
picked up again, counterbalancing reduced growth in the resources sector, but medium-scale and
small-scale agriculture have lagged behind, only growing at an average of 4 percent.

54.     Mozambique has a vast agro-geological potential, which is still largely untapped. It
has been estimated that up to US$567 billion worth of agricultural production could be realized,
assuming high commodity prices15, and that the resulting gains would mostly accrue to the poorest
and most rural provinces located in the central and northern parts of the country. At present, only
about 5 out of 36 million hectares of arable land are currently cultivated, of which 90 percent is
used for small-scale subsistence agriculture. Unlocking Mozambique’s agricultural potential
appears to be of particular importance in light of the fact that, while Mozambique currently
produces about US$3 billion worth of agricultural crops, it also continues to import about US$600
million worth of food and agricultural products each year (Iimi and Rao 2015). Raising agricultural
productivity would have positive implications in terms of food self-sufficiency and balance of
payments, as well as contributing to poverty reduction and inclusive growth.

15   These estimates were evaluated for the year 2010
55.     Agro-ecological diversity is a prominent feature of Mozambique. The south and
southwest regions, composed of arid and semiarid zones, tend to be prone to drought and are
associated with lower soil fertility. The center and north regions, more than 1,000 km away from
the capital, feature more sub-humid zones. They are therefore more suitable for rain-fed and
irrigated agriculture. Transport costs remain high as links between the south and other regions
continue to rely for the most part on a single road (Jones and Tarp 2013). Rain-fed agriculture is
vastly predominant in the country: less than 0.5 percent of all cropland is irrigated, and almost
exclusively for the purpose of sugar cane production (Salazar-Espinoza et al. 2015). As a result,
the agricultural sector in Mozambique is very sensitive to climatic conditions. Droughts, floods,
and other weather-related disasters are frequent. Climate change models indicate an increased risk
of extreme weather events with potentially severe negative consequences for the agricultural sector
(Suit and Choudhary 2015).

56.    The contribution of the agricultural sector to the economy is constrained by low levels
of productivity. In Mozambique, maize yields averaged 1.0 ton per hectare in 2013, while they
averaged 2.2 tons per hectare in Malawi, 3.8 in South Africa, and 2.5 in Zambia. Large productivity
gaps with respect to neighboring countries were also observed in terms of rice, millet, sorghum,
and wheat yields, as illustrated in Table 13 (World Bank 2015) (table 4.1). In 2009, labor
productivity was almost seven times higher in the tertiary sector and ten times higher in the
secondary sector than in the primary sector (Jones and Tarp 2013).

57.      A number of additional factors have been hindering the agricultural sector. These
include limited adoption of productivity-enhancing inputs and modern farming practices,
unreliable supply of electricity, insecure land tenure, limited access to rural extension services,
restricted access to credit, and poor infrastructure.

58.     The majority of production generated by smallholders is destined to their own
consumption, and staple crops account for a large share of total production . The value of
retained food corresponds to more than half of total household income (Salazar-Espinoza et al.
2015). The vast majority (99 percent) of agricultural producers are subsistence farmers: in 2012,
only 18 percent of smallholder farmers sold part of their maize production. Farmers tend to own
small farms, cultivate small plots, employ mostly family labor, and have very limited access to
inputs and mechanization. In 2012, six main crops accounted for 85 percent of total crop area in
2012, as shown in table 4.2 (World Bank, 2015). All of them are staple crops: maize, pulses,
cassava, groundnuts, rice, and sorghum.

59.     The highest proportion of agricultural households is observed in the poorest
provinces, where isolation is also the highest. Cumulatively, the Nampula and Zambezia
provinces accounted for 43 percent of all agricultural households and for 48 percent of the
country’s poor in 2009, but were home to only 38 percent of the population. Together, these two
provinces experienced an increase in poverty of more than 5 percent between 2003 and 2009, while
the rest of the country experienced a 17.3 percent reduction (World Bank, 2015). In addition, rural
households in Nampula and Zambezia are on average more isolated than households in the rest of
the country. Average distances to food markets, bus stops, primary schools, police stations, and
health facilities are significantly higher in these provinces than in the rest of the country.

4.2 A Profile of Rural Livelihoods in Mozambique

60.     Poverty rates remain exceedingly high in Mozambique, and are significantly higher
in rural areas than in urban areas. Progress towards poverty reduction has slowed down since
2003. Between 1997 and 2003, poverty rates declined rapidly, falling from 70 percent to 56
percent. After 2003, however, poverty reduction fell behind economic growth, and the headcount
poverty rate decreased only slightly, reaching 52 percent in 2009. Overall, between 1997 and 2009,
the growth elasticity of poverty reduction in Mozambique was only about half of the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, a stark rural-urban divide exists and has been widening in recent
years: in 1997, urban poverty was estimated at 53.1 percent, and rural poverty at 72.3 percent. By
2009, however, urban poverty had dropped by 23.7 percentage points, but rural poverty had fallen
by 10.3 percentage points only. As a result, the gap between urban and rural poverty widened by
13.5 percentage points (from 19.2 percentage points to 32.7 percentage points).

61.     A large urban-rural gap emerges when comparing the endowment levels of rural and
urban households across a wide range of assets and access to services. While being
demographically similar, rural and urban households tend to differ significantly in terms of human
capital, nutrition, access to services, housing quality, ownership of durable goods, sector and type
of employment, connectivity, and migration patterns (table 4.3). In addition, access to basic
services such as water, sanitation and electricity is substantially lower for rural households (table
16). About 95 percent of rural households consume water obtained from unprotected wells, as
opposed to only 46 percent of urban households. Among rural households, less than 2 percent have
access to piped water and over 60 percent lack toilets. Access to electricity is also very unequal
between urban and rural areas, reaching 41.7 of urban households but less than 2 percent of rural
households.

62.     Large urban-rural disparities in terms of housing quality and ownership of durable
assets are also observed. Overall, rural dwellings tend to be made of less durable materials, such
as grass, adobe, and wattle (table 4.4). Housing materials used in urban areas tend to be more
durable, as the majority of roofs is made of zinc foils, and walls tend to be in cement. Rural
households also exhibit lower endowments of durable assets with respect to their urban
counterparts. Whereas levels of radio ownership are relatively uniform in both rural and urban
areas, cellphone ownership is significantly more common among urban households (52.4 percent)
than rural households (11.2 percent). Only 0.7 percent of all rural households own a stove, as
opposed to 14.7 percent of urban households.

63.    The overwhelming majority of rural dwellers is employed in the agricultural sector.
The proportion of household heads engaged in agricultural activities reaches 90.9 percent in rural
areas. Nearly all the jobs in the agricultural sector are clustered in low-productivity, self-
employment activities (World Bank, 2015). Employment in other sectors (such as sales, services,
manufacturing, and public administration) is much less common in rural areas, suggesting little
income diversification away from agriculture (figure 4.2).

64.    The agricultural sector is dominated by smallholders, with very few medium- and
large-scale operations. Out of a total of 3.9 million households in the sector, about 3.86 million
are engaged in small-scale agriculture (based on IAI 2012). Only 52,851 households are registered
as medium-scale and only 618 as large-scale farms (CAP/INE, 2010). Overall, small-scale farms
still represent more than 99% of all Mozambican farms (World Bank, 2016) (table 4.5).

65.     Most farmers in Mozambique are classified as small, and are characterized by limited
ownership of productive assets and little engagement in off-farm activities. Less than 1 percent
of household heads working on small-scale farms have completed at least 3 months of agricultural
studies and less than half can read or write. A reflection of the broad material deprivations and
limited economic opportunities across rural Mozambique, small-scale farms tend to own fewer
assets and are less likely to complement their agricultural income with additional non-farm
revenues.

66.     Rural households appear to be significantly more isolated than urban households and
are physically less mobile. Rural households are more than twice as distant to the nearest water
source as urban households, on average (figure 4.3). Rural households also tend to be located
further away from food markets, bus stops, primary schools, health facilities and police stations
than their urban counterparts. Only 17 percent of the rural population is estimated to live within 2
kilometers of the nearest road in good condition, as measured through the Rural Access Index
(RAI). As a result, approximately 16 million people lack a connection to an all-season road (World
Bank, 2015).
67.     Rural accessibility is strongly correlated with poverty. In districts with a RAI lower
than 20 percent, poverty rates tend to be above 60 percent whereas districts with RAI above
60 percent have poverty rates in the order of 20 percent (figure 4.4). Rural and urban households
also follow markedly different migration patterns: while most of the former tend to remain in their
area of origin (80.3 percent of rural households have never migrated), the latter are more likely to
migrate (53.9 percent of urban household heads have arrived from other districts, typically in
search of productive employment opportunities).

4.3 What Is Behind the Low Level of Agricultural Productivity?

68.      Agricultural productivity is lower in Mozambique than in comparator countries. As
discussed above, large productivity gaps with respect to neighboring countries are observed
between Mozambique and its neighboring countries in terms of cereal yields (here: maize, rice,
millet, sorghum, and wheat). Over the past decade, cereal yields have also been growing at a slower
pace in Mozambique than in neighboring countries. For example, average yields of millet and
sorghum have been falling, on average, in Mozambique (by -1 percent and -4 percent, respectively,
between 2000 and 2013), while they have grown or stayed the same in Malawi, South Africa,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe (FAOSTAT, 2015). Also, both the number of farming households and the
area cultivated in Mozambique have been increasing gradually over time, which is indicative of
increases of agricultural output through area expansion rather than through more intensive use of
existing land. In fact, the area planted to food crops increased between 3 percent and 9 percent per
annum during the period 2002-2012, well above population growth.

69.     A strong negative correlation seems to exist between poverty and average yields in
Mozambique. Farmers in the poorest provinces remain less productive, on average, than those in
the rest of the country. In Nampula and Zambezia, where headcount poverty rates are particularly
high, the average cereal yield is about 761 kilograms per hectare. In the rest of the country, the
average yield equals 910 kilograms per hectare, 19.5 percent higher.

          Land allocation and crop choices

70.      The overwhelming majority of households cultivate small plots for which they do not
have formalized land use rights. The Mozambican Land Law states that land is the property of
the State, but it also establishes various modalities under which land use rights are confirmed. The
Direito de Uso e Aproveitamento das Terras (known as DUAT) is a secure, renewable, and long-
term user right that can be inherited, transferred or sold. DUATS are used mostly by larger
landholders, while customary and accrued land use rights for individual smallholders as well as
community land delimitation certificates are equally recognized16. Only 2.1 percent of households
surveyed in the AIS report having a land title (i.e. DUAT), and only 3 percent report having an
alternative document that grants them the right to use the land. In addition to scant land ownership,
in general land plots are small. About 98.7 percent of Mozambican farms are smaller than 10
hectares, with the average field area corresponding to about 1.7 hectares (Table 4.6). Most of the
land is cultivated continuously, with fallow areas often representing only a very small portion of
total field area (averaging 0.1 hectares in 2012). Since the mid-2000s, demand for land has been
increasing significantly due to spikes of food prices, increased demand for bio-fuels, and
accelerating urbanization.

Note: the cereal equivalent measure includes maize, rice, sorghum, pearl millet, groundnuts, cassava, and sweet potato. Together
these crops accounted for 85 percent of total crop area


71.    Most of the land is used to cultivate staples for subsistence rather than cash crops,
and as a result the share of production sold in markets is small. On average, farmers cultivate

16The Constitution (1990) establishes that land belongs to the State, but goes on to say that the ‘use and benefit of land is the right
of all Mozambicans’. This right is awarded to anyone who wants to use land for social and economic purposes, in the form of a
Land Use and Benefit Right (or DUAT). The Land Law (1997) puts these principles into effect through its Article 10 (men and
women can be holders of the DUAT); and Article 12, which is the cornerstone of the legal framework and details how the Right of
Use and Benefit of Land is acquired: a) occupation by individuals and by local communities, according to customary norms and
practices insofar as these do not contradict the Constitution; b) occupation by national individuals who, in good faith, have used
land for at least ten years; and c) authorization of a request presented by individuals or collective entities in the way established in
the present law.
5.3 crops and six main staple crops account for 85 percent of total crop area (namely, maize, pulses,
cassava, groundnuts, rice, and sorghum). In 2012, only 22.2 percent of farmers sold some of their
production. Consequently, the vast majority of agricultural output is retained by producers for
consumption within the household. The average share of production sold is only 19.3 percent of
total production.

72.     Farmers with a stronger market orientation are more productive17. As expected,
farmers who sell a portion of their production are on average more productive than those who do
not. Closely related to this observation, there is also a relationship between the type of crop (staple
or crash) and productivity. Farmers who cultivate cash crops are generally more productive than
those who only cultivate staple crops (figure 4.5). Farmers who sold part of their production
produced, on average, 1,007 kilograms per hectare of cereal equivalent crops. In contrast, those
who did not sell their production only obtained an average of 795 kilograms per hectare. Similarly,
farmers who cultivated cash crops produced on average 903 kilograms per hectare of cereal
equivalents, while those who did not produced on average 828 kilograms per hectare.

          Low rates of technology adoption

73.      Rates of adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies appear to be remarkably
low, particularly among farmers who only cultivate staples. Data for 2012 indicates that only
8.8 percent of farmers employed improved seeds whereas only 2.7 percent of farmers used any
irrigation method. Similarly, inorganic fertilizer is used by only 2.6 percent of farmers and only 5
percent applied Pesticides (table 4.7). Rates of technology adoption are particularly low in the

17 Cereal equivalent yields are used to measure farm productivity throughout this report. The cereal equivalent measure allows for
direct comparison of yields between Mozambique and other countries, as this type of aggregation is commonly used in agricultural
studies. The most important food crops in Mozambique (i.e.: maize, rice, sorghum, pearl millet, groundnuts, pulses, cassava, and
sweet potato) are aggregated in cereal equivalents following the methodology presented by FAO (2009) and Rask and Rask (2014).
Firstly, the average energetic value (Kcal/100g) is calculated; then the energetic value of each crop is divided by the average value
to obtain a conversion factor. The conversion factors are then used as weights to aggregate the production of different food crops.
Finally, cereal equivalent yields (in kilograms per hectare) are computed to provide a measure of farm productivity. Since the
energetic value of maize is similar to that of the average cereal, the resulting indicator is close to a “maize equivalent” measure.
cultivation of food crops. Restricting the sample to this group of farmers shows basically no
adoption of any of these inputs.

74.     The evidence available suggests that farmers who adopt technologies such as
improved seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticides, are more productive than those who do
not.18 Correlation analysis shows that, on average, cereal equivalent yields in the first crop season
were higher for technology adopters (figure 4.6). For instance, the average cereal equivalent
production totaled 1,340 kilograms per hectare for farmers who cultivated under irrigation, but
only 830 kilograms per hectare for those who did not, 61 percent less19. Similarly, farmers who
used improved seeds obtained on average 967 kilograms per hectare of cereal equivalent
production, while those who did not only obtained an average of 831 kilograms per hectare. The
difference in average yields was also large between users and non-users of fertilizer: while the
former produced 1,118 kilograms of cereal equivalents per hectare, the latter produced only 835
kilograms per hectare, equivalent to 33 percent less. Lastly, farmers who employed pesticides
obtained on average 955 kilograms of cereal-equivalent production per hectare, while those who
did not produced only 835 kilograms per hectare. The magnitude of these differences is not only
meaningful in economic terms but also statistically significant.

75.     The use of improved seeds, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and technologies
results in significantly higher crop yields, even after controlling for other relevant factors.
The adoption of agricultural technologies (i.e.: improved seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides, or
any of these) is positively and significantly correlated with yields, even when controlling for access
to agricultural services (i.e.: extension services, agricultural associations, and credit), for
demographic characteristics (i.e.: age, gender, and education level of household head), for climatic
shocks (droughts, cyclones, floods, and fires), and for regional fixed effects (table 4.8). The
adoption of at least one agricultural technology (among improved seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, and
pesticides) is correlated with a 14.8 percent increase in average cereal equivalent yields, ceteris
paribus (coefficient 0.138 in column 5 of table 5.8). Similar findings hold for each agricultural
technology individually. In particular, use of pesticides and use of fertilizer are associated with
16.1 percent and 40.1 percent higher yields, respectively (as depicted in columns 3 and 4). Irrigated
agriculture is also correlated with a 33.2 percent average increase in yield (as shown in column 2).
Lastly, the adoption of improved seeds is associated with an 8.5 percent average increase in yields,
although this result is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level (as indicated in column 1).

18 In order to provide a more complete analysis of the relationship between input usage and agricultural productivity in
Mozambique, a discussion of synergies among different inputs would be needed. However, due to data limitations, it has not been
possible to investigate this relationship further for this note.
19 The agricultural production measure used in this note is based on a basket of six main crops (i.e.: maize, rice, sorghum, pearl

millet, groundnuts, pulses, cassava and sweet potato). Together, these six crops account for over 85 percent of total crop area.

        Note: Cumulative distribution functions trimmed at 1st and 99th percentiles Vertical lines show median values.

76.     Crop-rotation and line sowing are uncommon practices. Only 29.3 percent of farmers
used crop rotation, changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each year, and
only 38.6 percent used line sowing, planting seeds with the help of a tool such as a seed drill (as
shown in table 4.7 above). The average productivity of farmers who adopted crop rotation was
slightly higher than the productivity of those who did not: 871 kilograms per hectare, as opposed
to 829 kilograms per hectare respectively, although it was not statistically significant. This result
is consistent with the rotation effect that results in increased productivity because of improvements
in soil physical quality and organic matter (see, for example, Bullock 2008). Farmers who used
line sowing, instead, were on average significantly more productive than those who did not: they
produced 924 kilograms per hectare, as opposed to 785 kilograms per hectare on average,
respectively20. Despite its yield-increasing benefit, line sowing has low uptake rates among
smallholder farmers, primarily because of the lack of skilled labor to perform the sowing task
(Vandercasteelen et al. 2014).




20Line sowing results in higher yields compared to broadcasting, primarily because it reduces weed pressure and maximizes
photosynthesis through increased exposure to sunlight (Crop Review, 2015).

         Access to information, skills development and production support services

77.     Smallholder farmers have limited access to key production support services. Services
from agricultural extension or through membership in agricultural associations, and agricultural
credit are either not widely available or used by the rural population. In 2012, only 6.6 percent of
farmers received information from an agricultural extension service program; only 4.5 percent
reported being members of an agricultural association, and only 2.0 percent had received
agricultural credit.

78.     Low accessibility and demand for agricultural production support services, including
little participation in agricultural associations, may be undermining technology adoption
and economic opportunities. When market failures exist, the ability of farmers to adopt
productivity-enhancing technologies and inputs is often limited. This issue is particularly
pervasive in rural areas, where markets for credit, insurance, labor, inputs, and output are often
plagued by such failures, and by issues of spillovers in technology adoption and asymmetric
information. Credit markets are of particular importance in accelerating productivity, given the
increase in the financial requirements of modern agriculture, which call for increased
mechanization and extensive use of fertilizers and improved seeds, among other practices.
Participation in agrarian associations, in turn, can help in pooling resources, exploiting economies
of scale, mobilizing community resources in pursuit of economic opportunity, and addressing
some market failures such as the lack of credit or individual liability. Membership in cooperatives
can facilitate access to agricultural inputs such as seeds, fuel or fertilizers, support the
transportation, distribution and marketing of farm products or provide sources of financing.
Farmers who receive information from agricultural extension services are observed to be more
productive, on average, than farmers who did not: cereal equivalent yields averaged 957
kilograms/hectare per hectare for the former relative to 834 kilograms/hectare for the latter.

79.     Multivariate analysis shows that access to credit, extension services, and participation
in farmers’ cooperatives are, in fact, positively correlated with uptake of enhanced
agricultural inputs and technologies. Farmers seemed to be significantly more likely to have
adopted any agricultural technology (among improved seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticides)
if they had either accessed credit, joined an agricultural association, or received extension services
in 2012 (table 4.9). Membership in agrarian associations seems to be more closely related to usage
of irrigation and fertilizer, while credit is associated more strongly with use of fertilizer and
pesticides. In addition, extension services appear to increase the likelihood of adoption of all
agricultural technologies of interest. Gender and education level of the household head also seem
to affect the probability of adoption of rural technologies. More educated household heads are
more likely to adopt any kind of technology, and female household heads are less likely to adopt
any technology. This result holds for each type of technology and is consistent with the fact that
female-headed households also tend to be poorer.

       Exposure and vulnerability to natural shocks is high

80.     High levels of incidence of climate-related shocks are observed in rural Mozambique.
As it will be evident in the next chapter, the country is often confronted with droughts, floods,
cyclones, pests, and diseases which generate significant agricultural risks. This, in turn, can lead
to food availability and affordability problems for vulnerable rural populations and urban
consumers, and sometimes results in sudden spikes in the food insecure population. Drought has
been identified as the most important agricultural risk, occurring in 1979, 1983, 1988, 1992, 1994,
2005, 2008, 2009 and the recent one in 2015/16/. Floods appear to be the second most important
climate-related risk in the country, and are likely to pose additional concerns in the near future as
excess rainfall events are expected to become more frequent due to climate change. Lastly,
cyclones are common along the coastline during the wet season, and tend to inflict the highest
level of damage on farm infrastructure and tree crops (Mozambique Risk Assessment, 2015).

81.      Natural shocks affect a large share of farmers, exerting both direct and indirect
effects on agricultural output and rural livelihoods. In 2012, about 73.6 percent of farmers lost
part of their crops, animals, or implements due to climatic shocks. A similar share of farmers
reported losses due to natural hazards in 2005 and 2008. In 2012, 62.1 percent of farmers
experienced drought (table 4.10). Floods, cyclones and fires were also prevalent shocks, affecting
11.0 percent, 7.4 percent, and 16.5 percent of rural households in 2012, respectively. In the absence
of functioning markets for credit, savings and insurance, major shocks are expected to reduce
agricultural output and, consequently, negatively affect rural livelihoods. In particular, droughts
and cyclones seem to have exerted a strong negative impact on agricultural productivity (figure
4.7). Farmers who experienced droughts obtained yields that are lower (economically and in
statistical sense) than those who did not: 804 kilograms per hectare, as opposed to 915 kilograms
per hectare, on average. Similarly, farms that were hit by cyclones had average yields of 705
kilograms per hectare, while those who were not yielded 853 kilograms per hectare on average in
2012. The occurrence of droughts and cyclones is associated with an average 10.1 percent and
11.9 percent decrease in cereal equivalent yields, respectively.

82.     Suboptimal cropland decisions partly reflect the desire of Mozambican farmers to
self-insure against weather shocks. In the absence of complete credit and insurance markets,
crop choice is often the only viable solution that remains available for farmers to manage risks. In
addition, the occurrence of shocks influences crop choices by shaping farmers’ perceptions of the
overall riskiness of their environment.21 After extreme weather events take place in Mozambique,
land tends to be reallocated from high-risk to low-risk cropping activities. Farmers tend to shift
resources away from cash crops and permanent crops after the occurrence of floods and droughts
(Salazar et al. 2015). This reallocation follows a short-term pattern, which is consistent with the
idea that households first tap into their buffer stock of food staples to smooth consumption when
a shock occurs. As climate change intensifies, weather events are expected to become more
frequent and more severe, and in the absence of insurance markets, crop choices are likely to
remain suboptimal. This may have significant consequences in countries in which large shares of
the population are still heavily reliant on agriculture for their livelihoods, such as Mozambique.
More specifically, this may further slowdown the pace of adoption of commercial crops or
productivity-enhancing technologies by smallholder farmers, particularly in areas where food
security risks are high.

4.4 Isolation and Limited Access to Information Hinder Market-Based Agriculture

         Physical accessibility to markets

83.     Transport networks are critical for agricultural development, yet the road system of
Mozambique appears to lag behind that of neighboring countries in terms of both coverage
and quality. The Mozambican road network is comprised of about 30,000 kilometers of functional
classified roads, and roads are used 98 percent of the time for passenger traffic. However, only 23
percent of the classified road network is paved. Road density is low compared to neighboring
countries, averaging 2.9 kilometers per 100 square meters of land in Mozambique, as opposed to
10.8 in Kenya and 5.5 in Tanzania (figure 4.8) (Iimi and Rao, 2015).

21The choice of farmers to diversify their cropping systems in order to insure themselves against weather shocks has been widely
documented in the literature (Benin et al., 2004; Di Falco et al., 2010; Bezabih and Sarr, 2012; Bezabih and Di Falco, 2012).
84.     The shortage is more pronounced in rural areas, especially in the poorest parts of the
country. Around 81 percent of rural residents are still disconnected from reliable all-weather road
networks. This means that about 14.5 million Mozambicans are isolated from the main urban
centers, markets and public infrastructure (Iimi and Rao, 2015). This compares unfavorably with
other countries in the region. While preliminary estimates for the overall RAI for Mozambique are
about 19 percent, it is estimated at 58 percent in Kenya.22 Road quality is also a concern,
particularly in rural areas, where most roads connecting villages to district centers remain unpaved
and in poor condition (Iimi and Rao, 2015). Transport connectivity is particularly weak in the
northern and inland provinces (such as Niassa, Sofala, Nampula, Zambezia, and Tete) where
poverty is also the highest (figure 4.9). Rural accessibility seems to be highly correlated with
poverty rates at the district level. In particular, poverty tends to be higher than 60 percent where
rural access is limited to less than 20 percent (Iimi and Rao, 2015). Transport costs are also highest
in the poorest and most rural provinces.

                                            Rural Accessibility Index
     The Rural Accessibility Index (RAI) is a key transport headline indicator that has been established to
     focus on the critical role of access and mobility in the reduction of poverty in developing countries.
     The RAI estimates the proportion of the rural population who have adequate access to the transport
     system. In this section, a newly developed RAI that uses technologies such as geo-referenced road
     network data and highly disaggregated population distribution data is used. It estimates the share of the
     population that lives within a 2-km distance from the nearest road in good condition.

                                       Figure 4.8. Mozambique’s road density is low




                                                  Source: Gwilliam (2011)




22A preliminary version of the RAI is published in the forthcoming report: “Mozambique: Spatial Analysis of Transport
Connectivity and Growth Potential”, World Bank, 2106. A new RAI is currently being calculated with updated road network data.

                     Note:Higher values of the variable Total_TC denote lower levels of connectivity


85.     Low agricultural productivity and high transportation costs appear to be associated
with the low connectivity of farmers. Farmers in more isolated provinces tend to have, on
average, lower levels of cereal equivalent yields (figure 4.10). In this case, distance to the nearest
food market is used as a proxy for isolation. The negative association also holds when using
different proxy measures of isolation such as distance to closest bus stop, health facility and
primary school. Likely due to poor connectivity, a strong negative correlation between
productivity and transport costs also exists. Average maize productivity, for instance, is estimated
at about 1.2 tons per hectare in the districts that have close access to markets, namely where
transport costs are lower than US$2 per ton. Conversely, where transport costs exceed US$20 per
ton, maize productivity appears to be nearly 20 percent lower (Iimi and Rao, 2015). While it is not
possible to establish a definitive causal link due to data limitations, these results are consistent
with the idea that long distances to markets do not provide incentives to farmers to increase their
productivity levels since the transportation costs that they face are high compared to the revenue
that they would earn from the commercialization activity.

86.    Low farmer connectivity has arguably contributed to preventing the agricultural
potential of Mozambique from being realized. Simulation analyses suggest that a 10 percent
reduction in transport costs to major cities would increase household agricultural production values
by 2.7 percent (Iimi and Rao, 2015). This result is consistent with the idea that road investments
could contribute to raise agricultural productivity by linking high-potential rural areas to markets.
As the rural population of Mozambique is expected to grow from 15 million to about 25 million
by 2050, efforts for improving rural transport infrastructure will be particularly relevant to help
provide better economic and social opportunities to rural dwellers (Iimi and Rao, 2015).

87.   Underlying the relatively lower productivity of more isolated areas is arguably a
weaker access and lower use of some important agricultural inputs. While the negative
relationship does not hold for all types of inputs and production support services, there are some
cases in which less connected farmers report lower utilization of improved agricultural technology.
For instance, provinces with a lower RAI are characterized by a lower proportion of farmers who
are members of agricultural associations. The percentage of farmers who use irrigation also seems
to be correlated with vicinity to roads. In addition, better-connected farmers are also more likely
to use fertilizer, although rates remain low across the country. This is true for all provinces except
Niassa and Tete, which share the longest borders with Malawi, where an extensive program of
subsidy for fertilizers is in place.

       Access to market information

88.      Mozambican farmers still face significant obstacles in gathering input and output
market information that can help them form decisions to make the most out of their crop
choices and harvests. In order for farmers to benefit from vicinity to markets, access to timely
and reliable information is crucial. Information can help farmers make better decisions on where
to purchase inputs or sell production, how to prepare for weather events, how to choose and plant
the best seed varieties, and how to combat diseases and pests most effectively. Access to
information on agricultural prices is of particular relevance for small-holders deciding to sell part
of their production. However, access to this type of information is still limited among Mozambican
farmers. In 2012, only 61 percent of farmers declared having received information on prices over
the previous 12 months (AIS 2012). In addition, only 7 percent of farmers reported having received
extension information over the same period.

89.     Farmers are still overwhelmingly reliant on friends, relatives, and the radio for
gathering information on agricultural prices. Over 76 percent of farmers that received price
information listed their friends or relatives as a source. While over 34 percent of households
declare owning a cellphone, only 3.4 percent cite it as a source of price information. Overall, less
than 16 percent of farmers reported having received information from sources other than relatives,
friends, and the radio (figure 4.11). In some particularly poor and rural regions, this proportion
shrinks considerably (in Zambezia, for example, only 9 percent of farmers received price
information from sources other than relatives, friends, and the radio).

90.     Farmers who received price information were more likely to sell some of their
production. Only 18.7 percent of farmers who did not receive price information sold some of their
agricultural products, as opposed to 24.7 percent of those who did (AIS 2012). Arguably,
expanding the role and outreach of information and communication technologies to enable timely
and affordable dissemination of relevant information to farmers would help reduce transaction
costs in the Mozambican agriculture sector, promote market participation and raise economic
efficiency.

          5. The Vulnerability of Household Welfare to Weather Shocks

5.1 Mozambique’s High Propensity to Natural Disasters

91.    Globally, Mozambique is among the countries with the largest exposure to various
types of natural hazards. It is extensively and increasingly subject to cyclones, floods and
droughts and secondary hazards arising from these events. While 17 natural hazards (i.e. droughts,
earthquakes, floods, storms) were recorded in the country between 1993 and 2002, as many as 28
occurred between 2003 and 2012 (World Bank, 2013). Mozambique is ranked higher than other
neighboring countries in terms of exposure to floods, cyclones, droughts, and all natural hazards
combined (which also include earthquakes and tsunamis), as shown in table 5.1 (EMDAT,
INFORM, 2016). The country also ranks high in two other dimensions (vulnerability and lack of
coping capacity) of the same index.

          Note: Scores are calculated on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing the lowest risk and 10 the highest risk


92.    Long and severe droughts constitute a recurring threat. Severe droughts are
experienced in 7 out of 10 years in the Southern regions, and in 4 out of 10 years in the Central
regions (GFDRR, 2012). Lower-intensity droughts occur even more frequently. Unlike other
weather shocks, droughts tend to affect large areas and have negative consequences for extended
periods of time. Overall, it is estimated that droughts have affected over 17 million Mozambicans
since 1956, and drought risk is projected to increase over the coming years, both in terms of higher
frequency and longer duration of droughts (EM-DAT, GFDRR, 2012).

93.     Mozambique is also particularly exposed to cyclones and floods. The Mozambican
coastline borders one of the most active basins of tropical cyclones, the Southwest Indian Ocean.
Each year, on average, Mozambique is hit by one tropical storm or cyclone, and by three or four
additional tropical disturbances (UN-Habitat, 2015). Tropical cyclones have produced devastating
effects in the country, with five tropical cyclones (of category 1 to 4) making landfall between
2000 and 2008. The coastal region, home to over 60 percent of Mozambicans, is the most heavily
affected and often experiences widespread destruction of infrastructure and population
displacement as a result of cyclones (GFDRR, 2012). Frequent floods, another common threat,
tend to result from the high winds and heavy rain associated with cyclones, but also from a
combination of excess rainfall, upstream discharges from major river basins, and poor drainage
infrastructure. Floods generally occur every two or three years, mostly during the rainy season and
along the nine major international river systems that cross Mozambique or across the low-lying,
densely-populated coastal areas. Extreme floods tend to occur once every 15 to 20 years. It is
estimated that floods have affected over nine million Mozambicans since 1958 (GFDRR, 2012).

94.     Some degree of exposure to geological hazards, while relatively low in Mozambique,
is also present. Generally, Mozambique tends to be considered as free from seismic activity.
However, since 2006, the country has experienced more than 80 earthquakes, with magnitudes
ranging from 3.9 to 7. In addition, starting in early 2015, continuous seismic activity has been
recorded, peaking at magnitude 7.0 (UN-Habitat, 2015). Therefore, while in the past geological
risks have not been particularly severe in the country, presently they do represent a valid concern.

95.     The costs of weather-related disasters are particularly high given the country’s heavy
reliance on the agricultural sector for providing livelihoods to the vast majority of its
population. The potential for disaster losses in the agricultural sector is extremely high in
Mozambique. In fact, the almost totality of production (97 percent) comes from rain-fed
agriculture, which is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events. A 2009 estimate of drought
and flood costs places average annual losses of maize and sorghum at 9 percent and 7 percent of
each crop, respectively. Further losses of around 20 percent of crops are also estimated to occur
once every ten years (GFDRR, 2012). Climate shocks do not impose costs solely on the
agricultural sector, but also on buildings and physical infrastructure. It has been estimated that an
average of 100km of roads and 33,000 households are impacted by flooding every year in
Mozambique, resulting in direct losses of about US$700,000 and US$17.5 million respectively.
The high concentration of population and economic activities in coastal areas predisposes the
country to large losses in case of extreme weather events. For example, in 2000, cyclone Eline
imposed an estimated cost equal to 20 percent of GDP (GFDRR, 2012).

96.     There is high regional variation inside Mozambique in the occurrence of weather
shocks. Exposure to natural hazards, both in terms of frequency and intensity, varies substantially
across the country. For instance, the southern and inland regions are more prone to suffer droughts
than the northern and coastal regions. Conversely, areas most affected by cyclones are generally
located along the coastline. In terms of floods, areas along the major international river systems
are the ones most likely to be affected, as illustrated figure 5.1 (UN-Habitat, 2015).

5.2 Rainfall Patterns and Anomalies

97.     Mozambique has a tropical climate that is characterized by two seasons . The wet
(rainy) season goes from October to March, and is characterized by heavier rainfall between
December and March. Most cyclones are also experienced over the same period, especially in the
coastal areas. The dry season extends from April to September, and is particularly pronounced in
the south of the country, making it more prone to drought. Due to Mozambique’s location in the
tropical zone, temperatures do not fluctuate much within and across seasons.23

98.     Rainfall shocks are prevalent across regions in Mozambique. They are defined here in
this chapter as district-level annual cumulative rainfall events between 1950 and 2014 that were
two standard deviations above (for floods) or below (for droughts) the historical annual mean for
the corresponding district. The annual historical mean is calculated over the 1901-2014 period for
each of the 128 districts into which the 11 provinces of Mozambique are divided. It is observed
that extreme precipitation (whether in deficit or in excess) occurs with relative frequency. There
is wide geographical variation across the country; provinces such as Niassa, Tete, Inhambane and
Manica record the largest number of rainfall anomalies. Major disasters such as the floods in 2000,
which were caused by Cyclone Eline and Cyclone Judah and affected mostly districts in the
Inhambane and Gaza provinces, are well captured by the rainfall shock variable (figure 5.2).

                             Note: red bars show districts where cumulative rainfall was two or more
                             standard deviation away from the district-level historical mean



23 Identifying rainfall anomalies, the most important dimension of weather variation in Mozambique, requires rich historical climate
data. The data used for the empirical analysis of this chapter comes from the CRU TS dataset, which is managed by the Climate
Research Unit at University of East Anglia. It provides extensive spatial and temporal gridded monthly precipitation data for global
land areas for the period 1901-2014, with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees (50 x 50 km). The data is constructed using records from
more than 2,400 meteorological stations across the world. Station anomalies are interpolated into grid cells combined with local
climatology data to obtain absolute monthly values. The variables included in the dataset in addition to precipitation are mean
temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapor pressure and cloud cover (Harris, et al. 2014). For the empirical
analysis, the rainfall and temperature variables are weighted by population at the district level and are obtained by overlaying the
gridded CRU TS climate data with population and district-level grid maps.
99.     Further analysis of weather data over a long interval of time reveals that some regions
of Mozambique are experiencing a reduction in total rainfall. One of the expected
consequences of a warmer world is a regional change in total precipitation. In Mozambique, some
provinces recorded rainfall levels in the 2000s that are quantitatively and statistically lower that
the levels seen in previous decades. For instance, Cabo Delgado recorded an annual rainfall
average of 957 and 943 millimeters in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. These levels of
precipitation are statistically lower than the average annual precipitation in the 1970s (1035
millimeters). In the case of Zambezia, its rainfall levels in the last 25 years are lower than those
recorded between the 1950’s and 1980s. A similar pattern is observed for Nampula, which jointly
with Zambezia are the poorest provinces in the country (figure 5.3).

          Figure 5.3. Some provinces in Mozambique are experiencing lower rainfall in recent decades

100.    There is, however, no evidence of changes in rainfall seasonality across the country
and variability across years. Climate change is expected to also alter other aspects of rainfall
regimes such as the seasonal distribution across space, namely a change in the timing of the onset
of the rainy and dry seasons across different regions. Similarly, the literature predicts changes in
inter-annual variability. Both variations are expected to have effects on agricultural output and
farmers’ livelihoods. The rainfall data from CRU TS for Mozambique does not provide evidence
of such changes: 10-year average monthly rainfall shares are statistically similar for every month
for the period 1930-2014, suggesting that the seasonal changes in rainfall recorded for
Mozambique are within the standard intervals of variation. Likewise, there is no evidence of a
systematic change in rainfall variation across years.

5.3. The Effects of Rainfall Shocks in Early Life on Long-Term Human Welfare

       Weather shocks reduce household welfare

101.    The objective of this analysis is to empirically estimate the causal effect of exposure
to rainfall shocks in early childhood on long-term socioeconomic outcomes in Mozambique.
The analysis is based on rainfall variation across space and time. More specifically, it compares
the outcomes of adults who were in districts exposed to extreme rainfall anomalies around the time
of birth (i.e. in utero or during the first year of life) against outcomes of individuals in the same
age cohort who resided in districts not affected by weather shocks as well as against outcomes of
individuals from slightly or older younger cohorts in affected and unaffected districts. The causal
effects of the shocks were obtained using statistical regression analysis that run measures of long-
term outcomes of a certain individual i in a district d and at time t, and the weather shock indicators
(see Annex 1 for more details about the empirical design and data).

102.    Exposure to extreme early-life rainfall anomalies, and particularly to floods, appears
to have a negative relationship with the employability of individuals in adulthood. First, the
analysis investigates whether individuals that experienced severe droughts or floods while in utero
or during their first year of life are less likely to participate in the labor market or not. Two
indicators are defined: the first one (Labor Participation 1) measures engagement or desire to work
in remunerated activities, whereas the second one (Labor Participation 2) adds participation in
non-remunerated activities to the first definition. The results indicate that excess of rainfall while
in utero had a negative effect on their probability to participate in the labor market later in life
(Table 5.2). Affected individuals exhibit on average a participation rate that is 6 percent lower
compared to the control mean. This subset of the findings is quite consistent across subsamples
(all versus rural) or the inclusion of variable for factors that are specific to districts (also known as
“fixed effects”).24 As for the droughts, they are not found to influence labor force participation,
regardless of whether they were experienced while in utero or in the first year of life.

103.   Similarly, floods are associated with a lower level of expenditures per capita and
higher likelihood of households to be poor. The analysis also investigates the relationship
between droughts and floods and expenditures per capita. Seeking to pinpoint the direct effects on
household wellbeing, the subsample for this part of the analysis consists of individuals that are
household heads. Consistent with the results on labor participation, households headed by
individuals that were hit by floods while in utero and during early childhood record lower

floods are seen only for the in utero period.
comparison group (table 5.3). The results are statistically weaker for the rural subsample.
Regarding poverty vulnerability, lower consumption per capita due to floods that affected
individuals early in life increases the likelihood that the households they head in adulthood fall
below the poverty line (9 percentage points or around 18 percent). This evidence suggests that
effects of uninsured weather shocks that occurred decades ago show strong persistence over time
and are still felt by affected individuals and their families to this day.

            Why Negative Effects? The agricultural output channel

104.    The burden placed by rainfall shocks on agricultural output in the short term is
identified as the most plausible channel driving the effects on socioeconomic outcomes in the
long run. Back in the 1970s, virtually all Mozambicans (nearly 98 percent) lived in rural areas. At
the time, agriculture –even more so than today— represented the main source of their livelihoods.
Arguably, agriculture is therefore the main mechanism at play behind the observed negative
impacts, as the shocks examined in this study are expected to strongly affect soil water balance.
As a result, severe droughts or floods can exert a negative impact on yields and, in turn, on
household income, consumption and food security.

105.    In the case of droughts, a measure that examines the relationship between water
conditions and agricultural yields in Mozambique can be used to gauge the possible effects
of water shortage on agricultural output. The Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI) is
a measure employed by the Famine Early Warning System project (FEWS NET) to predict harvest
outcomes and to identify potential food security issues on a seasonal basis. The WRSI is defined
as the ratio of seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration to the seasonal crop water requirement, and
captures the expected impact of water deficits on harvest at different points in time over the
growing season. The WRSI is crop-specific, spatially explicit and dynamically identifies start-of
season based on rainfall patterns. It ranges between 0 and 100, with values below 50 showing
levels of soil water well below the minimum. Its limitations include not accounting for excess
water (e.g. floods), and the fairly coarse resolution of some of its static inputs (e.g. soil water
holding capacity). The computation of the WRSI for Mozambique confirms the high prevalence
of years in which soil humidity is well below the critical levels required for the normal growth and
harvest of maize crops (figure 5.4).

106.    Weather data and crop growth models reveal the high sensitivity of agricultural
output to extreme weather in Mozambique. While data on agricultural yields at the province
level is patchy, looking at the unconditional correlation between the WRSI for maize and their
corresponding yields reveals evidence of a positive relation between water supply during the
growing season and crop performance (figure 5.5). A ten-unit reduction in the cumulative crop
water requirement index is shown to reduce maize yields by 0.1 tons per hectare. Figure 6.5 also
illustrates the existence of a positive relationship between yield anomalies (i.e.: deviations from
the mean at the provincial level) and WRSI anomalies. Since the WRSI is capped at 100 and is not
designed to measure excess water, the points located in the lower right of the graph might be
revealing the negative effects of too much rain or flooding. Low values of the WRSI are observed
with high frequency in Mozambique, and this may be indicative of recurrent crop failures in the
areas in which precipitation levels fall well below the historical mean (as shown in Figure 5.5).

107.    Lower crop yields caused by rainfall shocks can reduce household incomes and
consumption, and significantly affect parents’ ability to afford nutritional inputs for their
young children. When confronted with floods or droughts, households may be forced to cut basic
investments in the nutrition and human capital of their children. As a result, the underlying
mechanism which causes the effects of rainfall shocks to persist over time is arguably their
influence on critical endowments of affected individuals, such as their health during a crucial
period of physical development (i.e. the nutritional environment in the womb and in the first year
of life). Therefore, the same identification strategy employed in the models above is used to
explore the contemporaneous (i.e. short-term) impacts of the same floods and droughts on the
anthropometrics of children (0-4 years old), more specifically on the height-for-age z-score, a
strong predictor of height in adulthood.

108.     The results show a strong relationship between rainfall anomalies (both droughts and
floods) in the first year of life and the height-for-age z-score. Shortly after the extreme shocks
occur, affected children are about 0.6 standard deviations smaller than the control children, whose
mean is -1.89 standard deviations below the World Health Organization international reference
group. The results, illustrated in table 5.4, are robust across specifications and subsamples, and are
statistically significant in a quantitative sense.

Why Negative Effects? The short- and long-term human capital and productivity channel

109.    Children affected by shocks are found to perform more poorly in terms of schooling
indicators, and this is possibly mediated by the negative effects of extreme rainfall anomalies
on their health as infants. Results of econometric analysis on school participation and attainment
show that droughts reduce the likelihood of school-aged children to attend school regularly.
Overall, affected children accumulate 0.2 fewer years of schooling, equivalent to a drop in their
school attainment of 6 percent relative to the mean among unaffected children (3.3 years) (table
5.5). Similarly, affected individuals are 1.4 percentage points (2.8 percent) less likely to
accumulate some level of education. It is unlikely that rainfall anomalies occurring around the time
of birth exerted a direct impact on school enrollment, attendance, progress and attainment of the
children. In fact, affected infants had to wait at least 4 or 5 years after the shocks happened before
they formally started school. The most plausible explanation is therefore that the negative effects
of droughts and floods on the schooling of affected individuals are mediated by the influence that
these shocks exerted on their nutritional and health status as infants.

110.    The nutritional deprivations suffered in infancy also appear to have long-lasting
consequences on the physical development of affected individuals. In an effort to connect early
life health shocks –caused by extreme weather– and well-being in adulthood, the analysis looks at
the height of adults several decades after they experienced droughts and floods around the time of
birth. While comprehensive data on adult anthropometrics is rarely available in household surveys,
the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) constitutes an exception but collects data only for
women 15 to 40 years old, and not for men. The DHS also lacks information concerning the place
and date of birth of adults in the sample. For this analysis, women’s anthropometric data (i.e.:
height, measured as a percentage of an international reference group) in the DHS is used. An
attempt to circumvent lack of information on date and location of birth is made by restricting the
sample to include only districts with permanent migration rates below 20 percent. To do so, the
1997 census is used to calculate the share of adults born in the same district of permanent residence.
Reduced-form results on this sample are shown in columns 5 and 6 of table 5.625. The results
indicate that extreme rainfall events experienced during infancy, particularly droughts for the
district fixed effect models, hamper the physical development of women. Affected women are
around 0.5-0.7 centimeters shorter than the comparison unaffected women, on average.

111.    Suggestive evidence of positive returns to health in Mozambique is found, implying
that uninsured weather shocks that worsen nutrition status also leads to lower productivity.
The existence of a positive association between improved nutrition and increased productivity is
often assumed and has been widely demonstrated in the empirical literature. Good health is
particularly important in agricultural settings in developing countries, where the structure of
employment requires strong physical development, particularly among men. To contextualize the
negative effects of weather shocks on adults’ height, this study provides non-parametrical
estimates of the relationship between height and school attainment and wealth for adult women in
Mozambique (figure 6.6). The results show a positive relationship between women’s height and
human capital and wealth accumulation. This implies that the physical development lost due to
extreme weather is likely to translate into lower productivity and, ultimately, lower welfare.26

25 The internal validity of these results may be compromised by the fact migration decisions are likely endogenous to weather
shocks. However, a district-level regression of migration rates on weather shocks and district fixed effects do not reveal systematic
differences in migration patterns between affected and non-affected villages.
26 The relationship is estimated with much less precision for women above 175cms because of the low number of observations in

this height range.

                                         6. Conclusion

112.   Over the past two decades Mozambique enjoyed robust and accelerating economic
growth, yet strong economic progress only translated into modest poverty reduction. The
economy grew by an average of 7.9 percent per year from 1993 to 2014, an impressive rate by
regional and global standards. However, Mozambique has struggled to translate this stellar growth
into poverty reduction. Between 1997 and 2009, for each percent increase in SSA’s per capita
GDP, poverty fell by 0.5 percent in the region. Over the same period, for each percent of growth
in Mozambique, poverty fell by only 0.26 percent in the country, nearly half as fast as the pace of
poverty reduction in the region. At 52 percent in 2009, the level of poverty level is high both
regionally and globally. After the end of the civil war in 1993, Mozambique was the third poorest
country in the world. By 2013 it was the 13th poorest, signaling progress in poverty reduction.
Yet, with a poverty rate of 69 percent ($1.9 2011PPP), Mozambique still ranks among the countries
with the highest levels of poverty, alongside countries such as Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Madagascar.

113.    Not only poverty fell at slower pace than expected but the gains in income and
consumption growth are unevenly distributed across the country and across groups of
people. Some parts of the country –especially the center and the north– account for a
disproportionate share of the poor. Overall, urban provinces tend to have lower poverty rates than
rural provinces, particularly those in the central and northern parts of the country. Maputo City has
the country’s lowest poverty rate. At the other end of the distribution, Zambezia has a poverty rate
in the order of 73 percent. Rather than falling as in the rest of the country, poverty increased
between 2003 and 2009 in the provinces of Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, and Gaza. These five
provinces together accounted for approximately 70 percent of the poor, a considerable increase
from 59 percent in 2003. Looking across income groups, the better off benefitted disproportionally
from economic growth. Between 2002/3 and 2008/9, the annual growth rate of per capita
expenditure of the bottom 40% of the population was lower than the rate of the upper part of the
distribution.

114.     Three factors contribute to the low equity outcomes in Mozambique: unequal access
to economic opportunities across regions and income groups, low productivity and market-
based growth in agriculture and high vulnerability to weather shocks. Growth could have had
a much larger impact on poverty reduction in Mozambique if its effects had not been offset by the
observed increase in inequality. Largely contributing to that inequality is the lagging behind of the
most isolated regions in the norther parts of the country, especially Nampula and Zambezia. While
there is no clear indication that households living in these provinces accumulated assets at a slower
pace than the rest of the country, they are substantially less able to earn fair returns on their
productive assets, and lack of connectivity is an important factor underlying that inability. A
second explanation is the underperformance of agriculture, a sector that employs the vast majority
of the poor. The sector is dominated by smallholders, subsistence farming, low rates of adoption
of productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies and limited access to production support
services (extension, credit, etc.), which result in low levels of productivity. Market orientation in
agriculture is small, constrained by lack of connectivity and limited access to input and output
market information. The third hypothesis investigated in this study documents sizable negative
effects of uninsured weather shocks (such as floods and droughts) on the labor market, income and
consumption outcomes of affected individuals.

115.    Accelerating poverty reduction requires addressing structural factors that
undermine the inclusiveness of growth. The returns to growth have to be distributed more widely
to invest in the most isolated parts of the country in for these regions to be able to seize the
economic opportunities brought about by economic expansion and close the gap with the rest of
the country. Efforts to promote economic diversification and accelerate private sector growth –
necessary for an economy that is highly dependent on its natural resource wealth– should
contribute to support more equitable progress. Considering the importance of agriculture for
poverty reduction, higher productivity in this sector needs to happen alongside with higher
connectivity to markets. Policies efforts to achieve those goals also need to recognize the factors
that constrain farmers with potential to develop commercially-oriented production that feeds into
value chains from those that constrain farmers focused on subsistence-oriented production with
limited potential to commercialize. Underlying these objectives is the need to deepen the
investments in the human, physical and institutional capital of the country. Finally, given the high
exposure of Mozambique to natural disasters, it is necessary to strengthen formal and informal risk
management systems to avoid that the living standards of the population are highly influenced by
major shocks out of their control.
     ANNEX 1 – Empirical design and data used for the analysis of long-term
                   effects of weather shocks (Chapter 6)

Assessing the effects of weather shocks in early life on long-term welfare requires extensive data.
As discussed above, weather information is obtained from the CRU-TS dataset, disaggregated at
the district-year level. In addition, three main sources of data provide information on adult
outcomes. The first one is the 2008-09 income and expenditure household survey (known as IOF,
for its acronym in Portuguese) collected by the National Institute of Statistics of Mozambique. The
IOF survey is representative at the province level and, in addition to providing detailed data on
expenditures (including self-consumption) and incomes, it also contains a wealth of information
on sociodemographic characteristics, education, health, children’s anthropometrics, labor market
indicators and housing conditions. The second source of data is the 2011 Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS), which provides a range of variables in the areas of population, health and nutrition.
Lastly, A 10 percent random sample of the 2007 population census serves as the third main source
of data, especially in regard to providing information on indicators of human capital.

The objective of this analysis is to empirically estimate the causal effect of exposure to rainfall
shocks in early childhood on long-term socioeconomic outcomes. The analysis exploits rainfall
variation across space and time. More specifically, it compares the outcomes of adults who were
in districts exposed to extreme rainfall anomalies around the time of birth (i.e. in utero or during
the first year of life) against outcomes of individuals in the same age cohort who resided in districts
not affected by weather shocks as well as against outcomes of individuals from slightly or older
younger cohorts in affected and unaffected districts. Reduced-form impacts of the shocks were
estimated through the following empirical relationship between the long-term outcome Y of
individual i in district d and at time t, and the shock indicators:
                         2

               = ∑(s,u ∗ Shock s , in uteroidt + s,l ∗ Shock s ∗ 1st year of lifeidt )
                       =1
                                  + District FE + Cohort FE+  ′ + 

Where the parameters of interest are s,u and s,y , which measures the effects of either extreme
droughts (s=1) or extreme floods (s=2) on the outcomes of interest, whether they affected the child
while in utero (indicated by subindex u) or during the first year of life (indicated by subindex l).
The model also includes controls for district and cohort fixed effects, as well as gender and other
individual-level covariates (e.g. school attainment), which are captured in the term  .27 Finally,
the term  stands for a zero-mean error term. Standard errors are clustered at the same level of
the treatment, namely by district of birth-year. The results of all the empirical models are presented
both for the whole sample of adults in the surveys of the census, irrespective of the area of birth
(urban or rural), and also solely for individuals born in rural districts.




27The empirical models were also run without controlling for the school attainment of the individual since this indicators is
endogenous to the weather shocks.

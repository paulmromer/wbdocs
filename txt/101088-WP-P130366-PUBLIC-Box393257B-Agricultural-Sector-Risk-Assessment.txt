Foreword

Risks in agricultural systems are inherent, ubiquitous, and varied. Agriculture is
an exceptionally risky economic sector, and particularly in settings like Mongolia
which are subject to extreme weather and variability from one year to the next.
Here, production is often characterized a perpetual cycle of shock and recovery
that deters agricultural investment and innovation, and severely inhibits the
development of the sector over time. Vulnerability to risk can also reinforce
poverty traps and undermine what otherwise might be pathways out of poverty.
In addition to production related shocks such as weather, pests, and disease,
fluctuations in the prices of commodities and inputs represent another
important source of risk for public sector finance as well as producers’ income.
The prevalence and complexity of risks facing agriculture systems in developing
countries makes reducing risk and vulnerability a core pillar of the World Bank
Group Agriculture Action Plan for 2013-2015.

The magnitude of risks facing Mongolian agriculture has made the sector’s
development extraordinarily volatile over the last 25 years as it underwent de-
collectivization. Livestock in particular has seen rapid and largely unsustainable
rates of growth in terms of numbers of animals and herders, and in so doing has
become acutely vulnerable to the severe winter weather events known as dzuds.
Periodic droughts and other production risks have also affected the country’s
much smaller crop agriculture, much of which is geared for the production of
feeds. And price volatility poses serious systemic risks which affect large
proportions of the rural population.

This study was undertaken to assess the systemic risks facing Mongolian
agriculture and to identify gaps in current risk management practices within the
sector. It was carried out by the World Bank in collaboration with partners in the
Mongolian Government, primarily the Strategy Planning and Policy Department
of the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture.

Executive Summary
With its abundance of grazing land and harsh climate, Mongolia is most suited to
extensive livestock production – with herders practicing nomadic and semi-nomadic
pastoralism for hundreds of years. Livestock production currently accounts for
75 percent of Gross Agricultural Output (GAO) in current prices and employs 30 percent
of the economically active population. The limited area allocated to crop production is
dominated by dry land wheat production supplemented by other cereals, fodder crops,
potatoes, and vegetables.

The level and sources of Mongolia’s economic growth, and the contribution of
agriculture to this growth, have varied markedly over the last 30 years (Figure A). The
agricultural growth rate has exhibited pronounced volatility, dipping into negative
territory in 10 out of the past 30 years. Three distinct patterns of economic management
account for these differences: the centrally planned economy that lasted until 1989, a
period of transition and structural reform from 1990 to 2000, and the acceleration of
economic growth after 2000 in response to reform and the increasing influence of
mineral extraction. Many of the production risks that have emerged after de-
collectivization are results of the changing structure of the agriculture sector. Less state
intervention has meant less support to the sector, but also less regulation, which has led
to especially the livestock sector expanding rapidly in terms of herders and animals, but
also becoming more vulnerable to adverse shocks. An overview of these changes
provides useful insights into the sources and levels of agriculture sector risk, their
impact on overall growth, and the relative importance of short-term shocks versus
medium-term economic transformation.

Despite significant efforts by the Government of Mongolia to manage agricultural risks,
recent shocks, and in particular the 2009-2010 dzud, have inflicted large losses on
producers and other actors, and have revealed important gaps in existing mechanisms
for managing risk.


                                                                           vii
The shocks that affect the agriculture sector appear to have a moderate impact on the
overall economy. Agricultural growth in Mongolia varies much more than overall
economic growth. Although GDP growth rates fell in response to the major dzuds of
1999-2002 and 2010, no economic contraction took place. The structural reforms of the
early 1990s and the exogenous shocks of 2008-2009 had much larger impacts on the
national economy.

The risk analysis discussed in this document pointed to four major sources of risk:
dzuds, drought, generalized price shocks associated with exogenous adverse events
such as the Asian Financial Crisis, and the policy shocks associated with economic
transition during the early 1990s. Livestock, cashmere and mutton emerge as the
commodities most vulnerable to risk while wheat has the highest probability of
incurring risk.

Applying constant prices, dzuds emerge, as expected, as by far the most important shock
to physical output (Figure B). Not only do dzuds occur more frequently than other types
of adverse event, they also incur higher costs. Drought is a much less significant risk,
occurring with lower frequency than dzuds and predominantly affecting crop
production, which accounts for only one quarter of total GAO.1 The mobility of animals
and the capacity to move them in the event of a drought appears to limit its impact on
livestock production.

Mongolia has experienced three major macro-economic shocks over the last two
decades: i) the transition period between 1990 and 1995; ii) the Asian financial crisis of
1997; and iii) global financial crisis of 2008-09. The consequences of these macro-
economic shocks for Mongolian agriculture become evident when measuring the joint
impact of production and price shocks on real prices. While the types of policy shock

1It should be noted that droughts in Mongolia most often are associated with dzuds, and losses in
those years are in this report attributed to the dzuds. The droughts refered to here are those that
occurred independently of dzuds.

                                                                                   viii
associated with transition are unlikely to recur, the possibility of generalized price
shock such as the Asian financial crisis is a continuing risk.

The analysis confirms the need to focus on risk management in the livestock sector, not
only because the incidence of shocks to livestock production is relatively high but also
because it accounts for three quarters of the value of agricultural output and employs
about one quarter of the total workforce. The rural poverty rate is moreover
substantially higher at 35 percent that the urban poverty rate of 23 percent and more
effectively managing risks relating to livestock promises to both prevent poverty traps
and promote growth across the greater agriculture sector.

The current emphasis on measuring risk in terms of physical losses needs to be
broadened. While the physical losses due to dzuds are often high, and are always highly
visible, the less visible impact of macro-economic shocks can result in much higher
losses to sector output. Mongolia’s growing dependence on mineral exports and world
commodity markets makes it increasingly vulnerable to such exogenous shocks.
Because the main effects of drought are on crops, and the crop sub-sector is relatively
small in Mongolia, droughts tend to have limited impacts on the greater agriculture
sector as a whole. Nevertheless, given the country’s strategic objective of increasing
domestic grain production, incorporating the potential for droughts into its risk
management framework will be important.

A number of risk management measures (mitigation-transfer-coping), both public and
private, are already in place in Mongolia. Depending in large part on their knowledge,
capabilities, and resources, pastoralists prepare their herds and camps for approaching
winters and for the ever present possibility of a dzud. In 2006, the Government of
Mongolia launched public-private weather based index insurance for livestock owners
in collaboration with the World Bank, transferring production risks to insurance
companies and a reinsurer – the National Emergency Management Agency. The Agency
is responsible for helping herders to cope with extreme dzuds and provide fodder
support to livestock owners through its Emergency Reserve. Efforts are also underway
to introduce conservation agriculture and other soil and water conservation measures.

Despite the broad range of ongoing risk management activities, especially on the
production side, adverse shocks continue to have significant impacts on the Mongolian
agriculture sector. Dzuds, the largest source of production risk, continue to have larger
impacts now than in the past. Droughts and price volatility also continue to pose
systemic risks to producers and to the sector as a whole. The limitations of risk
management became apparent during the last dzud and the large scale livestock
mortality that resulted from it. These limitations were evident in approaches used both
by the public and private sector.

The current risk management landscape in Mongolia has a number of key characteristics
which quickly became evident during the analysis.
      A large number of initiatives currently underway across the mitigation-transfer-
       coping spectrum.
      A strong emphasis on disease management.
      Dzud management is more focused on coping, through NEMA, and transfer,
       through the livestock insurance program.
      Investment in mitigation measures is relatively limited despite their multiple
       benefits (risk management as well as productivity improvement).


                                           ix
       Sustainable land, pasture, and herd management warrants more attention and
        stronger policy shifts.



The risk assessment recommends the following mitigation measures to improve
resilience of the agriculture sector.
       Strengthening and scaling-up winter preparation practices, such as household
        production of hay and forage among herders.
       Increase awareness and knowledge of winter preparation activities through
        advisory services and information campaigns.
       Facilitate otors in the incidence of extreme weather events and educate new
        herders on how to use otor as a mean to mitigate risks.2
       Aimag and soums should set aside pasture land to be used only when a dzud has
        been declared.
       Strengthen the Livestock Early Warning System (LEWS) in gathering,
        monitoring, and disseminating early warning information such as weather
        forecasts and pasture quality indicators.
       Strengthen pasture tenure security.
       Strengthen herders’ network for information sharing and risk management.
       Emphasize appropriate land use, conservation agriculture, and drought tolerant
        varieties for crop risk management.
       Improve coordination among various agencies to increase effectiveness of
        emergency and post-emergency response.
       Explore mechanisms for rapid access to emergency finance, including contingent
        finance.
       Devise incentives to the crop sector to promote risk mitigating practices.
       The Government’s agricultural support program could be applied more
        strategically for risk management purposes.

The livestock sector’s long-term resilience should be strengthened with particular
emphasis on ensuring a sustainable balance between livestock numbers and pasture
availability and carrying capacity. This will become even more important in a changing
climate and as competition by households and industries over available water resources
increases. The size and sustainability of the livestock sector will be largely determined
by a number of factors that related directly to public policy, including legislation
concerning land access and use, agricultural policies, environmental regulation, and
sanitary and food safety standards, among others.




2 Otor means migration and refers to the practice of quickly moving livestock long distances to
better pastures, away from the herder’s regular pastures. It’s a traditional form of risk mitigation
for herders in Mongolia.

I.     Introduction

The changing structure of Mongolian agriculture has made the sector more vulnerable
to risk., The sector has undergone dramatic changes since the end of the collective
period. The post-transition environment has facilitated rapid growth over the past two
decades, especially for livestock output, which accounts for three quarters of Mongolia’s
agriculture. The decline in public services for risk mitigation together with a shift in
other forms of interventions has made the sector more vulnerable to adverse shocks.
This is especially evident when analyzing the impact of Mongolia’s most visible adverse
shock – the severe winter weather events known as dzuds. The livestock sector is
dominated by nomadic herders who rely heavily on available natural resources to cope
with Mongolia’s extreme weather conditions. The increase in animal numbers has meant
less available pasture area per animal and less opportunity to mitigate the effects of
hard winters and dzuds.

A more open economy and more reliance on export revenues from extractive industries
have also exposed the agriculture sector to external macro-economic shocks and
international price volatility. The country’s mostly traditional livestock sector is
becoming more market-oriented, and increasingly exposed to these external risks.

Despite significant efforts by the Government of Mongolia to maintain response capacity
in the event of an emergency, recent shocks to the sector and in particular the 2009-
2010 dzud, resulted in large losses to producers and other actors in the sector, and
revealed important gaps in existing risk management mechanisms. The objective of this
report is therefore to identify, analyze, quantify, and prioritize risks to the agriculture
sector, as well as to identify areas of risk management that need further scaling up and
strengthening.

A good deal of work has been conducted on agricultural risks in Mongolia. Most of this
has focused on livestock, and especially in connection to dzuds. This sector-wide
assessment analyzes agricultural risks more comprehensively, covering both livestock
and crops at production, market, and enabling environment levels. It ranks and
prioritizes these risks based on their importance to agricultural performance and their
impacts on stakeholders. It also provides an overview of current risk management
mechanisms and suggests ways to strengthen them, based on local needs and on
experiences from other countries.

The team conducted quantitative and qualitative assessments of agricultural risks based
on information provided by the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, NEMA, other
stakeholders, secondary information, and field interviews. A methodology designed by
the World Bank has been applied to analyze the scope of the losses due to adverse
shocks. Analysis of the sources, frequency and severity of agricultural risk relies on
extended time series data, preferably for between 20 and 30 years. Relevant data were
drawn from the FAOSTAT website, the National Statistical Office of Mongolia, and from
World Bank Development Indicators. A field mission was undertaken in October and
November of 2013 to consult with stakeholders, including herders, farmers,
Government agencies, private sector investors, and donors.

The report was requested by the World Bank Country Management Unit (CMU) and the
Government of Mongolia and is a self-standing part of an analytical series on Mongolia’s

and a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) supported by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Swiss Secretariat of Economic Affairs (SECO).

II.    Agriculture in Mongolia - An Overview
With 1.55 million km2 of land and 3 million people, Mongolia is one of the largest and
least densely populated countries in the world. Its land-locked location, sprawling
geography, and extreme climatic conditions further add to its unique characteristics –
and to its vulnerability to risk. Steppe accounts for nearly 80 percent of the total land
area and approximately 85 percent of the country is more than 1,000 meters above sea
level. Some 70 percent (113 million ha) of the total land area is natural grazing land.
Only 612,000 ha (0.5 percent) is classified as arable land, of which 480,000 ha is
currently cultivated. The irrigated area is even smaller, at approximately 35,000 ha.

With its abundance of grazing land and
harsh climate, Mongolia is most suited
to extensive livestock production –
with herders practicing nomadic and
semi-nomadic       pastoralism      for
hundreds of years. Currently, livestock
production accounts for 75 percent of
Gross Agricultural Output (GAO) in
current prices and employs 30 percent
of the economically active population.
The limited area allocated to crop
production is dominated by dry land
wheat production; supplemented by With its abundance of grazing land and harsh
other cereals, fodder crops, potatoes climate, Mongolia is most suited to extensive
and other vegetables.                   livestock production.



2.1    Agro-Climatic Conditions

A dry, continental climate predominates with major seasonal differences in
temperature. Summer temperatures range from 15°C in the mountains to 45°C in the
southern desert regions. Winter temperatures average -15°C in the coldest months and
can fall as low as -40°C. Average annual rainfall is 230 mm but varies across agro-
climatic zones, from 50 mm/year in the southern Gobi desert to 500 mm in the
mountain areas in the north. The growing season ranges from 70-120 days, with most
growth in the spring. This cold, dry climate results in high risks for both livestock and
crop production, in both winter and summer.

There are six agro-ecological zones in Mongolia. With the exception of Alpine Tundra,
each of them are important for livestock and crop production. Table 1 shows their
relative importance in terms of land area, grazing area and livestock production. Most
crop production occurs in the grassland steppe region of northern, central Mongolia.

The five main agro-ecological zones differ in terms of their livestock and pasture
management systems, their sources and levels of risk, and the approaches to risk
management that are employed by producers and other stakeholders. The Mountain and
Forest Steppe zone has the highest concentration of livestock because it offers year
round grazing, with a limited need for seasonal movement of livestock, adequate water,
and shelter from winter storms. Inter-annual movement of livestock to other regions
only occurs in very bad years. Seasonal livestock movements occur over much longer
distances in the Mountain Taiga and Grassland Steppe regions, and inter-annual
movements occur more often. Severe winters are a major risk in the mountain taiga

                                            3
zones, while summer drought and limited access to grazing and water are more frequent
problems in the grassland steppe zone. More variable climatic conditions in the desert
steppe and desert zones oblige herders to move their livestock more frequently and
over much wider areas. Pasture production patterns are less regular and there is greater
reliance on inter-annual movement of livestock in response to adverse climatic
conditions in both winter and summer.

The impact of climate change is also apparent (SDC 2010). Average annual temperatures
have increased by approximately 2°C during the last 60 years, increasing water losses
from evapotranspiration. Precipitation patterns have also changed with an 8.7-12.5
percent fall in the central grassland steppe and desert regions and a 3.5-9.3 percent
increase in the eastern and western regions. The impact of these changes is most severe
in the central and desert regions, due to the combined impact of higher temperatures
and lower rainfall. Elsewhere, precipitation has increased or stayed the same.


2.2     National and Agriculture Sector Growth

The level and sources of Mongolia’s economic growth, and the contribution of
agriculture to this growth, have varied markedly over the last 30 years. Three distinct
patterns of economic management account for these differences: the centrally planned
economy that lasted until 1989, a period of transition and structural reform from 1990-
2000, and the acceleration of economic growth after 2000 in response to reform and the
increasing influence of mineral extraction (Figure 1). An overview of these changes
provides useful insight into the sources and levels of agriculture sector risk, their impact
on overall impact growth, and the relative importance of short-term shocks versus
medium-term economic transformation.

The final 10 years of central planning, from 1980 to 1989, was a period of moderate
economic growth, punctuated by the impact of adverse climatic conditions on crop and
livestock production in 1983-84, and a dzud in 1987-88 (See Box 1). Agriculture
accounted for 30-35 percent of total GDP in the mid 1980’s, so agricultural shocks had a
marked impact on overall economic growth – particularly the dzud in 1987-88.

Economic output fell sharply after the end of central planning in 1989 and the initiation
of structural reform towards a market economy. Crop production collapsed quickly in
the absence of public support for state-owned grain farms and livestock numbers also
fell slightly initially. Livestock numbers then grew quickly after 1993, as herders
responded to the removal of restrictions on livestock ownership and to open access to
grazing land. Low growth characterized the period from 1995-1999, due to the impact
of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997, the Russian Ruble crisis in 1998 and falling mineral
prices, but structural reform continued. A succession of dzuds from 1999-2001 then
resulted in a contraction of agricultural output, which remained important enough part
of the economy to slow overall recovery.
Box 1. The Mongolian Dzud
Dzud is a Mongolian word for the impact of adverse climatic conditions on livestock numbers and
livestock production. It typically occurs when a summer drought is followed by a harsh winter.
Summer drought reduces the availability of grazing, weakening livestock and reducing their
ability to build up the fat reserves needed to carry them through the winter. Harsh winter
conditions result from blizzards, heavy and/ or long-lasting snow, extreme cold or ice-bound
pasture – all of which limit the ability of animals to graze during the winter and cause death from
extreme cold. As these conditions combine in different ways, herders denote the following types
of dzud:
White Dzud. Caused mainly by heavy snowfall, leading to snow depths of more than 20 cm in the
mountain areas and 10 cm in semi-desert areas.
Black Dzud. Caused by lack of water during summer, followed by lack of snow during winter.
Iron Dzud. Occurs when pasture is covered by a sheet of ice, which inhibits livestock movement
and prevents them from uncovering grass under the snow.
The Mongolian Meteorological Service defines Dzud as a snow cover of more than 25 cms, a
sudden prolonged snow storm, 2-3 cm of frozen snow cover, or prolonged extreme cold. Dzuds
are also defined by their geographic coverage (a single valley or a whole ecological or
administrative zone) and by their duration (severe Dzuds exceed 20 days). However, attempts
have been made to isolate a limited set of climatic parameters that correlate with livestock losses
but no strong relationship has been found, which makes mitigating for the impacts of dzuds more
challenging.

 sharply in 2010 following a particularly severe dzud. But rapid recovery followed both
 shocks. Agriculture sector growth has been much lower than economy-wide growth,
 nevertheless, with a consequent decline in agriculture’s share of GDP from 35 percent in
 1981 to 15 percent in 2012 measured in constant 2005 US dollars.

 Agriculture sector shocks appear to have a moderate impact on the overall economy,
 even though the variability of agriculture sector growth is much higher than that for
 overall economic growth. GDP growth rates fell in response to the major dzuds of 1999-
 2002 and 2010, but there was no economic contraction. Structural reform during the
 early 1990s and exogenous shocks in 1997-1998 and 2008-2009 had much greater
 impacts on the national economy.


 2.3     Aggregate Livestock and Crop Production

 Analysis of GAO (in constant prices) shows the respective contributions of livestock and
 crop production to both overall GAO and the variability of GAO (Figure 2). Note that
 trends in livestock GAO represent changes in the value of livestock output. Changes in
 livestock numbers are captured, nevertheless, as GAO is measured as the number of
 livestock multiplied by the average output per animal. Livestock production is the major
 source of GAO, ranging from 86 percent in 1980 to 63 percent in 2011 in constant prices
 (FAOSTAT). Crop production exhibits much higher overall variability, with volatility3 of
 20.46 versus 10.81 for livestock production. The sources and levels of risk for each
 subsector have changed markedly over time, as discussed below.




 3Volatility is measured as the standard deviation of the percent annual change in livestock and
 crop production (World Bank Development Report, 2013).

The impact of Mongolia’s three different periods of economic management is also
apparent in Figure 2. The state retained wide-ranging control of livestock production
through collectively owned negels during the final decade of planning from 1980 to
1990. Most livestock was state-owned and access to grazing was closely controlled in
order to balance livestock numbers with the availability of feed resources. Winter forage
production was also emphasized to protect against dzuds. These measures helped to
minimize livestock losses during adverse climatic events, as shown by the modest
impact of the 1987 dzud on livestock GAO. In contrast, crop production became a major
source of agriculture sector risk during this period, as the socialist government sought
to raise cereal production on state owned grain farms. Despite the limited suitability of
Mongolia’s land and climate for cropping, cereal cultivation was increased from 557,500
ha in 1980 to 673,400 ha in 1989 through expansion onto grazing land. Crop yields
became more variable as a result, and crop production more risky.

Crop production collapsed during the period of transition and structural reform from
1990-2000. By 2000 cereal cultivation had fallen by 71 percent to 195,000 ha and cereal
yields had fallen from 1.21 t/ha (average for 1987-89) to 0.67 t/ha (average for 1997-
99). The cultivation of forage crops also fell, from 118,000 ha in 1990 to less than 1,000
ha in 2000 (NSO). Livestock output fell from 1990 to 1994, and then increased steadily
as herders responded to the end of government controls on livestock ownership and
access to grazing. The combination of increased livestock numbers and minimal forage
production left herders highly exposed to the succession of dzuds that occurred from
2000 to 2002.

The post-reform period since 2000 has been characterized by the growth of both crop
and livestock production. But crop production has become much less variable and
livestock production more variable – in marked contrast to the pre-reform period.
Cereal cultivation had increased to approximately 300,000 ha by 2012, with an average
yield of 1.5 t/ha (2009-12), in response to subsidies and the adoption of modern
systems of conservation agriculture. The combination of continued growth in livestock
numbers, overgrazing, and inadequate forage production has further increased the

vulnerability of livestock production to adverse climatic events – as witnessed by the
huge livestock losses following the dzud of 2009-2010.

This overview of recent political and economic history highlights the extent to which
agricultural policy can influence the vulnerability to risk. Pre-reform policies helped to
reduce the risks of livestock production, while significantly increasing the risks
associated with crop production. Post-reform policies have had the opposite effect,
reducing the risk of crop production and raising the risks of livestock production.
Discussion in the next two chapters provides further insight into the reasons for these
changes.

III     Trends and Characteristics of Livestock Production
In a pastoralist management
system, sustainable livestock
production       depends        on
maintaining a balance between
livestock numbers and available
pasture                 resources,
supplemented where feasible
with forage production. In
principle, herders achieve this
balance by moving their
livestock according to grazing
availability at different times
and in different areas, relative to
the requirements of their Sustainable livestock production depends on maintaining a
livestock. In practice, public balance between livestock numbers and available pasture
ownership of grazing land resources
makes this system increasingly
difficult to sustain when livestock numbers and grazing pressure increase. This chapter
examines trends in livestock numbers and the corresponding availability of communal
grazing and forage production since the 1980s, and considers the impact of these trends
on vulnerability to risk, and the losses incurred from adverse events.

The relative stability of livestock production during the era of central planning is
illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the evolution of livestock numbers since 1961. Herd
composition was also relatively stable during this period, with sheep as the major
source of livelihoods. Reform resulted in a rapid (122 percent) increase in goat numbers
from 1990 to 2000 in response to the high demand for cashmere and the higher
fecundity and shorter breeding season for goats. Cattle and horse numbers increased by
approximately 40 percent from 1990 to 2000, while sheep numbers stayed more or less
constant and camel numbers declined. Hence, in addition to increasing grazing pressure,
the doubling of goat numbers also dramatically changed herd composition.

Livestock numbers fell sharply in response to the successive dzuds of 2000-2002, with
high losses across all livestock groups. Both goat and sheep numbers then recovered
rapidly from 2002 to 2009, reaching even higher levels than before, while cattle and
horse numbers recovered partially and camel numbers continued their long-term
decline. These changes further altered herd composition, with sheep and goats now in
equal numbers. Both goat and sheep numbers fell sharply again during the dzud of 2010,
together with a fall in horse and cattle numbers. However the 2010 dzud did not result
in any further changes to herd composition.
Reform has thus contributed to a major increase in the year-to-year variability of
livestock numbers, with a particularly sharp increase since 2000, as shown by a
comparison of the observed volatility for each of the three decades since 1980 (Table 2).
The underlying reasons for this increase in volatility, and its implications for the risks of
livestock production are the focus of the remainder of this chapter.

The overall impact of these changes in livestock numbers can be discerned by
converting livestock numbers to Livestock Units (LSU), which reflect the requirements
of different animals for feed.4 Figure 4 confirms the extent to which the overall increase
in livestock numbers has been driven by the increase in goat numbers. It also shows that
goats, sheep, cattle, and horses now compete equally for grazing, in contrast to 1980
when the demand for grazing for goats was relatively low. The increase in goat numbers
has been most pronounced in the Khangai region, which accounts for most of the
mountain and forest steppe zone, where grazing pressure is highest (Table 1).

The impact of these changes on grazing pressure, and its implications for risk, is shown
in Figure 5. Stocking rates were fairly constant during the 1980s, at approximately
400 LSU/1000 ha of pastureland. They then increased to 570 LSU/1000 ha in 2000 in
response to rising livestock numbers. The losses caused by the sequence of dzuds from
2000-2002 then reduced stocking rates to their pre-reform level. Stocking rates
returned to even higher levels in 2009 in response to the recovery of livestock numbers,
and a reduction in grazing land due to its transfer to settlements, mining, roads and
protected areas. Stock losses during the 2010 dzud reduced stocking rates slightly but
they have since recovered to 600 LSU/1000 ha – a 41 percent increase from 1980.

Parallel trends in hay and forage production have reduced the availability of winter feed,
further exposing livestock production to the risk of dzuds (Figure 6). Hay production,
which accounts for approximately 85 percent of conserved feed, rose from 1.1 kg/LSU to
1.37 kg/LSU during the 1980’s in response to strong government support. It then
plummeted to 0.01 kg/LSU in 1999 in the absence of both public and private efforts to

                                                                  12
maintain pre-reform production levels. A slight recovery has occurred since the 2010
dzud, but overall hay production remains low at 0.12 kg/LSU. Forage production,
measured as the forage area cultivated, follows an identical trend, and for the same
reasons. Note also that both hay and forage production/LSU are low in absolute terms.
Even in the pre-reform period total reserves amounted to approximately 15-20 days of
conserved feed/LSU/year. Any reduction from this low level leaves herders highly
vulnerable to the loss of grazing from a dzud. Local government authorities are now
encouraging herders to increase hay production and improving the storage and
management of public hay reserves, but the overall level of reserves – public or private –
remains inadequate.

The liberalization of livestock production in combination with a reduction in
Government sector employment after reform encouraged many new herders to enter
the sector. In the decade following de-collectivization, the number of herdsmen rose by
70 percent, from 247,450 in 1991 to 421,400 in 2000. Most of these new herdsmen
lacked the experience to manage livestock successfully in harsh conditions. They
incurred heavy losses during the dzuds of 2000-2002 and a high proportion left herding
as a result. The number of herdsmen has continued to fall since – to 289,400 in 2012.
The entrance of new herders in the sector and their apparent exposure to dzuds and
other risks highlight the need for strong programs for herder education, particularly
through traditional “apprentice? systems. By working for experienced herdsmen for 3-4
years, new herders acquire an understanding of seasonal pasture production patterns,
the suitability of different pasture types to different livestock, access to water, livestock
husbandry, feed conservation and strategies for risk management.

Climate change has added a further dimension to the risks of livestock production, over
and above the impact of policy change, overgrazing and herder dynamics (SDC, 2010).
Increased temperatures have been accompanied by higher precipitation in the western
and eastern regions and lower precipitation in the central and desert regions. The
frequency and severity of winter and summer drought has increased as a consequence,
as observed by the succession of dzuds since 2000.

The relative impact of human-induced versus climate change factors on the frequency
and severity of production shocks is difficult to gauge. Figure 7, which depicts the
incidence and impact of the worst dzuds since 1945, shows clearly that there has been a
marked increase in the frequency and impact of dzuds since 1999. It also shows that the
increased impact of dzuds coincides with the post-reform increase in livestock numbers
and grazing pressure. This suggests that while the increased frequency of dzuds is
attributable to climate change, the increased impact of these dzuds is also attributable to
to human factors.

IV      Trends and Characteristics of Crop Production
Crop production currently
accounts for approximately
one quarter of GAO (in
current prices), despite the
limited       suitability      of
Mongolia’s land and climate
for cropping. Wheat is the
most important crop with 86
percent of the total area
cropped.        All       cereals
combined account for around
90 percent of the total area
cropped (Figure 8). Potatoes
are the next most important
crop with 5 percent of the In Mongolia, crop production currently accounts for
total area, followed by fodder approximately one quarter of Gross Agricultural Output (in
                                  current prices).
crops (4 percent) and
vegetables with 1-2 percent.
Crop production risks are inherently high owing to Mongolia’s low rainfall and reliance
on dry land production systems. These risks are further increased by the narrow
production base, the limited resultant capacity to diversify this risk, and the
concentration of crop production in northern central Mongolia. Crop production risk is
thus both high and highly covariate.

The Government sought to increase cereal production during the 1980s by assisting the
large state-owned cropping farms to expand wheat production onto grazing land. Much
of this land was unsuitable for cropping, however, and it became barren and useless for
either crop or pasture production. Crop production then plummeted after
independence, from 797,300 ha in 1990 to 146,700 ha in 2004, due to the collapse of the
state-owned crop farms.

Wheat production began to recover in 2007 as private, corporate farms took over the
state-owned grain farms (Figure 9). Largely as a result of Government subsidies, these
new farms have invested heavily in large-scale cultivation and harvesting machinery
and have introduced the management practices required for modern conservation
agriculture. Wheat is now harvested every second year to allow adequate moisture to be
replenished in the soil, as practiced in the extensive, dry land cropping regions of North
America and parts of Kazakhstan. Production has quadrupled since 2007, with a
doubling of the area planted and higher and more stable yields. The Government is now
encouraging further expansion of cereal production, hopefully in a more sustainable
manner than during the pre-reform period.

The area allocated to fodder crop production is only 10 percent of what it was in 1980
(Figure 10). Production increased sharply after the 2010 dzud in response to increased
area and higher yields, but it remains a minor component of overall crop production
despite its importance for livestock production. Supply is constrained by the limited
amount of land suitable for crop production. Fodder demand is growing in response to
increased livestock numbers and the increased risk of dzuds, but herders prefer to
increase hay production rather than grow or buy fodder. Most of the current demand for
fodder comes from intensive livestock farmers that produce milk and meat for urban
markets, but this represents a small component of total livestock production. In
addition, NEMA contracts fodder production for emergency reserves and for
distribution during harsh weather conditions, and little effort is being made to
encourage private production and distribution chains.

Potatoes are grown in most parts of Mongolia for household consumption. Commercial
production is strongest in the Central region, which accounts for 60 percent of the total
area and 70 percent of total output. Production fell after independence, as with other
crops, due to a fall in yields and area (Figure 11). A strong recovery began in 2003, with
a threefold increase in production by 2012, driven by increases in both yield and area.
Yields also appear to have become more stable. Most of this increase in production has
occurred in the Central Region and in response to growing demand on urban markets.

The risks fall under three categories: production risk, price risk and a general set of risks
associated with the enabling environment for agriculture.

Box X. Defining Agricultural Risk

In this report, risk is defined as exposure to a significant financial loss or other adverse outcome
the occurrence and severity of which is unpredictable. It thus implies exposure to substantive
losses, over and above the normal costs of doing business. Agriculture is inherently variable as
producers incur moderate losses every year due to sub-optimal climatic conditions at different
times in the production cycle and/or modest departures from expected prices. For the purposes
of this report, risk refers to the more severe and unpredictable adverse events that occur beyond
these smaller events, measured as the inter-annual variation of the value of output.


Figure 12 depicts the impact of these risks on aggregate agricultural output. It is based
on analysis of trends and inter-annual variation of GAO, juxtaposed with information on
the occurrence of different shocks for the period 1980-2012. GAO is measured in both
constant prices, to show how these shocks impact production alone, and in real prices to
show the combined impact of these shocks on prices and production. The analysis of
GAO in real prices is for the period 1991 onwards because inflation data were not
reported prior to 1991.

A number of salient factors are apparent in this graphic. Note first that while livestock
related shocks are the most widely observed source of variability in GAO, not all shocks
are the result of dzuds. Drought also has an impact and price and policy shocks were

                                                               18
severe during the period of transition. It is also apparent that many of the officially
reported “shocks? to output actually have a modest influence on GAO. Only six of the
sixteen downside variations depicted above lead to a fall in GAO greater than 10 percent,
and only two lead to falls of more than 20 percent. Comparison of change measured in
constant versus real prices also shows that the worst shocks are the result of adverse
changes in both production and prices – as evidenced by the fall in real GAO in 1997.
Finally, it is pertinent to note the relatively low impact of the “shocks? to GAO during the
central planning period prior to 1990. The benefits of economic reform do not yet
appear to have extended to agricultural risk management.


5.1    Livestock Risks

Although dzuds are the most important source of livestock production risk, they are not
the only risk. Blizzards and drought are further risks together with livestock disease,
fires, sandstorms, and price volatility. The impact of the main livestock risks on livestock
GAO is depicted in Figure 13, for the period 1980-2012, using the same methodology as
above. Dzuds and droughts are
the main risks. As for total GAO,
a high proportion of the
observed “shocks? to the
livestock sub-sector have a
moderate impact. Of the fifteen
observed downside changes to
livestock GAO, eight result in a
drop of less than 10 percent and
only four result in an inter-
annual decline of more than
20 percent. The impact of the
worst shocks is also most severe Dzuds, blizzards, drought, disease, fires, sandstorms, and
when measured in real terms, price volatility all pose risks to livestock production.
suggesting that both production
and prices are affected.

5.1.1 Dzuds, Blizzards and Frosts

Twelve dzuds have occurred since 1944, as reported by the National Programme on
Protection for Livestock from Droughts and Dzuds (Table 3). Livestock losses varied
from 0.6 million head in 1996-97 to 9.7 million head in 2009-2010. Measured as a
proportion of total animals, the 1944-45 dzud was the most severe with losses
equivalent to 33.2 percent of the national herd, followed by the 2009-10 dzud with
losses of 22 percent. The impact on particular livestock species appears to vary
according to the type of dzud and the region it affects, with sheep and goat losses
highest in the 2009-2010 dzud and cattle and horse losses highest during the succession
of dzuds from 1999-2002. Many of the reported dzuds had a minimal impact on overall
livestock output, as noted above, although their impact was devastating for affected
herders and communities.

Available data suggest that blizzards have a much lower impact on livestock production
than dzuds (Table 4). The blizzards of 1980 and 1992 are the only ones that appear to
have had a significant impact on livestock numbers and GAO, with relatively low losses
in the others. Severe frosts in 2003 also resulted in heavy livestock losses. Blizzards and
dzuds are difficult to distinguish, however, and a blizzard can be one of the causes of a
dzud. Frosts can also be associated with dzuds.

5.1.2 Droughts and Feed Shortages

Although most droughts are associated with dzuds, droughts occurred independently of
dzuds in 1980, 2003, 2005 and 2006 (Table 5). There are no official data on the impact
of the droughts in 2003, 2005 and 2006 although corresponding trends in livestock
numbers and livestock GAO suggest that the impact was minimal. The impact of the
droughts in 2000, 2001 and 2009 is attributed to the dzuds during these years.

5.1.3 Livestock Disease

During “normal? years, total livestock losses are very low. Official records for the period
2000-2012 show that total livestock losses averaged 2.4 percent during the years from
2003-2009 and 2011-2012 (Figure 14). As livestock disease is the major source of loss
during these (non-shock) years, this suggests that the underlying risks from livestock

                                            21
disease are very low. Good animal husbandry and an effective system of public and
private veterinarians explain much of this low risk.

The major disease risk appears to come from foot and mouth disease, for both domestic
and wild, cloven-hoofed animals. Foot and mouth outbreaks infected 45,000 domestic
animals in 2001 and 20,500 domestic animals in 2010. Both outbreaks occurred in the
eastern border aimags of Dornod and Sukhbataar, suggesting that infection came from
across the border. A further outbreak infected 1.5 million gazelles in 2011, showing that
wild animals are also at risk (and a source of infection). The relatively low number of
domestic animals infected in the first two outbreaks suggests that the risk of foot and
mouth is low at the national level, although it may be much higher at regional (aimag)
level.

The latent risk to such a large livestock sub-sector is high nevertheless, first because it is
difficult to prevent cross-border transmission in a country with long, sparsely populated
border regions and highly mobile livestock populations; and second because
transmission via wild animal populations is even more difficult to control. Border
closures after the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 have also made live animal exports
to Russia and China virtually impossible, depriving the sector of a proven source of
revenue. Export earnings fell from US$ 1.2 - US$3.5 million prior to 2001, to less than
$50,000 by 2004, with no sign of recovery as of 2012.


5.1.4 Fire

Wild fires occur annually in the mountain forest and steppe zones, mostly during the
spring months from March to June, with an average of 50-60 forest fires and 80-100
steppe fires each year. Approximately two-thirds of these fires occur in the northern
aimags of Bulgan, Selenge and Khovsol where livestock production is less important
(IFFN, 2002). From 1981 to 1999, these fires destroyed an average of 2.64 million ha of
grazing land/year (IFFN, op cit), equivalent to approximately 2 percent of total pasture


                                             22
land. Approximately 95 percent are caused by human activity, but the frequency and
severity of wildfires increases markedly in dry years.

Figure 15 shows that the worst recent fires occurred in 1996 and 1997, following a
period of very dry winter and spring months. These fires resulted in the deaths of 29
people, the destruction of 218 houses and the loss of 11,700 animals. Approximately
7.83 million ha of pastures and wooded grazing land was destroyed in 1996 and 9.73
million ha in 1997 – equivalent to 7 percent of total grazing land.


5.1.5 Rodents

Available research suggests that rodents infest some 40 million ha of pasture, of which
19 million hectares is heavily infested (Nolte, 1996). Of the more than 60 species of
rodent in Mongolia, Brandt Voles are regarded as the greatest threat. In heavily infested
areas they consume up to 80 percent of vegetation during the spring growing season.
Their burrowing also damages pasture roots, slowing pasture recovery and changing
pasture composition. Eradication programs covered approximately two million hectares
a year prior to 1990. This fell to approximately 100,000 ha a year during transition but
rose to 620,000 ha in 2013 (NEMA).

As grazing pressure increases, the risks posed by fires and rodents are likely to become
more acute, principally through their impact on pasture availability. Future risk
management strategies will therefore need to assign higher priority to mitigating these
two hazards.


5.1.6 Other Risks

Livestock production is subject to a range of other hazards, including dust storms,
floods, predation, and theft. None of these hazards has a major impact at the aggregate
level, as suggested by the level of livestock losses reported in Figure 14 for “normal?
years and the hazard specific data in Table 6.

Dust storms occur in the spring, particularly in the southern desert regions. Livestock
losses from the worst of these storms have ranged from 29,800 animals in 2002 to
322,844 in 2009. Heavy spring rains can lead to flooding, although available data shows
that livestock losses are low – ranging from 1,700-15,000. There are no data on the
impact of predation by wolves, leopards, bears, foxes and birds of prey; or from animal
theft, although their impact is unlikely to be significant.


5.2      Crop Production Risks

Most of the observed shocks to crop production are the result of adverse climatic
conditions, policy shocks associated with transition and price volatility. Figure 16 below
shows downside variation in half of the years from 1980 to 2012, with GAO falling by
more than 10 percent in 11 of 33 years. Policy shocks during the transition period from
1990 to 2000 accounted for half of these events. It is also noticeable that these transition
policy shocks had a larger impact on GAO than shocks associated with adverse climatic
events and price volatility. The risk of crop disease is low as a result of Mongolia’s
freezing winters.

Most of the transition policy shocks resulted from successive reductions in the area
cultivated due to the loss of government support for state owned crop farms. Yields also
fell owing to lack of fertilizer and seed. With the main components of the economic
transition now being completed this source of policy risk is now unlikely to recur. The
adoption of modern conservation agriculture should also reduce production risks, as
indicated by the relatively low frequency and severity of observed production shocks
since 2000.

While the timing and magnitude of crop production shocks are evident from time-series
data, there is less clarity on why these shocks occur. Available information refers to
“crop failure? and “drought,? rather than specifying whether yields fell as a result of
moisture stress during crop maturation, or adverse weather conditions during harvest
which can reduce both yield and area. Sharp production declines are also observed
during dzud years, presumably in response to the summer droughts that precede harsh
winter conditions. Short-term crop production shocks are thus attributed to “drought?
for purposes of analysis, where they result from yield shocks. Sharp area variations
typically occur in response to policy (e.g. transition) or market risks. Analysis focuses on
wheat and potatoes, which account for 75-80 percent of total crop GAO.


5.2.1 Wheat Production Shocks

For the period 1980-2012, wheat production was subject to severe shocks (more than
25 percent fall in production) in 1984 and 2005 (Figure 17). In each case, the fall in
production was due to a sharp yield decline resulting from drought. The lesser
production shocks in 1996 and 1998 are also attributed to drought, and the shocks in
1987 and 2000 to the drought related impact of dzuds. Further sharp declines in
production in 1992, 1994 and 1995 are attributed to the longer-term impact of
transition and structural reform.

5.2.2 Potato Production Shocks

Climate related shocks to potato production are less numerous and less severe than for
wheat. Both the incidence and severity of these shocks have also fallen dramatically
since the onset of economic recovery in 2000 (Figure 18). The largest, climate related
production shock occurred in 1988 in association with the 1987/88 dzud. Two smaller
dzud related production shocks occurred in 1993 and 2002. Further production shocks
in 1990, 1991 and 1992 are attributed to the longer-term impact of transition and
structural reform.

5.3                     Price Risks

The analysis of price risk focuses on producer prices for live animals and the six main
agricultural commodities: beef, mutton, cow milk, wheat, potatoes and cashmere –
which together account for 75-80 percent of GAO. General trends in producer prices are
evident in Figure 19 below. The most severe, generalized price shock occurred in 1997
in response to the Asian financial crisis that resulted in economic contraction regionally
depressing prices of major commodities, including agricultural commodities. A
generalized producer price “correction? also occurred in the aftermath of the global food
price crisis in 2009.

Analysis draws on annual producer prices for the period 1993-2011 except for meat and
cashmere where price data were limited to the period 2003-2012. Real prices
(2005=100) were used to remove the influence of high inflation during the period of
analysis, by deflating nominal prices by the consumer price index (CPI).


5.3.1 Live Animal Prices

Animal liveweight prices (in tugrik/ton) are used as a proxy for live animal prices.
Figure 20 below shows that these prices move in unison, although there is a gradual
widening of the difference between prices for different livestock over time. General
economic trends are the major cause of downside movements in live animal prices, with
the largest fall in price during 1996-1998, a period dominated by the Asian financial
crisis, falling mineral and cashmere prices and slower economic growth. Lesser price
falls occurred during the succession of dzuds from 1999-2002 and during the dzud of
2009-2010, as farmers offloaded their stock in response to feed shortages.

Sheep and goat prices fell the most from 1996-1998 (Figure 21). This may reflect the
lower return from goats in response to falling cashmere prices and falling demand for
mutton – which is generally the most expensive meat. Horse and cattle prices fell more
sharply during the 2009-2010 dzud, particularly the former, suggesting that they were
offloaded heavily.

5.3.2 Milk and Meat Prices

Real cow milk prices were relatively constant in real terms from 1993-2007, and then
increased rapidly in response to strong economic growth, increased domestic demand,
and stagnant production (Figure 22). In most cases, annual price variation corresponds
to a change in production, with increased production leading to a fall in prices – as
would be expected. This observation holds for the sharp fall in real milk prices observed
in 2006, and the lesser fall in milk prices in 1994 and 2011. The parallel fall in both
production and milk prices in 2000 may result from a slightly longer-term adjustment,
as it follows a year of peak production and higher prices in 1999. Milk prices also fell
sharply in 1997 due to the economic downturn induced by the Asian financial crisis.

The analysis of meat prices is less instructive because data are available for a much
shorter period (2003-2012). Real prices for both beef and sheep meat follow a general
upward trend during this period, as would be expected, in response to growing domestic
demand. A modest fall in real prices occurs in 2009 (Figure 23), which coincides with a
short-term economic contraction in Mongolia in response to the global financial crisis
and falling mineral and cashmere prices, but overall there is little observed price
instability.

5.3.3 Cashmere Prices

Cashmere prices reflect trends in global demand for luxury products. Real prices fell
sharply in 2008 and 2009 as a result of falling world demand in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis (Figure 24). They recovered fully by 2010, but have been
somewhat erratic since then due to the slow and uncertain recovery of the global
economy.

5.3.4 Wheat and Potato Prices

Real producer prices for wheat and potatoes follow very similar trends, with high
downside variability during the period of transition, stable prices from 2000-2007 and
then higher prices in 2008-2009 in response to the global food price crisis. Prices for
both commodities also fell in 1997 as a result of the Asian financial crisis. Wheat price
variability is higher than that for potatoes due to the higher inherent variability of wheat
production, although the increased importation of wheat and flour since 2000 has
helped reduce this variability (Figure 25).

The combination of stable but increasing potato production and increased access to
imports has resulted in very stable real prices for potatoes since 2000 (Figure 26). Even
the global food price crisis had only a moderate impact on potato prices.

The combination of more stable production and improved access to imports should help
to reduce the incidence of short-term shocks to producer prices for both wheat and
potatoes for the foreseeable future.


5.4    Enabling Environment Shocks

Further risks arise from changes in the broader political and economic environment in
which agriculture operates. These changes can be both internal and external. At the
macro level, Mongolia’s steady economic growth for the last twenty years has been
broken only by the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, which resulted in a 1.6 percent
contraction of GDP in 2009 (Figure 1). The sharp fall in world commodity prices caused
by the global financial crisis led to reduced export earnings, lower incomes, higher
interest rates (especially on forex loans) and reduced public and private investment. For
agriculture, it resulted in lower prices and reduced export earnings from cashmere,
lower domestic demand for crop and livestock products and a fall in GAO. The overall
economy recovered rapidly in 2010, despite the severe dzud of 2009-2010, due to IMF
support, a rebound in copper prices and increased copper and coal exports. Economy
wide growth also slowed during 1996-1998, and GAO fell, due to the combined impact of
the Asian financial crisis, falling international commodity prices, and the Russian ruble
crisis (Figure 2).

Internal policy changes pose a risk when they are made quickly and erratically, giving
farmers and business agents little time to adjust. Within the agriculture sector,
cashmere has been most subject to frequent policy change. An export ban was imposed
on raw cashmere from 1994-1996 to encourage domestic processing. To facilitate
membership into the WTO in 1997, the Government agreed to replace this ban with an
export tax bound at 30 percent on the condition that it was terminated after 10 years.
Government eventually imposed a flat tax of 4,000 MNT/kg on raw cashmere exports
and the WTO subsequently agreed to extend the deadline for termination of this tax to
2012. Further policy changes include a producer subsidy of 5,000 MNT/kg on raw
cashmere in 2008, to offset the impact of low world cashmere prices, together with
US$8.6 million of low interest loans to cashmere processors. This support was
terminated in 2009. Following termination of the export tax on raw cashmere in 2012,
the Government decreed that all raw cashmere must now be sold through a newly
formed Commodity Exchange established for agricultural commodities.

A review of trends in cashmere production and trade suggest that these policy changes
have not resulted in any undue instability. Figure 27 below shows that most major shifts
in the production and export of cashmere have been the result of underlying changes in
supply and demand, rather than the policy changes outlined above. Official production
figures for 1998-2011 show that production declined slightly from 2000-2003 as a
result of livestock losses during the succession of dzuds from 1999-2002. It then
increased as goat numbers grew again. Production then fell again following the dzud of
2009-2010.

The volume and value of exports increased rapidly during the early 1990s in response to
liberalization of the livestock sector and high world prices for cashmere. The export ban
appears to have inhibited export growth from 1994-1995 and to have contributed to a
fall in exports in 1996 – a period of very high prices. However, subsequent analysis has
shown that much of this decline in official exports was the result of smuggling (World
Bank 2003). Lower exports from 1997-2004 reflect the collapse of world markets in
1996-97 due to the Asian financial crisis and the lower output from 2000-2003
following the 1999-2002 dzuds. Exports recovered after 2004, despite the export tax,
due to increasing production and the recovery of world demand for cashmere.
Smuggling and tax evasion have continued, however, and domestic processors continue
to operate at less than half of their capacity – suggesting that export restrictions have
had a limited impact on these two issues.

A potential threat to domestic export and indeed the sector as a hole is that of Dutch
Disease and the possibility that revenues from the booming mineral export will drive up
the nominal exchange rate or prices on non-tradable goods and services. This would
negatively affect other export products, such as agricultural commodities, and also make
imported products more competitive compared with domestically produced goods. The
value of tugrik has, indeed, appreciated significantly over the past years, although it
depreciated again in 2013-14 due to falling investments and mining revenues. There
have also been signs of Dutch Disease in the agricultural sector with reported labor
shortages both in primary production and in the cashmere industry, and although
cashmere as a luxury good is less price-sensitive than many commodities, an
appreciating exchange rate does have long-term effects on competitiveness. In order to
maintain macroeconomic stability, the Mongolian Parliament passed the Fiscal Stability
Law in June 2010, which imposed limits and ceilings on fiscal deficit, expenditure
increases and public debts (World Bank 2013). If implemented effectively, this will help
mitigate the risk of Dutch Disease. Nevertheless, Dutch Disease imposes long-term
constraints on the agriculture sector rather than unpredictable risks.

VI.     Frequency, Severity and Costs of Adverse Events/ Risk
In order to design and target risk management measures, the importance of each of the
risks discussed in the previous chapter must be better understood. This is done by
analyzing the frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events over a given period of
time. The cost and severity of these events is measured as the fall in the value of gross
agricultural output. Application of this methodology requires a consistent set of data on
both production and prices, over an extended time period. The data used come from
FAO and domestic sources. More details can be found in Annex 1.


6.1.1 Separating Risk from the Normal Cost of Doing Business in Agriculture

For agriculture, small changes in yields and prices are part of the normal cost of doing
business. Output and price loss thresholds were thus derived to distinguish major
adverse events from smaller inter-annual variations in output. Variation in output
beyond these thresholds is regarded as a shock or risk event. The basis for setting these
thresholds is described in Annex 1. A summary of the thresholds used for analysis,
rounded to the nearest 5 percent, is presented in Table 7.

Table 7: Thresholds for Risk Analysis
                GAO Constant Price     GAO Real Price      Commodity Price

Potato                    10%               15%                  10%
Wheat                     15%               20%                  10%

Note that the real price thresholds for aggregate measures of agricultural output are
lower than those for individual commodities, due to the offsetting effects of different
commodities within the aggregate. For individual commodities the threshold for
analysis measured in constant prices is also lower than that measured in real prices.
Output measured in constant prices reflects the variation due to production only, while
output measured in real prices reflects the joint impact of variation in both production
and price.


6.1.2 The Value of Losses

Official information on losses due to adverse events is derived in different ways and is
invariably approximate. Analysis was thus based on estimates of the “indicative? value
of losses, to provide a more consistent basis for comparison. While these estimates draw
on actual data as much as possible, it is emphasized that they represent indicative not
actual losses. Indicative loss values are also compared to the total value of GAO in the
relevant year to provide a relative measure of the magnitude of loss.

For production risks the value of GAO “lost? for each adverse event was first calculated
in tugrik as the difference between the actual change in output and the threshold change

                                           34
in output, using constant producer prices (2004-2006). The resultant value was
converted into US dollars at 2012 exchange rates and also expressed as a percentage of
the value of GAO. The same methodology was used to derive the combined impact of
production and price shocks, based on actual production and real prices. This captures
the joint impact of price and production shocks – which is the reality that the sector
faces.

For price risks the actual value of output in real terms was compared with the notional
value of output resulting from a 10 percent (threshold) fall in real prices relative to the
previous year. The total loss due to a price fall was then calculated in tugrik at real
prices (2012=100) as the difference between actual GAO and the notional GAO at
threshold prices. This approach allows the loss due to adverse price events to be
captured more independently of losses due to an adverse fall in production, although it
does not fully remove the joint endogeneity of prices and production.


6.2      Production and Price Risks in Mongolia’s Agricultural Sector

Analysis of the major shocks to aggregate output since 1991 based on the above
methodology gives an overview of the causes and impacts of shocks to the sector. The
following broad conclusions emerge:

     Dzuds emerge as the most common source of shock – as expected.
     The dzuds in 2001 and 2010 had the greatest impact on physical output (GAO
      measured in constant prices). Both dzuds followed a period of rapid increase in
      primarily goat and sheep number, above grazing capacity.
     The most severe shock, in 1997, was mainly due to the impact of a severe price
      shock caused by the economy-wide impact of the Asian financial crisis.
     The initial stages of economic transition also resulted in severe shocks to GAO,
      across all components of agriculture, particularly in 1992. These shocks were largely
      due to falling livestock numbers and a decline in cropped area.
     Shocks to crop GAO were more frequent and severe during economic transition, as
      crop production was hit harder by these policy shocks and took longer to recover.
      Crop GAO has been relatively stable since 2000, and has helped to offset the impact
      of dzud related shocks to the livestock sector.

Dzuds and price shocks are the major risks for livestock commodities, as shown by
indicative losses for cow’s milk, beef, mutton and cashmere (2003-2012 only). (See
Annex 1). These shocks reflect the influence of adverse macroeconomic shocks as well
as commodity specific shocks due to climate and price volatility. For mutton, beef and
cashmere the analysis shows that the impact of dzuds can extend beyond the immediate
weather related livestock losses due to its impact on post-dzud production levels. Price
shocks emerge as low frequency events for all commodities, although their impact is
quite strong. Drought is also a low frequency event, with an impact similar to that of a
smaller dzud.

Price shocks and droughts are the main risks for the two main crop products – wheat
and potatoes. A different pattern of shocks emerges compared to livestock, however,
with a much greater impact of economic transition on crop production during the early
1990s and a more frequent impact of drought. Economic transition resulted in a rapid
fall in the area planted in the early 1990s, particularly for wheat. Both wheat and
potatoes were then hit by the price shocks that occurred after the Asian financial crisis



                                             35
in 1997, and droughts in 1996 and 1998. Output has been relatively stable for both
crops since then, apart from a drought in 2005.

A high proportion of the observed producer price shocks are a response to adverse
events outside the sector, which have a significant impact on the agriculture sector.
Price shocks were analyzed separately for the livestock and crop commodities examined
above, using real prices as the basis for analysis. Generalized producer price shocks
occurred in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and to the correction of
agricultural commodity prices after the global food price crisis in 2009. At the
commodity level, cashmere prices fell in response to the global financial crisis in 2008,
and wheat prices fell in parallel with world prices after they spiked in response to the
global food price crisis. The remaining price shocks appear to reflect instability in
domestic markets. Milk prices are the most volatile, with sharp price swings in response
to fluctuations in production. Paradoxically, milk and mutton prices also fall sharply
during some dzud years when production falls. The smaller observed price shocks for
beef, wheat, and potatoes are also difficult to explain.


6.3                             A Timeline of Agriculture Sector Shocks: 1992-2012

Graphical depiction of the shocks described above provides useful additional
perspective on the incidence and magnitude of agriculture sector shocks during the last
twenty years (Figure 27 and 28 below). The two figures are drawn to the same scale to
allow comparison of the relative magnitude of the observed shocks, measured in
constant and real prices. Commodity price shocks are excluded from these figures as the
impact of these shocks can be inferred from the difference between shocks measured in
real versus constant prices.

The joint impact of adverse events on production and prices shows that the most severe
post-transition shock occurs in 1997 in response to the economic slowdown caused by
the Asian financial crisis and falling international commodity prices (Figure 28).
Economic transition had a significant impact in 1992 due to its impact on production.

The dzuds of 2001 and 2010 had the biggest impact on physical output, as measured in

VII.                                Ranking and Prioritizing Agricultural Sector Risks
The optimal allocation of resources available for risk response relies on a clear
understanding of the priorities for risk management. Ranking the types of risk the sector
faces and the commodities most vulnerable to these risks, also facilitates the choice and
design of measures to strengthen risk response and the types of support needed by the
public and private sector agents responsible for risk management. Four major risks to
agriculture emerge from the preceding analysis: dzuds, drought, generalized price
shocks associated with exogenous adverse events such as the Asian financial crisis, and
the policy shocks associated with economic transition during the early 1990s. Livestock
in general and cashmere and mutton in particular emerge as the commodities most
vulnerable to risk, while wheat has the highest probability of incurring a shock.

To discern their relative importance, each category of risk is quantified according to two
parameters: (i) the average indicative cost of the observed shocks above the relevant
threshold, during the relevant time period; and (ii) the frequency of these shocks,
expressed as the number of events during the relevant time period (e.g. three events in
21 years: frequency = 0.14). The same approach is then applied to individual
commodities. Results are presented for both constant prices and real prices.



7.1                                 Types of Risk to Mongolia’s Agricultural Sector

As expected, dzuds emerge as the most important shock to physical output (Figure 30).
Not only do dzuds occur more frequently than other types of adverse event, they also
incur higher costs. Drought is a much less serious risk, occurring with lower frequency
than dzuds and predominantly affecting crop production, which accounts for only one
quarter of total GAO. The capacity to move animals in the event of drought appears to
limit its impact on livestock production. The costs of economic transition to production
are low as (i) livestock production recovered rapidly (see Chapter I), and (ii) crop
production contributes a relatively small share to sector output.

Box 2. Macro-Economic Shocks and their Consequences for Agriculture

Mongolia has experienced four major macro-economic shocks in the 20 years since
independence: i) the collapse of central planning and the subsequent period of transition from
1990-95, ii) the Asian financial crisis of 1997, iii) the global food price crisis of 2008-2009, and
(iv) the global financial crisis of 2009. Each of these shocks had major implications for
agriculture. Following the breakup of the former Soviet Union, livestock numbers fell from 1990-
1992 and cereal production fell continuously from 1990 to 2006. The Asian financial crisis in
1997 and its associated economic slowdown, resulted in a generalized fall of agricultural
producer prices. Cashmere prices fell in response to the global financial crisis in 2008, and wheat
prices fell in parallel with world prices in the aftermath of the global food price crisis in 2008-
2009.

The impact of these macro-economic shocks for agriculture is evident from the analysis of inter-
annual changes in GAO, measured in real prices (as shown in Figure 27). The most severe shock
to agriculture resulted from the Asian financial crisis, which resulted in a 43% fall in GAO (in real
prices). The impact of the collapse of central planning was also severe, with a 24% fall in
livestock GAO (in real prices) in 1992. .

While the policy shocks associated with transition are unlikely to re-occur, generalized price
shocks such as the Asian Financial crisis are a continuing risk. A worldwide economic recession
or slowdown is also likely to depress cashmere prices – Mongolia’s major agricultural export and
a critical income source for herder households. Mongolia’s narrow economic base and heavy
reliance on mineral exports means that its domestic economy, and so domestic demand for
agricultural products, is extremely vulnerable to shifts in world demand and prices for minerals.




7.2     The Impacts of Risk on Different Commodities

The overriding importance of shocks to the livestock sub-sector is evident in Figure 31,
which shows the frequency and severity of joint production and price shocks (measured
in real prices). Both crop and livestock output is subject to shocks of one form or
another in three years out of ten, but the average indicative cost of these shocks for
livestock is almost four times higher than for crops. Milk is the most volatile commodity
owing to its higher price variability (see Figure 33 below). The other commodities are
subject to a mix of production and price shocks. The largest of these commodity specific
shocks are attributed to the impact of economic transition in 1992 and the generalized
price shocks observed in 1997.

Analyzing the impact on physical output shows wide variation in risk profiles between
different commodities (Figure 32). Wheat is most prone to adverse events because of its
vulnerability to drought, although the average indicative cost of these shocks is low
relative to livestock. This high vulnerability to drought will increase further if
production is expanded onto unsuitable land – as occurred during the period prior to
independence. Current plans to support a new program of wheat expansion should be
tempered by this experience. Note also that the frequency of adverse events for overall
crop production is much lower than that for wheat, due to the stabilizing influence of
potato production.

Of the livestock commodities the large observed shock to cashmere production is
attributed to a post-dzud fall of goat numbers. Cashmere production fell by 30 percent
from 2010 to 2011, from 6,300 tons to 4,400 tons, in response to a 29 percent fall in goat
numbers during the dzud of 2010. Mutton production is the most volatile of the other
livestock commodities, although the indicative losses for milk, beef and mutton are
similar, and moderate at 2-3 percent of aggregate GAO.

The incidence and cost of price shocks is consistent with observed trends in commodity
prices (Figure 33). Milk prices are the most volatile, mostly in response to variability in
domestic market conditions. Cashmere price shocks are less frequent, but incur
relatively high indicative losses when they do occur due to the value of cashmere output.
Mutton and beef have similar risk profiles due to their similar production environments
and role in household consumption. Wheat prices are stabilized by improved access to
imports (for wheat) and potato prices by the comparative stability of domestic
production. The impact of generalized price shocks in response to the Asian financial
crisis is apparent, as is the impact of the global financial crisis on cashmere prices. But
the reasons for other, smaller price shocks due to domestic market conditions are more
difficult to discern.

7.3     The Impacts of Risks on Stakeholders

Poverty Impacts of Dzuds and Herders’ Ability to Cope

Extensive livestock herders are those who carry the main burden of dzuds. A viable
livestock herd is somewhere between 100 and 200 animals, and as late as in 2010, 70
percent of remaining herding households were estimated to fall below this threshold.5
Exactly how these herders are affected by a dzud in terms of poverty and
malnourishment is not clear; poverty and undernourishment in Mongolia has declined
steadily over the past two decades in both urban and rural areas. However, these
herders are highly vulnerable to different risks such as dzuds, diseases, price volatilities,
and theft and tend to drop out of the sector at times of shocks rather than recuperating
after losses (World Bank 2009). In addition to full-time herders, there is a significant
number of part-time herders, and herders that move in and out of the sector depending
on season and non-agricultural employment.

During the last dzud, the
poorest herders proved to also
be the most vulnerable in that
they lost proportionally more
animals. There are several
reasons for this, importantly
the level of knowledge but also
the fact that large herd sizes
cope better in severe colds as
animals provide a natural
shelter for each other. Poverty

small herders unable to invest
in preventive measures, such as feed and shelter. Further, it is more difficult for herders
with smaller herds to migrate their livestock over longer distances in search for better
pastures.

Table 8 provides an overview over different groups of herders and their risk
management strategies:

5 Rasmussen and Dorling (2011) points out that when all households owning livestock are
included, 76% fall below the limit of 200 animals. Presumably, this includes part-time farmers,
and the 70% figure should, therefore, be a better estimate of household vulnerable specifically to
sector risks.

Different size of herders also have proportionally different sources of incomes, which
means that they are affected differently by especially price changes but also depending
on which animals that most resilient to a given risk. Notably, the poorest herders derive
a significant share of their income from other activities (Table 9).

The Impacts on Consumers from Prices Increases

Consumers are sensitive to changes in meat prices and consumption is highly correlated
with incomes, especially in urban areas. The richest 20 percent of Mongolia’s population
consumes five times as much meat as the 20 percent poorest. Fresh meat is preferred
and supply chains for frozen meat products have only recently begun to evolve.
Consumers do not differentiate between cuts of meat or substitute high-end meat

                                             43
products for less expensive meat in times of hardship. Instead, poor consumers give up
meat entirely in such periods. The Government has a price stabilization program, and
abattoirs process frozen meat on Government contracts that are sold at subsidized
prices for low-income consumers (World Bank Livestock Report, 2009).

Calorie share from wheat is relatively high in Mongolia, accounting for 44 percent of
caloric intake, which means that price changes in wheat directly impact consumers’ food
budgets and consequently other expenditures (World Bank 2011). However, as a result
of income increases, the share of household expenditures allocated to food has declined
over the past years, from about 58 percent in early 2000 to 40 percent a decade later.
This has made consumers proportionately less vulnerable to food price changes than
previously. The food price crisis in 2008 had less impact on them than it would have a
decade earlier. Similarly, multiple transfer systems are in place to improve food security
among vulnerable groups. Although social transfers are not directly linked to price
changes, social transfers increased in Mongolia from the mid-2000 and are targeting
particularly sensitive groups through the Child Money Programme (CMP), such as young
families and families below the poverty line with more than two children, which
according to the UN would have cushioned some of the impacts of the price changes for
these families (UNDP/RCC Policy Note).


7.4     Implications for Risk Management

The analysis confirms the need to focus on risk management in the livestock sector, not
only because the incidence of shocks to livestock production is relatively high but also
because the sub-sector accounts for three quarters of the value of agriculture sector
output and employs about a quarter of the total workforce6. The analysis also suggests
that the current emphasis on measuring risk in terms of physical losses needs to be
broadened. While the physical losses due to dzuds are often high, and are always highly
visible, the less visible impact of macroeconomic shocks can result in high losses to
sector output as well.

Many of the production risks that have emerged after de-collectivization are a result of
the changing structure of the agriculture sector. Less public sector support and a less
regulated sector in combination with more producers have resulted in increased
vulnerability and higher losses in the event of a shock. Pastures are being overused and
one study shows that in some areas, being used at between two and nine times their
carrying capacity (Rasmussen and Dorlig 2011). This impedes winter preparation,
especially the fattening of animals, and exacerbates the impact of dzuds. Further,
targeted subsidies and other support to certain livestock and crop distort farmers’ and
herders’ incentive to diversify, which could render them more vulnerable to production
and price shocks.

value added, will also make it more resilient to risks to individual commodities and
support the Government’s objective of diversifying the economy.


VIII. Risk Management
Agricultural risk management is not a one-time intervention but rather an ongoing
process that adapts to changing conditions over time – including change within the
agriculture sector itself. As the sector modernizes, actors and stakeholders change,
supply chains become more organized, and the nature of risks is transformed. Risks
might also alter depending on the role assumed by the Government, the policies of trade
partners, and the shape of global markets. Different types of risks require different risk
management measures on part of both the private and the public sectors. Risks that are
frequent but have limited impacts tend to be best managed through mitigation
measures. Less frequent risks that have larger impacts may be transferred to a third
party. And more uncommon risks that wield severe negative impacts are likely to be
managed by Governments through coping mechanisms and other support programs
(see figure 34). Risk management for any country will likely involve a combination of all
three types of instruments, and both the private and the public sector.

Public and private sector risk management measures are on-going in each of these
priority areas in Mongolia. Depending on their knowledge, capacities, and resources,
herders prepare their herds and camps for winter and the possibility of a dzud each
year. The Government of Mongolia launched public-private index insurance for livestock
owners in collaboration with the World Bank in 2006, and has since expanded its
coverage, transferring production risks to an insurance company and a reinsurer. The
National Emergency Management Agency is responsible for helping herders cope with
extreme dzuds and provide fodder support to livestock owners through the Emergency
Reserve. Efforts are underway to introduce conservation agriculture and other soil and
water conservation measures to manage drought risk.

Few mechanisms are currently available to manage the risks associated with
macroeconomic shocks, including those which bring about price shocks. Economic
diversification and less reliance on particular commodities can effectively offset some of
this risk over time. For the public sector, administering programs for macroeconomic
stabilization and a social safety net can be instrumental in cushioning the impacts of
macroeconomic shocks. Mongolia has a relatively well-developed social safety net
system in place to compensate for income losses, even though there is scope for
strengthening it (Benson 2011). Price volatility is a major concern but there are
currently few mechanisms in place to manage price risks. Contract farming is limited,
partly due to the structure of the sector, and partly because of liquidity limitations in
Mongolia’s processing industry.

Despite the broad range of ongoing risk management activities, especially on the
production side, adverse shocks continue to have a significant impact on the sector.
Dzuds, the largest source of risk to agricultural production, have larger impacts now
than in the past, and drought and price volatilities continue to pose a systemic risk to
producers and the sector. Annex 2 provides an overview of experience and learning
from the 2009-10 dzud. Large scale livestock mortality during the last dzud and the
resulting adverse consequences for herders and broader agricultural sector reveals
important gaps in risks management for both the public and the private sector

Table 11 highlights the high priority allocation for disease management compared with
the limited share allocated for managing other risks. While this has resulted in quite
effective management of livestock and crop pest and disease in Mongolia, limited
investment in mitigation of dzud, drought, and other risks renders Mongolian
agricultural sector vulnerable to risks.

      The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is responsible for implementing ex
      ante and ex post responses to all types of natural disaster and is the principal
      agency that helps herders cope with dzud risks. In the event of a dzud, NEMA
      coordinates and finances the provision of hay and fodder, the movement of herders and
      livestock to alternative grazing areas, clearing of roads, search and rescue for
      endangered people and the disposal of livestock carcasses. The details of budget and
      expenditure on NEMA to help affected populations cope with risks were not available.
      See annex 3 for further details on NEMA.

      The Government of Mongolia launched livestock insurance program in 2006, partially in
      response to 2000 dzud, to transfer the risk to commercial insurance markets. This
      public-private partnership (see annex 4 for details) insurance is multi-layered, covering
      high to very low frequency losses (from 6 to 30 percent losses). Soum level thresholds
      (indices) of livestock mortality are the basis for payouts and are based on NSO livestock
      loss statistics for the previous 40 years. Some 15,992 herder households were insured in
      2012, and 2.46 million livestock, equivalent to 11 percent of all herder households and 6
      percent of livestock (World Bank 2012). Penetration rates vary from 10 to 35 percent in

different aimags, and will likely vary widely as penetration increases into the newly
covered aimags. Livestock insurance is making a powerful contribution to risk
management. The largest groups of users are the most vulnerable herder households,
with smaller herds of fewer than 200 animals. In addition to reduced risk, these herder
households       are     also
benefitting from improved
access to credit and slightly
lower loan interest rates.
Both factors enhance their
ability to smooth household
income and invest.

attempt to better monitor the
cashmere market, formalize
trade, and make cashmere prices and trade more transparent. However, although the
commodity exchange is made mandatory for all cashmere trade, the number of brokers
(i.e. traders) allowed to participate on the exchange is limited to 32, restricting the
potential market mechanisms of the exchange. Thus, what effects it will have on
cashmere prices has yet to be seen.

In addition to the Government, a number of donors are engaged and supporting a wide
array of programs (see table 12). The World Bank, IFAD, FAO and JICA are engaged in
projects that helps improve pastureland management.

Analysis of the existing risk management landscape reveals some key insights.

         A large number of initiatives are currently underway, across the mitigation-
          transfer-coping spectrum in Mongolia.
         There is a strong emphasis on disease management.
         Zhud management is more focused on coping, through NEMA, and transfer,
          through livestock insurance program.
         The investment on mitigation measures is relatively limited despite their
          multiple benefits (risk management as well as productivity improvement).
         Sustainable Land, pasture, and herd management warrants more attention and
          stronger policy shift.


8.3       Strengthening Agricultural Risk Management in Mongolia

While the Government of Mongolia has been very active in the area of agricultural risk
management, this analysis has found considerable imbalance between the great priority
assigned to disease risk and coping and transfer and the relative neglect of mitigation.
Efforts to reduce the exposure to these risks are relatively underfunded. This section
turns to a number of recommendations to improve this balance in Mongolia, and in so
doing, substantially improve overall risk management.

Strengthen winter preparation practices among herders. The Government has an
important role in strengthening knowledge of winter preparation and ensuring that
decentralized monitoring of preparedness is in place. Winter preparation is a set of
activities that herders carry out
each year in anticipation of a
severe winter that include
animal       nutrition,     camp
preparation, fodder and hay
storage, and slaughtering of
part of the herd. This
knowledge has proven crucial
in how well herders cope with a
dzud (see Box 2). At the same
time, this knowledge is no
longer passed on between
generations within the herding
community to the extent that it
once was. The profession has
become much more mobile, Herders were preparing fodder for winter – winter
with herders entering and preparation is a set of activities that herders carry out each
exiting the sector. Important year in anticipation of a severe winter that include animal
tools for this would be advisory nutrition, camp preparation, fodder and hay storage, and
                                  slaughtering of part of the herd.
services     and     information
campaigns, in line with FAO’s
recommendations in the Winter Preparedness Report and Local Contingency Plans.

Facilitate otor migration in the incidence of extreme weather events and educate
new herders on how to use otor as a mean to mitigate risks.8 The main mitigation

8 Otor migration is the tradition risk management method of moving animals to distant pastures where
there are adequate forage supplies for winter. It means rapid move of animals due to adverse local grazing

                                                    52
measure adopted by individual household herd owners is otor: an irregular, long-
distance move, outside the normal seasonal migrations, undertaken to fatten animals in
autumn as a part of winter preparation, or to avoid or respond to winter disasters.
Households which go on otor in general lose fewer animals than those which do not. As
the amount of snow that accumulates often requires heavy equipment to remove, the
Government has an important role in opening up snowbound routes so that remote
herders can move their animals. Otor also requires good capacity in terms of adequate
labor, knowledge of the location of otor pasture reserves, management skills, and
information networks – something which advisory services and local governments can
have an important role in strengthening.

Aimag and soums should set aside pasture land to be used only when a dzud has
been declared. Although otor migrations can occur in any year to fatten animals, otor is
particularly important as a response to a dzud. However, herds moving on emergency
otor may have a negative impact on herds resident in the refuge area by grazing down
available forage. Conflicts
arise     rapidly    in   these
circumstances. As a practice
stemming from the collective
period, areas are set aside
throughout      Mongolia     for
herders to take their animals
on otor but the legal status of
such areas is unclear. Also, the
level of organization and
scheduling of use of these
areas has declined with no
clear       attribution       of
responsibilities.         Local
government or herder joint
planning of emergency otor is
essential       to      provide A shelter built by herders for their animals during the winter
emergency otor and avoid
conflicts among herders.

The Government has a clear role in gathering, monitoring, and disseminating
early warning information such as weather forecasts and pasture quality
indicators. Numerous donor programs have improved the information available for
forecasting and assessing the onset of a dzud, including the World Bank financed
Livestock Eearly Warning System (LEWS) under the Sustainable Livelihood Project
(SLP). This information base includes medium-range weather forecasts and assessments
of grazing availability, winter feed stocks and livestock numbers. While there is ample
scope to further strengthen this information base, more emphasis could be placed on: (i)
improving herder access to and trust in this information; and (ii) on the SEC using it to
establish more graduated thresholds for disaster warnings and response. The system for
monitoring the evolution of potential emergencies will need to become more pro-active
and continuous, based on a series of clearly defined thresholds for differentiated levels
of action.

Pasture tenure security is a critical feature of mitigation and public institutions
have a clear role in awarding and ensuring tenures. Improved pasture management

conditions (over 15 - 20 km from the main camp) with only a few herders, without moving the main camp
and leaving the family behind.

                                                  53
and household hay making can only take place where households, camps, and larger
groupings have secure rights over (i) winter and spring pastures9, and (ii) hayfields.10
There need to be an unambiguous land law in place and monitoring and facilitation for
implementation.

Box 3. Reducing Livestock Mortality from Dzud by Good Winter Preparedness
Winter preparation is the way herders mitigate the substantial risks of pastoral life.
Comprehensive winter preparation puts individual and small groups of herders in a position to
manage a certain level of dzud, drought or other hazard. Beyond this level government will have
to intervene. But if all herders were skilled in the techniques of winter preparation the impact of
natural disasters would be substantially reduced.
The difference in losses during the last dzud between three herders within a limited geographic
area shows the importance that knowledge has in managing risks. All three herders were
nomadic herders and lived within a radio of about 30 km 2; however, as a result of their
preparation and risk management skills, there was a large gap between the three herders in the
losses they experienced. During the last dzud in 2009/2010 the country as a whole lost 22
percent of its livestock. Of the three herders, the first herder with a 1,400 mixed livestock herd
lost 10 animals, the second with a 1,300 mixed livestock herd, lost 10 percent of his herd, and the
third, who had about 140 animals (sheep, horses, and cattle) and thus a subsistence farmer
below the national poverty line, lost 50 percent of his livestock.
When talking to the three herders it was clear good winter preparation was the principal
determinant for how well the animals coped during the dzud. The winter preparedness includes
fattening up animals, selective and early de-stocking, preparing adequate winter feed and fodder,
preparing and repairing winter shelter, altering herd composition, toughing up animals through
temporary migration, and a host of other measures. The herder who lost 50 percent of his herd
did not undertook adequate winter preparedness measures due to lack of knowledge and
resources while the herder who lost only 10 animals is one of the most knowledgeable and
resourceful herder who strongly emphasizes the value of good winter preparedness. Considering
the exposure to dzud risk and influx of inexperienced herders in recent times, the aim should be
to raise the level of knowledge and skill of all herders to the level of today’s best herders, through
training in winter preparation techniques conducted by those best herders.

Support existing networks between herders and encourage inclusiveness by
incentivizing supportive camps. Networks are an essential element of social
relationships among herders and become especially significant at a time of grave
livelihood disturbance such as dzud. These networks are the means through which
herders negotiate access to otor pastures, and if necessary acquire the extra labor
needed for a long distance move in hostile environmental conditions. Exchange of
knowledge, experience and techniques are also important but wealthy herders often

9 The winter/spring pastures on which the group spends the danger period for dzud starting from early
autumn, through winter to late spring. Various alternatives have been tried under the present law, but it has
proved difficult to provide the assurance needed for groups to be able to leave their winter/spring reserve
pastures unoccupied while members graze distant summer and autumn pastures. At present one herder
often stays behind to protect these pastures, not always successfully. This is often a route into conflict when
groups allocate these pastures as their own reserve and arrive back in early autumn to find that someone
else has already grazed down the pasture. Rights to camp sites are widely accepted in customary land
dealings, rights to winter/spring pastures also, although free-riding is common. Experimental attribution of
use rights certificates to winter-spring reserve pastures of khot ail camps and larger semi-formal groupings
of households are underway and have shown some promise.
10 Exclusive use of hayfields is also claimed by individual households and groups although there are
commonly disputes over this. If hayfields are not fenced they may be grazed by passing herds. Lack of
secure tenure is a strong disincentive to household hay making.

have the best networks while herders with fewer animals, new herders, and those with
limited kin networks are disproportionally likely to suffer herd losses. A way to
strengthen these networks and to ensure that they are inclusive also in a mobile sector
could be through incentives to supportive camps. Supportive camps form part of a
network of herders and is often led by a successful herder. Traditionally, it provides
support to herders, especially in times of difficulty, but herders may also work for the
leader for periods to learn. These camps can be given a more formal role in
strengthening the networks, introducing new herders to best herding practices, and
integrating them into existing networks.

Improve crop production practices for better risk management. Considering the
emphasis the Government places on increasing domestic grain production, it will be
important to incorporate crop risk management into any risk management framework.
This will involve a) preparing and adhering to a land use plan11 and ensuring that only
the land suitable for crop production is used and that marginal and vulnerable land is
ineligible for cultivation; b) putting more emphasis on conservation agriculture,
minimum tillage if applicable, good soil and water management practices, and
improving irrigation efficiency; and c) promoting more drought tolerant varieties. In
addition, crop insurance for larger commercial farmers could be helpful.

Improve price risk management through better information systems and through
strengthened policy evaluation of on-going price interventions. Price volatility,
largely stemming from underlying supply or macroeconomic shocks, is a major risk and
stabilizing the supply, improving information systems, and storage infrastructure could
contribute to reduced volatility. The agriculture sector, especially livestock, is still an
informal system which limits the use of financial price risk management instruments
(hedging, forward contracts, etc.). Price stabilization funds have been set up by the
Government which could, in theory, help stabilize prices. Further analysis could be
conducted to understand the actual impact of these stabilization funds in reducing price
volatility and to explore areas for further improvement.

Strengthen the coordination between government agencies, levels of government,
and donor organizations to improve the effectiveness of emergency and post-
emergency response. The 2009/10 dzud revealed deficiencies in coordination
between the departments and agencies involved in the dzud relief. This concerns
identification of adverse events, response in the case of emergency, and financing of
activities. When a state emergency or disaster has been declared, as in the case of the
2009/10 dzud, resources and personnel should be mobilized also from other
departments that are not directly related to the agriculture sector. Although NEMA has
strong capacity, a single agency cannot maintain stand-by capacity for a large-scale
emergency. During the collective period for example, the army usually availed vehicles
for clearing snow in distant areas. The lessons learned from the 2009/10 dzud are
described in detail in Annex 2.

Box 4. Responsiveness in Emergency: Lessons from Mexico’s Scalable Social Safety Nets
Mexico’s Programa de Empleo Temporal (PET) provides an example of a multi-agency response
program that is triggered in times of emergencies. PET is an inter-agency social safety net
program overseen by the Ministry of Social Welfare while implemented by several line
ministries. The responsibilities of each party and the coordination mechanisms are defined by a
Parliamentary act, which requires the ministries involved to share a common beneficiary

database (registry). All implementing agencies receive data from an early warning system that
allow them prepare an emergency response or scale up in affected localities through PET. In
response to climate events and natural disasters, the Government of Mexico used PET to provide
rapid support to an additional 900,000 people between 2007 and 2011. The following
components have proven important to allow PET to scale up in response to crises: (a) early
warning systems are linked to programming; (b) contingency plans are established; (c)
contingency financing is available; and (d) institutional capacity is in place ahead of crises.

Secure rapid access to emergency finance, including access to contingent finance.
Given the difficulty of mobilizing adequate finance during the 2009/10 dzud, both from
the Government’s budget and from donors, there is a need to establish a formal
mechanism for availing sufficient funding during an emergency event. In a World Bank
evaluation of Mongolia’s response to the 2009/10 dzud, Benson (2011) outlines a series
of recommendations for how to do this, including setting up a contingency fund with
support from donors to be made available in the event of an emergency. Further
analysis of contingent funding mechanism and its deployment in Mongolia should be
explored.

For longer-term risk mitigation, incentivize sustainable herd structures and
pasture management. As was seen in the report, many of current production risks in
the livestock sector are closely linked with overgrazing and disproportional livestock
mixes and herd sizes. Rather than providing specific output subsidies that distort
incentives for alternative production, agricultural supports programs can be used to
incentivize environmental practices and more optimal herd sizes to prevent overgrazing
and ensure that pastures remain productive into the future. And though support to
outputs is generally less optimal, making it conditional on recipients’ compliance with
well-defined practices to encourage improved land-management and sustainable use of
natural resources. Investment support can also be provided for risk mitigating and more
sustainable practices and pasture management. Box 5 describes Uruguay’s successful
experience in supporting investments and related agricultural services for improved
natural resource management.

Box 5. Incentivizing Improved Natural Resource Management: The Uruguay Integrated
Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management Project
Uruguay faces similar challenges as Mongolia but a successful initiative helped farmers adapt
economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
Uruguay’s agricultural sector is vital for the economy as it accounts for 70 percent of export
(including processing) and occupies around 13 percent of the labor force. The main component is
livestock and the extensive beef production sector uses 80 percent of the country’s land, 70
percent of which is currently natural pasture. At the same time, emerging crop sectors compete
for available agricultural land, thereby necessitating increased productivity on available
pastures.
By supporting on-farm agro-environmental and climate-smart investments to reduce the
vulnerability of livestock producers to Uruguay’s increasing climatic variability, the Integrated
Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management Project contributed to radically improving
natural resource management in Uruguay. Interventions promoted by the project were improved
management of natural pastures, enhanced soil quality, increased accessibility to water,
rehabilitated native forests, and biodiversity management. In addition to supporting on-farm
investments, the project also financed complementary services, including technical assistance to
farmers, training to all segments of the rural population, and improved communication and
dissemination. Technical services provided by private professionals in extension were upgraded
and more fully integrated with sound practices. The well-targeted combination of
demonstrations through on-farm investments and knowledge management led to tangible
behavioral changes among farmers and mainstreamed biodiversity conservation in production
system as well as in national agricultural institutions’ agendas, which allowed for the creation of
joint ventures for better rural practices. Today, some 25 percent of the country’s vulnerable
family farmers adopted economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
As a result of these interventions, the conservation of 243 native species was supported,
including 79 listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources
(IUCN) Red List, 18 identified by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flore (CITES), and 51 defined as National Priorities. The project generated about
US$33.5 million per year total incremental income for project beneficiaries along with significant
environmental externalities for the benefit of the Uruguayan productive landscape, and is
estimated to have saved over US$30 million avoided loss in livestock production due to summer
droughts.
The project was financed by the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and is
now being followed up by the Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Climate Change
Project, with an expanded scope and focus on climate-smart agriculture.

8.4     The Way Forward

The study has highlighted that dzuds, price volatility, drought and macroeconomic
shocks have emerged as the four biggest risks for the agriculture sector. The
vulnerability of Mongolian agriculture to these risks is likely to be further exacerbated
by climate change. The Government of Mongolia is running a number of programs to
manage agricultural risk. There are, however, some areas, especially in the mitigation
sphere, which could be strengthened. Stronger emphasis on winter preparedness,
improving herders’ skills, facilitating otor migration, improving early warning systems,
setting aside pasture land for extreme weather, and other measures may help to reduce
livestock mortality and losses.



                                               57
The Government’s agricultural support program can be applied more strategically for
risk management purposes. Subsidies are currently a large share of the Government’s
agricultural budget, mainly targeting livestock and wheat production. Given the size of
the Government’s support to the private sector, there is ample opportunity to reward
farmers for applying sustainable pasture management and herd sizes. And both services
and investment support can be used to strengthen risk management skills among
herders and to rehabilitate winter shelters and other risk management infrastructure.
Subsidies to encourage herders to destock could be used as an early response
mechanism in this context, and herders without adequate feed reserves and/or those
who don’t destock can be judged ineligible for subsequent public support. And rather
than financing restocking after a dzud, income diversification should be encouraged.

Similarly, incentives can be provided to the crop sector to promote risk mitigating
practices. While subsidies have proven highly effective in encouraging production,
making them conditional on farmers using suitable land management practices such as
techniques to improve soil moisture can target these public expenditures more
purposefully. The Agricultural Expenditure Review carried out by the World Bank in
2014 also found a large discrepancy between producer support and current allocations
to R&D. Focusing more R&D on developing climate resilient crop varieties and
improving conservation agriculture for the local environment will be even more
important in a changing climate and limited water resource availability.

The long-term resilience of the livestock sector can only be strengthened by ensuring a
sustainable balance between livestock numbers and pasture availability. Striking this
balance will become increasingly challenging with climate change and as Mongolian
agriculture comes into more competition for water resources from households and
industries. The public sector has a major role to play in supporting agricultural
development and in introducing and enforcing regulations to protect environmental
resources and promote sanitary and food safety standards. Public policy will need to
effectively engage agriculturists in achieving sustainable land, pasture, and herd
management in Mongolia.

Annex 1: Methodology and Quantification of Losses
Official information on losses due to adverse events is derived in different ways and is
invariably approximate. To provide a more consistent basis for comparison, analysis
was thus based on estimates of the “indicative? value of losses . While these estimates
draw on actual data as much as possible, it is emphasized that they represent indicative
not actual losses. Indicative loss values are also compared to the total value of GAO in
the relevant year to provide a relative measure of the magnitude of loss.

Loss Thresholds

Loss thresholds were set initially to distinguish major adverse events from smaller,
inter-annual variations in output. For the inter-annual variation of aggregate measures
of GAO, which all followed a normal distribution12, these thresholds were set at
approximately one (downside) standard deviation from the mean of the inter-annual
variation. For individual commodities initial estimates were also made on this basis,
where a normal distribution was discerned (approx. 50% of variables). Where inter-
annual deviation did not follow a normal distribution, threshold estimates were based
on the average of the downside inter-annual deviations. Final thresholds were then set,
based on these estimates and observed experience of the incidence and level of adverse
events. All thresholds were rounded to the nearest 5%. Results are presented in Table
13.

Note that the real price thresholds for aggregate measures of agricultural output are
lower than those for individual commodities, due to the offsetting effects of different
commodities within the aggregate. For individual commodities the threshold for
analysis measured in constant prices is also lower than that measured in real prices.
Output measured in constant prices reflects the variation due to production only, while
output measured in real prices reflects the joint impact of variation in both production
and price.

The Indicative Value of Losses

For production risks the value of GAO “lost? for each adverse event was first calculated
in tugrik as the difference between the actual change in output and the threshold change
in output, using constant producer prices (2004-2006). The resultant value was
converted into US$ at 2012 exchange rates and also expressed as a percentage of the

12   Based on the Shapiro-Wilk test.

                                            61
value of GAO. The same methodology was used to derive the combined impact of
production and price shocks, based on actual production and real prices. This captures
the joint impact of price and production shocks – which is the reality that the sector
faces.

For price risks the actual value of output in real terms was compared with the notional
value of output resulting from a 10 percent (threshold) fall in real prices relative to the
previous year. The total loss due to a price fall was then calculated in tugrik at real
prices (2012=100) as the difference between actual GAO and the notional GAO at
threshold prices. This approach allows the loss due to adverse price events to be
captured more independently of losses due to an adverse fall in production, although it
doesn’t fully remove the joint endogeneity of prices and production.

Application of this methodology requires a consistent set of data on both production and
prices, for an extended time period. Of the various sources of data available, FAOSTAT’s
data series (1991-2011) on the value of gross agricultural production and producer
prices was considered the most suitable. These data allowed the analysis of risk over a
20-21 year period for all products except cashmere where suitable FAOSTAT data were
not available. For cashmere, data from the NSO were used for the period from 2003-
2012. The analysis of price risk for beef and mutton was based on prices derived from
GAO and production as there were no relevant price data. However further analysis
showed that these derived prices were consistent with relevant live weight price data.

The various shocks derived from this analysis were attributed to specific events on the
basis of interviews with officials in national and regional government, farmers and
traders, plus information from published reports and internet sites.

The impact and causes of the major shocks to aggregate output since 1991 are
summarized in Table 14 below, first for total GAO and then for livestock and crop GAO
separately. Results in both constant and real prices are presented to show the impact on
production alone (constant prices13) and the joint impact of shocks to production and
prices.

Livestock Commodity R isks

Indicative losses for livestock commodities (Table 15) were analyzed for cow’s milk,
beef, mutton and cashmere (2003-2012 only). The results reflect the influence of the
major shocks identified in Table 8 above, plus further commodity specific shocks due to
drought and price volatility. Losses are lower in absolute terms as they are commodity
specific, but they show the relative importance of these commodities to overall GAO.

Price shocks emerge as low frequency events for all commodities, although their impact
is quite strong. Drought is also a low frequency event, with an impact similar to that of a
smaller dzud. For mutton, beef and cashmere the analysis shows that the impact of
dzuds can extend beyond the immediate weather related livestock losses due to its
impact on post-dzud production levels.

Crop Commodity Risks

Indicative losses for the two main crops, wheat and potatoes, were also analyzed for
both constant and real prices (Table 16). A different pattern of shocks emerges, with a
much greater impact of economic transition on crop production during the early 1990’s
and a more frequent impact of drought.

Economic transition resulted in a rapid fall in the area planted in the early 1990’s,
particularly for wheat. Both wheat and potatoes were then hit by the price shocks that
occurred after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and droughts in 1996 and 1998. Output
has been relatively stable for both crops since then, apart from a drought in 2005.

Commodity Price Risks

Price shocks were analysed separately for the livestock and crop commodities examined
above, using real prices as the basis for analysis (Table 17). A high proportion of the
observed price shocks are a response to adverse events outside the sector. Generalised
price shocks occurred in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Cashmere prices
fell in response to the global financial crisis in 2008, and wheat prices fell in parallel
with world prices after they spiked in response to the world food price crisis in 2008-
2009.

The remaining price shocks appear to reflect instability in domestic markets. Milk prices
are the most volatile, with sharp price swings in response to fluctuations in production.

                                              65
Paradoxically, milk and mutton prices also fall sharply during some dzud years – when
production falls. The smaller observed price shocks for beef, wheat and potatoes are
also difficult to explain.

Annex 2: Risk Management: The 2009-10 Dzud
The 2009-2010 dzud was among the most severe experienced in Mongolia. Livestock
losses were estimated at 9.7 million head, equivalent to 22 percent of the national herd.
An estimated 8,700 households lost all of their animals and 40,000 households lost 50
percent or more. The replacement cost of these livestock was estimated at 264 billion
MNT (US$ 192 million), equivalent to 4.4 percent of 2009 GDP (Benson, 2011). The
Government launched a major relief operation in December 2009, with an estimated
cost of US$ 25 million, to which donors began responding in February 2010. Eventual
government financed relief measures amounted to approximately US$ 5 million and
donor funded measures to US$ 11–20 million (Benson, 2011).

Dzuds are slow-onset events, with ample opportunity for pre-emptive action. The
challenge is in deciding how soon to act and how to calibrate the response to an evolving
situation. Drought affected some 70 percent of Mongolia during the summer of 2009,
prompting early concerns at the risk of a dzud. An SEC working group confirmed this
risk in July 2009 and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MFALI) encouraged herders to
prepare fodder and consider temporary resettlement to areas with better pasture. Their
advice was ignored and feed reserves actually fell relative to previous years (Benson,
2011). Low livestock prices also discouraged herders from destocking. Note that
NEMA’s capacity to initiate pre-emptive action is restricted, as a hazard or disaster must
be declared to have recourse to public reserves or public expenditure.

Heavy snow fell in October 2009, which then melted and iced over – preventing access
to grazing that would normally be accessible until December. The State Emergency
Commission (SEC) declared a hazard and NEMA began distributing fodder in late
December as herders had run out of stored feed. SEC formed another working group in
early January and states of disaster were declared in eight aimags. Heavy snow and
blizzards and a sharp fall in temperature in January and February led to a re-assessment
by SEC in early February and a second in March. By then, disaster and/or dzud was
declared in a total of 80 soums in 15 aimags. Snowfalls and below average temperatures
continued through March and April, and well into May 2010. It can be noted that many
herders experienced heavy livestock losses during these later months, although they
were not classified as being in a disaster area.

The late Government response to the dzud was exacerbated by the limited resources
available for emergency and post-dzud recovery operations. A total of US$ 16-25
million, or US$ 21-33 per affected person, was raised was raised -- much lower than the
US$ 30 million raised for the comparably less severe 2002 dzud14. The lack of resources
was in part due to the poor response to an international appeal for aid, which generated
only 19 percent of the requested amount. Government’s limited ability to mobilize
financing from its own budget is also evident in that its contribution of US$ 5 million to
response activities was relatively low. NEMA’s capacity to provide strong leadership and
coordination for such a large, multi-agency response was also severely tested, due to its
limited human and financial resources, limited equipment and a lack of clarity about the
roles and responsibilities of different agencies and authorities at national and local level.
Disparate approaches were apparent at the micro level, with donors targeting needy
households while government chose to spread assistance evenly across all affected
households. Much assistance was given in livestock fodder rather than in cash. Although
post-dzud restocking of animals was a priority, actual support for re-stocking was


14   About 3.5 million livestock was lost in the 2002 dzud.

                                                  67
ultimately limited, due to lack of government resources and lack of clarity as to which
ministries and agencies were responsible for this initiative. This lack of clarity between
government ministries and agencies as to the responsibility for post-dzud measures was
also found to be a general constraint to government efforts to support post-dzud
recovery – affecting education, health and employment.

In conclusion, there is a need to ensure timely emergency response that allow for a more
graduated basis for public response and which encourages herders to reduce risk and
strengthen preparedness for dzud themselves. The sequence of events outlined above
highlights not only the numerous opportunities lost for pre-emptive action, but also the
difficulty of motivating herders to take pre-emptive action themselves and NEMA’s
difficulty in deciding when and how to respond.

Annex 3: The National Emergency Management Agency
The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is responsible for implementing ex
ante and ex post responses to all types of natural disaster. It was established in 2004
through and currently employs 3,800 people, including 80 professional staff in Ulan
Battar. At national level it reports to the Deputy Prime Minister. Local NEMA agencies
operate at aimag level under the Aimag Governor and at soum level under the Soum
Governor. NEMA is active in all years in response to fires, droughts and dzud.

Decisions on what constitutes a national or local disaster are made by a separate State
Emergency Commission (SEC), which reviews the magnitude of adverse events. Chaired
by the Deputy Prime Minister, the 25 member SEC includes the Head of NEMA (as
Deputy), high-level representatives from nine line ministries, other government
agencies, a civil society organization and the Mongolian Red Cross. NEMA implements
the emergency response once a disaster is declared. The SEC also makes all relevant
budgetary decisions, including the release of state reserves, and submits these decisions
to the Cabinet for approval. The SEC’s high level government representation allows it to
work quickly, with as little as 8 days required to disburse funding in response to
requests for assistance (Benson, 2011). Requests for international assistance for
emergency response are also instigated and coordinated by the SEC.

Disaster preparedness, through the use of public reserves, is a critical element of
NEMA’s mandate. Public reserves of food, grain, fodder, fuel and other goods deemed
necessary for national security are held by the State Reserve at strategic locations
throughout the country. Additional reserves are held by aimag and soum authorities.
The size of these reserves is specified by law. For livestock the aim is to ensure the
following level of public and private fodder and hay reserves each year:

       Private herders        7 days
       Local government       3 days
       NEMA                   5 days

Public stocks are released on the instruction of the SEC, which also determines the
method of release (sales or free distribution) and the use of any resulting revenue. A
separate Government Reserve fund is held by the Ministry of Finance for other
contingencies, part of which is ring-fenced for disaster events and human and livestock
epidemics. The emphasis on public reserves may shift in the future with NEMA placing
more emphasis on encouraging herders to carry their own stocks and rationalize
livestock numbers, and on the protection of human lives. Recourse to financial reserves
and financial support may also become more prevalent, relative to the current emphasis
on managing and distributing physical reserves.

In the event of a dzud NEMA coordinates and finances (through SEC) the provision of
hay and fodder, the movement of herders and livestock to alternative grazing areas,
clearing of roads, search and rescue for endangered people and the disposal of livestock
carcasses. Firefighting is also managed and coordinated by NEMA through its local
government agencies. Local authorities are viewed as the first line of response for
localized adverse events. Inadequate resources often limit their capacity to respond,
however, particularly if their budget allocation from NEMA has already been used for
other emergencies.

NEMA’s capacity for disaster prevention and protection has benefitted considerably
from a long-term project to strengthen the national capacity for disaster mitigation and
management, funded by UNDP and the Government of Luxembourg. In addition to
guiding the establishment of NEMA in 2004, this project has helped to strengthen the
legislative basis for disaster management, train staff and provide equipment, strengthen
local government capacity for emergency response and develop a national strategy for
disaster risk reduction.

Annex 4: Mongolia Livestock Insurance Overview
Working with the World Bank and other donors the government of Mongolia has
developed a multi-layered framework for responding to livestock loss, of which
livestock insurance is a critical component. The risk layers are as follows:

Layer 1:       High frequency losses below a threshold of 6 percent, which herders are
expected to cover themselves.
Layer 2:       Low frequency losses (one in ten years) below a threshold of 30 percent,
covered by livestock risk insurance.
Layer 3:       Very low frequency, catastrophic losses above the 30 percent threshold
for insurance coverage, to be covered with public funds.

A pilot livestock insurance scheme to cover layer 2 risk was initiated in three selected
aimags in Western, Khangai and Eastern regions in 2006 (Uvs, Bayankhongor, and
Khentii). The aim was to establish a viable, affordable insurance scheme based on a
partnership between government and private insurance companies. Consistent with this
objective, an index based insurance scheme was developed to keep costs and premiums
low. Soum level thresholds (indices) of livestock mortality were determined as the basis
for payouts, based on NSO livestock loss statistics for the previous 40 years.

Actual, soum-level mortality rates are assessed each year by NSO on the basis of a year-
end livestock census and a follow-on mid-year survey. NSO survey data is also used to
set the soum-level livestock values used as the basis for payouts. Herders can choose the
number and type of animal insured (sheep, goats, cattle, yaks, horses, camels are
eligible) and whether to cover them for full or partial value. Loss payments are triggered
whenever losses exceed the thresholds for each soum, irrespective of the level of loss by
individual herders. An insured herder can thus receive a payout even if no losses are
incurred.

Insurance Coverage

Expansion to other aimags began in 2009, with coverage initiated in all 21 aimags by
2012. Some 15,992 herder households were insured in 2012, and 2.46 million livestock
(World Bank, 2012); equivalent to 11 percent of all herder households and 6 percent of
livestock. This coverage is expected to grow as penetration increases in the newly
covered aimags. An indication of the level of future coverage can be seen in Table 18,
which shows coverage for the three original pilot aimags in the seven years since
livestock index insurance was introduced. There is considerable variation in the level
and pattern of penetration, with the highest coverage in Bayankhongor at 34 percent of
herder households and 21 percent of livestock in 2012. Slightly lower coverage is
observed in Uvs and very low coverage in Khentii.

Analysis of all insured herder households shows that livestock insurance is most
actively sought by those with small herds (Figure 36). Almost 50 percent of insured
herder households have herds of 50-200 animals and a further 30 percent have less
than 50 animals. This pattern is similar in 2009 and 2012, before and after the 2010
dzud. For the country as a whole, these two categories accounted for 22 percent of all
livestock owned and 57 percent of herder households in 2012 (NSO). Most of the
livestock owned (75 percent) are in herds of 201-1500 animals (NSO), where the
interest in insurance appears to be lower. The owners of the largest herds appear to
have the capacity to cover livestock losses from their own resources.

These results suggest that insurance coverage is unlikely to exceed 55-60 percent of
herder households and 25-30 percent of livestock in the medium term. Coverage beyond
this will depend on the success of an active program to publicize the advantages of
insurance more widely and to refine and improve the product to make it more
attractive. Livestock insurance is making a powerful contribution to risk management
nevertheless. The largest groups of users are the most vulnerable herder households,
with smaller herds of less than 200 animals. In addition to reduced risk, these herder
households are also benefitting from improved access to credit and slightly lower loan
interest rates. Both factors enhance their ability to smooth household income and invest.

Financing Livestock Insurance

The financial viability of commercial livestock insurance was recognized as a major
challenge very early in the design of the livestock insurance program. The Mongolian
insurance industry lacks the financial capacity to absorb the huge potential losses
associated with dzuds. Figure 37 below shows how this disparity between indemnity
payments, risk financing capacity and probable risks has evolved since the program’s
inception.

This challenge has been addressed at several levels. A Livestock Insurance Indemnity
Pool (LIIP), financed by participating insurance companies on the basis of sales meets
part of this need. Government initially augmented this capacity by reinsuring losses (at
commercial rates) up to 110 percent of the LIIP’s assets – for losses within the
30 percent threshold for Layer 2 risks. A further Contingent Debt Facility was then
capitalized with U$S 5 million by the World Bank to cover additional losses –
particularly catastrophic losses associated with Layer 3 risk. For the period 2006-2011,
676 million MNT of indemnity payments was financed from the LIIP, 912 million MNT
from the Government Reserve account and 1.9 billion MNT from the Contingent Debt
Facility (World Bank, 2012).

Several measures to deepen and strengthen the financial capacity for livestock
insurance were initiated in 2010. A reinsurance agreement was signed with SCOR to
transfer part of the risk exposure of the LIIP to the global reinsurance market. The
government re-insurance facility and the Contingent Debt Facility were also formed into
a non-commercial Government Catastrophe Coverage (GCC) facility with a capital input
of US$ 11.35 million from the World Bank (including unused funds from the original
Contingent Debt Facility). Reinsurance of this GCC was also secured with Swiss Re to
reduce its risk exposure. Government has also launched plans to create a national
capacity for livestock reinsurance, with start-up capital of 30 billion MNT.

While these measures will strengthen the financial capacity to respond to livestock
losses through insurance, they will not remove the need for continued public finance.
Public expenditure will remain an essential component of commercial livestock
insurance, particularly in the event of catastrophic losses and/or in the event of
successive dzuds as occurred in 1999-2001. And while livestock insurance is now well
established as an important component of risk management – it is unlikely to cover all
households and all livestock as noted above. It should thus be viewed as one component
of the risk response portfolio.

1. Background and Objective
With a population of 65 million, the state of Karnataka in the south of India is considered among
the better-off states in the country. However, there are significant socio-economic disparities, with
large populations living in deep poverty, particularly in the rural northern part of the state.
Although the government health care system offers services free of charge, health care is often
sought from the private sector, so that out-of-pocket payments represent an estimated 69% of total
health spending in India.1 Analysis of 2004 household survey data found that the poorest third of
households in rural areas in India spent the equivalent of 11% of their average annual income on
health care, while those who paid for inpatient care spent on average 136% of average annual
income per hospital admission.2 Such spending on health care services can drive households
deeper in poverty.
Several state governments and the national government in India have introduced
government-sponsored insurance schemes for financing hospital care for the poor. 3 These
government-sponsored insurance schemes are different from private voluntary insurance markets,
in that beneficiaries of these schemes pay no premiums. Beneficiaries also typically receive first
dollar coverage as long as care is received in an empanelled or network hospital. Thus, these
schemes are similar to government-financed insurance programs for the poor in other countries
such as the Medicaid program in the U.S. The central government has recently initiated a scheme,
the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY), to pay public and private hospitals for
secondary-level inpatient care provided to members of households who are classified below the
poverty line (BPL). In parallel, a number of state governments have started schemes to pay for
tertiary-level care for BPL patients, including Karnataka, which has initiated the Vajpayee
Arogyashree Scheme (VAS). The scheme was implemented on a pilot basis in one of four revenue
divisions (Gulbarga) since the beginning of 2010, before being expanded in 2011 to a second
division (Belgaum). In April 2012, the state government started expansion of the scheme to the rest

of the state. A benefits package and reimbursement schedule for 447 tertiary care services have
been defined, encompassing the areas of cardiology, oncology, neurology, nephrology,
neonatology and pediatric surgery, burn care, and major trauma care. In addition, 50 follow-up
care packages have been defined. The annual benefit per family is 150,000 rupees (US$ 3,330)
with an additional 50,000 rupees (US$ 1,110) as a buffer on a case-by-case basis. Residents of
Karnataka who possess a BPL card issued by the state government are eligible to benefit from the
scheme. The scheme has empanelled over 100 government and private hospitals.
The IDA-financed Karnataka Health System Development Project (KHSDRP) supports the
scheme, allocating a total of US$ 42 million to reimbursement of claims. This is being disbursed
on completion by the scheme of a set of capacity and system-related milestones. Disbursement is
also tied to specific health services in that claims paid by VAS for individual services are
reimbursed by the credit.
Limited evidence exists on the impact of health insurance schemes in developing countries on the
health and economic well-being of beneficiaries. Prior reviews of the literature on health insurance
suggest that the evidence is primarily limited to a few case studies and in some cases is of
questionable quality. 4 , 5 In Karnataka itself, a study of rural households participating in the
government’s previous Yeshasvini community-based health insurance suggests that insurance
increased utilization and reduced out-of-pocket spending but that the effects varied across medical
episodes and socio-economic groups (notably, benefitting the better-off rather than the poor).6
The provider-purchasing mechanism used by the scheme, paying hospitals for defined packages of
services is an example of results-based financing (RBF) that contrasts with the budget-line funding
of hospitals services by the government that is the status quo. It is important to measure the impact
of the scheme overall in contrast with the status quo. The government’s main objective is to reduce
financial hardship due to spending on tertiary care by poor households, and it is also important to
evaluate the scheme’s effects on tertiary care utilization, quality of care, and health outcomes.
The impact evaluation has three aims:
(i)    Evaluation of the impact of VAS on tertiary care utilization, health outcomes, household
       out-of-pocket health expenditures and quality of care;
(ii)   Evaluation of the impact of results-based incentives for village health workers (ASHAs) on
       take-up of benefits by BPL patients requiring tertiary care; and
(iii) Evaluation of the impact of results-based incentives for primary health care centers (PHCs)
       and ASHAs on follow-up care for VAS beneficiaries.

2. Implementation
The government was preparing to expand the scheme to the entire state, but a household survey
was fielded before the expansion was implemented, allowing for comparisons between covered
and uncovered populations. The survey, fielded in September 2012, sampled 31,476 households in
300 villages where the scheme was implemented and 28,633 households in 272 neighboring
matched villages ineligible for the scheme, providing data in pursuit of study aim (i) above. In
parallel, the study team pursued dialogue with and support to the state government on
implementation of results-based incentives to encourage take-up of the scheme (study aim (ii)) and
follow-up care (study aim (iii)). After completion of the household survey, analysis of the data and
publication of the main results, in coordination with HRITF management the team decided that the
potential value-added of a planned follow-up survey was not sufficient to justify the expense.
The study team includes: the Principal Investigator, Neeraj Sood, Associate Professor, Leonard D.
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, University of Southern California; Arnab
Mukherji, Associate Professor, Center for Public Policy, Indian Institute of Management
Bangalore, Bangalore, India; Anish Majahan, Assistant Professor, School of Medicine, University
of California Los Angeles; Patrick Mullen, Senior Health Specialist (and Task Team Leader),
World Bank; Somil Nagpal, Senior Health Specialist, World Bank; and other collaborators.
3. Outputs
The dataset from the household survey has been provided to the HRITF database. Analysis of
these data contributed to study aim (i), described in the following four papers.
1. “Government health insurance for people below poverty line in India: quasi-experimental
evaluation of insurance and health outcomes?
This paper describes the main results of the impact evaluation, comparing below- and
above-poverty line households across the administrative boundary line dividing populations that
were covered and not covered by the scheme. Among households below the poverty line, the
mortality rate from conditions covered by the scheme was 0.32% in households eligible to benefit
from the scheme, compared with 0.90% in ineligible households. In contrast, there was no
difference in mortality rates between eligible and ineligible households above the poverty line.
With regard to out-of-pocket expenditures, being eligible for the scheme was associated with a
58% reduction in such costs incurred by households for admissions in tertiary care hospitals. When
comparing utilization of hospital services, the greatest difference was found for non-emergency
admissions for potentially covered conditions to tertiary care facilities that led to inpatient stays
longer than four days. Household eligible for the scheme were 44.2% more likely to use such
services. The magnitude of this difference is large and approaches statistical significance (p =
0.06). The journal article published in BMJ is available at:
http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5114
2. “Managing Financial Risk through Social Health Insurance in India?
Making use of the data on out-of-pocket expenditures, this is a further analysis of the financial

                                                 5
protection provided by the Karnataka scheme. Households that have access to the scheme report
lower frequency of borrowing to finance health care costs, and when they borrow they borrow less
money to support health care expenses. Further, the entire distribution of out-of-pocket
expenditures for households covered by the scheme is below the distribution for households
without access to the scheme. Importantly, these gains tend to be larger for higher quantiles of
out-of-pocket expenditure – the reductions in out-of-pocket expenditure at the 95th percentile are
about 12 times the reductions reported at the 85th percentile of the distribution. This is evidence
that the program leads to large reductions in catastrophic health care expenditures, particularly
important as this is the main policy goal of the state government.
3. “The impact of health insurance for tertiary care on postoperative outcomes and seeking care
for symptoms?
The first paper indicated that higher utilization of hospital services was a clear mechanism by
which coverage by the scheme was associated with lower mortality. This paper examines other
possible factors (care-seeking and quality), analyzing the data using the same methodology. It
finds that eligible households were 6.75% more likely to seek treatment for symptoms associated
with conditions covered by the scheme. Respondents eligible for the scheme reported greater
improvements in well-being after hospitalization in all categories (statistically significant in three
of the six categories – walking ability, pain, and anxiety. Respondents eligible for the scheme were
88% less likely to report any infection after their stay at a tertiary care facility and 48% less likely
to have been re-hospitalized after the initial hospitalization. Increased care-seeking as well as
higher quality of care are thus associated with coverage by the scheme, factors likely contributing
to better health outcomes.
4. “Health and economic implications of national treatment coverage for cardiovascular disease
in India?
This analysis uses estimates from the survey as well as other data sources in order to model the
potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of increased utilization of different types of care for
cardiovascular disease. Care for cardiovascular disease represents the largest proportion of
services paid for by the Karnataka scheme. “Primary? treatment for cardiovascular disease refers
to medication (a statin and two blood pressure medicines) for at-risk individuals. “Secondary?
treatment refers to medication (aspirin, blood pressure medications and a statin) for individuals
with a history of prior myocardial infarction or stroke. “Tertiary? treatment includes
hospitalization and surgical procedures. The model finds that primary treatments can avert the loss
of 3.6 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per year, secondary treatment can avert the
loss of 0.2 million DALYs per year, and tertiary treatments can avert the loss of 3.0 million
DALYs per year. It is estimated that coverage of primary treatment alone has an incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 469 per DALY, secondary treatment alone has a ratio of US$ 2,500
per DALY and tertiary treatment alone has a ratio of US$ 2,251 per DALY.

The following also contributes to study aim (i), examining quality of care using medical records
and administrative data.

5. “Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) & Cardiac Care in Karnataka, India?
Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) determine whether a given procedure is appropriate for a given
clinical scenario. Medical charts for 600 cardiac patients and pre-authorization data from five
hospitals providing care reimbursed by the Karnataka scheme were reviewed to determine whether
AUC could be applied in this context. Studies of AUC applied to surgical interventions in US
hospitals for cardiovascular disease have found that 85-90% of procedures/surgeries were
appropriate, 7-10% were uncertain, and 3-5% were inappropriate. The Karnataka records were
missing some information required for application by AUC. Making use of existing data (and
simulating the missing data), results in a best-case scenario where 92.2% of procedures were
appropriate, 2.0% inappropriate and 5.8% uncertain. A worst-case scenario results in 76.7%
appropriate, 7.5% inappropriate and 15.8% uncertain.
__________
The following paper contributes to study aim (ii), relating to the use of RBF incentives to
encourage take-up of care. Following considerable dialogue, the state government implemented
different types of incentives for ASHAs and the analysis of results is based on administrative data
from the scheme.
6. “Effects of alternative payment strategies for community health workers?
There are approximately 32,000 ASHAs in Karnataka. 175 administrative units (Taluks) in the
state were randomly assigned to three groups. In the first group (half of the Taluks), ASHAs were
to receive a low incentive payment (about US$ 4) for each case referred to the insurance scheme
that actually received treatment. In a quarter of the Taluks, ASHAs were to be paid a fixed
remuneration independent of the number of cases referred to the scheme. In the other quarter of the
Taluks, ASHAs were to be paid a high incentive for cases referred to and treated under the scheme
(around US$ 11, followed by US$ 4 for follow-up care). Unfortunately, due to inadequate
implementation of the incentive program, the analysis could not discern a statistically significant
difference in the number of cases referred by the three groups. Of the monthly average of over
3,000 cases covered by the scheme statewide, only an average of 44 were referred by ASHAs.
Qualitative interviews of ASHAs indicated that most knew about the incentive program but that
there were a variety of problems with recording their involvement in case referral and claiming
incentives.
__________
With regard to study aim (iii), relating to the use of RBF incentives to encourage follow-up care,
the team pursued considerable dialogue with the scheme’s management on design and
implementation of improvements to follow-up care. This led to agreement to re-design the service
packages for follow-up care to be paid for by the scheme (which was included as a
disbursement-linked milestone supported by the IDA project). However, the technical work and
consensus-building required to modify the packages took too much time to allow for design and
implementation of the planned experimentation with incentives.

4. Results
The results of the main impact evaluation, particularly the government insurance scheme’s
significant estimated effect on mortality, have had a considerable policy impact, including through
challenging several orthodoxies. In India, a significant proportion of public health opinion leaders
and stakeholders are suspicious of health insurance, particularly involving the private sector, but
also including government-financed insurance.7 Those holding this point of view argue that all
available resources should be directed to the government-run health system, which offers services
free-of-charge to the population. At the same time, there is also a considerable constituency
advocating government-financed insurance for the poor, particularly for inpatient hospital care
(provided by both public and private hospitals). When the paper describing the results of the
impact evaluation was published by the medical journal BMJ in September 2014 and released
through press conferences in Delhi and Bangalore, it had a considerable impact on this debate.
(The study was disseminated widely by the team, including through a youtube video). 8 Most
immediately, the Karnataka state minister of health referenced the study on several occasions and
it evidently bolstered the decision to expand the scheme statewide and to all citizens of the state
(with some copayment by the non-poor).9 It is notable that the RBF-type payment mechanism
(payment for packages of services provided) is being applied to both private and public hospitals,
while the share of claims accounted for by public hospitals is steadily rising (currently around
25%). At the national level, the impact evaluation has contributed to the policy debate over the
strategy of the national government’s planned “National Health Assurance Mission.?
Globally, there are few rigorous studies to demonstrate an impact on health outcomes of expanded
insurance coverage, so that this impact evaluation makes a significant contribution.
At the same time, the Karnataka scheme’s focus on tertiary hospital care has challenged the
prevailing notion that available public resources should be solely prioritized for primary health
care. The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among all populations, including the
poor in developing countries, raises issues of demand for care, financial protection, and political
impact – realities to which governments in India are responding through these types of insurance
schemes. This impact evaluation contributes to the notion that investments in both primary and
hospital care are cost-effective (recognizing that investment in tertiary care alone at the expense of
primary care is not an optimal strategy).
Finally, the work on quality (including measurement of an association between insurance coverage
and improved hospitalization outcomes, as well as medical records analysis), will in the immediate
term lead to improvements in the Karnataka scheme’s pre-authorization process (as well as similar
changes in other states). More generally, it is contributing to advancing the agenda of
evidence-based medicine in India.

1. Introduction

Export diversification matters for policy makers in developing countries for several reasons.
A highly concentrated export basket can result in high aggregate volatility that is difficult to
offset by fiscal or monetary policy (Brainard and Cooper, 1968; de Ferranti et al., 2002);
moving away from a strong reliance on exporting commodities can be a stepping stone for
industrialization and development (Prebisch, 1950; Singer, 1950; Young, 1991; Hausmann et
al., 2007), and export diversification can also operate as an intermediate target for
governments seeking to achieve what Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1969) call ‚Äúnon-economic‚Äù
objectives.1

         Largely due to being a landlocked country wedged between China and India, and its
low level of GDP per capita, Nepal‚Äôs exports are highly concentrated in a handful of products
which are sold to very few countries. To be more precise, 85% of total exports in 2011 were
sold to only 5 countries, with 80% of these sold in India alone. At the same time, the top five
(in terms of value) HS 6-digit export products in the same year accounted for approximately
one-third of exports. This staggering level of export concentration is a pressing issue for
Nepal. As Figure 1 shows, the share of exports in GDP declined steadily between 2000 and
2011, falling from 23 to 9% of GDP, while imports, on the other hand, have consistently
accounted for between 30 to 40% of output over the last 15 years. The combination of
these two trends has resulted in a dramatic deterioration of Nepal‚Äôs chronic trade deficit,
which reached 24% of GDP in 2011.

         In an effort to correct this imbalance, the government of Nepal introduced in 2010
the Cash Incentive Scheme for Exports (CISE), a program that provides cash subsidies
ranging from 2 to 4% of the value of export transactions for a select group of products,
subject to two conditions: (i) that the domestic value-added incorporated in the export
shipment exceeds a minimum threshold, and (ii) that the exported product is sold in a
country other than India.

         Our objective in this paper is to evaluate whether this export subsidy has had any
significant effects on export outcomes such as export values, quantities, prices, their

       It is hard to overstate the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of the CISE
scheme in promoting exports and fostering their diversification. As the 2011 Trade Policy
Report presented by the Nepalese government to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
notes, Nepal‚Äôs ‚Äúever-growing dependence on a single country indicates the urgency for trade
diversification and indicates need for strengthening its competitiveness to attain this end.‚Äù In
a context of reduced fiscal space following the disastrous earthquake in April 2015 ÔÄ≠which
killed more than 8,000 people and caused economic losses in the order of US$10 billionÔÄ≠ it
is crucial to determine whether a cash subsidy granted to exporters is an effective
instrument to achieve Nepal‚Äôs international trade objectives.

       Our analysis proceeds in three steps. Firstly, we provide a broad range of stylized
facts of product-level export patterns based on whether goods were eligible to receive the
export subsidy or not, and whether they were sold in India or elsewhere, using transaction-
level customs data for the period 2011-2014. We then merge these data with information
on the firms that obtained the CISE subsidy and the amount they received from the

                                                   3
Nepalese Central Bank, the entity in charge of disbursing the subsidy. This information
allows us to determine the share of eligible firms that actually received the subsidy, as well
as to identify the products that benefitted the most from the policy.

       We find that although exports to India account for 70% of Nepalese exports on
average throughout our period of analysis, their importance fell between 2012 and 2014.
We also find that products for which the export subsidy is available are important in
aggregate terms ‚Äîaccounting for about 40% of total exports; with the share of these
products sold outside India showing a small increase over the same period. We next move
to document the participation of Nepalese exporters in the CISE scheme. As we discuss in
more detail in Section 2, delays in the design of the rules governing the program and in its
implementation resulted in just a handful of exporters taking advantage of the subsidy in its
first year in place, and only half of the allotted budget being utilized. Nevertheless, the
usage rate of the scheme increased quite rapidly, and by 2014 the share of eligible exporters
receiving the subsidy had increased fivefold, while subsidy outlays doubled relative to 2012.
From a cross-sectoral perspective, our analysis reveals that 90% of all subsidy payments are
enjoyed by firms exporting carpets, man-made fibers, edible vegetables, apparel and hides
and skins.

       In the second part of our analysis we investigate which firm-level characteristics
determine the probability of receiving the CISE subsidy conditional on eligibility (i.e. carrying
out at least one export transaction of an eligible product to a destination market other than
India), as well as the characteristics that determined whether a product was included in the
subsidy program. We find that exporters are more likely to receive the subsidy, the larger
they are (in terms of the total value of their exports), the more important eligible products
and sales outside India are in their total exports ‚Äîand crucially‚Äî if they have received
subsidies in the previous year. Interestingly, incorporating a high share of domestic value-
added ‚Äîwhich is one of the requirements imposed by the CISE scheme‚Äî does not appear
to influence a firm‚Äôs chances of obtaining the subsidy. From a product perspective, eligibility
status under the CISE scheme is strongly associated with a product being sold primarily
outside India and with it incorporating a high share of local input content.

       Lastly, we investigate whether the CISE subsidy has produced a significant response
in firm-level export outcomes among the firms that received the cash incentive. The

                                               4
outcome variables we consider are export values, quantities, prices, their respective growth
rates and the number of products and destination markets served by exporters. Our
empirical specification includes firm-product category (i.e. eligible and non-eligible to
receive subsidies)-destination (i.e. India and the rest of the world), as well as year-product
category-destination-specific fixed effects. Thus, we estimate whether a given outcome,
such as the value of eligible products exported to the rest of the world, changed
substantially when a firm received subsidies relative to the situation in which the same firm
exporting the same product to the same market was not incentivized; all this while
controlling for broad demand and supply changes that could affect the exports of the four
product category-destination combinations that we consider.

       Our assessment of the effectiveness of the CISE export subsidy program in terms of
its impact on firm-level export outcomes is strongly negative. We do not find any significant
effect of the export subsidy on firms‚Äô export values, quantities, prices or their growth rates ,
regardless of whether a product was eligible to receive subsidies or not, or if the market
served was India or elsewhere. If anything, our results suggest that firms that received the
subsidy saw their export value and quantity of eligible products shipped to the rest of the
world fall after receiving the cash incentive ‚Äîalthough, as we noted above, this result is not
statistically significant. In a similar vein to other studies that have evaluated the
performance of export promotion agencies, such as Volpe Martincus and Carballo (2008)
and van Biesebroeck et al. (2015), we find a small but significant impact of the subsidy on
the extensive margin of exports. More precisely, firms that received the subsidy began to
sell a wider range of eligible products across more export destinations. Thus, while there is
evidence that the CISE program has had a significant effect in increasing product and market
diversification at the firm-level, there is no substantive increase in size of export shipments.

       Cash subsidies to exports targeted to specific products, subject to local content
requirements and available only to exports sold in certain destinations, are commonplace
among Nepal‚Äôs main trading partners in South Asia. Bangladesh, for instance, offers cash
subsidies to exports (with ad-valorem rates as high as 20 and 30%) to a wide range of
products such as frozen shrimp, jute and straw products, leather goods and garments




                                               5
among others.2 Similarly to the CISE scheme, subsidy rates increase with the share of
domestic value-added incorporated in the export shipment. India also provides cash
incentives ranging from 2 to 5% to more than 100 products under its Merchandize Exports
Incentive Scheme with subsidy rates depending on the country that exports are sold to.3

        Since Nepal belongs to the group of Least Developed Countries, as defined by the
United Nations, it is not bounded by the WTO disciplines regarding the use of subsidies
contingent upon export performance stipulated in the Agreement on Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures. International trade theory, however, has shown that export
subsidies are seldom desirable policies from a welfare standpoint. Exceptions include
instances in which product markets are oligopolistic (e.g. Brander and Spencer, 1985), and
when domestic distortions such an unemployment or externalities provide a rationale for
export subsidies to be used as a second-best policy (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956; Bhagwati
and Ramaswamy, 1963). Crucially ‚Äîgiven the specific eligibility requirements of the CISE
program discussed above‚Äî Feenstra (1986) shows that export subsidies can be welfare-
improving when products sold in different markets are not perfectly substitutable, while
Itoh and Kiyono (1987) show that targeting subsidies to ‚Äòmarginal‚Äô export products can also
be appropriate. As noted above, our analysis will not speak to the desirability, from a
welfare standpoint, of the cash incentive to exports, but will instead focus on its
consequences in terms of export volumes, quantities, their growth rates, and diversification
patterns.

export subsidies are inherently difficult to define and identify, (WTO, 2006). They often

  Closely related to this literature and our paper, Girma et al. (2009) and Helmers and Trofimenko (2015) study
the effect of broadly defined production subsidies recorded in the manufacturing surveys of China and
Colombia respectively, on export outcomes.

guarantees, access to duty-free imports of intermediate inputs and machinery and
preferential access to finance and public utilities, some of which would not be even
classified as subsidies from an accounting perspective. Similarly, export promotion agencies
also provide a number of services to firms using their services such as training, finance,
participation in international trade missions and shows intended to help firms in their
internationalization efforts. In this regard, the policy instrument that we analyze is an
extremely well-defined one, simply ‚Äúcold, hard cash‚Äù. Moreover, the factors conditioning
firms‚Äô eligibility to receive the subsidy ‚Äîi.e. the product exported, its destination market,
and to a certain extent, its domestic content‚Äî can be readily identified in the data available
to us.

         Given the product and destination-specific requirements featured in the CISE export
subsidy, our paper also adds to the body of work that investigates the consequences of
imposing performance requirements on export subsidies (Davidson et al., 1985; Rodrik,
1987; Defever et al. 2016; Defever and Ria√±o, 2017). We improve upon the existing
empirical work studying the effects of conditional export subsidies, in that we are able to
directly observe the subsidy disbursements made to each firm instead of just whether a firm
is eligible to obtain incentives, for instance, based on its export intensity, location in a
special economic zone or its ownership status.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the Cash Incentive
Scheme for Exports (CISE) subsidy program, spells out its eligibility requirements and
summarizes the changes it underwent following its reform in 2013. Section 3 provides a
stylized theoretical framework that we will use to guide our empirical assessment of the
CISE program. Section 4 describes the data used in this paper and provides a wide range of
stylized facts characterizing firm and industry-level export patterns in Nepal, as well as the
main determinants characterizing the exporters that received cash incentives. Section 5
presents our evaluation exercise, in which we investigate if the CISE subsidy program
affected export outcomes for firms that received the subsidy. Section 6 concludes.

2. Description of the Cash Incentive Scheme for Exports

The Cash Incentive Scheme for Exports (CISE) was first introduced in the Budget Speech for
the fiscal year 2010/11 in April 2010, but due to delays in the preparation of guidelines for
the scheme, it only started being implemented in 2012 (Sapkota, 2011).

           The CISE program offered a 2% ad-valorem subsidy on export sales (denominated in
Nepalese rupees) subject to two requirements: (i) the export transaction had to incorporate
at least 30% of domestic value-added, and, (ii) the product under consideration had to be
sold in a country other than India.5 The subsidy rate provided increased with the proportion
of local content incorporated in the exported good. Namely, if the share of domestic value-
added embodied in the exported product exceeded 50%, the subsidy rate increased to 3%,
and would, in turn, reach a maximum of 4% if the share of local content incorporated was
greater than 80%. The subsidy was made available to both direct exporters and ‚ÄúExport
Trading Houses‚Äù (i.e. wholesalers), with the latter being required to transfer 50% of the cash
payment to the producers of the good in question. The subsidy was disbursed by the
Nepalese Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank) upon receiving evidence that the payment for an
export transaction in foreign exchange had been deposited in a Nepalese bank. The total
budget allotted to the scheme was 240 million Nepalese rupees (approximately 3.2 million
2010 US dollars). The provision of subsidies was executed on a first-come first-serve basis.
This means that not all eligible firms (i.e. those satisfying the two requirements listed above
before 2013, or those exporting eligible products to countries other than India afterwards)
received subsidies.

           Two reasons were adduced to justify the exclusion of sales to India from the scheme.
Firstly, as noted above, one of the goals of the scheme was to foster the diversification of
Nepalese exports away from India, which in 2010 accounted for approximately 70% of the
country‚Äôs exports. Secondly, both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and
Supply (MOCS) noted that extending the subsidy to exports to India would create incentives
for firms to export products which then could be reshipped back to Nepal through a
different border point, thus obtaining subsidies for goods that were not actually exported
(Sapkota, 2011). To further ensure that no subsidies were granted to exports to India, the

    What Nepal‚Äôs Customs Act Rules and Regulations refer to as ‚Äúthird countries‚Äù.

                                                        8
CISE regulation stipulated that export transactions had to be denominated in convertible
currencies, thereby excluding sales invoiced in Indian rupees, which are deemed non-
convertible by the Nepalese Central Bank.

        The CISE scheme was modified in the June 2013 budget speech (and renamed CISE
2070), partly in response to exporters‚Äô complaints about the complexity of the domestic
value-added calculation required to receive the subsidies (World Bank, 2016). This can also
help to explain the low share of eligible firms claiming the subsidy in 2012 and 2013 which
we document below. The reformed scheme made the subsidy available to firms exporting a
group of 24 industrial and 7 agricultural products that had been previously identified as
having high export potential in the 2010 Nepal Trade Integration Strategy drawn by MOCS.
The list of eligible goods and their respective subsidy rates are presented in Table 1 below.
The scheme‚Äôs budget was also increased to 300 million Nepalese rupees. Although there is a
formal annual review procedure for the list of products incentivized and their subsidy rates,
which is administered by the Department of Industry, no changes have been made to the
scheme since 2013.

        As Table 1 shows, subsidy rates in the CISE 2070 scheme are not increasing in the
share of domestic value-added incorporated in the export transaction, but are product-


                                                   9
specific instead. Nevertheless, exports of eligible products still need to incorporate at least
30% of domestic value-added to be deemed eligible. Crucially, the requirement that only
exports sold outside India are eligible to receive the incentive has remained in place.

         In terms of simplifying the regulatory burden necessary to obtain the subsidy, CISE
2070 stipulates that firms exporting agricultural products do not need a value-added
assessment to claim the subsidy. Industrial product exporters do not need to conduct new
value-added assessments to receive the subsidy once they have been approved once.6 Thus,
the 2013 reform to the CISE program lowered the subsidy rates available to the few
exporters that claimed the subsidy in 2012 by selling products with high domestic value-
added outside India. On the other hand, however, it increased the program‚Äôs budget and
simplified the administrative procedure to claim the cash incentive.

3. Theoretical Framework

We explore the implications of offering an ad-valorem subsidy granted on the basis of
export sales of a multiproduct firm in a specific product-destination combination. Our
objective is to show that when products and/or markets are not perfectly substitutable from
the perspective of the firm‚Äôs cost, then the subsidy can affect the firm‚Äôs sales across all
products and markets in which it operates.

         Consider an exporting firm that produces two goods, eligible (e) and non-eligible (n),
and in turn, can sell these in two foreign markets, India (I) and the rest of the world (R).
                                                                       ‚àíÌ†µÌºé
Suppose that demand for good k in market j is given by Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ó = Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ó , where Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ±ó is a country-
specific demand shifter (e.g. the product of a country‚Äôs income and price index when
consumers have Dixit-Stiglitz preferences), Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ó , is the price charged by the firm and Ì†µÌºé > 1 is
the elasticity of demand. Let Ì†µÌ±Ü > 1 denote the gross subsidy rate granted to firms based on
their sales of eligible products sold in the rest of the world.

         We assume that the firm‚Äôs total cost is given by Ì†µÌ∞∂(Ì†µÌ±Ñ) = Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±Ñ , where Ì†µÌ±ê > 0 and Ì†µÌ±Ñ is an
aggregator of the firm‚Äôs output sold in different markets. We assume that Ì†µÌ±Ñ is a two-tiered
CES aggregate of the form:

         Ì†µÌºÉ       Ì†µÌºÉ Ì†µÌªº‚ÅÑÌ†µÌºÉ      Ì†µÌºÉ       Ì†µÌºÉ Ì†µÌªº‚ÅÑÌ†µÌºÉ   1‚ÅÑÌ†µÌªº
Ì†µÌ±Ñ = {[Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±Ö + Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ∞º ]   + [Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±Ö + Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ∞º ] }          , Ì†µÌªº, Ì†µÌºÉ ‚â§ 1.                          (1)

 Industrial goods‚Äô exporters can use a copy of the value-added calculation sheet obtained for previous
shipments of the same product to claim the cash incentive from their respective banks.

                                                              10
            This representation of a firm‚Äôs total output allows for different degrees of
substitutability ‚Äîin terms of production costs‚Äî between the same good produced for
different markets and across different goods sold in the same destination.

            The recent literature studying multiproduct firms in the context of international
trade has drawn attention to the linkages arising in the production of different goods sold
across multiple markets (see e.g. Eckel and Neary, 2010 and Nocke and Yeaple, 2014). For
instance, pashminas to be sold in Europe could be a close substitute for Pashminas sold in
India; conversely, they could be manufactured using very different inputs and techniques,
which would render them less substitutable from the point of view of production. Similarly,
the parameter Ì†µÌªº governs the degree of substitutability across different goods produced by
the same firm (e.g. garments for men and women). Let Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ò ‚â° 1‚ÅÑ(1 ‚àí Ì†µÌªº) and Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ó ‚â° 1‚ÅÑ(1 ‚àí Ì†µÌºÉ)
denote the elasticity of substitution across products and destinations respectively. Thus,
when Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ò > Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ó, eligible and non-eligible products are more easily substitutable for a firm than
the same product tailored to customers based in different markets; in the converse
situation, the differences in cost between products are more marked than across
destinations.

            The firm‚Äôs profit maximization problem is therefore given by:

                  ‚ÅÑ      ‚ÅÑÌ†µÌºé                      ‚ÅÑ        ‚ÅÑÌ†µÌºé

{Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ó }


When Ì†µÌªº = Ì†µÌºÉ = 1, eligible and non-eligible products are perfect substitutes in production
regardless of where they are sold, and there are no complementarities across products
and/or markets from the point of view of the firm ‚Äî just as in the model proposed by
Bernard et al. (2010). In this case, it is straightforward to show that the introduction of the
subsidy Ì†µÌ±Ü lowers the price charged by the firm and increases the quantity and sales of
eligible products sold to the rest of the world without affecting the firm‚Äôs choices with
respect to other product-market combinations.

            In the more general case, the use of the subsidy targeted at one product-destination
pair affects sales of other products and other markets depending on the degree of
substitutability/complementarity across products and destinations. Since the firm always




                                                           11
chooses to produce all product-destination combinations,7 it follows that its marginal cost
has to be equalized across all varieties. Thus, once the firm increases Ì†µÌ±ûÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±Ö in response to the
subsidy granted to eligible products sold in the rest of the world, it also needs to adjust the
quantities of all other varieties as well.

           Assuming that products and destinations are equally but not perfectly substitutable
in terms of the firm‚Äôs cost (i.e. Ì†µÌªº = Ì†µÌºÉ ‚â† 1), it follows, using the first-order conditions
associated with problem (2), that the elasticity of sales of eligible products sold in the rest of
the world relative to sales of eligible products in India and relative to the sales of non-
eligible products in the rest of the world are equal, and given by:

           Ì†µÌ±ë ln(Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±Ö ‚ÅÑÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ∞º )       Ì†µÌ±ë ln(Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±Ö ‚ÅÑÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±Ö )        Ì†µÌºé‚àí1
                                    =                            = 1‚àíÌ†µÌºé(1‚àíÌ†µÌªº).                       (3)
                 Ì†µÌ±ë ln Ì†µÌ±Ü                     Ì†µÌ±ë ln Ì†µÌ±Ü


           Thus, if products/markets are substitutable from the perspective of a firm‚Äôs cost (i.e.
when both Ì†µÌªº and Ì†µÌºÉ are positive), an export subsidy granted to the sales of eligible products
to the rest of the world will increase the sales of this product relative to those of the same
product in India and also relative to those of non-eligible products in the rest of the world.
The opposite result would obtain if products are complements in the firm‚Äôs cost.

           It also follows that if operating in foreign markets is costly, e.g. due to the existence
of fixed costs related to market-access, providing a cash subsidy based on sales of eligible
products shipped to the rest of the world can also affect a firm‚Äôs decision to export products
to markets that are not directly targeted by the subsidy. We will explore this possibility in
our empirical assessment of the CISE subsidy program in Section 5.

           Our main message in this section is that it is important to consider how the sales,
quantities and prices of beneficiary firms change in response to the subsidy across product-
market combinations other than the ones directly targeted in order to evaluate the effect of
the CISE subsidy program on firm-level export outcomes.

Department of Customs. The data contain the universe of international trade transactions

reporting at least one positive export transaction in at least one of 1,762 HS-6 digit products
sold to/bought from 177 countries.

           Table 2 provides several descriptive statistics on exporting firms for the years 2011-
2014. The number of active exporters remains quite stable throughout our sample period,
ranging between 1,300 and 1,400 firms each year. This figure is relatively high in comparison
with other developing countries of similar size and income level reported in Fernandes et al.
(2016).8 Both the average and median size export transactions are in line with those
observed in countries at a similar stage of development.

           Table 3 provides a first view of Nepal‚Äôs total exports throughout our period of
analysis according to whether products are listed as eligible to receive the subsidy based on
the CISE 2070 guidelines and the destination of export flows. It is important to note that
although the CISE scheme was initially not restricted to a specific set of products; all the
firms that received subsidies in 2012 obtained these for exporting goods included in the
product list introduced in 2013. Therefore, we retain the ‚Äòeligible product‚Äô category for the
years 2011 and 2012 in order to facilitate the comparison of export figures across time.

           The table highlights several stylized facts characterizing Nepal‚Äôs aggregate exports.
Firstly, the importance of India as a trading partner is remarkable. In 2011, sales to India
accounted for a remarkable 66.7% (= 15.4% + 51.3%) of the value of total exports, 77% (=
51.3%/66.7%) of which were in products not eligible to benefit from the CISE program. Over
the following three years, however, there is a considerable fall in India‚Äôs imp ortance as an

export destination; its share of Nepal‚Äôs total exports fell by 3.8 percentage points (= 66.7% -
62.9%), with the share of eligible products experiencing a larger decline than that of non-
eligible ones. Table 3 also shows that the set of products targeted to receive subsidies under
the CISE scheme are quite important in Nepal‚Äôs export basket. They account for
approximately 40% of aggregate exports, and are significantly less dependent on the Indian
market than non-eligible products.9

        Next we provide information on the size of export subsidies granted to firms
participating in the CISE scheme. Table 4 shows that based on the products they sold in
countries other than India, approximately two-thirds of Nepalese exporters were eligible to
receive subsidies. It is important to emphasize that this figure constitutes an upper bound,
since exporters are also required to incorporate at least 30% of domestic value-added in
order to be eligible to claim the CISE cash incentive.

  The most important export destinations for Nepalese firms besides India during our period of study are, in
terms of total export values, the US, Germany, Bangladesh, China, UK, Turkey, France, Japan and Singapore.
Interestingly, a relatively larger number of firms (between 200 and 600) export to developed countries,
whereas developing countries such as Bangladesh, China or Turkey were served by substantially fewer firms
(20 to 40 on average).

                                                      14
       The data on the total amount of subsidies disbursed, which were provided by Nepal
Rastra Bank, show that in 2012 approximately half of the stated budget allocated to the
scheme was disbursed to only 28 firms. Over the next two years, however, both subsidy
outlays and the number of exporters receiving the incentives increased dramatically. Total
expenditure on subsidies more than doubled from 1.57 million to 3.81 million US dollars,
while at the same time the number of exporters receiving subsidies increased fivefold ‚Äî
from 28 to 151‚Äî reaching 16.4% of eligible exporters in 2014. Figure 2 shows that the
dispersion in the amount of subsidies received per firm has also increased over time.

       We now move to investigate cross-sectional sectoral patterns of export outcomes,
i.e. number of exporters, number of destinations served and share of exports sold to India
as well as subsidy disbursements across Nepal‚Äôs main export sectors. Table 5 shows that in
contrast to the high level of concentration in terms of the number of foreign markets
served, Nepalese exports are relatively well diversified across products, with no single HS 2-
digit sector accounting for more than 10% of total exports. The table also shows that there
is a strong negative correlation between the share of export value of eligible products and
the share of exports sold to India across sectors.

                     Table 5 also shows that the disbursement of subsides has been highly concentrated
           among a few products ‚Äî namely carpets, man-made fibers, edible vegetables, apparel and
           hides and skins. These sectors account for 88% of subsidy outlays between 2012 and 2014,
           with one-third of eligible firms exporting these products receiving subsidies on average.

           Which firms are more likely to receive the subsidy? To provide a better sense of the firm-
           level determinants of receiving a cash subsidy under the CISE scheme, we estimate the
           following Probit model using data pooled at the firm-year level for the period 2012-2014, for
           the group of firms that are eligible to claim subsidies, i.e. firms carrying out at least one
           export transaction of an eligible product sold in a destination other than India in a given
           year:

                                                                        Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±ä                    Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±îÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±í

where the dependent variable, Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° , takes the value 1 if firm i receives the CISE cash incentive
in year t and 0 otherwise. Table 6 reports the marginal effects evaluated at the mean based
on estimating regression (4). Column (1) shows that larger firms, in terms of having higher
export sales (Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ), are more likely to receive the CISE subsidy. Doubling the value of a
firm‚Äôs total exports is associated with a 3 percentage point higher probability of obtaining
the cash subsidy. The share of a firm‚Äôs exports destined to countries other than India,

Ì†µÌ±Ü‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°                 , both have a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of receiving the
CISE subsidy. These results suggest that the incentives have been granted to relatively large
exporters specialized in eligible goods and that had experience operating outside India.10
Conversely, the share of domestic value-added incorporated into a firm‚Äôs exports, proxied
                          Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ‚àíÌ†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°
by the ratio (                                                     ) does not play a significant role in determining if a firm
                                    Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°

obtains the cash incentive. It is important to note, however, that our measure of domestic
content is highly imperfect because it does not take into account the imported component
embodied in materials purchased domestically, and can also be subject to measurement
error, particularly for multi-product exporters.

           Column (2) explores whether the reform to the CISE scheme in 2013 induced any
noticeable changes in the probability of receiving subsidies. Consistent with the evidence
presented in Table 4 above, exporters were significantly more likely to receive subsidies
after 2013, although the main messages conveyed by column (1) still hold. Firm size and
exporting eligible products to third countries are the strongest determinants of the
probability of benefitting from the CISE subsidy scheme.

  We also investigate other determinants of the probability of receiving the subsidy such as the number of
destinations to which a firm exports and the number of products exported. More precisely, the variable
log(number of export destinations+1) has a positive and significant impact while the log(number of HS 6-digit
products exported+1) comes up negative and significant. These results are robust and hold across all
specifications. Our interpretation of these results is that firms are more likely to obtain the subsidy if they have
a significant foreign presence but also when they tend to focus on exporting a narrow range of eligible
products.

           We now investigate whether having been successful in obtaining export subsidies in
 the previous year influences the contemporaneous probability of receiving subsidies. One of
 the key innovations introduced in the 2013 reform of the CISE scheme was that exporters
 that had already obtained a domestic value-added assessment for a previous export
 shipment could use the same documentation to claim the subsidy in the future without
 having to apply for a new evaluation ‚Äîa change that sought to lower the administrative
 costs associated with claiming the incentive. An alternative hypothesis, of course, is that
 firms with stronger political connections are also more likely to repeatedly receive the
 incentives, as suggested by Nogu√©s (1989) and Helmers and Trofimenko (2013). The results
 presented in columns (3)-(5) of Table 6 highlight the crucial role played by firms‚Äô past
 experience with successfully claiming incentives in explaining their current propensity to
 receive subsidies. Firms that obtained subsidies in the previous year have an 8-9 percentage
 point higher probability of receiving subsidies in a given year relative to firms that had not
 received the incentive before. Firms that satisfied the requirement of exporting an eligible
 product outside India in the previous year are also substantially more likely to obtain
 subsidies in the current year, while having exported in the previous year does not enter

                                                          18
significantly. Reassuringly, the magnitude of the effect of current level of exports, the share
of eligible exports and the share of exports sold in the rest of the world on the probability of
being subsidized remains largely unchanged relative to that reported in columns (1) and (2).

Which products were chosen to receive incentives? We now investigate the product-level
characteristics driving the choice of which goods were chosen to be eligible to receive
subsidies under the CISE 2070 program. To do so, we aggregate our data at the HS 6-digit
product-year level and estimate a Probit model in which the dependent variable takes the
value 1 if a given product was included in the 2013 list of CISE 2070 eligible products. Table
7 presents the marginal effects evaluated at the mean for this regression.

       Consistent with the evidence presented in Tables 3 and 5 above, the share of exports
sold outside India is a very strong predictor of a product‚Äôs eligibility status. As column (3)
reveals, the share of export transactions that incorporate at least 30% of domestic value-
added also affects the likelihood of a product being selected in the CISE scheme. These
results suggest that the set of products chosen to be subsidized was not random. The move
towards using product-targeted subsidies in 2013 shows the Nepalese government‚Äôs
commitment to promote products on the basis of its 2010 Trade Integration Strategy.
Nevertheless, following this approach could hinder the CISE scheme‚Äôs objective of increasing
export diversification given that a majority of firms producing eligible goods were selling
those in third countries even before the subsidy was enacted.

                In column (4), we introduce some additional explanatory variables such as product-
       level Herfindahl indices for exports ‚Äîsince higher concentration could facilitate firms‚Äô
       coordination to lobby for subsidies, as suggested by Caves (1976) and Grossman and
       Helpman (1994)‚Äî as well as physical and human capital intensities, with the view that these
       characteristics can capture the potential for domestic value addition.11 Introducing these
       additional variables has a very limited impact in our results. In column (5), we re-estimate
       the Probit model after dropping all eligible transactions for firms that actually received
       subsidies, with the view that the policy could have impacted the share of firms exporting to
       third countries or the share of firms with domestic value-added above 30%. Once again, the
       results remain very similar. Lastly, we re-estimate the model using only data for 2011, since
       due to its late implementation, there were no subsidy disbursements associated with the
       CISE scheme during fiscal year 2010/11. These results are presented in column (6). In this
       specification, only the share of transactions exported outside India remains a significant
       determinant of product eligibility.

5. Effectiveness of the CISE Subsidy Program on Export Outcomes

We now move to evaluate whether obtaining cash incentives under the CISE scheme
affected firm-level export outcomes for firms that received the treatment. We consider the
effect of the policy intervention on firm-level export sales, quantities, prices and their
growth rates, as well as on the number of HS 6-digit products exported and the number of
destination countries served. As noted in the theoretical motivation section above, it is
possible that providing incentives to firms selling their output in a specific product-market
pair would also affect exports of other product-market combinations if these different
‚Äòvarieties‚Äô are not perfect substitutes from the point of view of the firms‚Äô costs. Therefore,
our estimating equation ‚Äîspecified below‚Äî will take into consideration these effects when
we evaluate the impact of the subsidy program on export outcomes.

           In order to assess the effect of the CISE subsidy program, we first aggregate our data
at the firm-product category (i.e. products eligible and non-eligible to receive subsidies)-
destination (i.e. India and the rest of the world) level. Letting Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° denote the export
outcome of interest for firm i producing product p sold in destination market d at year t, we
formulate the following regression model:

Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªΩ1 [Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ‚àô Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ù ‚àô Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ë ] + Ì†µÌªΩ2 [Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ‚àô Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ù ‚àô (1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ë )] + Ì†µÌªΩ3 [Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ‚àô (1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ù ) ‚àô Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ë ] +
Ì†µÌªΩ4 [Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ‚àô (1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ù ) ‚àô (1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ë )] + Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë + Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±° ,                                                 (5)

where Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ù is a dummy variable taking the value 1 for eligible products (i.e. those listed in
Table 2) and 0 otherwise; Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±äÌ†µÌ±ë is a dummy variable taking the value 1 for export sales
destined to countries other than India and 0 otherwise; and Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° is defined in the same way
as in the Probit regressions reported in the previous section, taking the value 1 if firm i
receives subsidies in year t and 0 otherwise. Regression (5) includes two sets of fixed effects:
firm-product category-destination ( Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë ) and year-product category-destination-specific
fixed effects (Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë ). The inclusion of the first set of fixed effects means that our regression
compares firms selling the same product category (eligible or non-eligible) to the same
broad destination (India or elsewhere) before and after they receive the subsidy. The year-
product category-destination fixed effects seek to control for aggregate factors that have
affected Nepalese exports of each of our four product category-destination combinations.
The estimated coefficients Ì†µÌªΩ1- Ì†µÌªΩ4 capture the possibility that receiving the CISE subsidy


                                                                   21
 might affect firms‚Äô exports of product-destination combinations other than that of eligible
 products sold outside of India, which is the main objective of the program.

           Table 8 presents the results of estimating regression (5). The main message provided
 by our results is that there are no significantly positive effects associated with the CISE
 program on the level of export values, quantities or prices (columns 1-3) nor in terms of the
 respective growth rates of these variables (columns 4-6). Since the construction of the
 dependent variable used in the regressions reported in columns (4)-(6) requires information
 for two consecutive years, the estimates are based on data for the period 2012-2014. Our
 results remain unchanged when we estimate regression (5) using more disaggregated data,
 i.e. defining products at the HS-6 level instead of just eligible and non-eligible and using all
 destination countries instead of India and the rest of the world. These estimates are
 reported in Table A.1 in the appendix.

           In Table 9 we re-estimate equation (5) using as dependent variables the number
 (both in levels and logs) of HS 6-digit product and destinations (again, defined as India and
 the rest of the world) combinations served by a firm (columns 1 and 2) as well as the
 number of HS-6 products sold in a given destination (columns 3 and 4) and the number of

destinations served for a given product category (columns 5 and 6).12 This specification
shows that the CISE subsidy increased the number of eligible products sold and destinations
served by firms that received the subsidy. This result suggests that the CISE scheme has
increased measures of export diversification at the firm-level. We do not find that the
number of products sold among or the number of markets reached increased among non-
eligible products.

Within-firm reallocation. In our last regression we investigate whether receiving the CISE
subsidy induced recipient firms to reallocate their exports towards eligible products sold
outside India. To this end, we aggregate our data at the firm-year level, and estimate the
following regression:
              Ì†µÌ∞∏,Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±ä
Ì†µÌ±Ü‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±í(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°        ) = Ì†µÌªΩ1 Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° .                                                 (6)

in terms of export value (column 1), number of exported products (column 2) and number
of destination markets (column 3). The inclusion of firm and time fixed effects results in the

  Since there is only one destination available when selling to India, this means that the Subsidy √ó Eligible √ó
India and Subsidy √ó Non-eligible √ó India variables are dropped from the regression. Note that the coefficients
associated with these two regressors are identical in columns (1) and (3) and (2) and (4) respectively. This is
due to the fact that for India the number of product-destination pairs sold by a firm is exactly identical to the
number of products sold in India.

                                                                      23
identification arising from within-firm variation over time in the exposure to the subsidy.
The results, presented in Table 10, show that firms that received the CISE subsidy did not
significantly tilt the composition of their exports towards eligible products sold outside
India.

6. Conclusions

Nepal‚Äôs exports have chronically been extremely narrow, both in terms of the number of
products and destination markets, with sales to India consistently accounting for close to
70% of aggregate exports. In an effort to alleviate the lack of product and geographic
diversification of its exports as well as an expanding trade deficit, the Government of Nepal
introduced in 2010 a Cash Incentive Scheme for Exports that provides cash subsidies to
firms exporting products with high local content to countries other than India. In this paper
we use transaction-level data combined with information on the cash payments disbursed
to firms by the Nepalese Central Bank over the period 2012-2014 to assess the extent to
which this export subsidy program has achieved its objectives so far.

         Our results show that the products chosen to be eligible to receive cash subsidies
were primarily those that were sold outside India and that incorporated more than 30% of
domestic value-added to begin with. From the firm‚Äôs perspective, firms that received cash
incentives, were relatively large ones (in terms of their export sales) for which sales of
eligible products outside India constituted a higher share of their total exports. We also find
a high degree of persistence in firms‚Äô success in receiving subsidies. This could be due to the
fact that the rules of the subsidy scheme allowed firms to skip redoing domestic value-
added assessments for new export transactions, thereby making them more likely to apply

                                                   24
for the incentives; or because the firms that receive subsidies are simply larger and have
better political connections. All in all, it appears as if the product and destination
requirements imposed by the CISE scheme were, to a large extent, not binding. The firms
receiving subsidies did not have to radically change their product mix or destination markets
they sold to; conversely, firms that were producing non-eligible goods or that sold mostly in
India probably did not find the incentives generous enough to alter their export behavior.
This diagnostic is clear when we investigate whether firms receiving subsidies changed their
export sales, quantities, prices or growth rates in response to receiving the incentives. We
do not find any significant effect of the CISE scheme in increasing exports of firms of eligible
products to the rest of the world. We also do not find evidence of within-firm reallocation of
export sales across products/destinations based on the requirements imposed by the CISE
program.

       Although we do not attempt to answer the normative question of whether a cash
subsidy to exports of a select group of products to countries other than India is the optimal
policy instrument to increase Nepal‚Äôs diversification of its export basket (or whether this
intermediate objective results in higher aggregate welfare), our results suggest that the
imposition of product and destination-specific requirements on the CISE subsidy has
reduced the effectiveness of the subsidy in boosting firm-level export outcomes. This is the
case because the requirements already select firms that were already doing what the policy
intended to achieve ‚Äîselling high value-added products outside India‚Äî and also because
the use of requirements increases the administrative burden involved in claiming the
incentives.

   Appendix
   Table A.1 reports the results of re-estimating the regressions reported in Table 8 in the text after
   aggregating the data at the firm-HS 6-digit product and destination (individual country) level. The
   results remain are largely unchanged. The only difference is that under the new aggregation, we find
   that firms that received the subsidy marginally increased the price they charged on shipments of
   eligible products destined to India.

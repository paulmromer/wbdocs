Executive Summary
Since 2004, Madagascar has been granting mini-grid concessions to private operators to
electrify rural areas. Around 30 private operators have rural concessions or authorizations
and maintain mini-grids providing electricity coverage to around 200 villages. As of 2015,
they are estimated to maintain connections to around 7,000 households, down from a high
of around 9,000 household connections in 2012. However, the electrification rate in
Madagascar is still very low. The rural electrification agency estimated in 2014 that the
national electrification rate was 15.02 percent and that the rural electrification rate was 5.21
percent. These figures have changed little in the last 10 years.
History: In 1998 Madagascar passed an electricity reform law setting out to privatize the
sector. The government’s main goal was to mend the national utility (JIRAMA). The law
unbundled the industry and allowed competition in electricity supply by using a
“concession? approach. While the JIRAMA reforms were unsuccessful, a rural electrification
agency began operations in 2004. Several private operators took the opportunity to apply for
subsidies to build small mini-grids, mostly powered by diesel-fired generators. The new rural
electrification agency also tried, unsuccessfully at first, to run public tender processes to
select concessionaires for designated areas.
Mini-Grid Concessions: Forty-seven private operators obtained rural concessions or
authorizations. As of September 2015, around 30 of the 47 authorized private operators still
exist. Most of the 200 or so mini-grids they operate range in size from 100 to 1,000
connections, supplied by generators with capacities of 40 kW to 200 kW (sometimes higher).
The majority of the private operators obtained their authorization contracts based on the
“spontaneous offer? approach to the rural electrification agency (ADER) allowed under the
law. These offers must include a workable business plan and the agreement of the
community in question.
Larger projects, with generators or peak demand above 500 kW, need to obtain a concession
contract through a competitive public tender process.
In all cases, private operators may be eligible to receive a subsidy of up to 70 percent of the
value of the capital investment. The private operators obtain the exclusive right to distribute
electricity in a given area. The state-owned utility JIRAMA, has also developed rural
concessions using mini-grids and grid extension.
Reasons for Results: The Malagasy Government hoped to connect over 80,000 households
using rural concessions. This goal has not materialized for several reasons.
        First, the widespread reliance on diesel-fired generators. The costs of operating
         and maintaining these power plants have gone up as diesel subsidies have been
         removed. Private operators reported that the tariffs needed to recover fuel costs
         were above consumers’ willingness to pay.
        Secondly, the cross-subsidy intended to finance rural projects has not been fully
         disbursed to rural private operators as promised. The rural electrification fund has
         instead in part been used to financially support the national utility, JIRAMA.
        Thirdly, reforming JIRAMA has consumed the attention of policy makers since
         1998. A failed privatization process in the early 2000s was followed by a


                                               i
          management contract between 2005 and 2007 that ended acrimoniously. JIRAMA
          remains state-owned and is in poor financial condition.
New Directions: Going forward, the Malagasy government plans to develop larger ‘area-
based’ concessions, based on more capital-intensive but sustainable generation projects,
especially hydro and biomass. The hope is to grow the size of the average project in order to
achieve economies of scale. The rural electrification agency has published regional master
plans for half of the country’s provinces, and intends to hold public tenders for the right to
supply electricity to areas with between 10,000 and 30,000 households.
Key Lessons: The Malagasy concessions illustrate several lessons for governments
considering using a concession approach to rural electrification:
        The success of rural electrification efforts is closely tied to the performance
         of the rest of the sector. JIRAMA has had recurring problems since the
         electricity reforms started in 1998. These problems have absorbed both the
         attention of Malagasy policy-makers and the available funding, at the expense of
         rural projects. Making the urban-focused electricity sector viable helps make the
         rural electricity sector viable.
        Diesel-powered mini-grids can work but require ongoing subsidies when
         incomes are very low. This case study shows that small diesel-powered mini-
         grids can sustain themselves and be rapidly deployed. However they are at risk of
         shocks from changes in the price of diesel, and may need ongoing subsidies.
        In rural areas, customers can pay very high tariffs, but demand is elastic.
         Madagascar’s rural electricity consumers are paying $5-$15 per month at effective
         tariffs around US$0.40/kWh to US$0.70/kWh. However, demand is elastic and
         Madagascar’s experience has shown that there is a tipping point where customers
         will disconnect if prices go too high. The concessionaires we interviewed all cited
         number of customers and quantity demanded as the key factor in their tariff-
         setting decisions, rather than regulatory or contractual obligations.

1      Introduction
Starting in 2004, the Government of Madagascar authorized private parties to build and
operate mini-grids around the country through the use of concession agreements. The
purpose of this report is to review Madagascar’s experience with these concessions. This case
study is one of six detailed case studies that form a body of evidence on the experience and
successes of rural electrification concessions across sub-Saharan Africa.
Background on the Madagascar power system is presented in Section 2. The mini-grid
concession model, as implemented in Madagascar, is reviewed in detail in Section 3. The
report concludes with an assessment of the success of these concessions, in Section 4.
Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C include profiles of three concessionaires currently
operating rural electrification concessions in Madagascar. Appendix D has a list of
Madagascar’s rural concessionaires, and their location on a map. Appendix E shows the rural
concessionaires that are operational, by year, since the year 2000.

Economy and demographics
Madagascar is a country of 23.6 million people. GDP per capita is low at US$449 and growth
in GDP per capita has been slow between 2004 and 2014, at roughly 0.24 percent per year. A
large share of the population, 65.53 percent, lives in rural areas, where population growth is
1.98 percent per year.

Politics and governance
Madagascar is a former French colony which gained independence in 1960. The pro-French
Social Democratic Party of Madagascar (SDP) ruled under Mr. Philibert Tsiranana until
1972. Amid opposition protests, power was handed to the army and a provisional
government was formed. Following a period of martial law, a new constitution was ratified
in 1975, ushering in a Marxist one-party state under the leadership of President Didier
Ratsiraka.1 Ratsiraka cut ties with France and nationalized large parts of the economy.2 In the
late 1980s, in an effort to deflect political opposition and to curb government debt,
Madagascar promoted market-based reforms. Infrastructure policy in Madagascar since the
1980s has been strongly influenced by agreements reached with the IMF and World Bank.
A new 1992 constitution created the conditions for multi-party elections in 1993. Today,
Madagascar is a multi-party democracy. Since 1993, the country has experienced occasional
period of political turmoil, marked by: an impeachment of the President in 1996, opposition
boycotts of national elections, general strikes and mass protests in 2001, and the overthrow
of the Government in 2009 by opposition protesters.3 In the time that the concessions have
been in place, the security and humanitarian situation has been mixed. Madagascar is on the
World Bank’s 2015 list of fragile or conflict-affected states.4
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index ranks Madagascar at 133 out of
175 on a ranking of how corrupt a country’s public sector is perceived to be. The legal
system is based on civil law and the administrative tradition is French.

The Ministère de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures (Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons) is
the Government entity responsible for electricity sector policies, strategy and planning. 5
Under the Ministry are two administrative entities with responsibilities for the electricity
sector:
           1. Agence de Développement Rural (ADER–the rural development agency), created
              in 2002 by decree 2002-1550. ADER has primary responsibility for increasing the
              electricity access rate, especially in rural and peri-urban areas with no access to
              electricity or with installations with capacity under 250kW. ADER manages a rural
              electrification fund, Fonds National de l’Electricité (FNE). FNE is financed by a
              universal access levy on JIRAMA consumers, direct transfers from the Ministry of
              Finance, and donors.6
           2. The Organisme Régulateur du Secteur de l’Electricité (ORE–the electricity sector
              regulator), created in 1998 by law 98-032. ORE is responsible for: i. Setting tariffs;
              ii. Monitoring of technical standards; and iii. Ensuring competition in the sector.
The stated-owned water and electricity utility, Jiro Sy Rano Malagasy (JIRAMA), is a
vertically-integrated company focused mostly on urban areas of Madagascar.

interconnected networks of Antananarivo and Fiananrantsoa. Five other population centers
are served by large independent grids operated by JIRAMA. The 87 remaining population
centers are served by small and medium-sized grids. Thirty of the population centers are
considered to be in rural areas and have an installed generation capacity of less than 250kW
each. JIRAMA’s total installed capacity is 484MW.7
Donors and international partners active in rural electrification in Madagascar include: GIZ;
the World Bank; the EU; the Governments of Holland, Spain and Switzerland; the Global
Environment Facility (GEF); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO); and the United Nations Development Program.8
The World Bank reported that the rural electrification rate in the country was officially 8.1
percent in 2012. This estimate differs from ADER’s, which calculated a rural electrification
rate of 4.77 percent in 2012. The World Bank’s estimates for the electrification rate changes
over time in Madagascar are presented in Figure 2.3.

2.2        Rural Electrification Approach
The concession approach to rural electrification in Madagascar originates in the 1998 Law to
Reform the Electricity Sector (Law 98-032).9 Law 98-032 opened the electricity sector to the
private sector by allowing new actors to supply electricity. In rural areas, the Law signified a
change to an approach of entrepreneur-driven rural electrification. The Law created a
threshold above which a concession contract – a “contrat de concession? – would need to
be signed with the Government. Below this threshold, an authorization contract – a “contrat
d’autorisation? – needs to be signed with the Government. The threshold is:
            Hydroelectric power plants—above 150kW
            Thermal power plants—above 500kW
            Distribution networks—peak demand above 500kW.
In this case study, we will use the word “concession? to refer to both concessions and
authorizations.
The intent of the threshold in the Law was to ensure that there is a competitive tender
process for larger projects, but that the smallest projects could be built more quickly. The
hope was that the competitive process would be the preferred way of implementing new
electricity projects.

In 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Mines created a rural electrification agency, ADER
(Agence de Développement de l’Electrification Rurale).10 ADER became operational in
2004.11 The first concession agreement with a private operator was signed shortly thereafter.
Madagascar’s rural private operators sign concession or authorization contracts to obtain the
exclusive right to build and operate a distribution network (the right to build and exploit a
generation plant is not usually an exclusive right – another developer could build a power
plant in the service area if the electricity is sold to the JIRAMA grid through a power-
purchase agreement (PPA)). The duration of the contract is usually for 15 to 30 years. In
return, the private operators are obligated to:
             Provide permanent and regular operations
             Provide equality of access and service to subscribers
             Sign contracts with its clients and abide by them
             Maintain their installations and keep them up to standards
             Contract with any person in its service area that wishes to subscribe or renew a
              subscription.12
The Ministry of Energy also set up a rural electrification fund, Fonds National d’Electricité
(FNE) in 2005. FNE was designed to channel subsidies to rural electrification programs.13
The FNE was intended to be funded by donors and by a “contribution spéciale?, a universal
access contribution levied on all ratepayers except those paying the lifeline tariff.14 That levy
was added to JIRAMA customer bills in 2005.
However, in practice, the FNE was never implemented as a separate entity and is as of 2015
effectively an accounting entry under the control of the Ministry of Finance.15 JIRAMA
collects the universal access contribution on each kWh, but is late and slow to transfer the
funds to the FNE.16 Some, but not all, of the contribution is passed on ADER to fund
subsidies it has agreed to provide to rural developers.
Current Approach
ADER is now starting to put out bids for larger areas using an area-based approach to
concession. The objective of the new area-based approach is to increase the potential project
size in order to achieve economies of scale and attract more private sector interest. ADER is

supported in this effort by some donors and international financiers including KFW, the EU,
GEF, UNDP, and the World Bank. ADER believes that private operators are more
interested in larger concession areas than the smaller village-level projects that have been
most common since 2004.17 They also believe that the larger areas will be more viable,
particularly because renewable generation sources can be harnessed to serve multiple villages
using a single network.
As of 2015, ADER has started implementing this new approach to rural electrification
concessions. For example, ADER recently put out a RFP for an area containing four
administrative regions composed of 138 villages with 30,000 customers. This area has a
population of around 200,000 inhabitants. Another tender for an area with around 10,000
customers is in the process of being issued.
There is no central register for new electrification projects. Therefore there have been
conflicts at certain attractive hydroelectricity sites between planned rural vertically-integrated
mini-grid projects and planned generation-only projects. The processes to obtain a
concession for a small hydro rural mini-grid are different than the processes to obtain a
concession for a hydroelectric plant that would connect to the main grid.18
Madagascar is currently developing a law on PPPs in response to a lack of legal definition of
the roles, obligations and rights of private partners.19 This law is expected to impact
Madagascar’s concessions processes and energy policies.

3          Madagascar’s Rural Electrification Concessions
After the creation of ADER in 2004, many small entrepreneurs applied for and obtained
authorizations to build mini-grids. Madagascar’s rural electrification concessions are operated
either by local private entrepreneurs or by JIRAMA.

ADER has approved 153 projects as of June 2015. 65 of these projects were put out to bid
using competitive procurements. The remaining 88 were spontaneous concessions where a

As of September 2015 there are around 30 private operators still active in Madagascar.21
There have been around 47 private operators, but several have gone out of business or left
the industry. Most of the concessions that are no longer operational used diesel-fired
generators and had difficulty dealing with fuel input price changes.22
Most of the operators are locally owned, but there are two or three foreign companies
operating as well. All the concessions are small village-level concessions, with operators
bidding to electrify one, two or three villages. However, some of these concessions have
grown out of their service areas. There are therefore now 208 electrified villages.23 The
largest concessionaires, such as CASIELEC, serve around 3,000 people.
We interviewed three of the concessionaires. Short case studies documenting their
operations and experience can be found at the back of this document:
           BETC (Appendix A)
           CASIELEC (Appendix B)
           HIER (Appendix C)
Fuel
Unable to cover the cost of their operations, several mini-grid operators abandoned their
installations and exited the industry. Most of the small entrepreneurs who obtained
authorizations to build mini-grids in 2004 used diesel-powered generators. At the time, a 50
percent diesel fuel cost subsidy existed for rural generators. Around 2012, under pressure
from the IMF, Madagascar’s diesel fuel subsidies were ended.24 To cope with rising costs of
operations, private operators raised their tariffs. However, the tariffs went above consumers’
willingness to pay, and the concessions lost customers.
3.1         Key Objectives, Challenges and Risks
Madagascar’s approach to rural electrification by concessions was a small part of a larger
effort to liberalize the power sector and to ensure stability of electricity supply in the
country. The stated objectives of Law 98-032 were to:
             End JIRAMA’s monopoly
             Stabilize the electricity supply
             Tap private sources of finance to invest in electric infrastructure
             Improve sector efficiency and quality of service.
Reforming JIRAMA created delays for the implementation of the new approach to rural
electrification.25 A World Bank project focused on rural electrification aimed to a) prepare a

rural electrification master plan, and b) invest in electrification schemes. However, after the
completion of the master plan in the 2001, it took several years to set up ADER and FEN,
which became operational in 2004 and to finally deploy funds towards rural electrification
projects in mid-2004. This delay was partly due to a decision to create a rural electrification
agency, rather than to implement rural electrification projects in a separate cell within the
Ministry of Energy, but it was also due to JIRAMA absorbing the attention of government
decision-makers.26
3.2        Stages of Development
A timeline showing the major stages of development leading up to the concession, focusing
on the 1999 to 2008 period, is presented in Figure 3.1.

3.3        Operations and Management
The concessionaires are fully responsible for the operations and maintenance of their
equipment and facilities. All rural electrification concessions not run by JIRAMA are
vertically-integrated mini-grids that include generation and distribution, as well as marketing
and commercial operations.
The concessionaires we interviewed (BETC, CASIELEC, HIER) manage several generation
plants and small distribution networks:
          BETC runs four generation plants and four isolated distribution networks that
           altogether connect over 700 customers. Power is supplied by two hydro power plants
           of 70kW and 200kW respectively, a diesel plant of 150kW and a biomass plant of
           70kW.

       HIER operates three hydro power plants of 70kW, 100kW and 500kW respectively.
        The distribution assets connect over 1,350 customers.
       CASIELEC owns and operates 14 diesel power plants, one biomass power plant
        (rice husk) and one dual fuel power plant, as well as distribution networks connecting
        a total of 2,913 customers. Some of CASIELEC’s generation and distribution assets
        are pictured in Figure 3.2.

The concessionaires also sign up customers, connect them to the village network, and
manage meters, billing and collection. The metering is usually postpaid. Some
concessionaires, including HIER, decided to invest in prepaid meters after noticing that 37
percent of the electricity consumed was not registering on their meters due to illegal
connections or deliberate tampering of meters.
The extent to which international companies have been involved in operations and
management has until now been relatively limited. However, CASIELEC recently raised
additional capital by issuing shares to Indian investors. These investors also helped
CASIELEC procure Indian electricity equipment.
The concessionaires are skilled and appear to have high quality management, but are lacking
in resources. The majority of operators are local entrepreneurs. Two of the operators we
interviewed are local Malagasy (Mr. Paul Rakotondralambo from BETC and Mr. Ranaivo
Casimir from CASIELEC) and one of the operators is a French expatriate (Mr. Andre Fillet



                                              13
from HIER). All three had relatively long careers in the Malagasy electricity sector prior to
launching their operations, and appeared very capable:
        Mr. Rakotondralambo (BETC) had a 25 year career at JIRAMA before starting his
         business
        Mr. Fillet (HIER) developed for Hydelec SA, an Independent Power Producer
         (IPP) that sold power to JIRAMA, before entering the rural electrification
         business
        Mr. Casimir (CASIELEC) had a 15 year career at JIRAMA, and worked briefly at
         the rural electrification agency ADER, before leaving to start CASIELEC
BETC, CASIELEC, and HIER experienced similar operational and commercial challenges.
Table 3.3: Common Challenges of Malagasy Concessionaires
          Marketing                   Financing
           Low income levels          Subsidies from ADER not paid when promised
           Limited number of          Lack of funds to repair damaged equipment like
             customers                   transformers
           Low population             Limited financial capacity to invest in extension
             density                     of the grid
          Exogenous                   Commercial
           Diesel price volatility    Unpaid bills averaging around 15 percent of
                                         total revenue


Some concessionaires have experienced greater operational challenges than expected. The
projected demand in certain areas was exaggerated. For example, HIER was given demand
studies by ADER that were performed by outside consultants. These forecasts were over-
optimistic about the number of potential customers in the areas. HIER and other
concessionaires’ customers spend around 15 percent of their monthly income on electricity.
This indicates the value of electricity to rural consumers, as well as challenges of running a
business in such low income areas.
3.4    Financing Arrangements
The private operator is responsible for providing financing for the investment required to
build the new installations. ADER can provide subsidies of up to 70 percent of the capital
expenditure on the installations. The private operator is then entirely responsible for
financing the operations and maintenance. There are no tariff subsidies provided to
consumers or to operators for the O&M.
In practice, the commercial financing comes from personal investment, friends or local
investors. In some rare case, donors or international investors provided financing. Banks
provide very little or no financing.
The capital investment subsidy is supposed to be funded by the rural electrification fund, the
FNE. The FNE, in turn, is supposed to be funded by a special levy on JIRAMA ratepayers.
Additional funding is supposed to come from the Malagasy Government and from donors.
However, since 2009, the country has experienced a crisis in the electricity sector that has



                                                14
impoverished the FNE. This has consequently weakened all national electrification planning
and implementation efforts.27
JIRAMA has not paid its total amount due to FNE. As a result, ADER has not been able to
honor its obligations to smaller private operators. Some subsidies have been disbursed to
private operators, but many private operators are still awaiting contractually agreed subsidies.
For example:
             BETC: ADER promised to finance 70 percent of the capital investment, but
              BETC only received 60 percent of the capital investment
             HIER: ADER promised to finance 75 percent of the capital investment.
              However, HIER was only reimbursed for 55 percent of the capital investment
             CASIELEC: ADER promised to finance 70 percent of the investment but
              CASIELEC has only received 60 percent so far.
Some donors are filling in the financing gap. The EU is financing 75% of BETC’s Jiro Kanto
hydro project (See Appendix A). BETC is looking for other donors and financing sources
for the remaining 25%. ADER is not contributing any financing for that project.
New connections are paid partly by the concessionaire and partly by the customer. The
extent to which this is the case depends on the concessionaire. CASIELEC charges new
customers a connection fee of US$11 for a monophase connection, a meter, a circuit breaker
and two plugs, in addition to US$1.50 for the 2x16mm² stranded aluminum connection cable
itself. Another concessionaire charges new customers for the entire cost of the infrastructure
required to establish the connection. He estimates this cost to be around US$60.
3.5         Contractual Arrangements
Law 98-032 requires private operators to sign contracts with the Ministry of Energy, as
discussed. There are two types of contractual arrangements. In both cases, the contract is
between the private company and the Government of Madagascar via the Ministry of
Energy:28
            1. A concession contract (for distribution projects serving areas with peak demand
               greater than 500 kW, thermal generation projects above 500kW, and hydro
               generation projects above 150kW) – a “contrat de concession.?29 The private
               operator in this instance is called the “concessionaire?. Concession contracts can
               only be obtained following a competitive bidding process. This is also the type of
               contract BETC has for its new project, Jiro Kanto, for a duration of 30 years.

            2. An authorization contract for the smallest projects – a “contrat
               d’autorisation.?30 The private operator in this instance is called the
               “permissionaire?. Authorization contracts can be obtained either following a
               competitive bidding process or on the basis of spontaneous offer. Most private
               operators in the rural electrification market in Madagascar have signed an
               authorization contract with the Government, rather than a concession contract,
               and are considered “permissionnaire? (licensees).
Obtaining authorization contracts has in practice been easier than obtaining concession
contracts. There are three reasons for this:
             First, anyone can approach ADER with a business plan to obtain an authorization
              contract, rather than waiting for specific tenders. Concession contracts, on the
              other hand, can only be obtained following a public tender.
             Secondly, concession contracts require a higher-level approval than authorization
              contracts. An authorization contract requires a Ministry of Energy decision,
              whereas a concession contract requires a decree by the Government’s governing
              council.31 Concession contracts are thus more prone to delays, and some have
              faced corruption in their application for concession contracts.
             Thirdly, after its creation in 2004, ADER initially didn’t have the capacity and
              know-how to run competitive public tenders. The first attempted competition
              organized by ADER in 2004 received no bidders. An ADER employee, Mr.
              Ranaivo Casimir, negotiated to leave his position and start a company to win the
              award on the basis of a “spontaneous candidature? by submitting a business plan.
              That company, CASIELEC, is one of the biggest and most established private
              operators in rural Madagascar, with around 3,000 customers.
Some private operators that have authorization contracts have grown their installations to
meet demand above the 500kW threshold. To comply with the law they must sign
concession contracts with the Government. This is the situation facing the private operator
HIER. HIER asked for a concession contract in August 2014 but as of September 2015 the
decree had not been signed.
3.6         Technological Approach
The concessions operated by private companies are mostly vertically-integrated mini-grids
that use diesel generators or hydro generators. This was the initial approach used by ADER
and private operators. Between 2004 and 2008, the rural mini-grid concessions included 67
diesel-fired generators, 15 solar PV generators, two hydroelectric plants, and two wind-
powered generators.32

Out of the 118 power generating units not operated by JIRAMA in December 2014, 77 were
diesel-fired.33 35 of the 77 diesel-fired units were no longer operating, as a result of
mechanical failures or operations ceasing for other reasons. Some diesel-fired generators
were abandoned when the Government’s diesel subsidy ended in 2012, making operations
no longer financially sustainable.
Moving forward, the choice of technology is specified in the Requests for Proposals (RfP)
and is based on the region’s strategic plan (“Plan Directeur?).34 Hydro projects are being
prioritized by ADER, followed by biomass projects. For example, BETC (Appendix A) is
building a €5million hydro project at Jiro Kanto with financing support from the EU. ADER
states that diesel-powered generators can only be used as backup generators.35
Projects that use renewable energy generation are given a greater share of subsidies from the
government. The government’s use of subsidies on the capital expenditure favors projects
with higher upfront capital expenditures (capex) relative to operations and maintenance
(O&M) expenditures. For example, hydro generators and solar generators both have higher
capex relative to O&M than diesel-fired generators.
3.7         Regulatory Arrangements
The rural concessions are regulated by the rural electrification agency (ADER) and by the
regulator (ORE).
Relevant laws and regulations
Ministry of Energy and Mines Decree N° 2001-849 establishes the conditions and methods
for fixing electricity prices. It requires tariffs to reflect the cost of service, defined as the
economic cost of the resources used to supply electricity.36
In 2009, the Ministry of Energy published a decision37 about guidelines for tariff
adjustments. The decision makes private operators responsible for calculating tariff
adjustments based on a formula that takes into account currency changes, inflation, and
changes in the price of fuel inputs. They are also responsible for communicating the tariff
adjustments to the ORE, and are able to adjust tariffs twice a year after receiving the assent
of the ORE.38
Tariff conditions established by the contracts
One contract specifies that tariffs require approval from the regulator, ORE.39 The same
contract allows private operators to “freely negotiate their tariff structures with clients and

community representatives.?40 However, the private operators are also required to “guarantee
their economic neutrality.?41
Another contract says that “tariffs can be set freely? and are “the result of free negotiations
between the private operator and its clients, the conclusions of which are an integral part of
the authorization contract signed by the private operator and the community.?42
In the case of disagreements between the concessionaire and the Malagasy Government, the
parties submit themselves to a mediation process. If the parties can’t agree to the three
mediators, they will be referred by the President of the Tribunal of First Instance of
Antananarivo.43
Tariff-setting in practice
For both “spontaneous concessions? and concessions arising from public tenders, the tariff
levels are proposed by the private bidders at the business plan stage and negotiated with
ADER. This was the case for the spontaneous candidacies by BETC, CASIELEC, and
HIER.
If concessionaires want to raise their tariffs, they should make the request formally to ORE
(the regulator). The ORE publishes tariffs on its website for JIRAMA and 24 private
operators on its website.44
The concessionaires interviewed said that the agreement of the community was needed to
change tariffs. The community is represented by a “Committee? that signs off on such
decisions. These committees in some cases have asked for bribes from the private operators
in exchange for their assent to tariff increases.
The concessionaires interviewed (BETC, CASIELEC and HIER) all felt that consumers’
willingness to pay was the factor limiting their ability to raise tariffs. This seems to be why
some operators using diesel-fired generators have gone out of business. They may increase
tariffs, but if they do, customers stop paying, get disconnected, and never reconnect.
3.8         Extent of Risk Transfer
The risk transfer is almost completely to the private operators. The private operators assume
a high-level of commercial and operating risks, while the public assumes a relatively low-level
of risk.
The private operators in Madagascar assume:
           100 percent of the demand risk

4           Assessment of Concession
In this section we evaluate Madagascar’s concession approach to rural electrification against
its targets, analyze the reasons for the results, and present lessons for future concessions.
4.1         Evaluating Success of Concession
The results of the concession depend on several dimension of success: access, quality of
service, financial sustainability, and efficiency.
4.1.1 Access
The concession approach in Madagascar has improved access in rural areas. However, the
concession approach has fallen well short of its goals.
The rural electrification component of the World Bank project was expected to extend
15,000 new rural connections, but by 2006 electricity connections had only reached 3,000
rural homes.45
At the end of 2008, ADER reported that 24,380 connections had been extended
connections.46 At that time, ADER set a new target of connecting 85,000 new homes by
2012.47
ADER’s data on electricity connections between 2012 and 2014 is presented in Table 4.1.
We see the number of subscribers by type of provider (JIRAMA or private operator) and by
location of the subscriber (urban or rural). The electricity access rate is calculated as the
product of the total number of subscribers, the number of households served by connection,
and the average household size, divided by the total population.

Between 2012 and 2014, the national electricity access rate declined slightly from 15.35
percent to 15.02 percent, despite an increase in the number of total subscribers in the same
period. The reason for the drop in the electricity access rate is that the population growth
rate is greater than the growth rate in new connections.
In rural areas, the access rate is significantly lower than in urban areas. There is a significant
decrease in the number of rural subscribers connected to private operators between 2012
and 2013, and then a more modest decrease between 2013 and 2014. ADER believes this
decrease is caused by certain private operators reliant on diesel-powered generators that have




                                                 21
stopped operations.48 ADER estimates that diesel generators represent 70 percent of the
total installed capacity in rural areas.49
The ADER data shows that the majority of new rural customers are connecting to JIRAMA,
which added 23,709 connections during this time, while the number of customers of private
operators declined by 2,086 connections.
4.1.2 Quality of service
ORE maintains technical standards and norms for the sector.50 However, it doesn’t
disseminate information on quality of service.
The quality of the diesel mini-grids is mixed. The diesel mini-grids usually operate less than
24 hours a day. Some diesel-powered mini-grids have had to reduce electricity production
following the rise in diesel prices. For example, BETC reduced the operation of their diesel-
generated grid to eight hours a day.
ADER states that the quality of service (voltage and frequency stability, interruptions, and
response to enquiries and complaints) from the mini-grids powered by diesel-fired
generators is generally poor.51 Partly as a result of this, ADER is no longer giving subsidies
for diesel-fired generators, unless they are back-up generators.
Around 17 private rural concessionaires have gone out of business52, and therefore a
meaningful number of previously-connected households are no longer receiving electricity.
4.1.3 Sustainability
The private operators have reported difficulty remaining financially viable. The three
concessionaires interviewed during our study–BETC, CASIELEC and HIER, (described in
Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C)–all have ongoing operations and no plans to
leave the industry, but they exhibited problems keeping their businesses viable.
The private operators we met could not open their books to us. It is therefore difficult to
assess how financially sustainable their operations are. However, we believe at least one of
the operators is generating sufficient profits to consider investing in new facilities. Another
of the operators appears to be recovering just enough revenue to cover its costs in the short
term.
Hydro projects have become more viable as a 70 percent subsidy on the capital investment is
provided by ADER. Hydro projects become sustainable once viability-gap funding (VGF) in
the range of 60 percent is provided. However, this subsidy is often slow to be disbursed and
sometimes only partially transferred to the private operators.
Diesel-fired mini-grid projects have generally not been viable under recently prevailing fuel
prices and the current subsidy regime.

Currently, operators are seeking to expand their business on the basis of new renewable
energy projects. Because of the widely-held view that diesel systems are not sustainable in the
long term, ADER is trying to convert them to renewable energy.
Despite these reported difficulties, ADER reports that many private operators are still in
business. Though some private operators have exited the industry between 2005 and 2015,
there have also been new entrants in the industry. Figure 4.1 below shows the number of
active rural electricity operators in the country.

4.1.4 Efficiency
We were not able to collect information on the capital costs of the private operators.
However, we collected some information on operating costs for one concessionaire: their
operating costs were between US$6 and US$15 per subscriber per month, depending on the
mini-grid.
The costs to the government of subsidizing the rural electrification between 2004 and 2008
are presented in Table 4.2. Between 2004 and 2008, ADER’s rural electrification program
had invested US$9.05 million. In that same timeframe, the program had achieved 24,380
connections. This implies a subsidy cost to ADER of US$371.21 dollars per connection.

4.1.5 Other Impacts
In the 1998 Electricity Reform Law and in subsequent policy and strategic documents, the
Malagasy Government affirmed the importance of a functioning electricity sector for the
economic and social development of the country. Promoting economic growth is often cited
as a desired outcome of electrification efforts in Madagascar. However, the Government
does not have explicit social and economic development targets beyond increasing access to
electricity.
Nonetheless, the concessionaires interviewed for this study appeared to be making positive
social and economic impacts on the community. For example, BETC supplies electricity to
around 70 non-residential customers, including small business, which have been able to
generate new economic activities. HIER also reported new economic activity in its service
area as a result of the electricity service it provides.
4.2     Arrangements that Could Have Delivered Better Results
Ex-post, we believe some alternative arrangements would have delivered better results. We
would improve this arrangement by doing the following:
         Gradually reduce diesel tariffs. Malagasy rural mini-grids overwhelming rely on
          diesel as an input fuel. The decision in 2014 to remove nationwide diesel
          subsidies, though sensible, came as a negative shock to rural electricity consumers
          that saw their tariffs go up proportionally. Rural concessionaires with the lowest
          margins or the most price-sensitive customers went out of business.
         Increase the generation capacity threshold for “authorization contracts.?
          Private operators were more responsive to the ability to do “spontaneous
          candidatures? than to the traditional public tender route. Increasing the threshold
          above 250 kW or 500 kW may encourage private operators to pursue larger
          projects that can benefit from economies of scale.


                                                24
             Develop an integrated register for the concession rights for on-grid and off-
              grid projects. We encountered private rural concessionaires whose projects were
              on hold as a result of conflicts with grid-connected generation-only projects.
              There is a need to integrate the planning of rural electrification projects
              undertaken by ADER with grid-connected generation projects undertaken by
              agencies other than ADER.
The rural electrification strategy going forward addresses some of the problems faced by
concessions in the last 10 years. Specifically:
             Development of a rural master plan to determine the techno-economically
              optimal way to serve Madagascar’s rural regions
             The areas defined and bid out are larger than in the past
             The focus is on development of renewable generation, especially hydro and
              biomass
             Improved contracts and tender processes developed with GIZ assistance.
In our assessment these things are likely to help, and ADER thinks so as well.
4.3         Reasons for Results
The results of the concession are explained by the following key factors:
             Private operators overly dependent on diesel-fired generators: At the outset,
              the majority of the private operators powered their mini-grids with diesel-fired
              generators. Some of these operators found their customers unable to pay when
              tariffs where increased after diesel subsidies were cancelled.
             Insecure sources of financing from government: The rural electrification fund
              FNE has been slow to disburse and has failed to provide the promised subsidies
              to
             Financing gap: Operators are responsible for 30 percent of the cost of the
              investment but commercial bank financing is virtually inaccessible, and
              community financing is close to zero.53 However, committed entrepreneurs,
              including the operators interviewed for this case study, were able to secure
              financing.
4.4         Replicability of Experience and Success
Aspects of the concession model used in Madagascar can be replicated elsewhere.
             Local capacity: The case study shows that small, local entrepreneurs are able to
              start and maintain businesses providing electricity in remote areas of a low-
              income country. One of the common features of the concessionaires we met is

          knowledge in the electricity sector – as contractors, engineers or managers.
4.5    Lessons for Future Concessions
The concession illustrates lessons for governments considering using a concession approach
to rural electrification:
        The success of rural electrification efforts is closely tied to the performance
         of the rest of the sector. JIRAMA has had recurring problems since the
         electricity reforms started in 1998. These problems have absorbed both the
         attention of Malagasy policy-makers and the available funding, at the expense of
         rural projects. Making the urban-focused electricity sector viable helps make the
         rural electricity sector viable.
        Diesel-powered mini-grids can work but require ongoing subsidies when
         incomes are very low. This case study shows that small diesel-powered mini-
         grids can sustain themselves and be rapidly deployed. However they are at risk of
         shocks from changes in the price of diesel, and may need ongoing subsidies.
        In rural areas, customers can pay very high tariffs, but demand is elastic.
         Madagascar’s rural electricity consumers are paying $5-$15 per month at effective
         tariffs around US$0.40/kWh to US$0.70/kWh. However, demand is elastic and
         Madagascar’s experience has shown that there is a tipping point where customers
         will disconnect if prices go too high. The concessionaires we interviewed all cited
         number of customers and quantity demanded as the key factor in their tariff-
         setting decisions, rather than regulatory or contractual obligations.

Appendix A: Small Concessionaire Case Study – BETC
Overview
BETC operates four concession mini-grids, serving
a total of around 730 connections in the areas of
Lac Alaotra area of Madagascar. The company
operates four power generation plants and has been
in business for about 10 years.
Formation of the company, background and
motivation
BETC is a family company established by Mr. Paul
Rakotondralambo. Prior to starting BETC, Mr.
Rakotondralambo worked for the national water
                                                   Figure A.2: Location of Lake Alaotra
and electricity company JIRAMA in the investment
                                                   in Madagascar
studies department. During his time at JIRAMA, he
became acquainted with many of the potential hydropower sites of Madagascar as he studied
and visited them for 25 years.
When the Government launched ADER, the rural electrification agency, Mr.
Rakotondralambo approached ADER and left JIRAMA in order to start the business. Mr.
Rakotondralambo was able to mobilize the finances to start BETC because of his past
investments in real estate and running a small
building company.
Mr. Paul Rakotondralambo, as a partner in the
family business, owns 80 percent of equity and
receives 80 percent of the equity return on the
company.
Mr. Paul Rakotondralambo says he is motivated to
continue rural electrification for both financial
(personal) reasons and for the public’s benefit. He
doesn’t want the number of people being served by
electricity to be reduced. He intends for the business
to succeed by constructing and operating the Jiro
Kanto hydro project and by transforming his Figure A.3: Mr. Paul
diesel power plant to a hydro power plant.             Rakotondralambo, General
                                                       Manager of BETC (Source: BETC)
Key facts about the operations
Today, BETC operates today four power plants in the Lac Alaotra region of Madagascar.
Prior to BETC, the surrounding villages had no electric supply as the region was too small
for the national electric utility JIRAMA and it was assessed to be not worth running an
electricity business there.
The concession serves 660 residential customers and 70 others (small businesses and local
government). Power is supplied by two hydro power plants of 70kW and 200kW
respectively, a diesel plant of 150kW and a biomass plant of 70kW.




                                            27
The average residential customer consumes 10kWh per month, for a monthly bill of US$5-
US$7. The tariff is based on a meter hire for US$1.67, a fixed charge for maintenance and
other duties of US$0.33 and an average kWh charge of US$0.233 to US$0.50/kWh. The
average household income in the area is estimated at US$35 to US$50 per month. Though
some members of the local population would like to have a power connection, many cannot
afford one. BETC could lower its tariffs but due to its low customer base, it needs to
maintain them in order to recover the fixed costs
Non-residential customers consume 150kWh per month for an average monthly bill of
US$37 to US$77. The tariff is based on a meter hire for US$1.67, a fixed charge for
maintenance and other duties of US$0.33 and an average kWh charge of US$0.233 to
US$0.50/kWh.

Operator’s responsibilities
BETC produces electricity from its hydro power plants and distributes it to its customers. It
signs up customers, connects them to the village network, and manages meter, billing and
collection. Metering is still postpaid and the company must support unpaid bills which
represents approximately 15 percent of its monthly revenue.


                                                            29
BETC also manages maintenance of the power plants, transformers, network and
distribution system.
Financials
Under the concession contract, ADER was due to finance 70 percent of the capital
investment but due to a lack of money at ADER, BETC only received 60 percent of the
capital investment.
Technical skills
The operator, Mr. Paul Rakotondralambo, has experience in electricity as before running
BETC business, he worked in JIRAMA for about 25 years in the investment studies
department. During his time at JIRAMA, he became acquainted with many of the potential
hydropower sites of Madagascar as he studied and visited them for 25 years.
Impact on the community
With electricity connections, local population could access to modern life, use clean energy
and develop economic activities such as small businesses generating cash flows.
Contracts and licenses
BETC has an authorization contract from the Ministry of Energy. The contract is signed by
the Minister in charge of Energy and is the same type of contract needed for all diesel power
plants with a capacity below 500kW or hydro plants below 150kW.
Tariff setting and subsidies
The tariff is set according to the business plan of the operator that he submitted while he
answered the bid. Afterwards, when he wanted to raise the tariff, he had to ask the regulator,
ORE if he can do so. However, the main limitation to raising tariffs has been people’s ability
to pay.
The operator only gets subsidies from ADER on the capital investments. Normally it’s fixed
to 70 percent of the amount needed, but the subsidy remains promised, it’s not totally paid.
For any other extension or maintenance, he must put in his own cash flow or finance.
Coverage and service standards
The service area and the rules setting minimum coverage levels are all determined in the
bidding documents prior to contract signature.
Main challenges and problems
       Low income levels
        Unpaid bills: about 15 percent of total revenue
        Diesel price increase
        Subsidies not paid when promised
        Transformers damaged and no money to fix them
        Limited number of customer
        Limited network extension due to finance.




                                              30
Realistic opportunities for future improvement
        Add more customers
        Take over new service areas
        Bring in more investment for example with the Jiro Kanto project and first
         network interconnection in rural electrification
        Change postpaid meters to prepaid ones.
BETC’s power plants
BETC runs four power plants:
        Amboasary (a hydro power plant of 70kW)
        Andaingo (a biomass plant of 70kW)
        Imerimandroso (a diesel power plant of 150kW)
        Ambatomanoina (a hydro power plant of 200kW that has not yet connected to
         customers as it has just been constructed)
The diesel plant, Imerimandroso, always made a profit until 2014. Today, in 2015, the price
of fuel has gone up, as seen in Table A.2, so it makes a loss in fuel.
Table A.2: Diesel Price to BETC (2007-2015)
                           Year                    Fuel price (US$/liter)
                           2007                             0,85
                           2011                             0,98
                           2015                             1,10


In order to limit losses in the diesel power plant, BETC changed daily operations of the
plant to only eight hours a day. If BETC did not make this reduction in hours of operation
per day, they assess they will make a loss of about US$340 per month.
BETC’s future project: Jiro Kanto
In 2013, the World Bank and the European Union went to the Lac Alaotra Region to study
the extension and development of rural electrification.
Mr. Paul told them, “Why do they never give studies or investments to Malagasy people but
rather to Europeans or North Americans. Europeans and North Americans in turn ask
Malagasy people to do the job for them. This means that we, Malagasy are intelligent and
clever?.
The European Union launched an expression of interest and bid process for a hydroelectric-
powered mini-grid project. BETC was short listed by the European Union and won the
contract to develop Jiro Kanto, without the support or knowledge of the Ministry of Energy.
Jiro Kanto is a hydropower-based run-of-the-river mini-grid that will electrify 13
communities around Lac Alaotra using two hydro power plants: one with a capacity of
1.5MW and one with a capacity of 700kW for a total of 2.2MW. The project also includes
the construction of 70km of distribution lines.


                                            31
The objective of the project is to extend affordable electricity to 177,000 inhabitants in
29,500 households, as well as 450 artisans and small entrepreneurs.
BETC expects that the Jiro Kanto project will help make its business profitable. In 2016,
BETC will begin using prepaid meters.
The European Union will finance 75 percent of the project and BETC will finance the
remaining 25 percent. BETC is negotiating with investors from Dubaï and I&P in France.

Appendix B: Small Concessionaire Case Study – HIER
Overview
HIER operates three concession mini-grids, serving a total of around 1,300 connections in
three areas of Madagascar. The company operates three hydro power generation plants and
has been in business for about 10 years. It has only been working in rural electrification for
two years. The company started by working exclusively on hydro generation, without being
directly involved in distribution.
Formation of the company, background and motivation
HIER is a limited liability company established by French national Mr. André Fillet. Prior to
starting HIER, Mr. André Fillet worked as a subcontractor for JIRAMA and was an
electricity supplier to JIRAMA through his company Hydelec SA. During those years, he ran
a hydro power plant interconnected to the national grid of Antananarivo (RIA: Réseau
Interconnecté Antananarivo).
The motivations of the founder, Mr. André Fillet, are primarily social. He hopes to maintain
and if possible increase the number of people using electricity. However, he also has
financial and commercial motivations for growing the business.
For the Soavina and Ankilizato power plants, ADER provided HIER with studies conducted
by a consulting firm. These studies were significantly over-optimistic about the number of
potential customers in those areas.
Key facts about the operations
Today, HIER operates in three regions of Madagascar (Fandriana, Soavina and Ankilizato).
Prior to HIER, the surrounding villages had no electricity supply and were not connected to
the grid.
The concession serves 1,230 residential customers and 130 commercial or other customers.
Power is supplied by three hydro power plants of 70kW, 100kW and 500kW respectively.
The average residential customer consumes 3kWh to 10kWh per month (depending on the
area), for a monthly bill of US$7 to US$11. The tariff is based on a meter hire costing
between US$2 and US$5.20, and an average kWh charge of US$0.175 to US$0.2075/kWh.
Average household income in the areas is estimated at US$35 to US$50 per month.
Non-residential customers consume around 150kWh per month for an average monthly bill
of US$36.
HIER had 18 months of experience distributing electricity from a thermal generator before
switching to a hydro plant. This experience allowed HIER to notice that 37 percent of the
electricity consumed was not registering on their meters due to illegal connections or
deliberate tampering of meters. 6 percent of clients were delinquent despite having
functioning meters. HIER felt obligated to install pre-paid meters with a coaxial cable to a
receiving meter to avoid or limit theft.

Operator’s responsibilities
HIER produces electricity from its hydro power plants and distributes it to its customers. It
signs up customers, connects them to the village network, and manages meter, billing and
collection. Metering is still postpaid. Unpaid bills represent approximately 15 percent of its
monthly revenue.



                                                           34
HIER also manages maintenance of the power plants, transformers and distribution system.
Financials
Under the concession contract, ADER was meant to finance 75 percent of the capital
investment. Due to a lack of money at ADER, HIER only received 55 percent of the capital
investment.
The operating costs are reduced to a minimum and do not include overhead costs.
For the projects to be profitable, they to wait for other subscribers to generate more
operating income because we have minimum operating costs that are incompressible.
The minimum threshold for number of subscribers should be 400 to 500 households with a
75 percent capital subsidy on the cost of the hydro plant and a 100 percent subsidy on the
distribution lines. The distribution lines particularly penalize the profitability of the assets as
the sites are very spread out and require kilometer upon kilometer of distribution lines.
Technical skills
Mr. André Fillet has experience in electricity. Before running HIER, he worked as a
subcontractor to JIRAMA.
Impact on the community
Electricity connections have helped the population access modern life, use clean energy and
develop business and economic activity.
Contracts and licenses
HIER has an Authorization Contract signed by the Minister in charge of energy for all the
hydro power plants. To comply with regulations, the contract for the Fandriana plant should
be changed to a Concession Contract as its capacity has been increased to 500kW in order to
meet the local population’s demand. The Concession Contract had been promised to HIER
in August 2014 but as of September 2015 the decree had not been signed.
The threshold for needing a Concession Contract is 150kW for a hydro plant.
Tariff setting and subsidies
The tariff is set according to the business plan HIER submitted when they answered the bid.
If HIER wants to raise the tariff, it should make the request formally to ORE (The
Regulator). However, in practice, tariff increases are more limited by consumers’ ability to
pay than they are limited by the regulator.
The operator receives subsidies from ADER only for the initial investments. The initial
capital subsidy is fixed at 75 percent of the amount needed, but to this day the subsidy
remains promised but unpaid. For any grid extension and ongoing maintenance, HIER must
put in its own cash or finance the expense.
Coverage and service standards
The service area and the rules setting minimum coverage levels are all determined in the
bidding documents prior to contract signature and agreed with the mayor of the city.
Main challenges and problems
       Low income levels



                                                35

        Transformers damaged and no money to fix them
        Limited number of customer for some areas: projections for Ankilizato and
         Soavina were very badly established (425 projected vs. 210 actual for Ankilizato
         and 375 projected vs. 170 actual for Soavina)
        Limited network extension due to finance, customers and isolated areas.

Appendix C: Small Concessionaire Case Study –
CASIELEC
Overview
Concessionaire CASIELEC operates 16 concession mini-grids, serving a total of 2,913
connections in several areas of Madagascar. The company operates 16 generation plant using
diesel, biomass with rice husk and dual fuel technology. The company has been in business
for about 10 years.
Formation of the company, background and motivation
CASIELEC started as a small scale individual company. The owner, Mr. Ranaivo Casimir
worked at JIRAMA for 15 years and later moved to the rural electrification agency ADER.
He got into the business because he wanted to help the rural population. When ADER
launched the first expression of interest, there were no interested bidders.
ADER launched an Expression of Interest for a rural electrification project in which nobody
was interested. He thought “Why not me?? and bid. He negotiated the project with ADER
and left his job in order to start the business in 2005. He was the first rural concessionaire.
Mr. Casimir is motivated to continue rural electrification for economic and social reasons.
He wants to increase the number of households receiving electricity and he wants electricity
to contribute to the modern development of the villages in its service area.
Figure C.1: Picture of Mr. Ranaivo Casimir (middle, flanked by two colleagues)

Mr. Casimir also acts as the President of the Association of Rural Electrification
Entrepreneurs (AOPEM: Association des Opérateurs Privés en Electrification Rurale de
Madagascar).
Today, CASIELEC owns and operates 14 diesel power plants, one biomass power plant (rice
husk) and one dual fuel power plant (implemented after training in Brazil). Mr. Casimir visits
the CASIELEC power plants every month to limit losses and do maintenance.
All his concessions were signed on spontaneous demand.


                                              37
Ownership and partnerships
In 2014, Mr. Casimir attended a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in
Madagascar and signed a partnership with Indian foreign investors to bring in new financing
and recapitalize his company in order to expand the company’s activities. CASIELEC hopes
to bid on projects in the Comoros, Seychelles and Eastern Africa.
His company changed into a limited liability company with new stakeholders but Mr.
Ranaivo Casimir remains the majority shareholder with 51 percent control of the company.
The new associates bought the shares for US$100,000.
Since the Malagasy Government’s decision to transition towards renewable energy,
CASIELEC has invested with new partners in solar energy. Specifically, they are pursuing a
120kW solar project in Bongolava but this is not yet operational.
Today, CASIELEC uses Indian technology which the company believes to be cheaper than
European technology but with a similar useful life.
Key facts about the operations
The concessions serve 2,623 residential customers and about 290 other non-residential
customers like small businesses. Power is supplied by diesel, biomass and dual fuel
technology.

                                            38
The average residential customer consumes 10kWh/month, for a monthly bill of US$7. The
tariff is based on a monthly fixed premium and a charge per kWh consumed. Average
household income in the areas is estimated at US$35 to US$50/month.

Operator’s responsibilities
CASIELEC produces and distributes electricity. The company signs up customers; connects
customers to the village network; and manages metering, billing and collection. Metering is
still postpaid and the company must make provisions for unpaid bills representing
approximately 15 percent of revenue in 2015.
CASIELEC also manages maintenance of the power plants, transformers, network and
distribution system.



                                                     40
The power plants are getting old and need more maintenance. Financial means are not
enough to cover the extension and distribution as the subsidy is only given resources for the
first investment. After 10 years, the power plant should be rebuilt.
Relationship with ADER
Under the concession contract, ADER should finance 70 percent of the investment but due
to lack of money, CASIELEC received less. ADER only provided 60 percent.
Prospects
CASIELEC would like to convert to using renewable energy power plants and stop relying
on diesel power plants. CASIELEC has just begun a solar farm and intends to build a wind
power plant. The firm also plans to build a hydro plant, which is much more difficult and
expensive on investment but has lower operating costs.
CASIELEC hopes to bid on projects in the Comoros, Seychelles and Eastern Africa.

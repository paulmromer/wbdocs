 I.       Consolidated Report - EITI Preparation Support for
          Myanmar
Context: In 2011, Myanmar started on a series of critical political and economic
reforms, following fifty years of authoritarian military rule, civil war, and a centrally
planned, closed economy. Improved economic governance stands at the center of the
reform process started in 2011. To this end, in 2012, Myanmar’s President Thein Sein
issued a Presidential Decree that Myanmar would become a member of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). In June 2014, Myanmar became an EITI
candidate and the hosted the semi-annual board meeting in October 2014. The
country’s first EITI report is due in January 2016.

Myanmar is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, minerals, gems, as well as
timber. These sectors officially account for an estimated 35% of total exports,
primarily from gas. Myanmar is the world’s largest producer of jade and among the
largest producers of rubies and sapphires. Reported gemstone total sales figures were
USD3.7 billion in 2011-12, although considerable uncertainty surrounds the sector,
and actual sales could be higher. Mining activities are currently limited in scale, with
export figures around USD70 million, but mineral potential is considered to be high.
Historically Myanmar’s resources have not been managed in such a way as to
translate them into improved services, infrastructure, and economic growth. Lack of
transparency and accountability affect oil, gas, and mining. Information about
contracting, payments, revenues, and destination of revenues are not made public.
This lack of transparency and military involvement in extractive operations has
contributed to public mistrust and lack of meaningful policy debate surrounding the
role of extractive industries in the economy. The decision to sign up to EITI
constituted an important practical and symbolic break with the past.

World Bank and DFID Collaboration: Once the decision to sign up to EITI was
taken, the immediate challenge was practical preparation in a context of very low
government capacity. The capacity challenges were myriad. These encompassed very
significant knowledge gaps, including of the institutional, legal, and regulatory
environment, even among Myanmar stakeholders themselves, compounded by the
very poor quality of data that affects all sectors in Myanmar. In addition there was
virtually no awareness of the EITI Standard and approaches to its implementation
across the public, government, or civil society. Finally, there was no tradition of
public dialogue, meetings between Government and civil society, and providing data
to the public. In recognition of the capacity limitations, President Thein Sein tasked a
quasi-independent think-tank, Myanmar Development Resources Institute (MDRI)
with the preparation of the EITI candidacy and appointed its Director, Dr. Zaw Oo, as
EITI National Coordinator.

Recognizing both the importance of supporting Myanmar to become an EITI member
and the depth of the capacity challenge, the World Bank and DFID moved quickly to
put in place the support necessary to address the capacity and knowledge gaps
sufficiently for Myanmar to complete the EITI candidacy process within the relatively
short time-frame decreed by the President. In April 2013 DFID approved an
Externally Funded Object (EFO) for the World Bank to run between April 2013 and
May 2015. In addition, the Bank and DFID also initiated an EITI donor coordination


                                                                                       4
group. The Project Development Objective of the EFO is to provide advice to the
Republic of the Union of Myanmar on implementation of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative including capacity building in areas of legal, contractual and
financial terms of licenses in the petroleum, gas and mining industries.

EFO Design and Activities: It was clear at the design stage that to be effective, the
EFO would have to work across multiple streams at once. These included hands-on
day to day technical advice and support, awareness raising and training, and creating
the baseline knowledge, documentation, and data necessary to implement EITI. In
addition it was clear that the activities, while focusing on Government and MDRI as
the lead EITI implementers, would have to also encompass civil society and the
private sector as EITI constituencies. To accommodate the need to work
simultaneously across different areas and constituencies, the EFO was designed as a
package of five mutually reinforcing work streams:

   Technical Assistance on EITI implementation (P155590) – This activity was
    the “backbone? of the package funded by the EFO, providing guidance and advice
    on international good practices necessary for Myanmar to meet key milestones in
    preparation of EITI candidacy and the early stages of implementation.
   Constituency Building (P155600) – This activity assisted in preparing the three
    EITI Multi-stakeholder Group (MSG) constituencies – Government, civil society,
    and private sector – to understand EITI and meaningfully participate in the
    process, through a series of awareness raising and outreach activities.
   Legal and Contractual Analysis (P155599) - Basic understanding of the legal
    and contractual issues affecting extractive industries operations among
    constituents is essential to participation in EITI and to its effective
    implementation. This includes also building understanding about the extractive
    industry value chain.
   EITI Scoping Study & Legal Review (P155597) - This aimed to produce the
    Legal Review and the Scoping Study, both standard and essential parts of EITI
    implementation. The Legal Review was delivered in 2013. However the Scoping
    Study could not be delivered in time. Work commenced in April, 2015 and it will
    be delivered in August 2015, using a different funding source.
   Political Economy Study of Extractive Industries (P155598) – As noted above
    at the outset, there was a very large gap in basic knowledge of the workings of the
    extractive industries in Myanmar. This activity delivered the Institutional and
    Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar, in March 2015.
    In addition to providing a knowledge base for the implementation of EITI, the
    report will have broad uses among those interested in extractive industries in
    Myanmar, including within the World Bank.

Outcomes: As of May, 2015, Myanmar has achieved candidacy status, hosted a major
international EITI event, and is well on its way to meeting the deadline for its first
report in January 2016. The EFO has met its original aims and been the mainstay of
international support to Myanmar’s EITI candidacy. Without the EFO-funded support
it is unlikely that Myanmar would have been able to successfully become an EITI
candidate country in June 2014. The EFO provided the assistance needed to meet the
essential milestones: i) MSG formation and functioning; ii) finalizing a costed
workplan; iii) production of essential sector analysis to allow informed decision-
making, iv) public awareness raising. Awareness of EITI is now significantly more


                                                                                     5
  widespread than even envisioned at the outset of this project, evidenced in the regular
  coverage of EITI related events and issues in the domestic media, frequent references
  to EITI by Government and CSO members, and the active discussion of EITI on
  social media sites. In addition there has been a large increase in the availability of
  information about extractive industries in Myanmar due to the reports produced under
  the EFO, specifically the legal review and the Institutional and Regulatory
  Assessment. In the area of institution building the EFO has gone farther than its initial
  scope and supported the creation of an EITI Secretariat inside the Ministry of
  Finance. The delay in the funding of the Scoping Study is regrettable but all other
  aspects of the EFO have met, if not exceeded the original goals. As of second quarter
  of 2015, Myanmar EITI is truly moving into implementation with the establishment
  of the EITI Secretariat inside the Ministry Finance and commencement of the data
  collection and reporting process which will lead to publication of EITI data in the
  Reconciliation Report in January, 2016.

  This consolidated report covers three work streams – Technical Assistance on EITI
  implementation (P155590), Constituency Building (P155600), and Legal and
  Contractual Analysis (P155599. There is a short separate narrative report for each
  workstream. This is followed by an annex with the relevant supporting documents
  and actual devliverables/outputs produced for the three activities.


II.   P155590 Output Report - Technical Assistance on EITI
      implementation
  This activity was the “backbone? of the support package. An international technical
  advisor was recruited in September 2013. A very experienced EITI expert with well-
  established training, capacity building, and communication skills, the technical
  advisor has been located at the Myanmar EITI coordination office at MDRI and
  provided the day in and day out, step by step advice and support necessary to
  satisfactorily implement EITI. This includes the formation of the multi-stakeholder
  group, the MEITI workplan, the candidacy application, the TOR for the Independent
  Administrator firm to draft the EITI report, the production of public outreach
  materials, and regular formal trainings on various aspects of EITI. In addition the
  advisor undertook a significant amount of capacity and institutional building within
  the MDRI team and increasingly with the Ministry of Finance. Having this advisor in
  place has not only been essential to Myanmar’s reaching its goal of EITI candidacy
  but also to successfully integrating the other streams of assistance provided under the
  EFO.

  The EITI International Technical Advisor has contributed to all aspects of the EITI
  implementation since her arrival in September 2013. Without this day to day
  assistance, there would have been insufficient capacity and experience for Myanmar
  to reach EITI candidacy, much less start well on the way to EITI implementation. The
  following reports highlight eight of the key milestones achieved in Myanmar’s EITI
  journey in which the International Advisor played a large role.

  MSG Formation: MEITI’s multi-stakeholder group (MSG) was established in January
  2014 and comprises 21 representatives of government, civil society and private sector.


                                                                                         6
The MSG is the core of EITI implementation and is a requirement for candidacy. The
International Technical Advisor played an essential role on providing advice as to
what needed to be done to adhere to the EITI Standard, while at the same time making
the MSG reflect Myanmar’s particular circumstances. The Terms of Reference for the
multi-stakeholder group (MSG) was one of the first core outputs to be prepared
during the first quarter of 2014. This document, agreed and approved by the MSG,
also comprises one of the four requirements for EITI candidacy. An initial TOR was
produced which then went through a long consultation and feedback process, and
several iterations, before it was finally approved by the MSG in April 2014. In
response to the preferences of stakeholders, as permitted under the EITI Standard, the
MSG was established with six Government and six Private Sector representatives, but
nine CSO representatives, appointed from the MATA coalition.

At its 5th meeting in August 2014, the MSG agreed to establish 3 sub-committees,
each comprising 2 representatives from each of the 3 stakeholder groups, as follows:
Technical and Reporting Sub-Committee; Workplan and Governance Sub-
Committee; Communications and Outreach Sub-Committee. These three sub-
committees have undertaken much of the core planning and decision-making. The
International Advisor attends most sub-committee meetings as well as all MSG
meetings.

MSG Workplan and budget: The International Technical Advisor played a central role
in convening the discussions on the MSG workplan and on ensuring that the workplan
would allow Myanmar to achieve the core EITI benchmarks required by the EITI
Standard and the International EITI Secretariat in Oslo. The MSG workplan and
budget was initially produced during the first quarter of 2014. As with the MSG TOR,
this comprises one of the four requirements for EITI candidacy, and as with the TOR,
it underwent a very lengthy consultation and feedback process before the MSG
approved the final version in April 2014. An initial draft/estimated budget was
produced and approved by the MSG, in time for the candidacy application in May
2014. However, since then the workplan budget has been revised a number of times,
in particular with the aim of identifying and securing sources of funding for the
various activities, included but not limited to the EITI MDTF. The MSG Workplan
and Governance Sub-Committee has led and continues to lead on this, with close
support from the International EITI Technical Adviser and the MDRI MEITI
Coordination Office. The MSG has now agreed that in addition to the MEITI MDTF,
the other main source of funding that it is seeking to secure funding from the Bank-
managed country MDTF for Myanmar, funded by the UK and Australia.

MEITI Candidacy Application: The candidacy application was prepared by the
MEITI Team in MDRI with substantial input from the International Technical
Advisor during Q1 and Q2 2014. This had to demonstrate that the four minimum
requirements necessary for candidacy had been met, and the relevant documentary
evidence was also required to support this. Some further additional evidence was also
put together, where possible, to show that Myanmar had not just met but where
feasible and given the context, gone beyond, the key requirements for candidacy. A
draft with all the supporting evidence was produced, which was then approved by the
MSG in May 2014, after which it was submitted to the EITI International Secretariat
and Board. At its meeting in July 2014, the Board awarded Myanmar EITI
‘Candidate’ status.



                                                                                    7
   TOR for Independent Administrator: A draft Terms of Reference for the Independent
   Administrator was produced for the MSG during Q3 and Q4 2014, again with
   significant guidance from the International Technical Advisor. The TOR had to
   respond to Myanmar’s context but also ensure that Myanmar would meet the
   requirements set by the EITI Standard and enforced by the EITI International
   Secretariat. The final document was approved by the MSG in December 2014 and the
   consulting firm was selected in late April 2015. The successful completion of the
   Candidate Application and the selection of the Independent Administrator are
   evidence of the effective functioning of the MSG Technical and Reporting Sub-
   Committee.

   Transition of MEITI Secretariat function from MDRI-CESD to the Ministry of
   Finance. – One of the key challenges facing EITI in Myanmar has been the transition
   of the EITI Secretariat functions from MDRI, an external think tank, to Government.
   This was necessary to bring Myanmar into line with international standards for EITI
   implementation, but also to create a body that would be able to implement the MEITI
   Work Plan. The International Technical Advisor provided key advice on the staffing
   and functions of the new secretariat within the Ministry of Finance, and continues to
   provide ongoing training.

   In February 2015 the Cabinet approved the proposed new structure within the
   Ministry of Finance. The EITI Secretariat unit was formally established as part of the
   new Budget department. This unit has initially been designated with five members of
   staff, of whom two are currently focusing mostly on EITI. However, it is anticipated
   that the number of staff will rise to ten during the course of 2015 with at least five
   full-time staff.


III.   P155600 Output Report - Outreach and Constituency
       Building
   As noted above, there was virtually no awareness of EITI in Myanmar when
   Government committed to become a candidate in 2012. EITI is at its core an
   information sharing and dialogue process which requires that all three constituencies
   in the multi-stakeholder group (Government, civil society, and private sector) have a
   good understanding of the process and be able to function coherently as
   constituencies. This activity aimed to help each constituency gain an essential
   understanding of EITI and be able to meaningfully participate in public dialogue
   about EITI and extractive industries in general. This activity consisted of 11 different
   training and awareness raising events, sponsored by the Bank, the EITI Secretariat, or
   other partners which contributed to increased capacity for dialogue and EITI
   implementation.

   Civil Society: It is noteworthy that the potentially most difficult of the three
   constituencies, civil society, has responded with surprising speed and coherence to the
   opportunity to participate in EITI. In October 2013, over 400 CSOs came together to
   form the Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability (MATA), the first
   such large-scale, multi-sector, representative coalition of civil society organizations in
   Myanmar. The CSO constituency for the MSG is chosen by MATA.


                                                                                           8
MATA is a civil society alliance that supports civil society actors to collaboratively
advocate for transparency and accountability in all sectors across Myanmar. More
than 400 civil society organizations, civil society network and individual from the
whole country of Myanmar are involved in MATA as members. The objectives of
MATA are: i) Advocate for transparency and accountability in the management of
natural resources by Government, private sector and civil society organisations; ii)
Raise awareness of the importance of transparency through education and training
sessions; iii) Build partnerships with INGO, NGO, Government, CSOs and other
stakeholders; iv) Strengthen the capacity of CSO and communities to improve Natural
Resources Governance; v) Increase freedom of information, monitoring mechanisms
and the accessibility of data; and iv) Promote the freedom of CSO participation in
Myanmar.

MATA participated in several of the outreach and training activities supported under
this sub-activity, particularly a public consultation held in Tanintharyi Region in July
2013 and the regional workshop in Jakarta in December 2013. In addition Bank staff
were invited to participate in and make presentations at several events sponsored by
Myanmar or international civil society organizations, including a Revenue Watch
Institute workshop in November 2013 and an EcoDev Learning event in June 2014.
These events have contributed to a significant expansion in CSO awareness,
understanding, and in general support for EITI and to the nine CSO representatives on
serving as equal partners in the MSG. A very positive by-product is also regular
communication between Bank staff and MATA members, providing a sustained
engagement between the Bank and CSOs.

Government: As Government necessarily has to take a leading role in the
coordination and organizing of EITI implementation, there was an urgent need to first
build awareness across Government about EITI and then to build capacity. In 2013
and 2014, activities were chiefly aimed at building awareness. Government
participated in a public consultation held in Tanintharyi Region in July 2013, the
regional workshop in Jakarta in December 2013, and a workshop on EITI and
Extractive Industries Governance in Myanmar specifically aimed at the inter-
ministerial EITI Working Group in 2013. In addition upon the request of the then
newly appointed Minister of Finance, the Bank EITI team put together a Briefing On
Revenue Streams Accruing From Extractive Industries In Myanmar in August 2013.

By 2015, these activities changed gear, moving into capacity building for the newly
created EITI Secretariat within the Ministry of Finance’s Budget Department. This
included a series of meetings, plus workshops in February 2015 in Nay Pyi Taw.
These were carried out together with MDRI’s MEITI Team and the EITI International
Secretariat. Particularly important was the workshop on EITI Implementation and
Extractive Industries Governance on February 10, 2015. The audience was the
Government EITI Working Group and included representatives from all the relevant
ministries. For the first time Government representatives discussed together how data
for the EITI reports would be generated and shared across ministries, making it one of
the most productive training exercises to date. An important result was much
increased understanding of the nuts and bolts demands of the EITI process and the
role played by officials at different levels in the relevant ministries. Additionally,
these officials built a fundamental basis of understanding of EITI and the mechanics


                                                                                      9
      of implementation among the five EITI Secretariat staff, none of whom had previous
      experience with or knowledge of EITI.

      Private Sector: Private sector representatives took part in several of the activities
      under this sub-activity and the EITI TA sub-activity described above. The EITI
      process has enhanced the coordination among sector operators which was previously
      conducted on a loose basis, subject to topical issues or challenges. With the EITI
      process, the coordination has become formalized with separate constituency
      groupings for oil & gas and mining operators, respectively. Secondly several of the
      international companies, namely Total and Petronas were already familiar with EITI
      from other contexts.

      The Annex provides a complete list of events supported by the DfID-financed
      Externally Financed Output, plus supporting documents. A more comprehensive
      folder of presentations and papers are available in WBDocs.


IV.      P155599 Output Report - Legal and Contractual Analysis
      This sub-activity has aimed to create a basic understanding of the legal and
      contractual issues affecting extractive industries operations is essential to participation
      in EITI and to its effective implementation. This also building understanding about
      the extractive industry value chain. Given the paucity of understanding of these
      issues, even within Government, and near absence of coherent data, it was necessary
      to conduct trainings for key stakeholders in the EITI process, specifically MDRI and
      Government counterparts. This activity delivered 4 separate training events, three of
      them multi-day, including special training for the MDRI team, a comprehensive
      workshop on the EI value chain for the Ministry of Mines in November 2013, and a
      successful roundtable on State Owned Enterprise reform targeted at the Ministry of
      Energy and the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise in March 2015. These activities
      were the first events of their kind in Myanmar and contributed to the capacity
      development of the MEITI team and enhanced capacity to undertake policy and
      strategy dialogue by key Government ministries. Below are summaries of the key
      training events and their results.

      EITI and Extractive Industry Value Chain Workshop Series – October – November
      2013: This series of three multi-day training/workshop activities was delivered by
      John Strongman (retired GEEDR staff). The first of these was a four day workshop
      specifically for MDRI staff, which covered EITI, financial data, and good governance
      across the value chain. Particular attention was given to contextual information, tax
      collection, and revenue flows, with regard to the new 2013 EITI Standard. This was
      particularly important as the 2013 Standard had just been introduced, requiring a
      higher and more comprehensive level of reporting than had been previously been the
      case. This workshop series was aimed only at MDRI staff, as the team that was
      responsible for coordinating EITI in Myanmar and informing others. A training
      specifically for the MDRI had been identified as a priority. The result of the workshop
      was that the MDRI team took a large step forward in terms of knowledge of EITI and
      the ability to contextualize this knowledge within broader issues of extractive industry
      governance. This in turn had several practical results – the team was better able to
      articulate the aims of EITI to other audiences, argue the merits of becoming an EITI


                                                                                              10
member with key decision-makers within Government, and mutually support each
other because all had received the training.

The second workshop was a two day workshops specifically for the media. This was
very important because the media had a great deal of interest in EITI but journalists
and editors had virtually no understanding of EITI. Additionally the workshop took
place barely a year after enormous changes in Myanmar’s media landscape, with the
abolition of the censor board and various other restrictions, leading to an explosion in
the number of publications and in the number of people consuming media.
Consequently it was a very important juncture for training for the media on EITI.
EITI is widely reported on in the Myanmar media, reflecting the public interest in
improved transparency and accountability in the extractive industries.

The last was a two day workshop specifically for the Ministry of Mines on
Institutions, Regulations, and Policy in the Mining Industry. The Ministry of Mines
was targeted given its significantly weaker capacity than the Ministry of Energy and
other ministries involved in the extractive industries. The training aimed to lay out
such issues as regulatory function, fiscal regime, safeguards, licensing, and
community impacts. This was the first time such a comprehensive look at these issues
had been presented to the ministry, including many topics that the Government will
have to report on directly in the EITI report. It contributed significantly to building
high level support for EITI in the Ministry of Mines, which has been consistently
supportive of and participated well in Myanmar’s EITI effort.

Institutional Development and Modernization of State Economic Enterprises in the
Oil and Gas Sector, Roundtable, March 5, 2105: This activity was requested by the
Ministry of Energy and the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise during the 2014 EITI
Board meeting in Nay Pyi Taw. It was also enthusiastically supported by donors,
particularly DfID and Australia, which partner with the World Bank on the
Modernization of Public Financial Management. The roundtable brought together
World Bank and other experts in energy, corporate governance, and financing. This
included presentations on options for corporate restructuring presented by Robert
Lesnick (retired GEEDR). The roundtable directly supports the transparency and
accountability aims of EITI in convening a discussion about possible changes to
MOGE, rated as one of the least transparent state owned oil companies in the world.

In conclusion, the advisory services provided under the EFO have significantly
improved the structure and content of dialogue about the good governance in the
extractive industries. Civil society and sector operator stakeholders have combined
forces in an unprecedented manner to meet the challenge of EITI implementation. But
the collaboration has been much more ambitious than the required reporting on
revenue streams. A debate has opened about the entire value chain of extractive
industry operations from extraction of sub-soil resources to sustainable development
to the benefit of society as a whole. This debate has addressed five distinctive parts of
the value chain: (i) award of contracts and licenses for extraction, (ii)regulation and
oversight of the performance of operators, (iii) collection of taxes and royalties, (iv)
distribution and management of revenue accruing from operations, and finally (v)
implementation of sustainable policies and projects. The following chart illustrates the
five stages which have been addressed in the advisory services of the EFO.

    REQUIREMENT 1.1
    The government is required to issue an unequivocal public statement
    of its intention to implement the EITI. The statement must be made by
    the head of state or government, or an appropriately
    delegatedgovernment representative.


The first time that a senior representative of the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar
                                                               th
mentioned EITI was at the Myanmar Forum in Singapore on 8 June 2012, where Minister U Soe Thein stated,
“We want to court foreign investments. Necessary steps, accordingly, have been taken to create an
investment friendly climate for foreign investors. In time, we plan to introduce and practice Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, which calls for governments to disclose all payments from oil, gas and
mining companies?

In July 2012, in an interview with the UK Financial Times, President Thein Sein stated “We are preparing to be
a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to ensure that there is maximum transparency
in these sectors and try to make sure the benefits go to the vast majority of the people and not to a small
group. The most important thing is to have completely transparent financial accounting to ensure that
everyone knows where the revenues from these extractive industries are going."

During a visit by the EITI International Secretariat to Naypyidaw on 16 July 2012, the government confirmed its
intention to implement EITI.

In December 2012, President Thein Sein issued Presidential Decree no.99/2012 which formally established EITI
and states the government’s intention and commitment to implement EITI. The Presidential Decree formally
establishes the Leading Authority of five Senior Ministers and designates their responsibilities for EITI
implementation. On 14 December 2012, President Thein Sein publicly announced the government’s
commitment to work with civil society and private sector on EITI implementation. Minister U Soe Thein was
appointed EITI Champion. The Presidential Decree also established the government Leading Authority to
oversee the preparations for implementation, including the establishment of a multi-stakeholder group and
development of a work plan. Myanmar Development Research Institute (MDRI) is responsible for providing
support to the government in preparing for implementation, and to coordinate awareness raising efforts
among stakeholders.

The Myanmar Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR), agreed in December 2012, also specifically
refers to EITI in Section 7.2 under ‘Governance and Transparency’.
         th
On the 15 July 2013, President Thein Sein further reaffirmed the government’s commitment to implement
EITI in a speech at Chatham House in London. “We are eager to become a signatory to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, or EITI, to ensure maximum transparency as well as work to attract new
investment and develop our natural resources. We wish to avoid the so-called ‘resource curse’ and make sure
that revenue from our natural wealth is used to reduce poverty, not fuel corruption. “

  REQUIREMENT 1.2
  The government is required to appoint a senior individual to lead the implementation of the EITI.
  The appointee should have the confidence of all stakeholders, the authority and freedom to
  coordinate action on the EITI across relevant ministries and agencies, and be able to mobilise
  resources for EITI implementation.

Presidential Decree 99/2012 formally established the Myanmar EITI Government Leading Authority,
which comprises five senior government ministers. Senior Minister U Soe Thein was appointed the Chair
of the Leading Authority and the senior individual responsible for EITI implementation in Myanmar. The
Myanmar Development Resources Institute Centre for Economic and Social Development (MDRI-CESD)
was appointed as the Coordination Office.

The government Leading Authority includes U Than Htay, Minister of Energy, Dr Myint Aung, Minister of
Mines, U Win Tun, Minister of Environment and Conservation, and U Win Shein, Minister of Finance. In
2013 a new Minister of Energy was appointed, U Zayyar Aung.

The Leading Authority is responsible for overseeing the preparations for EITI implementation. The
Decree states, “the Leading Authority is meant to ensure better management for extractive industries of
natural resources, develop good investment environment, create opportunity for a frank and
transparent discussion between private investors and the people. ?

The Leading Authority is also responsible for overseeing the formation of a multi-stakeholder group,
developing an EITI work plan and taking the necessary steps to apply for EITI Candidate Status. The
committee is also tasked with initiating reforms in the extractive sector so as to ensure that the
country’s natural resources contribute to sustainable development.
     th
On 18 November 2013, in response to certain CSO concerns, a multi-stakeholder meeting was held in
Naypyidaw for civil society, some company and some government stakeholders to openly discuss and
agree next steps in terms of EITI in Myanmar. Senior Minister U Soe Thein presided over the meeting
and responded directly and openly to CSO queries during the meeting. CSOs then agreed to move
forwards with the EITI process. His intervention and the meeting outcome clearly demonstrate that he
has the confidence of stakeholders.

             appropriate stakeholders, including but not necessarily limited to: the private sector; civil
             society, including independent civil society groups and other civil society such as the

            EITI, the central role of companies and civil society, as well as widely disseminating the
            public information that results from the EITI process such as the EITI Report.

              Administrator, EITI Reports and annual activity reports.
         v.   The multi-stakeholder group should oversee the EITI reporting process and engage in
              Validation in accordance with chapter 3.

  Internal governance rules and procedures:
         vi. The EITI requires an inclusive decision-making process throughout implementation, with
               each constituency being treated as a partner. Any member of the multi-stakeholder group
               has the right to table an issue for discussion. The multi-stakeholder group should agree
               procedures for nominating and changing multi-stakeholder group representatives,
               decision-making, the duration of the mandate and the frequency of meetings. This should
               include ensuring that there is a process for changing group members that respects the
               principles set out in Requirement 1.3(f).
         vii. There should be sufficient advance notice of meetings and timely circulation of documents
               prior to their debate and proposed adoption.
         viii. The multi-stakeholder group must keep written records of its discussions and decisions.



Government commitment to work with civil society and companies:

Privatesector outreach and constituency building:
In terms of private sector outreach and constituency building, an initial meeting took place in June 2013 with the
Myanmar Federation of Mining Associations (MFMA) at which preliminary discussions regarding their potential
involvement in EITI were outlined.

In early October 2013, the MEITI Coordination Office held a workshop with the government and private sector at
Myanmar Insurance Enterprise. A wide range of private sector representatives attended, including representatives from
both the international and national oil, gas and mining sectors (e.g. Wanbao, FMMA, Petronas, MPRL, Total, Chevron,
Shell). In addition, from October- December 2013, the MEITI Coordination Office held a series of meetings with
individual companies, to further explain the EITI process and their potential role in it. Individual meetings were held with
Petronas, MPRL, Total, Chevron, Daewoo, PTTEP and MFMA, among others. Total, as a corporate EITI Board member,
has for a long time been supportive of EITI implementation in Myanmar.
      th
On 18 November 2013, mostly in response to a request from civil society, a large multi-stakeholder meeting was held.
in Naypyitaw at which Senior Minister U Soe Thein, Deputy Minister of Finance Dr Maung Maung Thein, and MEITI
National Coordinator Dr Zaw Oo, openly discussed and responded to stakeholder questions and concerns regarding
Myanmar’s intention to become an EITI candidate country. From the private sector, Daewoo and Petronas attended this
meeting.

In December 2013 an EITI private sector meeting was held in conjunction with EITI Chair Clare Short’s visit on 9-10
December in Naypyitaw. Here, the company representatives (including from Total, Chevron, Petronas, CNPC, MFMA and
others) had the opportunity to meet with Clare Short and discuss any concerns or questions they had, as well as agree
some next steps in terms of selecting private sector representatives for the MSG.

On the 18 November a large multi-stakeholder consultation meeting took place in Naypytitaw at which Senior Minister
U Soe Thein reconfirmed the government’s commitment to work with CSOs and companies to implement EITI.

MSG Representatives Selection Procedure and Establishment of MSG:
Following a period of extensive outreach and constituency building, and amid plans and preparation for the
establishment of the multi-stakeholder group, the Chair of the international EITI Board and the EITI Regional Director
paid a visit to Myanmar to meet stakeholders, discuss progress and agree next steps.

The MEITI Coordination Office prepared a ‘Next Steps Consultation Briefing Paper’ at the end of November which was
shared with all key stakeholders and which outlined progress so far and proposed next steps. All stakeholders were
invited to submit any comments, feedback or suggestions ahead of the multi-stakeholder consultation meeting planned
for 9-10 December. The multi-stakeholder consultation meeting and other individual constituency group meetings took
place in NPT during Clare Short’s visit on 9-10 December. Clare Short also met the President during her visit. One of the
key outcomes agreed was that the MSG should be established and the first meeting should take place by December/
January.

The Ministry of Mines organised a large EITI workshop meeting on 13 December 2013, to follow through next steps after
the Chair of EITI’s visit. A large number of mining company representatives attended the meeting and the Minister of
Mines and MEITI Coordination Office representatives spoke and encouraged companies to participate in the process. At
the end of the meeting 2 mining sector representatives agreed to be MSG members – one international (CNMC Nickel’s
Country Manager) and one national (the joint Secretary General of the Myanmar Federation of Mining Associations,
who also owns a private mining company).




                                                                                                               27
For the oil and gas sector, MOGE invited a number of companies to attend a meeting on 13 December, at which
four company representatives agreed to sit on the MSG. It has initially been suggested (drawing on the
recommendations provided in the MEITI Options Study) that there should be 4 oil and gas company seats. During
the consultation and outreach process, it had been suggested that one of these seats should be left vacant until
the outcomes of the current offshore oil and gas tender process was announced, enabling one of the new
companies to have a seat on the MSG. However, at the MOGE meeting it was decided that the 4 seats should be
filled as follows:
            Total (international, private)
            Petronas (international, state)
            MPRL (national/international)
            GoldPetrol (national)

In terms of the government selection process, the government agreed to nominate its 6 members, reflecting
senior government representatives from the key EITI related government institutions, by the end of December
2013. The names were given to the MEITI Coordination Office by the end of the year. The government Working
Group includes senior government officials, many of whom are on the MSG. The appointed MSG members are all
Director General and Director level, as follows:
          Director General, General Administration Department, Ministry of Home Affairs
          Director General, Forestry Department, Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry
          Managing Director, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, Ministry of Energy
          Director General, Department of Mines, Ministry of Mines
          Director General, Internal Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance
          Director, Union Auditor General’s Office

Finally, the MSG was formally established and the first MSG meeting was held in Naypyitaw on Saturday February
 th                                                                                     st
8 2014. Leading Authority formal notification establishing MSG – openly discussed at 1 MSG meeting among
members: CSOs requested some changes – in particular:
           There were concerns that the document was too similar to an MSG TOR
           There was concern that only CSO individual names were mentioned, not other stakeholder groups
           There was concern that the document didn’t specifically refer to the EITI Standard, especially 1.3
           CSOs requested changes in accordance with these concerns

Further to discussions and agreement at the first MSG meeting, the Chair of the MSG agreed that some changes
                                                                                                  th
to the notification could be made. As such, the Leading Authority re-issued the Notification on 18 February (date
of notification), and had it formally published it in the Government Gazette.
                                              th
The second MSG meeting took place on the 6 March 2014 and mostly focused on discussion of the draft TOR
                                                                                          th
document as well as progress on the draft Workplan. The third MSG meeting took place on 7 April. This included
discussion and approval of key documents and preparation of the candidacy application. The MSG TOR were not
quite approved by the MSG members. A final draft, with comments from that meeting incorporated was
circulated among MSG members during mid-late April so for their approval by the end of April (early May) at the
latest.

MEITI Stakeholders have the right to communicate and cooperate with each other. This is clear from the MSG
meetings and other EITI related events to date. Stakeholders are able to operate freely and express opinions
about the EITI.
In terms of capacity development, a Capacity and Training Needs Assessment is included in the Workplan, and a
training Plan for EITI stakeholders will be developed according to the needs identified. Many outreach activities
are also included in the Workplan. An MEITI communications strategy will also be developed which will include a
wide range of communications and outreach activities, including for the EITI Report.

All key stakeholders and their main constituency group representatives have been actively involved in the
process. In terms of liaison with broader constituency groups, each MSG constituency group is setting up
structures for liaison with their broader constituencies, and although these have not all been set up or formalised
yet, there has been extensive consultation among all constituency groups.




                                                                                                           28
For CSOs, there has been a considerable amount of broad consultation among constituencies, including
regional/subnational awareness-raising, workshops, conferences and other activities. The Myanmar Coalition for
Transparency (MC4T)- serving as an umbrella organisation for a number of CSO groups has now been ‘formally’
established and ensures regular and wider liaison with wider CSO constituencies around the country.

For the private sector, an ‘Oil and Gas Group’ of 18 companies (convened by Total) has met twice since January
2014 and will continue to meet on a regular basis. Mining sector representatives have yet to meet with a broader
mining constituency but have agreed to do this once the candidacy application has been submitted.

MSG Terms of Reference (TOR) development process:
At the first MSG Meeting in February 2014, two sub-committees were established, one of which was the Terms of
Reference sub-committee. The objective of this sub-committee was to meet and work together to develop the MSG
TOR. The TOR sub-committee meetings drew extensively from the recommendations in the MEITI Options Study
(prepared by an international EITI expert), which assessed various options for MSG governance and structure in
Myanmar, using several other international examples as benchmarks. The preferred suggested model comprised 21
members:
      6 government
      6 private sector (2 mining, 4 oil and gas)
      6 (or more) CSOs
Finally it was agreed that there should be 6 government and private sector representatives, and 9 CSO
representatives for Myanmar EITI’s MSG.
Three meetings of the MSG TOR sub-committee took place during February and March 2014. There was active
participation of all members during the meetings, and discussions and developments of the draft were based on
international good practice examples and the recommendations provided in the MEITI Options Study. After each
meeting, the draft TOR were amended in line with discussions, translated and shared among members for their
review and feedback. The final draft was agreed at 28th March meeting. A few further comments were received on
          th                                                                               th
Friday 4 April from CSO and private sector representatives. These were discussed during 7 April MSG meeting,
and some final small changes were agreed. It was also agreed that the final draft TOR would be shared with MSG
                        th
members on Friday 11 April for approval.

The TOR provides for alternates. Most MSG members have nominated their alternates and the rights and
responsibilities of alternates are clarified in the TOR.

Enabling environment:
MEITI stakeholders, both in the MSG and beyond, are able to speak freely on EITI, transparency and natural
resource governance issues. This has been clearly demonstrated at the end of 2013 and in early 2014 in a number
of media articles, (see e.g. CSO representative interviews here and Mon media articles), and in meetings and
workshops with companies and CSOs. It is clear (see also minutes of meetings) that CSOs and all MSG stakeholders
are free to talk and raise issues of concern. CSOs have established a comprehensive national governance structure
for EITI, which includes representatives in the States and Regions.

In terms ofan enabling environment for company and civil society participation with regard to relevant laws,
regulations, and administrative rules as well as actual practice in implementation of the EITI, it should be noted that
many CSOs have been actively lobbying and engaging with parliamentarians and government regarding reform of
relevant laws, in particular thedraft Association Registration Law (2013) and the Peaceful Assembly Law.

The Association Registration Law requires any CSO to be formally registered. This had caused concerns among CSO
groups, including some involved in the EITI process. It was raised as a key concern by CSOs in October 2013, as one
of a few issues the CSO group wanted clarification on before agreeing to go ahead and participate in EITI. At the
large CSO conference in early October, Dr Maung Maung Thein, Deputy Minister of Finance and MEITI MSG Chair,
publicly stated that any CSO wanting to engage in EITI does not need to be registered. The International Centre for
Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) highlights on its website the developments and updates regarding the Association
Registration Law process, and states that in January 2014, the Public Affairs Management Committee officially
submitted the Association Registration Law to the Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) in Myanmar. ICNL
notes that the Public Affairs Management Committee had already discussed the draft law with the Bills Committee
and with the Ministry of Home Affairs.




                                                                                                            29
Many CSO representatives have also been lobbying for amendment and review of Section 18 of Myanmar’s
Law on the Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession, which requires permission to be granted
for peaceful protest to take place. There has been some concern at the number of political prisoners in
Myanmar as a result of this provision. CSOs raised this as a major concern at the MEITI multi-stakeholder
                                          th
consultation meeting in Naypyitaw on 18 November 2013. Senior Minister U Soe Thein responded to CSO
concerns regarding political prisonersand publicly stated that a prominent female political prisoner would
be released that week. The President had also publicly committed to release all political prisoners by the
end of the year.

With regard to Section 18, the penalty had been one-year imprisonment for protesting without permission,
but the law was amended in January 2014, and now states that in the case of permission for a protest
being refused by government, the penalty for going ahead and protesting without prior permission has
been amended from one-year imprisonment to 6 months. Further amendments to Section 18 are on going
and anticipated.

In addition, there have been a number of other legal and regulatory reforms, including the 2012
Environmental Conservation Law which includes Environmental (and Social) Impact Assessment
requirements that will also extend to all new extractive industry contracts. Also, the government has
committed to implement the voluntary EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Facility. While
these reforms and initiatives are not specific to EITI, they are nevertheless indirectly associated, and
demonstrate the government’s commitment to broader reform and to providing an enabling environment.

It is also clear that EITI stakeholders are not, in practice, being impacted or restricted in terms of their
ability to participate in the EITI process.

REQUIREMENT 1.4
The multi-stakeholder group is required to maintain a current workplan, fully costed and aligned
with the reporting and Validation deadlines established by the EITI Board. The workplan must:

a) Set EITI implementation objectives that are linked to the EITI Principles and reflect national
priorities for the extractive industries. Multi-stakeholder groups are encouraged to explore innovative
approaches to extending EITI implementation to increase the comprehensiveness of EITI reporting
and public understanding of revenues and encourage high standards of transparency and
accountability in public life, government operations and in business.

b) Reflect the results of consultations with key stakeholders, and be endorsed by the multi-
stakeholder group.

c) Include measurable and time bound activities to achieve the agreed objectives. The scope of EITI
implementation should be tailored to contribute to the desired objectives that have been identified
during the consultation process. The workplan must:

         i. Assess and outline plans to address any potential capacity constraints in government
         agencies, companies and civil society that may be an obstacle to effective EITI
         implementation.

         ii.Address the scope of EITI reporting, including plans for addressing technical aspects of
         reporting, such as comprehensiveness and data reliability (Requirements 4 and 5).

         iii. Identify and outline plans to address any potential legal or regulatory obstacles to EITI
         implementation, including, if applicable, any plans to incorporate the EITI Requirements
         within national legislation or regulation.

d) Identify domestic and external sources of funding and technical assistance where appropriate, in
order to ensure timely implementation of the agreed workplan;

e) Be made widely available to the public, for example published on the national EITI website and/or
other relevant ministry and agency websites, in print media or in places that are easily accessible to
the public;

f) Be reviewed and updated annually. In reviewing the workplan, the multi-stakeholder group should
consider extending the detail and scope of EITI reporting including addressing issues such as revenue
management and expenditure (3.7-3.8), transportation payments (4.1.f), discretionary social
expenditures (4.1.e), ad-hoc subnational transfers (4.2.e), beneficial ownership (3.11) and contracts
(3.12). In accordance with requirement 1.3 (g)(viii), the multi- stakeholder group is required to
document its discussion and decisions;

g) Include a timetable for implementation that is aligned with the EITI reporting and Validation
deadlines established by the EITI Boardand that takes into account administrative requirements, such
as procurement processes and funding.




                                                                                                          31
At the first MSG meeting in February it was agreed to establish two sub-committees, including a ‘Workplan
Sub-Committee’. Each constituency group was invited to nominate representatives for the sub-committees.
The Workplan sub-committee comprises 3 government and3 private sector representatives, but just 2 CSO
representatives (2 in each sub-committee, as selected by CSOs). Despite not all members being able to attend
                                                                                            th      th
each meeting, significant progress was made during the meetings which took place on the 14 and 28
                               th       th
February, then again on the 14 and 28 March.

An initial draft document was developed which, after being reviewed by the International Secretariat and the
MEITI Technical Adviser, was found not to be in line with EITI Standard Requirements. Various additional
activities were proposed to ensure the minimum EITI Requirements are met. This draft was then shared with
                          th
members ahead of the 28 March final sub-commitee meeting, before approval by the MSG at the third MSG
               th
meeting on 7 April. All members of the sub-committee contributed to discussion and some small
                                           th
amendments were made to the draft. On 29 March a budget was added and all the comments and feedback
were incorporated and this version was shared with all members. No substantive comments on the budget
were received.

CSOs then had various meetings among themselves to consult on and discuss the final draft, and submitted
                                th                                      nd
final comments and feedback on 4 April. The Oil and Gas Group met on 2 April and also submitted final
                            th
comments and feedback on 4 April. The final draft was presented to the Government Working Committee
members at their meeting on xxxMarch/April?, and provided no further comments.
                                th
At the third MSG meeting on 7 April the Workplan was discussed and approved. It was agreed that while CSOs
still wanted to make more changes and additions to the document, these further suggested changes would be
clearly reflected in the MSG meeting minutes for future review of the Workplan. It was agreed that this was the
best approach given the time constraints faced by the MSG in terms of finalising all the documents to submit
the MEITI candidacy application by the end of April, rather than the time-consuming process required to
continue to make small amendments.

The Workplan includes measurable and time bound activities and a timetable for implementation. It includes a
‘training and capacity needs assessment’ and the development of a training plan which will specifically address
the needs identified. A number of other training and capacity development activities have also been included.
The scope of EITI implementation and Workplan activities is tailored to contribute to the desired objectives
identified. Various activities in the Workplan address the scope of reporting, including e.g. a ‘pre -scoping’
study/institutional and regulatory assessment (funded by the World Bank), a formal scoping study, and other
studies which will enable improved data quality.An initial legal review was completed in January 2014, which
assesses potential legal and regulatory obstacles and provides recommendations to government to overcome
such obstacles. A further legal study will be carried out and this is included in the Workplan. It will build on the
initial legal review and prepare government to embed and institutionalise EITI. The Workplan also includes
preparatory work and consultations for an EITI Bill.
                                      rd                          th
The Workplan was approved at the 3 MEITI MSG meeting on 7 April - including total budget estimate. The
MEITI Coordination Office is now planning a series of meetings to discuss funding options with the World Bank
and DFID and other potential donors. At the third MSG meeting the MEITI National Coordinator also confirmed
that during conversations with senior government in the previous week, it had been confirmed that MEITI will
be included in Myanmar’s national budget.

The Workplan includes an activity to be updated annually as well as a section on monitoring, evaluation and
continuous improvement, which includes the establishment of a monitoring sub-committee who can lead on
ensuring the review and updating of the Workplan, and extending the scope and detail on an annual basis.

The Workplan be published on MEITI website and other relevant locations by early May.

    D. Terms of Reference for the Independent Administrator

              For the production of Scoping Study and EITI Report

                       for the period April 2013- March 2014

         Myanmar Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (MEITI)

                      Approved by the MSG in December 2014

Background

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that
promotes transparency and accountability in the oil, gas and mining sectors. It has a
robust yet flexible methodology for disclosing and reconciling company payments
and government revenues in implementing countries.

EITI implementation has two core components:

      Transparency: oil, gas and mining companies disclose their payments to the
       government, and the government discloses its receipts. The figures are
       reconciled by an Independent Administrator, and published in annual EITI
       Reports alongside contextual and other information about the extractive
       sector.

      Accountability: a multi-stakeholder group (MSG) with representatives from
       government, companies and civil society is established to oversee the
       process and communicate the findings of the EITI Report, and promote the
       integration of EITI into broader transparency efforts in that country.

The EITI Standard encourages multi-stakeholder groups to explore innovative
approaches to extending EITI implementation to increase the comprehensiveness of
EITI reporting and public understanding of revenues and encourage high standards
of transparency and accountability in public life, government operations and in
business. It is a requirement that the MSG approves the terms of reference for the
Independent Administrator (requirement 5.2), drawing on the objectives and agreed
scope of the EITI as set out in the workplan. The MSG’s deliberations on these
matters should be in accordance with the MSG’s internal governance rules and
procedures (see requirement 1.3(g)). The EITI requires an inclusive decision-making
process throughout implementation, with each constituency being treated as a
partner.?

It is a requirement that the Independent Administrator is perceived by the multi-
stakeholder group to be credible, trustworthy and technically competent
(Requirement 5.1). The multi-stakeholder group and Independent Administrator
should addresses any concerns regarding conflicts of interest. The Independent
Administrator’s report will be submitted to the MSG for approval and made
publically available.



                                                                                    34
The requirements for implementing countries are set out in the EITI Standard1.
Additional information is available via www.eiti.org

These terms of reference include “agreed upon procedures? for EITI reporting (see
section 4) in accordance with EITI Requirement 5.2. The Board has developed these
procedures to promote greater consistency and reliability in EITI reporting. The EITI
process can be used to complement, assess, and improve existing reporting and
auditing systems. The Board recommends that the process relies as much as
possible on existing procedures and institutions, i.e., so that the EITI process draws
on, complements and critically evaluates existing data collection and auditing
systems. In this way, the EITI process has the potential to generate important
recommendations to strengthen other oversight systems.

EITI Implementation in Myanmar

The President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Thein Sein made a formal
commitment to become an EITI Candidate country at the end of 2012, through
Presidential Decree no 99/2012.This established the government ‘Leading
Authority’ (chaired by the President’s Office) and the Centre for Economic and
Social Development of the Myanmar Development Resources Institute (MDRI-
CESD) was designated the national MEITI Coordination Office. A government inter-
ministerial ‘Working Group’ for EITI, comprising 12 members, was established in
April 2013. Significant progress was made throughout 2013, and by May 2014
Myanmar was ready to submit its candidacy application to the EITI Board.

At its 27th meeting on 2-3 July 2014, the EITI Board approved Myanmar’s candidacy
application, and granted Myanmar until January 2016 to produce its first EITI
Report. Myanmar now has until January 2017 to meet all 7 of the EITI Requirements
and attain ‘EITI Compliant’ status.

MEITI’s multi-stakeholder group (MSG) comprising 21 representatives of
government, civil society and private sector, is now working to implement MEITI’s 3-
year workplan and prepare for the production of the first MEITI Report.

The MEITI workplan (attached in Annex 1) is aligned around 4 key objectives:

       Contribute to broader reform for resource governance

       Create an enabling environment for EITI

       Prepare and facilitate the process for implementing EITI

       Increase the accessibility of data (Communication and Information
        Sharing)

The MSG has established a Technical and Reporting Sub-Committee, which has
responsibility for overseeing the scoping and reconciliation process, on behalf of,

and with, the MSG.

Objectives of the assignment

On behalf of the MSG, the World Bank and the Government of Myanmar seek a
competent and credible firm, free from conflicts of interest, to provide Independent
Administrator services in accordance with the EITI Standard. The objectives of the
assignment are to:

   i.      Part 1: Produce a scoping study to inform the MSG’s decision on the
           scope of the 2013-2014 EITI Report (MEITI workplan activity 3.2.4) –

                                                                                   36
Phase 1 – Preliminary Analysis, Scoping Study and Summary Inception Report

Background: The objective of the first phase of work is to ensure that the scope of
the EITI reporting process has been clearly defined, including the reporting
templates, data collection procedures, and the schedule for publishing the EITI
Report. It is imperative that the scope of EITI reporting is clearly defined, in line with
the EITI Standard and with the MSG’s agreed objectives and expectations for the
EITI process. The findings from the first phase should be documented in a scoping
study report (see 1.3 below) for the MSG. After the MSG agrees the scope, a
summary inception report (see 1.4 below) should be produced.

Phase 1 will be under contract with the World Bank whereas the remaining phases
(2-5) will be under contract with the Government of Myanmar.

The Independent Administrator is expected to undertake the following tasks:

1.1    The Independent Administrator should review the relevant background
       information, including the governance arrangements and tax policies in the
       extractive industries, the findings from any preliminary scoping work, the
       MSG workplan, and the conclusions and recommendations from previous
       MEITI-related reports where applicable. (A list of relevant documentation
       is provided as Annex 1).

1.2    The MSG has agreed that for the purpose of the scoping study, the extractive
       sector in Myanmar for 2013-2014 shall be defined as:
             Oil and gas
             Mining (including jade and gemstones, according to formal
                 government Gem Emporium data)

1.3    The Independent Administrator should produce a scoping study report to
       inform the MSG’s decision on the scope of the 2013-2014 EITI Report. The
       scoping report should recommend a 5-year ‘reporting roadmap’ of
       progressively expanded reporting. In producing the scoping report, the
       Independent Administrator is expected to:

Contextual information

i.     Review and summarise the legal framework governing the extractive
       industries in accordance with EITI Requirement 3.2. The consultant
       should draw on existing studies, such as the MEITI Legal Review.
ii.    Provide a descriptive overview of the extractive sector in accordance with
       EITI Requirement 3.3. The consultant should identify and draw on
       existing sources of information.
iii.   In accordance with EITI Requirement 3.4 and reflecting MEITI workplan
       activity 1.2.5, prepare a summary of the contribution of the extractive
       industries to the economy for 2013-2014.This should include information
       on the artisanal and small-scale mining sector where possible (MEITI
       workplan activity 1.2.7), and assess the quality of data from small-scale



                                                                                       37
        mining license holders, where possible, including its volume and its
        relative significance within Myanmar’s extractive industries and the
        economy overall.
iv.     Identify sources of information about production and export data,
        comment on the quality and reliability of the data, and identify a
        mechanism for disclosing production and export figures in the 2013-2014
        report (in accordance with EITI Requirement 3.5 and MEITI workplan
        activity 1.2.5).
v.      In accordance with EITI Requirement 3.6 and MEITI workplan activity
        1.2.9 and 1.2.10, investigate the role of state-owned companies in the
        extractive sector and suggest an approach for reporting on financial
        relationships between the government and the SOEs, quasi-fiscal
        expenditures, and government ownership in oil, gas and mining
        companies operating in Myanmar in 2013-2014. This should include
        identifying any barriers to comprehensive disclosure for the EITI report.
vi.     Propose a framework for reporting on revenue allocations and
        distribution of revenues in 2013-2014, in accordance with EITI
        Requirements 3.7 and 3.8, including identifying government reporting
        entities and sources of information.
vii.    Review the currently available information about license holders in 2013-
        2014 and assess the completeness and timeliness of the information.
        Where the information about license holders requested in EITI
        requirement 3.9.b is not comprehensive or accessible, the Independent
        Administrator should propose a mechanism for reporting and disclosure
        in accordance with EITI Requirements 3.9.
viii.   Review the currently available information about license allocations in
        2013-2014, and assess the completeness and timeliness of the
        information. Where the information set out in 3.10 is not publicly
        available, the Independent Administrator should propose a mechanism
        for reporting and disclosure in accordance with EITI Requirements 3.10
        and MEITI workplan activity 1.2.13.
ix.     In accordance with Myanmar’s workplan objectives and activity 1.2.12,
        the Independent Administrator should propose a definition of beneficial
        ownership consistent with EITI requirement 3.11.d, and a mechanism for
        reporting and disclosure in accordance with EITI Requirements 3.11.a-b.
        A model beneficial ownership declaration form is available from the EITI
        International Secretariat.
x.      In accordance with EITI Requirement 3.12 (b), review and document
        Myanmar’s policy on disclosure of contracts and licenses that govern the
        exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals. This should include
        a summary of relevant legal provisions, actual disclosure practices and
        any reforms that are planned or underway.
xi.     In accordance with Myanmar’s workplan objectives and activity 1.2.14:
           a. Canvass stakeholder’s views and international practice on contract
              transparency


                                                                                38
               b. Propose options for how the MSG might wish to consider
                  approaching contract disclosure
               c. Assess the feasibility and steps necessary in order to disclose
                  relevant contractual information relating to the objectives of the
                  EITI and, in accordance with the existing law, the encouragement
                  in requirement 3.12 (a) and step 1.2.14 of the MEITI workplan.
xii.       Include an overview of major Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
           programmes and social development funds at state/regional level.
xiii.      Identify any barriers to disclosure of contextual information set out
           above, and set out options and make recommendations for addressing
           these barriers.

EITI reconciliation

xiv.       Undertake a comprehensive analysis of the payments and government
           revenue streams related to the extractive sector (as defined by the MSG in
           1.2 above) noting in particular the revenues streams that must be covered
           in accordance with EITI Requirement 4.1 (b). The analysis should also
           cover revenues related to the sale of the state’s share of production or
           other revenues collected in-kind (4.1.c), infrastructure provisions and
           other barter arrangements (4.1.d), mandatory and voluntary social
           expenditures (4.1.e and MEITI workplan activity 1.2.14), and
           transportation payments, such as pipeline transit fees (4.1.f).
xv.        Taking into account the findings of vii above, review cadastre (or best
           equivalent and relevant source) and revenue data from 2013-2014 and
           make recommendations as to which of these tax payments and
           government revenue streams should be considered material, including
           suggesting materiality thresholds for company disclosure if appropriate
           (with reference to guidance note 2 and EITI requirement 4.1 and MEITI
           workplan activity 3.2.5).
xvi.       Based on the proposed materiality definition, develop a preliminary list of
           the companies that make material payments and should be covered in the
           EITI Report (EITI requirement 4.2.a). Where materiality thresholds are
           proposed, this should include an estimate of coverage of company
           payments that will be disclosed relative to total government revenues
           from the sector. It should also identify the total contribution of companies
           not required to report (i.e. those that fall below the materiality threshold),
           with a clear indication of the relative size of each company. (This
           information will inform the assessment of the comprehensiveness of the
           EITI Report as per Requirement 5.3.c).
xvii.      For each company, identify where available:
               a. Company’s Tax Payer Identification Number

    Guidance note on defining materiality: http://eiti.org/document/guidance-notes



                                                                                      39
           b. Sector and phase of operation, i.e. exploration, production, oil, gas,
              mining etc.
           c. Type of license(s) held and the license number(s).
xviii. Based on the proposed materiality definition, identify which government
       entities should be required to report. It should be noted that the
       government is required to disclose all revenues, regardless of the
       materiality (EITI Requirement 4.2.b). Thus where materiality thresholds
       for company disclosures are established, a reconciliation of the company
       payments and government revenues in accordance with the materiality
       threshold would be appropriate. Any additional government revenues
       (i.e. from companies below the materiality threshold) would also need to
       be disclosed in the EITI Report as per Requirement 4.2.b.
xix.    In considering which government entities should be disclosed, the
        consultant should identify whether sub-national government entities
        receive direct or indirect revenues from the extractive sector in
        accordance with Requirement 4.2(d) and Requirement 4.2(e), and MEITI
        workplan activity 1.2.11.
xx.     Identify any legal, regulatory, administrative or practical barriers to
        comprehensive disclosure, and if necessary set out options and make and
        recommendations for addressing these barriers.
Data quality
xxi.  In accordance with EITI Requirement 5.2(b), examine the audit and
      assurance procedures in companies and government entities that are
      likely to participate in the EITI reporting process, including the relevant
      laws and regulations, any reforms that are planned or underway, and
      whether these procedures are in line with international standards.
xxii.   In accordance with EITI Requirement 5.2(c), The Independent
        Administrator should provide advice to the MSG on what information the
        MSG should require to be provided to the Independent Administrator by
        the participating companies and government entities to assure the
        credibility of the data in accordance with Requirement 5.2(c). The
        Independent Administrator should then employ his /her professional
        judgement to determine the extent to which reliance can be placed on the
        existing controls and audit frameworks of the companies and
        governments. The Independent Administrator should document the
        options considered and the rationale for the assurances to be provided.
        Where deemed necessary by the Independent Administrator and the
        multi-stakeholder group, assurances may include:
           a. Requesting sign-off from a senior company or government official
              from each reporting entity attesting that the completed reporting
              form is a complete and accurate record.
           b. Requesting a confirmation letter from the companies’ external
              auditor that confirms that the information they have submitted is
              comprehensive and consistent with their audited financial
              statements. The MSG may wish to phase in any such procedure so
              that the confirmation letter may be integrated into the usual work


                                                                                  40
               programme of the company’s auditor. Where some companies are
               not required by law to have an external auditor and therefore
               cannot provide such assurance, this should be clearly identified,
               and any reforms that are planned or underway should be noted.
           c. Where relevant and practicable, requesting that government

              government’s disclosures from their external auditor or
              equivalent.
        The Independent Administrator should exercise judgement and apply
        appropriate international professional standards in developing a
        procedure that provide a sufficient basis for a comprehensive and reliable
        EITI Report.

Presentation
xxiii. Prepare and present the draft scoping study to the MSG, the World Bank
       and the International Secretariat for review and comment. MSG members
       may then share the draft with their constituency groups for comments
       and feedback.
xxiv.   Prepare a final scoping study report to the MSG and provide options and
        recommendations for the 2013-2014 EITI report.
xxv.    Recommend how future scoping study reports can be improved.




1.4 After the MSG has considered the options and recommendations of the scoping
    study, and agreed the scope accordingly, the Independent Administrator should
    produce a summary Inception Report for consideration by the MSG. The
    Inception Report should:

           a. Confirm the MSG’s position and agreed approach on the issues
              addressed in the scoping report (point 1.3.i-xxii above).
           b. Confirm how the contextual and other non-revenue information in
              the EITI Report (point 1.3.i-xiii above) will be incorporated and
              analysed, as per agreement with the MSG. Information should be
              clearly sourced and attributed.
           c. Confirm the level and type of disaggregation of the EITI Report in
              accordance with Requirement 5.2(e).
           d. Provide advice to the MSG on agreeing appropriate provisions
              relating to safeguarding confidential information.
           e. Where necessary highlight any unresolved issues or potential
              barriers to effective implementation, and possible remedies for
              consideration by the MSG.
           f. Include draft reporting templates developed by the Independent
              Administrator for consideration and approval by the MSG based on


                                                                                 41
              the agreed benefit streams to be reported and the reporting
              entities (1.3 above). Sample templates are available from the
              International Secretariat. It is recommended that the templates
              include a provision requiring companies to report “any other
              material payments to government entities? above an agreed
              threshold.

Phase 2 – Data Collection
Phases 2-5 of the work will be under contract with the Government of Myanmar,
whereas Phase 1 will be under contract with the World Bank.

2.1    The Independent Administrator is mandated by the MSG to distribute the
       reporting templates and collect the completed forms and associated
       supporting documentation, as well as any other contextual or other
       information requested to be collected by the MSG, directly from the
       participating reporting entities. The government should provide contact
       details for the reporting entities and assists the Independent Administrator
       in ensuring that all reporting entities participate fully. The MSG will provide
       oversight, and the MEITI Secretariat will support the facilitation of this
       process.

2.2    In accordance with MEITI workplan activity 3.2.6 and at the direction of the
       MSG, the Independent Administrator should develop guidance to the
       reporting entities, and should provide training on how to complete the
       reporting templates.

2.3    The Independent Administrator is mandated to contact the reporting
       entities directly to clarify any information gaps or discrepancies.




Phase 3 – Initial Reconciliation and Initial Reconciliation Report

3.1    The Independent Administrator should compile a database with the data
       provided by the reporting entities.

3.2    The Independent Administrator should comprehensively reconcile the
       information disclosed by the reporting entities, identifying any discrepancies
       (including offsetting discrepancies) in accordance with the agreed scope.

3.3    The Independent Administrator should prepare an initial reconciliation
       report based on the reported (unadjusted) data for consideration by the MSG
       in accordance with the agreed scope.

3.4    The Independent Administrator should identify any discrepancies above the
       agreed margin of error established at 5% of total revenues.



                                                                                   42
3.5   With respect to contextual information and other data collected by the
      Independent Administrator or provided to the Independent Administrator by
      the government or MSG: the Independent Administrator will compile the
      data collected by the government, MSG, or reporting entities and prepare an
      initial report based on the reported contextual and other information in the
      format agreed by the MSG for reporting this information.



Phase 4 – Investigation of Discrepancies and Draft Independent Administrator’s
Report

4.1   The Independent Administrator is mandated to contact the reporting
      entities in seeking to clarify any discrepancies in the reported data.

4.2   The Independent Administrator should prepare a draft Independent
      Administrator’s Report that comprehensively reconciles the information
      disclosed by the reporting entities, identifying any discrepancies, and reports
      on contextual and other information requested by the MSG.

4.3   The draft Independent Administrator’s report should:

      a. Describe the methodology adopted for the reconciliation of company
         payments and government revenues, and demonstrate the application of
         international professional standards
      b. Include a description of each revenue stream, related materiality
         definitions and thresholds (Requirement 4.1).
      c. Include an assessment from the Independent Administrator on the
         comprehensiveness and reliability of the data presented, including an
         informative summary of the work performed by the Independent
         Administrator and the limitations of the assessment provided.
      d. Based on the government's disclosure of total revenues as per
         Requirement 4.2(b), indicate the coverage of the reconciliation exercise.
      e. Include an assessment of whether all companies and government entities
         within the agreed scope of the EITI reporting process provided the
         requested information. Any gaps or weaknesses in reporting to the
         Independent Administrator must be disclosed in the EITI Report,
         including naming any entities that failed to comply with the agreed
         procedures, and an assessment of whether this is likely to have had
         material impact on the comprehensiveness of the report (Requirement
         5.3(d)).
      f. Document whether the participating companies and government entities
         had their financial statements audited in the financial year(s) covered by
         the EITI Report. Any gaps or weaknesses must be disclosed. Where
         audited financial statements are publicly available, it is recommended




                                                                                  43
           that the EITI Report advises readers on how to access this information
           (Requirement 5.3(e)).

4.4    The Independent Administrator should make recommendations for
       strengthening the reporting process in the future, including any
       recommendations regarding audit practices and reforms needed to bring
       them in line with international standards. Initially, these recommendations
       will be for the MSG only, then, subject to their approval, can be included in
       the final report.

4.5    The Independent Administrator is encouraged to make recommendations on
       strengthening the template Terms of Reference for Independent
       Administrator services in accordance with the EITI Standard for the attention
       of the EITI Board.

4.6    The Independent Administrator should make recommendations for
       integrating EITI disclosures in government systems.



Phase 5 – Final Independent Administrator’s Report

5.1    The Independent Administrator should produce electronic data files that can
       be published together with the final Report.

5.2    The Independent Administrator should provide machine-readable files
       and/or code or tag EITI Reports and data files. The Independent
       Administrator should recommend the best format and approach for doing
       so.

5.3    Following approval by the MSG, the Independent Administrator is mandated
       to submit summary data from the EITI Report electronically to the
       International Secretariat according to the standardised reporting format
       available from the International Secretariat (Requirement 5.3(b).

The Independent Administrator will publish/make public their final report only upon
the instruction of the MSG. The MSG will endorse the report prior to its publication.
Where stakeholders other than the Independent Administrator wish to include
additional comments in, or opinions on, the EITI Report, the authorship should be
clearly indicated.

Qualification requirements for Independent Administrators

The reconciliation of company payments and government revenues must be
undertaken by an Independent Administrator applying international professional
standards (Requirement 5.1). It is a requirement that the Independent Administrator
is perceived by the MSG to be credible, trustworthy and technically competent
(ibid). Bidders must follow (and show how they will apply) the appropriate




                                                                                    44
professional standards for the reconciliation / agreed-upon-procedures work in
preparing their report.

The Independent Administrator will need to demonstrate:

       a. Expertise and experience in the oil, gas and mining sectors in Myanmar.

       b. Expertise in accounting, auditing and financial analysis.

       c. A track record in similar work. Previous experience in EITI reporting is not
          required, but would be advantageous.

       d. Inclusion of a local expert/partner on the team is not required, but would
          be advantageous.

       Industries In Myanmar – Briefing For Ministry Of Finance/GOUM


  Briefing on revenue streams accruing from extractive industries in Myanmar

The extractive industries in Myanmar contribute to federal revenue generation
through a variety of instruments which in combination make up the fiscal regime. In
general terms, the fiscal instruments aim to capture four dimensions:

   1. Resource rent (or royalty or production sharing) in order to compensate the
      state for use of its natural resources.

   2. Variable income tax which is often in line with the general corporate income
      tax.

   3. “Windfall tax?, which is more common in the petroleum industry, in order for
      the state to benefit from “super-normal? returns which can be realized when
      high commodity prices allow an especially high profit after subtracting actual
      costs of production (according to available information, “windfall tax? in
      Myanmar is based entirely on production quantity since the government
      production share increases in percentage as a function of production output.
      On the other hand, sales value – hence profit – is not considered when
      calculating the government production share. As a consequence, the prevailing
      Myanmar “windfall tax? does not consider how price fluctuations may impact
      operators’ profit margin).

   4. Administrative fee to off-set government’s cost of regulation and oversight.

Important differences exist between the fiscal regimes for solid mineral extraction as
compared to the fiscal regime applying to the petroleum industry. The following
tables define the general terms applied in Myanmar with definition of the actual rate
applied as well as the recipient agency in charge of collection.

It should be noted that the current legal framework allows a certain discretion to the
authorities to modify or negotiate the terms. For instance, paragraph 20 (b) of the
Mines Law allows the Ministry to “exempt in whole or part, any royalty payable on
any mineral by the holder of a permit for such period as may be determined with a
view to promoting production of the mineral?. Likewise, the actual production sharing
arrangement and government’s equity participation can be negotiated.

It should also be noted that the arrangement of production sharing in the extraction of
solid minerals is not practiced internationally, as opposed to the petroleum industry



                                                                                     49
where the practice is generally accepted. Production sharing puts a significant burden
on the operator’s cash-flow, and acts in effect as an additional resource rent on top of
the royalty payment, when both are applied.

Comparison

The following chart traces the fiscal contributions by category in the mining sector in
Lao PDR. As can be seen, the Lao categories are very similar to the Myanmar
situation with the important exception of the Production Sharing component. Similar
trends would be observed in most other mining jurisdictions.

Effective collection of payments

A number of challenges may arise when rules and principles are applied in practice.
First, a common constraint in many countries is authorities’ problems in assessing the


                                                                                                      51
tax returns and payments made by operators. Very often operators’ calculations are
taken at face value without any audit performed by tax authorities. This may result in
issues such as under/overvaluation of sales or purchase prices, i.e. transfer pricing
with the intent to shift taxable income to the jurisdiction with lowest rates. Other
consequences may be incorrect calculation of depreciation, deduction of ineligible
expenses, etc. All of which at the risk of reducing the payments made to host
government.

Second constraint relates to clear definition of the source of taxation in order to
distinguish between different fiscal contributions, e.g. reporting which aggregates
corporate profit tax with excise taxes, import tariffs, etc. Along the same lines, tax
declarations may be filed on “net basis?, that is after companies have unilaterally
deducted tax exemptions or credits such as VAT reimbursement or others. The effect
of both practices is that authorities will have difficulties controlling and auditing the
tax declarations.

A third shortcoming which is reported in Myanmar is irregular tax payments which
lump together several quarters of tax payment or payment in instalments.

EITI reporting

The primary objective of the EITI is to shed more light on individual companies’ tax
contributions. A derived benefit of the EITI in Myanmar is expected to be that the
EITI would help provide a systematic picture of the payment streams from the
extractive industries. It should be stressed, however, that the EITI is a reporting tool
which can be vehicle to report financial data and payments which are already
available. EITI is not a financial management tool since it does not replace any tax
administration or treasury functions. In conclusion, the EITI can be a useful tool to
define some of the needs which must be filled in order for public financial authorities
to manage and account for the important revenue streams accruing from the extractive
industries.

from 2011 is attached. The report includes illustrative reporting templates, and was

requirements.

   D. 13 – 14 February 2014 – Presentation: Review of the Government’s
      Regulatory Oversight Responsibilities and Framework for Onshore and
      Offshore Project Development at US Department of State Energy
      Governance and Capacity Initiative sponsored workshop on "Environmental
      Information Analysis and Compliance in Oil and Gas Exploration,? Nay Pyi
      Taw (in English and Myanmar)


      Good Morning – Thank you to MoE, colleagues from the US State Dept and
       Norway. Very much the opportunity to be here and to talk about issues of
       great importance for Myanmar and where we hope we will be able to
       offer assistance relevant to Myanmar’s needs

      My presentation today will focus on regulatory responsibilities and
       framework. Tomorrow, my colleagues Peter Leonard, Ruxandra Floruiu,
       and Reidar Kvam will discuss the role of civil society and companies in
       environmental monitoring and management

      Before I turn to my presentation, I would like to reiterate that we are
       appreciative of the opportunity to be part of this discussion and to say a
       few words about the World Bank

      World Bank – source of funds, but also a source of expertise, and
       promoter of global standards – and in this area we can be all three.




                                                                                         62
   EITI - technical assistance, support for the process. Also involved in
    improving governance and public financial management – connected to
    EITI. Also bring environmental expertise and historically played role in
    promoting environmental standards, including through our safeguards
    processes.

   My presentation will focus on Government’s regulatory responsibilities
    and frameworks. My presentation does not describe how things in
    Myanmar but on how institutions in general, principles and standards,
    and tools and processes work together on environmental management.
    Focusing on oil and gas, but many of the issues also common to mining.

   EI – large topic – generates wealth but also large environmental impacts
    compared to almost any other kind of industry. Pollutants that can hurt
    people, animals, and plants for generations. EI would not work if did not
    have environmental standards – people would get angry, shut down –
    impacts would be devastating that would make areas around operations
    unlivable. Environment can’t be thought of something that is separate – is
    part of what it is to do extractives

   WE think of EI as the Value Chain – what changes country’s natural
    wealth into sustainable development. Five phases – Award of contracts
    and licenses to Implementation of sustainable development polices with
    revenues produced. EITI, which I will talk about a little later, increases
    accountability and transparency at each step.

   As I said, extractive operations have multiple actors. Important to define
    role. Regulators – how each of these actors plays a role.

   Government – starting point. Regulator – Sector ministry (MoE) and
    environmental agency (ECC) – Sets rules of the game

   Looking at the regulatory responsibilities:

   Sector

       o Policy – how manage sector, role will play, what want from the
         sector
       o Licensing
       o Compliance
       o Data – need to know what is going on – both revenue and impacts

   Environmental agency:
       o Environmental policy and standards
       o Practical – assessments and plans
       o Monitoring

   Government each stage – rules that will apply



                                                                               63
       o Planning – where – how to increase new exploration and
         production
       o Exploration – what are the environment standards, what
         disclosures, transparency – avoids problems down the line
       o Production – ongoing operations in line with regulations,
         emergency/non-routine
       o Decommissioning

   Not just government – CSOs, Parliament, Industry, International
    agreements – many of these

   Basic principles that are accepted internationally – operator
    responsibility
       o Social license – the idea that government can give a license but
           unless surrounding communities and other stakeholders do, can’t
           operate. Lepataung example of an operation which lost license –
           had operated for 10 years or more; new company – jobs, land,
           other issues – lost social license
       o Polluter pays
       o Environmental compliance - not an add on – from day one
       o Public involvement – can’t be credible unless public involved and
           unless engaged will have problems in relationship with community
       o ESIA, ESMAP, etc… - fundamental tools

   Turning to the specifics – Environmental management systems – day to
    day and catastrophes

   Participation – some of the principles

   International standards and initiatives – many, won’t go through in detail.
    Also don’t know which ones Myanmar already part of – but will highlight
    a few which are particularly important

     Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative – quantifying gas emissions –
      climate change – emissions from oil/gas but also from exploration and
      production
     UNEP Offshore Oil and Gas Environment Forum (OEF) Emissions from
      the Offshore Oil and Gas Environment Forum – UN Environment
      Program
     Voluntary Principles - Security Issues and Human Rights
     International Maritime Organization – UN Agency/ Prevention of
      Water Pollution by Oil
     IMO & IPIECA - Contingency plan for international oil spills –
      (http://www.ipieca.org/) – really important – IPIECA is industry
      body/IMO is UN agency. What to do in case of spills in international
      waters?




                                                                            64
        Basel Convention - Control of Transboundary Movements of
         Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989
         by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in
         response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in
         Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic
         wastes imported from abroad

        Convention on Migratory Species - The Convention on the Conservation of
           Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or Bonn Convention) aims to
           conserve terrestrial, aquatic and avian migratory species throughout their range. It is an
           intergovernmental treaty, concluded under the aegis of the United Nations Environment
           Programme, concerned with the conservation of wildlife and habitats on a global scale.
           Since the Convention's entry into force on 1 November 1983, its membership has grown
           steadily to include 119 Parties (as of 1 April 2013) from Africa, Central and South America,
           Asia, Europe and Oceania.


        Framework Convention on Climate Change – Overarching UN Body to
         address climate change

        Biodiversity Convention - Convention on biological diversity

        UN Law of the Sea - The United Nations Convention on the Law of
         the Sea (UNCLOS), also called the Law of the Sea Convention or the
         Law of the Sea treaty, is the international agreement that resulted
         from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea
         (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982. The Law of
         the Sea Convention defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in
         their use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses,
         the environment, and the management of marine natural resources.
         The Convention, concluded in 1982, replaced four 1958 treaties.
         UNCLOS came into force in 1994, a year after Guyana became the 60th
         nation to sign the treaty.[1] As of August 2013, 165 countries and the
         European Union have joined in the Convention. However, it is
         uncertain as to what extent the Convention codifies customary
         international law.

        MARPOL – International convention for the Prevention of Pollution
         from Ships, 1973. Protocol in 1978, following tanker accidents –
         minizing accidental and routine pollution

              Regional Sea Conventions (Barcelona, OSPAR, Kuwait, etc.)


      This list shows the different topics and which organizations or
       conventions deal with which topics

        Environmental principles (ex. E&P Forum/EUROPIA)

E & P Forum – The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP) is a
global forum in which members identify and share best practices to achieve



                                                                                                   65
improvements in health, safety, the environment, security, social responsibility,
engineering and operations.

The association was formed in 1974 to develop effective communications between the
upstream industry and an increasingly complex network of international regulators.
Originally called the E&P Forum (for oil and gas exploration and production[1]), in
1999 the name International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP) was adopted.
Most of the world’s leading publicly traded, private and state-owned oil & gas
companies, oil & gas associations and major upstream service companies are
members. OGP members produce more than half the world’s oil and about one third
of its gas.


        Management systems (E&P Forum), (API), (UNEP)
         API – American Petroleum Institute – trade association, which
         develops and maintains environmental standards in line with US EPA
        Chemical usage (API)
        Waste management (E&P Forum)
        Drilling muds (E&P Forum)

acted as a discussant. Myanma Oil & Gas Enterprise, Myanma Petrochemical
Enterprise and Myanma Petroleum Products Enterprise presented reviews of
their strategic plans for corporate development and partnerships. Various sector
experts and World Bank staff presented practices and experience concerning
energy sector and corporate governance. The following is a summary of the
discussion and findings of the roundtable:




                                                                                  78
1. Modernization and corporate reforms of SEEs will be needed to meet
   the increasing and changing demands from consumers and government
   in Myanmar, but important pre-conditions and potential consequences
   should be considered:
    Various reform measures which are presently introduced are leading to a
      degree of separation between line ministries and SEEs (e.g. separation of
      cost centers, introduction of new tax instruments, etc.). It is essential that
      such reforms be guided by a strategic plan for oil and gas sector value
      creation in Myanmar.
    The current separation of SEEs from the control of line ministries allows
      greater independence to SEEs but is also putting more financial pressure
      on SEE cash flow.
    All SEEs are promoting strategies of joint venture partnerships in order to
      gain access to technological know-how and mobilize capital for ambitious
      investment plans.
    Government stake is to be funded by existing assets. But it is not clear
      what methodology is applied to assure that existing assets are priced at
      “fair market value?.
    The current strategy to form joint ventures may create benefits, but
      should support a larger corporatization and modernization strategy in
      order to protect the core value of the SEEs. To this end, other forms of
      corporate reforms should also be considered.
    Capacity to fund and oversee joint ventures may become a challenge as
      high priority activities are included in the reform processes.
    Corporate reforms must be accompanied by regulatory strengthening in
      order to avoid unintended consequences, such as creation of monopolies,
      neglect of unprofitable market segments, etc.

2. Petroleum sector growth is needed to fuel Myanmar’s economy:
    Most of Myanmar’s existing oil and gas fields have reached peak
      production and can expect declining productivity over coming years as
      reserves get depleted. As a consequence new exploration and
      development should be encouraged.
    Domestic demand for gas, primarily for power generation will require
      600-1000 MMCFD additional gas supply by 2030.
    Gas and petrochemical industries can generate important job creation,
      but more importantly, reliable domestic gas, and electricity, supply is a
      pre-condition for growth in the manufacturing industry and productivity
      gains in the agricultural sector.
    Natural gas will continue to represent Myanmar’s largest contribution to
      foreign exchange earnings and government revenue through export sales.




                                                                                 79
      Natural gas use and pricing policies must be carefully planned to
       encourage a growing portfolio of supply and balanced export/domestic
       demand.
      Growth will require greater transparency in the upstream sector of
       exploration and production, midstream reform to support construction of
       open access pipelines, and increase in government capacity to govern
       upstream and midstream operations.

3. Policy reforms and sector regulation must support a cohesive,
   cooperative natural gas value chain for critical natural gas development
   and use:
    Exploration and production (upstream), gathering, treatment, processing,
      transport and distribution (midstream), and end use products
      (downstream), including export, make up the natural gas value chain.
    Coordination, cooperation and planning is required across all components
      of the value chain.
    A key element is midstream services, often funded and operated by SEE
      on an “open access? basis until this component reaches a critical mass and
      can be operated at a profit on a stand-alone basis.
    The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is a good example of a country, with
      gas reserves similar to Myanmar that has used a value-added policy to
      attract Direct Foreign Investment in natural gas use industry to improve
      its economy.
    Strong government support at the highest levels, long-range master
      planning, and price/tariff policies which support the natural gas value
      chain are necessary to maximize the value of gas reserves.

4. Revenue management is a critical component of corporate governance
   of the Myanmar SEEs:
    SEEs represent approximately 40% of government tax income collection.
    SEEs are also playing critical roles as “quasi-fiscal? agents through
       financing of pensions, infrastructure, services, etc.
    Regulation of private and corporate enterprises is still developing and not
       yet complete (e.g. limited regulation of financial reporting and audits, no
       stock exchange, etc.)
    Profit-making SEEs are now enjoying greater flexibility and can retain
       after-tax profits in separate “Other Accounts?.
    Different models exist across the world for ownership and revenue
       management of National Oil and Resource Companies, and different
       country case studies and lessons should be explored by Myanmar
       authorities.




                                                                               80
       No single “best practice? model can be recommended, and authorities
        should expect that the chosen model must be refined and revised over
        time.


    F. Discussion note: Corporate governance strengthening in the Myanmar
       energy sector and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise

   I.      Country context

Beginning in 2011, Myanmar launched major political and economic
transformations aimed at increasing openness, public empowerment and
inclusion in order to introduce broad-based democratic and market-based
reforms. Job creation and productivity enhancement, together with poverty
reduction, rank among the top priorities on the national reform agenda. To this
end, government has initiated a program of improvements to the performance of
State Economic Enterprises (SEE) in an effort to nurture drivers of growth.
Efforts to date include outright privatization and sale or transfer of assets in
some industries. In other sectors with high strategic importance to economic
development, institutional strengthening has been paired with action plans
introducing market-based transactions in a more gradual manner.

Development partners, including the World Bank (WB), have provided
assistance on stand-alone basis to a variety of strategic enterprises and to the
ministries in charge of overall sector planning and regulation. Moreover, a World
Bank mission undertook a cross-sector review of corporate governance options
which were discussed at a conference in July, 2014.

The power sector has been one of the first-movers with the Yangon Electricity
Supply Board (YESB) embarking on commercial reforms as part of the strategy
to improve and expand service delivery. Experience from these reforms, as well
as others in the transport sector and elsewhere, will be important for other SEEs
and industries.

The Ministry of Energy (MOE) and Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise (MOGE) MOE
have also initiated a reform process with the support from development
partners such as the US State Department and the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation (NORAD). A comprehensive suite of support is going
to the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
in which MOGE and MOE are central partners.

It is indisputable that MOGE and associated national energy companies
(including Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise and Myanmar Petroleum
Products Enterprise) will play a pivotal role in the national reform process.
MOGE is a key contributor to government revenue mobilization thanks to gas
exports. Moreover, reliable energy supply will be a determining factor for
enhanced productivity and economic growth and development. In the recent
Investment Climate Assessment, access to electricity was identified by firms as
the third-most-important constraint to doing business in Myanmar. Almost all


                                                                              81
firms in Myanmar face power outages due to insufficient network capacity and
fuel supplies. Inadequate supply of fuel sources and fertilizer is constraining
agricultural productivity, while manufacturing and heavy industries suffer from
inadequate oil and gas supplies.

MOGE has responded to the challenges by introducing various changes to its
corporate governance and operational set-up. In addition, subsidiary enterprises
have been created for specialized operations. In recognition of the need for more
comprehensive reforms, Myanmar government and MOGE have requested
support for sustaining the corporate change process. In light of the early
achievements and lessons, there is a need to consolidate the efforts and explore
options for an integrated package of support to improving SEE management,
focusing on MOGE as per Minister of Energy's request.

   II.    Energy sector challenges

MOGE has traditionally played a pivotal role in the sale of natural gas to Thailand
which is the primary export commodity and source of revenue for government in
the order of US$3.5 – 4 billion. On the other hand, the Government and MOGE
have neglected the domestic gas market where the price of gas is old at a price
below the export price. As a result, Myanmar suffers from large gas shortages,
which are estimated at about 50% of the domestic demand.

Reforms realized to date have already introduced more transparent reporting
procedures and allowed stronger control mechanisms to parliament and to
central government units (including Ministry of Finance, Auditor General,
amongst others). Although somewhat simplistic, it can be argued that MOGE
previously answered to a single government demand of generating foreign
exchange earnings and revenue. As a result of the reform process, the new
demands facing MOGE are much more diversified. The following table provides a
summary of the key objectives against which MOGE will be held accountable.

These objectives and outcomes will guide the strengthening and reform of
MOGE, MPE, MPPE and their subsidiary companies. Ultimately, the objectives
will also help define the needs for legal reform and new regulatory agencies,
although it is expected that MOGE (as many other national oil companies) will
continue to have regulatory responsibilities which must be appropriately
separated from core commercial activities.
         Objective                                  Outcomes
Management of revenue          MOGE must be able to live up to the public demands
from oil and gas sales          for increased transparency in payments and revenue
                                collection; this is defined through the Extractive
                                Industries Transparency Initiative.
                               The multiplication of off-shore gas field operations
                                and commencement of new business streams (The
                                Shwe Oil and Gas pipeline) require more robust
                                management and reporting systems.
                               MOGE (and government partners) must rapidly build
                                capacity to analyze and negotiate contract terms of
                                new oil and gas agreements.



                                                                                 82
                            Strategic planning, including development of a gas
                             sector master plan, is needed to improve transparency
                             and clarity of the Government objectives in the gas
                             sector.
Management of social and    With the reform process, the public demands for
environmental impacts        social and environmental accountability have
                             increased dramatically. MOGE must be able to account
                             for and respond to local grievances and concerns.
                            The award of on-shore and off-shore oil and gas
                             exploration blocs will lead to an unprecedented level
                             of survey and exploration activity in coming years.
                             The roles of MOGE and ministries must be clarified
                             and technical capacity and skills must be
                             strengthened.
Gas and oil supply for      The current shortages of gas supply (about 50%) in
domestic consumption         the domestic market cripple the economy and
                             contribute to acute electricity shortages (about 20%).
                             Going forward, the Government is facing a major
                             policy trade-off between fast increasing gas exports
                             and improving gas supply to the domestic market
                             where the economic value added of gas (in
                             manufacturing, services etc.) is much higher than from
                             exports.
                            Gas infrastructure, including high and low pressure
                             compressor stations and pipelines, will require
                             upgrading and expansions.
Transparency          in    Concerns about opaque ownership arrangements
beneficial ownership and     behind the newly awarded concessions are already
award of licenses            increasing,    and      clarity   about   joint-venture
                             arrangements must be enhanced.
Attraction of investment    The new gas pricing policy and regulatory regime will
capital                      need to reflect the large investment needs in the
                             sector and create incentives for domestic and foreign
                             investors.
                            Institutional development and capacity building is
                             needed to improve capacity of MOGE to implement
                             ambitious development plans for the oil and gas
                             sectors.
                            Competing demands for government investment in
                             social services are likely to constrain MOGE’s ability to
                             participate in project development (beyond
                             mandatory free-carry ownership).
Regulatory functions        The expected production of new seismic and geo-
                             scientific data must be stored, managed and
                             disseminated for public and private sector uses which
                             extend well beyond oil and gas field development.
                            Procedures must be established for all stages of oil
                             and gas development from early exploration to post-
                             production decommissioning plans. This will also
                             include cancellation of non-performing concessions
                             and regular tenders of vacant development blocs.

   III.   Principles of SEE Reform


                                                                                  83
The following section provides a summary of the recommendations offered in
the note “Myanmar State Economic Enterprises (SEE) Reform? from July, 2014.
SEE reform can take a variety of forms ranging from (i) corporate governance
strengthening under continued state-ownership through (ii) mixed ownership
models to (iii) outright privatization. The policy option at the two extremes of
the spectrum is the choice between (a.) complete state-ownership of the
enterprise (and all assets in the industry) with government representatives
overseeing operations or (b.) full private ownership of companies and assets
with the State regulating the sector by legal means and regulations without any
ownership or control over assets. Inbetween the two extremes a multitude of
combinations of State participation and private ownership can occur. It is not a
choice between A or B since none of the two options exist in the energy industry.
The challenging decision will be to identify MOGE at the appropriate place along
the spectrum and with due consideration to transition arrangements and
resources needed to implement the changes.

                                                               A. Private ownership of
     B. Complete State
                                                               the asset base with the
    ownership of assets
                                                                State only intervening
      and production
                                                                  through regulation
          facilities



The preferred outcome in the case of MOGE and other SEEs will involve a careful
consideration and debate about six issues which will be discussed in the context
of MOGE below. The six issues are:
    - The portfolio of the State Economic Enterprise;
    - Corporate restructuring;
    - Corporate governance structure;
    - Legal, regulatory and institutional framework;
    - Implementation timetable;
    - Financing of the proposed reforms.

Portfolio assessment: The starting point of corporate reform will be to clearly
define the purpose and objectives of the SEE in question in order to determine
whether or not it is relevant for government to continue to play a role in its
operation. In the case of MOGE, there may not be a question about government’s
continued relevance as the owner of the enterprise (although the option of
partial public share offering may be considered in 5 to 10 years – the time it is
expected to take to develop separate cost centers for the various functions). On
the other hand, the multitude of MOGE’s current operations will need to be
analyzed separately. It is relevant to carefully consider which parts of MOGE’s
current operations are commercial in nature as opposed to services or
operations which are driven by political priorities and not easily governed by
mechanics of the market. Such non-marketable services are likely not to be
profitable neither at present nor in the long term and may be best carried out by



                                                                              84
separate government agencies or ring-fenced departments within or outside
MOGE. Examples of politically-driven interests may include (i) nationwide
supply obligations, (ii) regional development strategies, (iii) job creation, (iv)
environmental protection and climate change targets, etc.

MOGE is already engaged in various joint venture partnerships through its
Production Sharing Contracts for existing on and off-shore oil and gas
exploitations. Previous Bank analysis (World Bank, July 2014) has recommended
that MOGE continue to pursue joint ventures and consider a partial public share
offering in the 5-10 years horizon. The same strategy is recommended for
Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise and Myanmar Petroleum Products
Enterprise.

Corporate restructuring: Before any privatization (and possibly in place of
privatization), it is imperative to evaluate MOGE’s asset base and separate
MOGE’s operations into cost centers with separate responsibilities or lines of
services or products. Typical cost centers would include (i) Drilling, (ii) Sales and
Marketing, (iii) Pipeline operations, etc. Restructuring and creation of separate
cost centers may present an alternative to privatization since well-structured
cost centers enhance accountability of the separate business processes, services
and products. Accordingly, potential inefficiencies can more easily be identified
and performance improvements can be suggested.

Corporate governance structure: Depending on the final reconfiguration of
MOGE, steps must be taken to ensure that basic governance principles are
protected, including (i) transparency, (ii) accountability, (iii) efficiency, and (iv)
autonomy. The appointment of an independent Board of Directors which is
technically competent, respected and free of political connections is traditionally
seen as the instrument to protect good corporate governance. With these
principles in place, stronger clarity can be afforded to:
   - MOGE’s assets and liabilities as well as its rights and obligations;
   - MOGE’s legal autonomy and associated reporting obligations;
   - MOGE’s independent management of daily businesses such as
       recruitment, salary levels, procurements, etc.
   - Principles for oversight and internal as well as external audit.

It is standard practice to define performance criteria which go beyond pure
financial targets, such as security of supply, national service coverage, etc. to
which MOGE should be held accountable. On the other hand, daily management
and decision-making must be left to MOGE management without unduly
interference from the Ministry of Energy or other government authorities. The
board of directors should be allowed to carry out its necessary management
oversight function. In order for this to happen, there may be a need to appoint
new directors who can bring skills, objectivity and independence, and provide
perspective for the formulation of a corporate strategy. In turn, directors must
have the mandate to hold management to account for their implementation of
agreed strategy.
Legal, regulatory and institutional framework in place: Successful corporate
reforms have important institutional implications, including for the organization



                                                                                   85
of State shareholder units; redefinition of the role of MOF and revision of sector
and corporate laws.

Myanmar has already established a precedent for State shareholder management
in the Ministry of Transport which established a State Shareholder Unit (SSU) to
review regular reports from the state enterprises, monitor industry
developments, attend shareholder meetings, and vote knowledgeably on director
appointments and major corporate initiatives. Such SSU would not replace the
responsibility of Ministry of Finance which must ensure the overall monitoring
of equity performance of all State enterprises, advise other State shareholders on
their enterprises (including appointment of independent directors), and address
fiscal and other cross-ministry issues arising from State ownership. Moreover,
MOF must provide central oversight on issues related to public-private
partnerships, including project priorities, quality control, and fiscal incentives
and guarantees. Considering the limited role MOF has played historically, these
competencies will only develop over time and in parallel with capacity building
in the areas of financial management and budget.

As a legal underpinning, sector laws concerning oil and gas exploitation,
transport and distribution should be passed in order to update the existing
Petroleum Act, which dates from 1934, and related rules and regulations which
are generally of an old date. This would complement the terms of contracts
which have been signed between MOGE and its international joint venture
partners.

Implementation timetable and financing requirements: The total number of
SEE which are formally controlled by the Myanmar State is estimated to be
limited to around 45 enterprises. The reform process will be lengthy and must
be guided by priorities in order to focus on areas where the greatest impacts are
expected to occur. For MOGE, in particular, the process is likely to go through
stages of gradual change in order to safeguard the important asset base under
MOGE’s control. On the other hand, corporate restructuring is imperative in
order to meet the daunting financing requirements facing MOGE and other
energy enterprises. It is also unlikely that MOGE and other enterprises will be
able to enhance accountability and productivity without a certain level of
restructuring, such as creation of cost centers. Previous sections have already
addressed the needs for corporate governance strengthening which must be
made explicit in corporate by-laws, internal operating procedures and
management systems. These initiatives can commence in the near term, subject
to overall policy decisions concerning the mandate of MOGE, its objectives and
overall business plan. Parallel joint venture engagements should continue while
the internal and external governance reforms are implemented.
Longer term reforms over the next five to ten years should consider strategic
partnerships, public share offering or divestment of non-core operations. This
may also include public-private partnership arrangements in the interest of
mobilizing required investment capital for infrastructure expansion or in order
to acquire operational and management expertise for activities which are new to
the enterprise.

Resources required undertaking the suggested reform processes would include,
inter alia, (i) legal advice and transaction support, (ii) accounting expertise, (iii)
training in corporate management and oversight of the same, and (iv) capacity
building concerning regulatory functions.

   IV.      Achievements to date – experience from Yangon Electricity
            Supply Board

The Corporate Governance (CG) work for YESB – like the overall corporatization
process – is still very much work in progress. Thus far, the CG work has focused
on: a) designing the broad CG framework for YESB once it is corporatized (the
newly corporatized entity is being called YESC); and b) Educating both the MOEP
and YESB staff on basic governance principles and what the new framework will
mean to them as shareholders, board members, and executives. The aim of the
new CG framework is to put in place a structure that is commercially-oriented,
fully autonomous, embodies the OECD CG principles of fairness, accountability,
responsibility, and transparency and aligns with the requirements of the
Myanmar Companies Act (1914). Although quite outdated, the Act does provide
for a basic common law construct for CG, outlining the fundamental rights and
responsibilities of shareholders, board of directors, and management
(incidentally, there are plans to update the Companies Act in the coming year, led
by the ADB). Beyond the basic requirements of the Act, the IFC team has strived
to incorporate other leading CG practices for corporatizing SOEs to the extent
practical in the YESB context.

To date, the team has held several sessions with MOEP and YESB to discuss the
CG design principles and how they will apply in practice. A preliminary CG
Roadmap has been developed to help layout the various actions and timeframes
needed to setup the CG framework over time. Although this will be revised once
there is more clarity on the IFC investment and overall corporatization plan.
Following is a brief summary of some of the guiding principles discussed thus
far:
      The Government must participate in the governance of YESC as a
        Shareholder, such that any actions or authorities must be executed via
        appropriate shareholder channels. The Companies Act defines particular
        matters reserved for Shareholders, including items requiring super-
        majority.

        As a controlling shareholder, the Government must recognize that
         minority shareholders will be granted particular rights and protections,
         including nomination rights, consent rights, pre-emptive rights, and
         information rights, among others.

        Regarding the Board of Directors, the overall goal is to compose a group
         of individuals that possess the requisite technical qualifications and
         experience to guide YESC, capable of carrying out their duties objectively
         and promoting the interests of YESC as a company, without being unduly
         influenced by political or other forces. The Board Directors should be


                                                                                   87
       chosen via an objective process based on their technical qualifications
       and the specific skillsets needed to guide YESC. They should not be
       appointed for political purposes or influence. Individual directors should
       understand and be fully capable of exercising core duties of care and
       loyalty. They should also meet fit and proper criteria, including particular
       integrity criteria.

      The Board of Directors shall be granted autonomy and authority to guide
       the company, providing strategic direction for the business and oversight
       of management. This includes the authority to appoint the CEO and
       senior management team and take decisions on major business matters,
       as per governing documents (Articles of Association, CG Policies).

      Likewise, Senior Managers should be chosen based on their technical
       qualifications and the specific skillsets needed to manage YESC and carry
       out the functions of their assigned management role. Consideration
       should be given to the future direction of YESC and its need to further
       modernize and become more commercially-oriented. Management (not
       the Board or Shareholders) is responsible for the day-to-day operation of
       the business. Part of that includes ensuring that sound frameworks for
       risk management, internal control, and audit/assurance are in place.
       Senior Managers should be given clear performance objectives and
       incentives and be evaluated and held accountable against those
       objectives/incentives by the Board of Directors. In turn, the Board
       should be held accountable by the Shareholders.

Beyond the strict definition of corporate governance, the IFC team has also
recognized and is pushing the need to address broader organizational capacity
building needs in YESB to transform it into a more commercially viable entity.
This will be a substantial task and possibly one of the most crucial for success of
the overall corporatization process. The project will develop an Organizational
Transformation Plan which will guide YESC in making changes over the long-
term. For example, some of the major items include:
     Redefine the organizational structure for YESC, including key units,
       roles/responsibilities, and reporting lines; re-map staff to the new
       organization.
      Develop new HR policies and procedures specific to YESC (e.g., Hiring,
       Termination, Compensation, Benefits, etc).
      Define a more formal strategic business planning, budgeting, and
       monitoring framework for the company, including formal performance
       metrics.
      Develop a staff performance management framework which defines how
       staff are formally evaluated, incentivized, and held accountable in YESC.
      Document new YESC-specific operational policies and procedures as
       needed for all operational and business functions.


                                                                                 88
       Strengthen key management and administrative functions via tools and
        training as needed (e.g., Finance, Human Resources, IT Management,
        Legal).
       Strengthen financial management, internal control, internal audit and risk
        management frameworks.
       Implement/upgrade an IT infrastructure and new management
        information systems as needed (none exist currently).
       Improve internal management analytics and reporting to support
        decision-making.
       Deliver Staff Training on new roles and responsibilities and develop a
        change management & communication strategy for the transformation.
Finally, it is worth noting that based on IFC’s investment experience in Myanmar
thus far, the need to do such in-depth capacity building in companies is very
much the norm – even in private enterprises, let alone SOEs. For example IFC
has in-depth advisory service projects ongoing in each of its financial sector
investments to date to help build capacity in various ways (e.g., setting up CG and
risk management frameworks, new product development, training). This should
certainly be expected for any future SOE corporatization effort in Myanmar and
will represent one of the biggest risks for any project.

   V.      International experience

The following section is derived from the Extractive Industries Sourcebook and
(Tordo, 2011) which should be consulted for more detailed analysis. Enthusiasm
for national resource companies (NRC) has waxed and waned, but they have
proved a durable phenomenon, particularly in resource-rich developing States
where NRCs have been tasked with commercial as well as non-commercial
objectives. Their performance in pursuing those objectives has provoked debate.
Meeting commercial objectives has proved difficult; in fact, with few exceptions,
NRCs have scored poorly in terms of profitability compared to international,
private corporations. In particular, funding equity participation in the EI sector
has proved a problem for NRCs. In states where there are urgent competing
priorities for the use of public funds, choices to not contribute to NRC equity
participation in EI sector projects can hold back performance and development
of capacity. Recent dramatic drops on NRC market capitalization (such as Vale,
PetroChina, Gazprom and EDF) indicate that NRC may face increasing difficulties
in capital mobilization over the coming years.

Non-commercial objectives may include job creation, subsidies, regional
development of disadvantaged provinces, etc. By assigning non-commercial
objectives to NRCs, most of which are seen as the responsibility of government,
these companies have the potential to not only undermine their own commercial
effectiveness but also the non-commercial objectives and the effectiveness of
government authority due to loss of transparency and accountability.
Notwithstanding, in petroleum sector it is quite common for NRCs to have
considerable regulatory obligations in addition to commercial functions. This is
usually explained by capacity issues or overriding political considerations. In


                                                                                 89
such cases, the non-commercial activities can be ring-fenced within the NRC for
operational and accounting purposes and reported in the national budget and
accounts.

The debate over NRC performance in the past has prompted a number of
positive responses. Commercial performance has been enhanced by the
introduction of competition (by partnering with IRCs) and by privatization in
varying degrees (by partial listing on stock exchanges). Funding issues have been
addressed by adopting flexible contractual formulas (such as carried interests or
production sharing) with the private sector that defers or cancels funding
obligations. Technology transfer and skills development have occurred where
NRCs have entered strategic joint-ventures with specialized international
companies in the interest of developing skills. In general, the most successful
NRC performances are found where commercial and non-commercial objectives
are mutually consistent and not competing, for instance profitability and skills
development go hand in hand, whereas profitability and price subsidies are
incompatible.

Good governance of NRCs generally requires clear oversight mechanisms as
mentioned in the sections above. Norway is a good example where
responsibilities are clearly separated between the (i) ministry which provides
overall planning and policy-making, (ii) the (State-owned) company ensuring
efficient operations, and (iii) the independent regulator which is defining the
rules of the game, Commercially based shareholder roles can lead to companies
that compete strongly in the international market place. Examples of companies
with a strong commercially based shareholder role include: Codelco in Chile,
Petronas in Malaysia, and Vale and Petrobras in Brazil. Some prominent
exceptions which have been generally well managed and highly profitable and
competitive include: in mining, CODELCO, the state copper mining company in
Chile, and in petroleum, Statoil, the Norwegian petroleum producer.

   VI.    Coordination among development partners

There is a strong commitment among development partners in Myanmar to
accompanying the process of corporate reforms. The US State Department and
USAID are engaged in technical advisory activities with the Ministry of Energy
and, to some extent, MOGE. DfID and Australian DFAT consider corporate
strengthening of SEEs is a fundamental part of the overall governance reform
program. The World Bank has already initiated corporate support to electricity
distribution companies through the power sector program. Additionally, SEE
reforms across all sectors are also discussed. A deeper engagement in corporate
reforms of the energy sector enterprises would be aligned with current activities.
It is recommended that a reform program for MOGE be guided by a holistic
assessment of the energy sector demands and opportunities. Moreover, the
timetable of MOGE reforms must also be adapted to the parallel Public Financial
Management Modernization support.

    H. SEE Roundtable Proceedings

A roundtable discussion on Institutional Development and Modernization of State
Economic Enterprises in Myanmar’s Oil and Gas Sector was held on the 5th of March
2015 in Nay Pay Taw. The meeting was organized by the World Bank as part of its
project on Public Financial Management, which is jointly supported by funding from
the Department of Foreign and International Development of the UK (DfID), and the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia (DFAT).

The roundtable was attended by 31 officials from the Government of Myanmar,
including, the Director General of the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), the Managing Director of Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), one
presidential advisor, 21 officials from the Ministry of Energy, 4 from the Ministry of
Finance and 4 from the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development,
and by 25 participants working for the WBG and development partners.
The consultation set out to achieve the following objectives:
      Review challenges facing the energy sector in Myanmar
      Analyze options and approaches to strengthening, commercialization, and
       corporatization of sector enterprises
      Discuss strategies for institutional strengthening and development of energy sector
       enterprises in Myanmar
      Consider regulatory environment and options for a broader SEE reform process
Opening Remarks:
U Maung Maung Win, Director General, Budget Department, Ministry of Finance
U Maung Maung Win reported on the GOM’s efforts to modernize SEEs through
learning from the experience of other countries, adopting international best
practices and cooperating with international partners. He explained that the SEEs
have been instructed to re-orient goals from output targets to profitability, to focus
on marketing and product quality, and are now subject to stricter financial discipline
under the new budget system. He stated that in the future selected SEEs will be
required to privatize or corporatize.

U Myo Myint Oo, Managing Director, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE)
U Myo Myint Oo summarized the current situation in the State Economic Enterprises
under the Ministry of Energy, namely MOGE, Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise
(MPE) and Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise (MPPE). He noted recent
increases in exploration for, and production of crude oil and natural gas. He also
reported on the development of the National Energy Management Committee in
2013, and the approval of the comprehensive National Energy Policy in early 2015.
He reported that the demand for crude oil was expected to increase by 4.6 %


                                                                                        93
annually to reach 3.93 MTOE in 2030 and natural gas by 6.1% to 4.07 MTOE, with oil
expected to contribute 18.3% and natural gas 19 % to the energy mix. The
government intends to prioritize domestic supply of natural gas. U Myo Myint Oo
concluded by reporting that MOE is in the process of partially corporatizing some
services and by outlining the government’s goals to improve transparency and
financial incentives for investment.

Julie Fraser, Practice Manager, World Bank Group
Ms Fraser reviewed the objectives and program for the workshop, encouraged lively
participation and debate and emphasized that although restructuring of the oil and
gas sector would be a long process, the WBG will be there to provide support
throughout.

Session 1:
Overview of Mandates and Targets for Myanmar Oil

Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, Wah Wah Thaung: Executive Officer (MOGE)
Daw Wah Wah Taung provided updated figures for exploration and production of oil
and gas in Myanmar, including production levels of current onshore and offshore
fields, pipeline construction, joint ventures, and quantities of natural gas exported
and supplied domestically.

She reported that Myanmar had recently completed a bid round for new off shore
concessions and that 20 blocks have been provisionally awarded to 8 companies for
future exploration and production activities. These operators include a number of
very large and experienced international oil companies.

Based on the National Energy Policy’s goals to develop the oil and gas sector
sustainably, MOGE is seeking to partially corporatize by establishing JVs for selected
services. Invitations for Letters of Expression of Interest (LEOI) have already been
announced for JVs for drilling services, seismic services and pipeline construction and
maintenance. MOGE is currently seeking legal, technical and commercial support to
review and finalize these JV relationships.

Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise, Daw Yin Yin Aung, Assistant Director (MPE)
MPE is responsible for production, import, distribution and export of petroleum
products, fertilizers and petrochemicals from crude oil and natural gas, excluding the
distribution of motor fuels. It operates 3 refineries and 5 fertilizer factories, 3 LPG
plants and one methanol plant in central Myanmar. All of these facilities are small,
old and are not operating at capacity.

MPE is planning to implement a number of JVs. A tender process for the JV for No. 1
Refinery has already closed and the results will be announced in 2015.
Announcements have been made for Letters of Expressions of Interest for joint
ventures in the LPG Plant in Nyaung Don and Crude and Petroleum Products
Movement. Invitations to tender for these projects will be carried out soon. MPE




                                                                                    94
intends to corporatize by promoting participation of the private sector and
developing PPPs.

Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise, Daw Khin Than Oo, Assistant Director
(MPPE)
MPPE is an SOE that is responsible for wholesale and retail distribution of petroleum
products. It operates on a market based policy. Since 2010 it has transferred 261
state owned petrol stations to the private sector. MPPE continues to operate fuel
terminals, is responsible for granting importation and distribution licenses, and for
supervising private sector operations, including the current total of 1,462 petrol
stations

MPPE has established a joint venture for the distribution of aviation fuel at Yangon
airport and is seeking to establish further partnerships for this product at other
airports around the country. It is currently in discussions with a consultancy
company regarding the establishment of a joint venture for the importation, storage
and distribution of petroleum products.



Energy Sector, Challenges and Prospects, Robert Lesnick, Consulant, World Bank
Group
Mr Lesnick led a group activity designed to recognize technical and geopolitical
advancements which have occurred over the last 15 years, and which will continue
to advance through 2030. He stressed that Myanmar’s challenge is not only to reach
current levels of global economic development but to expand at a rate fast enough
to catch up with and become part of the global economic community within the
next 15 years.

He presented an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
facing the petroleum sector as viewed by the potential private sector investor. It was
noted that Myanmar’s established petroleum industry and favorable fiscal terms are
considered strengths, and that unexplored prospective areas would be viewed as
opportunities for investment. However issues regarding transparency, access to
petroleum services and natural gas markets are weaknesses within the current
corporate landscape. Key threats to successful development include concerns about
environmental liabilities and obtaining a social license to operate.

A review of natural gas industry structure followed. Individual components of the
natural gas value chain were defined and it was stressed that there must be
cooperation and coordination between each individual activity. From a government
perspective it is critical that policy and regulation consider the value chain as a whole
rather than focus on individual components. Within the value chain model the
creation of transportation, treating and processing infrastructure is critical to
support gas development. Often this industry is built and owned by an SEE and use
of the facilities offered openly to industry under a tariff. In closing, Mr Lesnick




                                                                                      95
pointed out that it is critical that the government establish a principle based system
to prioritize gas use.

Discussion of Opening Program

U Zaw Oo, Economic Advisor to the President/ National Coordinator, Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative Myanmar
U Zaw Oo reported that the President has recently announced a 3 rd phase of reform
in Myanmar, which while focusing on producing early results will also link up to long
term sustainable reforms. In light of this he felt that the this workshop provided a
timely opportunity to reflect on how SEEs can reform in a way that gives immediate
benefits, but also can be linked with the building of the foundations for the future.
He also emphasized current efforts of the government to adopt the principles under
EITI which require a higher degree of transparency with regard to the treatment of
revenues within this sector.

In regard to the issues raised in the first session he confirmed the need to adopt a
natural gas value chain model. He registered concern that there were significant
gaps in Myanmar’s value chain, which needed to be analyzed, so that actions could
be taken to close these before drawing up a grand plan. He felt that this is an area
where Myanmar could really benefit from external expertise and lessons learned
from other countries.

U Zaw Oo noted that Myanmar is now seeking to expand EITI principles beyond the
initial focus on improving revenue transparency and to address some of these gaps
in contracts, awards and licenses and develop more comprehensive resource
governance program. He noted that several governance issues need to be addressed
and improved as the MOE modernizes. One specific concern being the need to divest
regulatory responsibilities from the current operating SEEs. He requested external
support to develop an effective regulatory framework and appropriate institutional
structures, and to build capacity within the ministries and the SEEs to negotiate and
build relationships and /or to compete with members of the international petroleum
community.

He suggested that the most senior government leaders should lay out the objectives
for the modernization efforts and determine activities for initial implementation of a
corporatization strategy, including sequencing of policy reform versus privatization
efforts. He felt that the government should think carefully about the model they
wish to adopt to corporatize SEEs, not just in the energy sector, and cautioned that
there may be a need to establish a new authority to oversee government interest in
regard to the development of a wide array of joint venture companies.

U Zaw Oo concluded by stating that capacity building is key. He requested
international support to help Myanmar to understand how to mitigate the impact of
volatility in the global petroleum market, the technological challenges and
opportunities in the energy sector, and how reforms in this sector can be




                                                                                   96
constructively linked to reforms in other sectors, especially in the emerging
manufacturing sector.

Dejan Ostojic, Lead Energy Specialist, World Bank Group
Mr Ostojic pointed out the need to address Myanmar’s immediate short term needs
when considering reform of the energy sector. He stressed the importance of the gas
market in Myanmar, both as the country uses gas exports as a pillar of development
but also because of severe shortages in domestic gas supply. He noted there needs
to be good understanding of this market, including who the anchor clients that will
underpin the development of sector will be.

Mr Ostojic also raised the issue of regulatory reform, noting that operating practices,
regulatory practices and policy practices are currently all mixed together under MOE.
However he felt that gas pricing policy was the issue of critical importance in regard
to regulation within the sector, as it must take into consideration long term
objectives, but also conditions within the market such as affordability and as it plays
a critical role not just in one industry but in the development of the country as a
whole.

He concluded by stressing the need for a long term strategic vision, and to develop
the institutional capacity to continually review and revise this in response to the
challenges as the world changes at an ever increasing pace.
U Maung Maung Win, Director General Budget Department, Ministry of Finance
U Maung Maung Win stated his appreciation for the presentations from the SEEs
under MOE. He stressed the importance of these three enterprises in terms of
government revenue in Myanmar and therefore of the need for careful
consideration of the costs and benefits to government of their commercialization.

U Myo Myint Oo, Managing Director MOGE
U Myo Myint Oo described the planned joint venture processes in MOGE, MPE and
MPPE, and explained that their goal is to increase efficiency and profitability through
the privatization of certain services. He stated that MOE is currently seeking
consultants to advise on the joint venture process, which it hopes to complete within
2015-2016.

In addition he reported on MOE’s efforts to increase government revenue through
the launching the international bidding round for onshore and off shore blocks. In
2013 a second onshore bidding round was held and awarded to 14 companies and
more recently a bidding round was held for 20 off shore blocks, 8 of which have
been awarded to date.

Rome Chavapricha, World Bank Group, Energy Specialist Yangon
Mr Chavapricha suggested that the Government of Myanmar may wish to consider
minimizing
further investment in the oil and gas sector as this is known to be a sector where
private sector interest is robust.




                                                                                    97
Session 2:
Profiling Natural Resource Companies, Robert Lesnick
Mr Lesnick reviewed 9 practical difficulties which can reduce operational efficiency
and the creation of value within SEEs and provided a number of examples as follows:

      Conflicting ideologies – PDVSA in Venezuela was given a widen mandate which
       included running schools and grocery stores. This interfered with efficient
       management of the oil and gas.
      Economic Cost: NOC in Libya actually destroyed the value of the domestic crude oil
       by refining it into motor gasoline and fuel.
      Operational Efficiencies: PEMEX in Mexico destroyed one of the world’s largest gas
       fields by going against international best practice and injecting nitrogen to try to
       extend the life of the field.
      Lack of Competition/Barriers to Entry
      Subsidies and Non-commercial Interests: Petrobangala in Bangladesh receives a
       lower price for its gas than a private oil company which results in inefficiencies such
       as cutting corners, of failing to maximize production of the field as they cannot
       afford to invest properly.
      Weak Corporate Governance
      Funding Constraints: The state owned oil company in Nigeria is required to give all
       of the revenues it generates to the state. However the treasury failed to provide
       sufficient funding to meet the company’s share of the investment, so it had to
       borrow funds its operating partners, and then repay these debts with oil. This then
       significantly delayed the receipt of revenue by the state from this sector.
      Conflicts of Interest
      Imbalance of Control: It is not possible for an SEE to operate on a commercial basis
       if it is led by political decisions. In Nigeria the SOE had entered into a long term
       contract to supply natural gas to its neighbors, but when gas supplies ran short,
       rather than allowing it to meet its contractual obligations, the government forced it
       to divert gas to local industries. This was not only bad in terms of commercial
       reliability but also had negative implications in terms of Nigeria’s relationship to its
       neighbors.

Mark Miller, World Bank Group, Public Financial Management Program
Corporate governance of SEEs and Macro-economic & Fiscal Considerations
Mr Miller highlighted the importance of Myanmar SEEs to the macroeconomic and
fiscal environment. He suggested that corporate governance reform could drive a
more dynamic SEE sector and in turn increase economic growth and improve public
services. However he emphasized that that under a more arms length arrangement,
while taxes and dividends would remain in the budget, retained balances would not.
Therefore both the timing and ultimate amount of revenue obtained from the sector
may change, especially in a joint venture where a partner is not likely to accept the
siphoning off of income.
Mr Miller pointed out that there had already been some changes to the SEEs in the
energy sector and suggested some possible next steps in the reform process,
including reform of the legal and regulatory framework, clarification of the policy
direction of state in regard to SEEs, and clarification of roles and responsibilities,
particularly ownership arrangements, the responsibilities of the Board of Directors.

Vidar Ovesen, Revenue Management Consultant, NORAD
Revenue Management and State Equity Participation
Mr Ovesen outlined five principles and practices for sound oil and gas revenue
management, and went on to provide 3 potential models for National Oil Companies
(NOCs) which represented the range of funding systems of upstream petroleum SEEs
that currently exist throughout the world.

Model 1:      All revenues are paid to the government and the NOC is funded by
              the National Budget
Model 2:      The resource rent goes to the government. The NOC is
              commercialized and retains profit from its own activities
Model 3:      All PSC revenues are channeled through the NOC, and a share of the
              total revenues is transferred to MOF.

 Mr Ovesen reviewed the pros and cons of each of the models. He emphasized that
no one model is preferred and that careful consideration should be given to
whatever model Myanmar chooses to use as part of its modernization efforts. He
noted the need to strengthen revenue administration, by ensuring that the fiscal
regime provides the right incentives, by carrying our revenue projections, and
conducting cost audits of operator’s expenses and by improving coordination,
transparency and accountability. He concluded by stating the citizens should benefit
from oil and gas revenues, by highlighting the importance of transparency and
capacity development and by pointing out that it takes time to develop a
professional NOC.

Session 3: Case Studies

Vikram Kumar, Resident Representative, International Finance Corporation
Observations on Yangon Electricity Supply Board Reform
Mr Kumar provided an overview of YESB, and outlined the anticipated benefits of
corporatization, including more rapid growth of systems and services and easier
access to capital through independent listing of the company on the stock exchange.

He suggested that comprehensive due diligence covering financial, technical, social
and environmental issues is an important part of the privatization process, and that
an outside independent assessment of value is required to serve as a reference point
to balance those of government and potential investors. Early findings in regard to
YESB have highlighted the need for capacity building in procurement. Mr Kumar also
stressed the importance of establishing an effective governance structure of the new
private entity.

As part of an open discussion it was noted that an independent regulator must be
established before the joint venture could be set up. It was also pointed out that
although there are many existing environmental concerns and liabilities in regard to
YESB privatization, agreement has been reached as to how these will be rectified
within the new joint venture.




                                                                                 99
The focus of the IFC investment is on reducing the current high losses within the
system. IFC estimates that an investment of 40 million USD in loss reduction will
result in the equivalent additional energy to the construction of a 100 million USD
power station.

A distinction was made between investment in generation versus distribution and it
was pointed out that the current focus of YESB is likely to remain concentrated in
distribution. With regard to funding of growth, reference was made to the previous
benefits of corporatization whereby a successful joint venture resulting in a bankable
company will provide access to a broad number of lending instruments (stock,
bonds, and short term credits).

Robert Lesnick, Trinidad Experience in Building an Indigenous Gas Industry
Trinidad provided an interesting model for industry structures whereby the state
holds strategic interests throughout the gas value chain. Although Trinidad and
Myanmar report equal reserves of natural gas, Trinidad’s production is
approximately three times that of Myanmar’s and much of it is used internally to
supply value added industrial manufacturing. As a result Trinidad’s gas related
revenue as a percent of export is 25-30 percent higher than that of Myanmar.

Trinidad was able to achieve this high level of industrial gas use despite its isolated
location, its relative smallness in size and population and its lack of technological
knowhow, because of a focused vision and sustained commitment at the highest
levels of government.

The Point Lisas Industrial Estate was cited as an example of how diversified use of
natural gas could be established over time. The current estate of approx 3.3 square
miles is home to over 100 companies which have invested over 2.5 billion USD and
currently use over 1.6 BCFD of gas. The estate employs over 4,000 Trinidad citizens
and has created thousands of additional jobs outside in support activities. The
establishment of the 100% state owned natural gas company which gathers, treats
transports and distributes natural gas throughout Trinidad and Tobago was
considered critical to these achievements.

During the open discussion period, issues around the pricing of gas in Trinidad were
clarified, and it was noted that the use of SEEs to provide the midstream gas services
was not unique. Other countries using this model include Argentina, the UK, and
Russia. With regard to the timing of development of the gas sector it was noted that
this is often a function of the degree to which existing gas infrastructure exists within
a country. For complete green field development it is not uncommon for projects to
take 15 years or more to complete from the time of first gas reserve discovery.
However in countries with significant existing infrastructure similar sized projects
can be completed in approximately 4 years.

While Trinidad is an interesting model of development for a country with natural gas
resources of a similar size to Myanmar, it is not necessarily a good pricing model as it
is in a different region of the world. Trinidad was highlighted to demonstrate the


                                                                                    100
   importance of high level government vision and long term commitment for any gas
   industry to develop successfully.

   Session 4:
   Breakout Discussions

   Robert Lesnick Introduction
   Mr Lesnick noted that effective organizations have mutually supportive structure,
   systems and processes. Structure defines the organization including the roles,
   responsibilities and skill sets necessary to conduct business. Processes are how
   decisions and strategies are made, how communications take place, how projects
   are managed and how assets are operated. Systems support the organization and
   include physical infrastructure, technology, programs, training and reward
   structures. It is necessary to consider all three aspects when conducting
   modernization efforts.

   Participants were asked to identify three opportunities to improve structure,
   processes and systems as part of MOEs modernization program and to describe how
   these changes could be achieved. The following table summarizes the presentations
   made by SEEs and Ministries present.
